<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“Sunan an-Nasaaee”</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">an-Nasaaee authored a collection which he titled: “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>as-Sunan al-Kubraa</strong></span>” in which he gathered authentic <em>Hadeeth</em> as well as those with defects in their chains. He then summarized his collection which is known as “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>as-Sunan as-Sughraa</strong></span>” although he actually called it “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>al-Mujtabaa</strong></span>”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this summarized collection, he gathered only those Hadeeth which he considered to be authentic; it is this collection that is referred to when a Hadeeth is generally attributed to anNasaaee. “al-Mujtabaa” has the least number of weak Hadeeth out of the other four collections (excluding “Saheeh al-Bukhaaree” and “Saheeh Muslim”). It also contains the least amount of chains including narrators that have been criticized (regarding their Hadeeth narrating). It occupies a status right after “Saheeh al-Bukhaaree” and “Saheeh Muslim”. From the point of only relying upon narrators that are completely void of any criticism, this collection exceeds “Sunan Abu Daawood” and “Sunan at-Tirmithee” due to an-Nasaaee’s severe scrutiny of narrators within his writings. al-Haafith Ibn Hajar said, “How numerous are the narrators that Abu Daawood and atTirmithee relied on, yet an-Nasaaee shunned recording their Hadeeth. He even avoided recording Hadeeth from some of the narrators relied upon in the two authentic collections (“Saheeh al-Bukhaaree” and “Saheeh Muslim”).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In summary, the conditions of an-Nasaaee in “al-Mujtabaa” are the strongest after the two authentic collections.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">an-Nasaaee</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is ‘Abdur-Rahmaan Ahmad Ibn Shu’ayb Ibn ‘Alee an-Nasaaee, and it is said his name is anNaswee, referring to Nasa, a famous place in Khuraasaan. He was born in 215 Hijrah in Nasa. He then traveled in search of Hadeeth, eventually hearing from and studying from the people of the Hijaaz (lands such as Syria, Palestine, etc.), Khuraasaan, ash-Shaam, the Arabian Peninsula and other lands. He resided for a long time in Egypt and his writings spread throughout there. Later he journeyed to Damascus where he met with trials and tribulations. He died in 303 Hijrah in Ramlah, Palestine when he was eighty-three years old.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He left behind him many great works of Hadeeth and the study of their defects. May Allaah have mercy on him and reward him on behalf of his contribution to the Muslims.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Saheeh al-Bukhaaree” :</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This book was given the title: “<em><strong>al’Jaami’ as-Saheeh</strong></em>” by its author. In it, he recorded six hundred thousand <em>Hadeeth</em> and he exerted great effort in revising them, editing them, and scrutinizing them to determine their authenticity. He was so concerned that he would not place any <em>Hadeeth</em> within his collection without first washing and praying to units of prayer seeking Allaah’s guidance in the decision to include it. He did not include any report or narration unless it was authentically reported from the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) with a clear, connected chain of narrators, all known for their trustworthiness and preciseness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He completed his work over a span of sixteen years. After which, he presented it to <em>Imaam</em> Ahmad, Yahyaa Ibn Ma’een, ‘Alee Ibn al-Madeenee, and others. They admired it and approved of it and attested to its authenticity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since then, scholars of every time period have accepted this collection of <em>Hadeeth</em>. al-Haafith athThahabee said, “<strong>It is the best and most significant book in Islaam after the Book of Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى)</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This collection consists of seven thousand, three-hundred ninety-seven (7,397) <em>Hadeeth</em> including the ones that are repeated, yet placed in different chapters. Excluding the repeated <em>Hadeeth</em>, there are two thousand, six hundred two (2,602) individual <em>Hadeeth</em> as al-Haafith Ibn Hajar pointed out.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>al-Bukhaaree</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is Abu ‘Abdullaah Muhammad Ibn Ismaa’eel Ibn Ibraaheem Ibn al-Mugheerah Ibn Bardizbah [1] al-Ja’fee, originally of Persian origin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was born in Bukhaaraa (in present-day Uzbekistan) in the month of Shawwaal (the 10th month of the Islaamic calendar) in the year 194 <em>Hijrah</em>. He was raised as an orphan (without his father) in the care of his mother. He began traveling throughout different lands, seeking out <em>Hadeeth</em> in the year 210. He resided for six years in various lands including ash-Shaam (the lands of Palestine, Syria, Jordan, etc.), Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, Basra, Koofah, and Baghdad (all three in Iraaq). He was very proficient in memorizing and it was even said that he was able to memorize a book after seeing it only once. He was one who abstained from useless worldly things. He was pious and did not mix much with the kings, princes, or leaders. Yet, he was brave and generous. Scholars of his time and thereafter have praised him. <em>Imaam</em> Ahmad said of him, “<strong>No one even close to him has ever come from (the land of) Khuraasaan</strong>.” Ibn Khuzaymah said, “<strong>There is no one under the sky more knowledgeable of <em>Hadeeth</em> of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم), nor one having memorized more than Muhammad Ibn Ismaa’eel al-Bukhaaree</strong>.” He was also diligent in deducing rulings and had an amazing ability to derive rulings and benefits from <em>Hadeeth</em> as can be witnessed from the manner in which he organized his authentic collection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He died in a place known as Khartank near Samarqand (in Uzbekistan) on the night of <em>‘Eed al-Fitr</em> (the Islaamic holiday to conclude fasting in the month of Ramadhaan) in the year 256 <em>Hijrah</em>. He was thirteen days away from the age of sixty-two years old. He left an enormous amount of knowledge behind in his writings. May Allaah have mercy upon him an reward him on behalf of his contribution to the Muslims.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>AL-HASAN IBN ABIL HASAN AL-BASREE</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(Abridged from ‘Siyar A`laamin Nubalaa·’ of Imaam adh-Dhahabee)<br />
Translated by Abu Talha Dawud Burbank <em>rahimahullaah</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“al-Hasan ibn Abil-Hasan Yasaar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Imaam, Shaikhul-Islaam, Aboo Sa`eed al-Basree. It is said that he used to be a <em>mawlaa</em> (slave) belonging to Zayd ibn Thaabit, and it is said: a slave belonging to Jameel ibn Qutbah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His mother was Khayrah, the slave-girl of Umm Salamah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He grew up in al-Madeenah; and memorized the Qur·aan in the Khilaafah of `Uthmaan, and heard him give the Khutbah many times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the day of the killing of `Uthmaan he was fourteen years old.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he grew older and was constant upon Jihaad, and constant upon knowledge and action. He was one of the courageous folk who were mentioned for that…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the rule of Mu`aawiyah he was a scribe for the governor of Khuraasaan &#8211; ar-Rabee` ibn Ziyaad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He narrated from `Uthmaan, `Imraan ibn Husayn, al-Mugheerah ibn Shu`bah, `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Samurah, Samurah ibn Jundub, Jundub al- Bajalee, Ibn `Abbaas, Ibn `Umar, Aboo Bakrah, `Amr ibn Taghlib, Jaabir, and many others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who narrated from him include: Qataadah, Ayyoob (as- Sakhtiyaanee), Ibn `Awn, Yoonus (ibn `Ubayd), Khaalid al-Hadhdhaa·, Hishaam ibn Hassaan, Humayd at-Taweel, Jareer ibn Haazim, Shaybaan an- Nahawee, Yazeed ibn Ibraaheem at-Tusturee, Mubaarak ibn Fadaalah, ar- Rabee` ibn Sabeeh, Abaan ibn Yazeed al-`Attars, Qurrah ibn Khaalid, and many others besides them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Sa`d said: “<strong>He was a comprehensive scholar, lofty, reliable a proof, trustworthy, a worshipper, one who performed frequent acts of worship and sacrifice. He was abundant in knowledge; spoke eloquently, and was handsome</strong>”…, until he said: “He is not a proof in those narrations which he narrated in ‘<em>mursal</em>’ form, and he was a ‘<em>mudallis</em>’. So when he says ‘From..’ with regard to those he did not meet, then he is not taken as proof.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He sometimes performed ‘<em>tadlees</em>’ from those he had met, omitting the intermediary between himself and them, and Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However he was a great memorizer, a great scholar; from the oceans of knowledge; a jurist concerning the soul; of tremendous status; having no equal. His reminders were beautiful. His admonitions were eloquent and penetrating. He was a chief in the various types of good; and I have written a biography for him in a single volume which I have entitled <em>‘az-Zukhruful- Qasriyy</em>’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He died in the year 110 H at the age of 88 &#8211;<em>rahimahullaahu ta`aalaa</em>.” [‘Tadhkiratul-Huffaaz’: (1/71-72)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His father Yasaar was a slave taken captive in Maysaan [North of Basrah, in Southern Iraaq]. He settled in al-Madeenah, and was set free, and married.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Hasan was born two years before the end of the Khilaafah of `Umar and he grew up in Waadee al-Quraa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">adh-Dhahabee said: “<strong>He was the noblest of the people of his time, in knowledge and action</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mu`tamir ibn Sulaymaan said: My father used to say: “<strong>al-Hasan is the Shaikh of the people of Basrah</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He learned the recitation of the Qur·aan from Hittaan ibn `Abdillaah ar- Raqaashee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">adh-Dhahabee said: “<strong>He was a man who was of perfect build. His form was fine, and he was handsome; and he was described as being one of those who were courageous.</strong>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Burdah said: “I did not see anyone who more closely resembled the Companions of Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) than him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Humayd ibn Hilaal said: Aboo Qataadah said to us: “Adhere to this Shaikh, for I have not seen anyone closer in opinion to `Umar than him &#8211; meaning al-Hasan.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jurthoomah said: “I saw al-Hasan dyeing his beard yellow every Jumu`ah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qataadah said: “I never compared the knowledge of al-Hasan to that of anyone from the scholars except that I found him having superiority over him; except that if anything was problematic for him he would write to Sa`eed ibn al-Musayyib, asking him about it; and I never sat with a jurist except that I saw the superiority of al-Hasan.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Humayd and Yoonus said: “We did not see anyone more perfect in behavior than al-Hasan.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yoonus ibn `Ubayd said: “I have not seen anyone whose speech more closely matches his actions than al-Hasan.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ar-Rabee` ibn Anas said: “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>I used to go to al-Hasan for ten years, or as Allaah wished, and there was not a single day except that I would hear from him something which I had not heard before</strong></span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hawshab narrated from al-Hasan that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“O son of Aadam! By Allaah! If you recite the Qur·aan and then truly believe in it, then your grief in this world will be lengthened, your fear in this world will become severe, and your weeping in this world will be plentiful.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[‘Siyar A`laamin-Nubalaa·’ (4/563-588)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zaa·idah ibn Qudaamah: from Hishaam ibn Hassaan: al-Hasan said: “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>When a man used to seek knowledge, then (its effect) would soon be seen upon what he looked at, upon his humility and submission, upon his tongue, upon his ties of kinship, and upon his avoidance of the unnecessary things of the world (<em>zuhd</em>)</strong></span>.” He said: “And al-Hasan used to say: “<strong><span style="color:#000000;">Do not sit with the people of the innovated sects (<em>Ahwaa</em>·); do not debate with them; and do not listen to anything from them</span>.</strong>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[‘Tahdheebul-Kamaal’]</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>MUJAAHID IBN JABR</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Mujaahid ibn Jabr, the Imaam. Abul-Hajjaaj al-Makhzoomee &#8211; their mawlaa (freed-slave), al- Makkee, the reciter, the Mufassir, al-Haafiz. The slave belonging to as-Saa·ib ibn Abis-Saa·ib al-Makhzoomee. He learned from Sa`d, `Aa·ishah, Aboo Hurairah, Umm Haani·, `Abdullaah ibn `Umar, and Ibn `Abbaas and he closely accompanied him for some time, and he learnt the reading of the Qur·aan from him and Tafseer and Fiqh. He was one of the stores of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who narrated from him included `Ikrimah, Taawoos, and `Ataa· &#8211; and they were his contemporaries; and `Amr ibn Deenar, Abuz-Zubayr, alHakam ibn `Utaybah, Ibn Abee Najeeh, Mansoor ibn al-Mu`tamir, Sulaymaan ibn A`mash, Ayyoob as-Sakhtiyaanee, Ibn `Awn, `Umar ibn Dharr, Ma`roof ibn Mushkaan, Qataadah ibn Di`aamah, al-Fadl ibn Maymoon, Ibraaheem ibn Muhaajir, Humayd al-A`raj, Bukayr ibn alAkhnas, al-Hasan al-Fuqaymee, Khusayf, Sulaymaan al-Ahwal, Sayf ibn Sulaymaan, `Abdul-Kareem al-Jazaree, Aboo Haseen, al-`Awwaam ibn Hawshab, Fitr ibn Khaleefah, an-Nadr ibn `Arabee, and many others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A group learned the recitation from him, including <strong>Ibn Katheer</strong> ad-Daaree, Aboo `Amr ibn al-`Alaa·, and Ibn Muhaysin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujaahid said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I read the entire Qur·aan to Ibn `Abbaas three times, stopping at each Aayah and asking what it was sent down concerning and how it was.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qataadah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The most knowledgeable one remaining with regard to tafseer is Mujaahid.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Juraij said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“To have learned from Mujaahid would have been more beloved to me than my family and my wealth.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Khusayf said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The most knowledgeable of them concerning tafseer is Mujaahid.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyaan ath-Thawree said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Take Tafseer from four: Mujaahid, Sa`eed ibn Jubayr, `Ikrimah, and ad-Dahhaak.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">adh-Dhahabee said: It is said that he settled in Koofah at the end of his life, and he used to frequently travel and move about.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-A`mash said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“When I used to see Mujaahid I would think little of him; he would be wearing worn-out clothing, as if he were a mule-driver who had lost his donkey and was concerned about it; but when he spoke, pearls [[of wisdom]] came out from his mouth.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…A number of people said: he died in the year 103 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Waaqidee narrated from Ibn Jurayj that he said: “He reached the age of eighty three.”…”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ya`laa ibn `Ubayd: from al-A`mash: from Mujaahid that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I do not know which of the two favours is greater: that He guided me to Islaam, or that He saved me from these innovated sects.”</strong></span> [adh-Dhahabee said: Such as those of the Raafidah, the Qadariyyah, and the Jahmiyyah.”]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahyaa ibn Sulaym said: `Abdul-Wahhaab ibn Mujaahid narrated to us, saying: I was with my father when his son Ya`qoob came and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">‘O my father, we have companions who claim that Eemaan of the inhabitants of the heavens and the inhabitants of the earth is one (and the same.) So he said: “O my son, those people are not my companions. Allaah does not make a person who is drowned in sins just like a person who has no sin.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Nu`aym said: Mujaahid died whilst prostrating in the year 102 H…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hibbaan said: “He died in Makkah in the year 102 or 103 H in prostration having been born in the year 21 H in the Khilaafah of `Umar.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyaan ath-Thawree said: “<strong><span style="color:#000000;">If tafseer comes to you from Mujaahid then that is enough for you</span></strong>.” Therefore his tafseer was relied upon by ash-Shaafi`ee, al-Bukhaaree and others from the people of knowledge, and likewise by Imaam Ahmad and others who complied works of tafseer: they repeatedly bring chains of narration from Mujaahid; more often than from anyone besides him.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>`ABDULLAAH IBN `AMR &#8211;<em>radiyallaahu `anhumaa</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(Abridged from ‘Siyar A`laamin Nubalaa·’ of Imaam adh-Dhahabee)<br />
Translated by Abu Talha Dawud Burbank <em>rahimahullaah</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdullaah ibn `Amr ibn al-`Aas ibn Waa·il ibn Haashim ibn Sa`eed ibn Sa`d ibn Sahm ibn `Amr ibn Husays ibn Ka`b ibn Lu·ayy ibn Ghaalib, the Imaam, the great scholar, the worshipper. The Companion of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and the son of his Companion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Muhammad and it is said: Aboo `Abdir-Rahmaan, and it is said: Aboo Naseer; al-Qurashee, as-Sahmee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His mother was Raa·itah bint al-Hajjaaj ibn Munabbih as-Sahmiyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His father was no older than him except by eleven years or thereabouts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has reached us that he accepted Islaam before his father; and it is said that his name was ‘<em><strong>al-`Aas</strong></em>’ [the disobedient one], so when he accepted Islaam the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) changed it to `<strong>Abdullaah</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He possessed many merits and virtues, and had a high position with regard to knowledge and action. He carried a great deal of knowledge from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was one of those who performed the <em>Hijrah</em> along with his father prior to the conquest of Makkah. His father was only eleven years older than him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) used to prefer him over his father, and in the time of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) he was a person who fasted a great deal, stood in (Night) Prayer a great deal, and recited the Qur·aan a great deal, and who sought a great deal of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He wrote down a lot of knowledge from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), and Aboo Hurairah acknowledged the great amount of knowledge he possessed, and said: “<strong>Because he used to write things down from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and I had not used to write</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ahaadeeth he narrates from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) reach seven hundred in number. al-Bukhaaree and Muslim were united in reporting seven of his ahaadeeth, al-Bukhaaree was alone in reporting eight, and Muslim twenty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He wrote down a great deal of narrations with the permission of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdullaah also narrated from Aboo Bakr, `Umar, Mu`aadh, Suraaqah ibn Maalik, and his father `Amr, and `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn `Awf, Abud-Dardaa· and a group; also from the people of the Book, and he closely examined their books and gave attention to that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was a person of excellence and was earnest in his affairs, and he criticized his father for taking part in affairs in the time of tribulation; however he feared falling into the sin of disobedience if he abandoned his father, so he was therefore present at the battle of Siffeen, but he did not unsheathe a sword.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He acquired a number of the books of the People of the Book and closely examined them, and found some amazing things in them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His father left him a vast amount of property, and he possessed slaves and servants. He also had a garden in Taa·if called <em>al-Waht</em> that was worth a thousand thousand (1,000,000) dirhams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of Egypt took a great deal of knowledge from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He passed away in Egypt in the year 65 H, during the nights of the siege of the capital &#8211;<em>al-Fustaat</em>&#8211; so when he died they were not able to take his funeral out because of the war between Marwaan ibn al-Hakam and the army of Ibn az-Zubayr. So he was buried in his home &#8211;<em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who narrated from him included Ibn al-Musayyib, `Ikrimah, Aboo `Abdir-Rahmaan al-Hubulee, `Urwah, Wahb, Ibn Abee Mulaykah, and Aboo `Amr Shu`ayb ibn Muhammad his grandson.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who narrated from him were: his son Muhammad &#8211; even though there is dispute about this, and narrations of Muhammad from him are reported in Aboo Daawood, at-Tirmidhee and an-Nasaa·ee; and his freed-slave Aboo Qaaboos, and his grandson Shu`ayb ibn Muhammad &#8211; who reported a great deal from him; and he served him and kept his company constantly, and he was brought up in his apartment because Shu`ayb’s father Muhammad died in the life time of his father `Abdullaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His students were many and included: his freed-slave Ismaa`eel, and his freed-slave Saalim, and Anas ibn Maalik, Aboo Umaamah ibn Sahl, and Jubayr ibn Nufayr; and Sa`eed ibn al-Musayyib, `Urwah, Aboo Salamah ibn `Abdir-Rahmaan, Zirr ibn Hubaysh, Humayd ibn `Abdir-Rahmaan ibn `Awf, Khaythamah ibn `Abdir-Rahmaan al-Ju`fee, Taawoos, ash-Sha`bee, `Ikrimah, `Ataa·, Mujaahid, al-Hasan al-Basree, `Abdullaah ibn Buraydah, Ibn Abee Mulaykah, `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Jubayr, `Ataa· ibn Yasaar, `Uqbah ibn Muslim, `Amr ibn Deenaar, Masrooq ibn al-Ajda`, Aboo Burdah ibn Abee Moosaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qataadah said: “He was a stout man.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hammaad ibn Salamah narrated: from `Alee ibn Zayd [[ibn Jud`aan]]: from al-`Uryaan ibn al-Haytham who said: “I came in a deputation along with my father to Yazeed. So a very tall man came. He was reddish and had a large belly. So he sat down. I said: ‘Who is this?’ So it was said: `Abdullaah ibn `Amr.”…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahyaa ibn Ayyoob narrated: from Aboo Qabeel: from `Abdullaah ibn `Amr that he said: “<strong>We used to write down what Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said in his presence.</strong>”..</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[…Yoosuf ibn Maahak: from `Abdullaah ibn `Amr who said: I used to write down everything which I heard from Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), wanting to memorize it. So the Quraish forbade me and said: ‘Do you write everything when Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) is a man, and speaks when angry and when pleased!’ So I stopped writing, and then mentioned it to Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), so he indicated with his finger to his mouth and said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Write, for by the One in Whose Hand is my soul, nothing comes out of it except what is true.</strong> &gt;&gt; (Saheeh: as-Saheehah: no. 1532)]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is established from `Amr ibn Deenaar: from Wahb ibn Munabbih: from his brother Hammaam that he heard Aboo Hurairah say: “<strong>No Companion of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) had more ahaadeeth than me, except for `Abdullaah ibn `Amr, because he used to write and I do not write</strong>.”…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qutaybah narrated: al-Layth narrated to us, along with someone else: from `Ayyaash ibn `Abbaas: from Aboo `Abdir-Rahmaan al-Hubulee: I heard `Abdullaah ibn `Amr say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“That I should be the tenth of ten poor people on the Day of Resurrection is more beloved to me than that I should be the tenth of ten wealthy people; for those with most will be the ones with the least on the Day of Resurrection, except for those who do like this and like this: meaning: they give in charity to the right and to the left.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[al-Bukhaaree narrated in his ‘Saheeh’ (no. 5052): Moosaa narrated to us: Aboo `Awaanah narrated to us: from Mugheerah: from Mujaahid: from `Abdullaah ibn `Amr who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“My father got me married to a woman of a noble family, so he often used to ask my wife about me. So she said: ‘What a fine man he is, for a man who does not come to my bed, nor has he approached me since he married me.’ So when that continued for a long time he mentioned it to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) who said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Let me meet him</strong>. &gt;&gt; So I met him afterwards and he said: &lt;&lt; <strong>How do you observe fasting?</strong> &gt;&gt; So I replied: “I fast every day.” He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>How long does it take you to complete reading the Qur·aan?</strong> &gt;&gt; I said: “I do so every night.” He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Fast for three days every month and recite the Qur&#8217;aan once every month</strong>. &gt;&gt; I said: “I have strength to do more than that.” He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Then fast the most excellent fast: the fast of Daawood: Fasting one day and refraining from fasting the next day; and finish the recitation of the whole Qur·aan once in seven nights.</strong> &gt;&gt; Would that I had accepted the concession of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), as I have become a weak old man.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he used to recite one seventh of the Qur&#8217;aan to some of his family during the day to make sure that he remembered it for the night; and whenever he wanted to gain some strength he would abstain from fasting for some days, count them and fast them later on for he disliked leaving something which he used to do during the time of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I [i.e. adh-Dhahabee] say: He inherited a very great deal of Egyptian gold from his father, so he was one of the kings amongst the Companions. …`Abdullaah accepted Islaam, and migrated after the seventh year and took part in some of the battles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo `Ubayd said: “He was in command of the right flank of the army of Mu`aawiyah on the day of Siffeen.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Khaleefah ibn Khayyaat mentions him as one of Mu`aawiyah’s governors of Koofah. He said: Then he removed him from that position and replaced him with al-Mugheerah ibn Shu`bah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There occurs in the ‘<em>Musnad</em>’ of Ahmad: Yazeed narrated to us: al- `Awwaam related to us: Aswad ibn Mas`ood narrated to me: from Hanzalah ibn Khuwaylid al-`Anbaree who said: “I was in the presence of Mu`aawiyah when two men came to him disputing with regard to the head of `Ammaar &#8211; <em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em>, so each one of them was saying: ‘I killed him.’ So `Abdullaah ibn `Amr said: “Each one of you should be pleased that it was his companion who killed him, and not himself, for I heard Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) say: &lt;&lt; <strong>The transgressing party will kill him</strong>. &gt;&gt; So Mu`aawiyah said: “O `Amr! Will you not spare us this crazy person of yours? Then why are you with us?!” He [i.e. `Abdullaah ibn `Amr] said: “My father made a complaint to Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), so he said to me: &lt;&lt; <strong>Obey your father as long as he lives.</strong> &gt;&gt; So therefore I am with you, but I will not fight.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[‘Saheeh’: ‘as-Saheehul-Musnad’ of Shaikh Muqbil]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Naafi` ibn `Umar related: from Ibn Abee Mulaykah who said: `Abdullaah ibn `Amr &#8211;<em>radiyallaahu `anhumaa</em>&#8211; said: <em>“What have I to do with Siffeen! What have I to do with fighting against the Muslims! I wish that I had died twenty years &#8211; or he said: ten years-before it. Yet even so, by Allaah, I did not strike a sword, nor fire any arrow”;</em> and it is mentioned that he held the flag.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Husayn al-Mu`allim related: from Ibn Buraydah: from Sulaymaan ibn ar- Rabee’ al-`Adawee: that he performed Hajj in the time of Mu`aawiyah amongst a group of the reciters: so it was told to us that `Abdullaah [ibn `Amr] is to be found in the lower part of Makkah. So we went towards him and found a very great party of people and baggage, with three hundred camels: one hundred for riding and two hundred for carrying, whereas we used to be told that he was one of the most humble of people. So we said: ‘What is all this?’ They said: ‘It is for his brothers; he conveys them, and whoever stays as a guest with him upon them.’ So we were surprised. So they said: He is a wealthy man, and they told us where to find him in the Masjidul-Haraam. So we went to him and found that he was a short man with mucus upon his eye-lids, and he was wearing a simple cloak and waistwrapper and a turban, and he let his shoes hang at his left side.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…Yahyaa ibn Bukayr said: “<strong>`Abdullaah ibn `Amr died in Egypt, and was buried in his small house, in the year 65 H.</strong>” This saying about the year of his death was also stated by Khaleefah, Aboo `Ubayd, al-Waaqidee, al- Fallaas and others.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">(Abridged from ‘Siyar A`laamin Nubalaa·’ of Imaam adh-Dhahabee)<br />
Translated by Abu Talha Dawud Burbank <em>rahimahullaah</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Sufyaan ibn Sa`eed ibn Masrooq, the Imaam, Shaikhul-Islaam, The chief of the memorizers, Aboo `Abdillaah, ath-Thawree: from Thawr of the tribe of Mudar, not Thawr of Hamadaan; al-Koofee, the Jurist (Faqeeh).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He narrated from his father, and from: Zubayd ibn al-Haarith, Habeeb ibn Abee Thaabit, al-Aswad ibn Qays, Ziyaad ibn `Ilaaqah, Muhaarib ibn Dithaar, and their level.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who narrated from him included: Ibn al-Mubaarak, Yahyaa alQattaan, Ibn Wahb, Wakee`, al-Firyaabee, Qabeesah, Aboo Nu`aym, Muhammad ibn Katheer, Ahmad ibn Yoonus al-Yarboo`ee, and very many others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shu`bah, Yahyaa ibn Ma`een, and a group said: <strong>Sufyaan is the Chief of the Believers in Hadeeth</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Mubaarak said: <strong>&#8220;I wrote (narrations) from one thousand one hundred Shaikhs, and there was not amongst them anyone more excellent than Sufyaan.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shu`bah used to say: “<strong>Sufyaan is a better memorizer than me.</strong>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Warqaa· said: “<strong>ath-Thawree did not see the like of himself</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad said: “<strong>No one takes precedence over him in my heart</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Qattaan said: “<strong>I have never seen a better memorizer then him: if you asked him about a question or about a hadeeth which he did not possess, it would trouble him greatly</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdur-Razzaaq said: Sufyaan said: “<strong>I never stored anything in my heart and then found it letting me down</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Awzaa`ee said: “<strong>No one whom the Ummah is united upon in their being pleased with him and holding him to be correct remains except for Sufyaan</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Mubaarak said: “<strong>I do not know anyone upon the face of the earth who is more knowledgeable than Sufyaan</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Wakee` said: “<strong>Sufyaan was an ocean</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Qattaan said: “<strong>Sufyaan is above Maalik in everything</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Usaamah said: “Whoever informs you that he has seen the like of Sufyaan, then do not believe him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abee Dhi·b said: “I have not seen in Iraaq anyone who resembles your Thawree.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ath-Thawree said: “<strong>I would love that I am saved regarding knowledge: so that it is neither for nor against me; and there is no action which I fear more for myself than it &#8211; meaning Hadeeth</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahyaa ibn Yamaan said: I heard Sufyaan say: “<strong>The scholar is the doctor of the Religion and dirhams are the disease for the Religion. So if the doctor catches the disease, then when will he be able to treat others?!”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Khuraybee said: “I heard ath-Thawree say: <strong>“Seeking Hadeeth (itself) is not a preparation for death, rather it is an ailment which a man prescribes himself with.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (i.e. adh-Dhahabee) say: ‘He has spoken the truth, by Allaah. Seeking Hadeeth is something other than Hadeeth itself. So seeking Hadeeth is a term commonly used to cover a number of affairs which are additional to actually acquiring Hadeeth itself, and many of them are just steps towards knowledge; and most of these are affairs which the narrator of hadeeth becomes engrossed with, such as: acquiring fine manuscripts; seeking shorter chains; increasing the number of one’s Shaikhs; being overjoyed at titles and praise; and hoping for a long life so that he can narrate more; and loving to be alone in narrating something; and many affairs which are closely allied to personal goals, and not to actions for the Lord. So if your seeking the Prophetic Hadeeth is surrounded by these calamities, then when will you escape from them towards acting purely and sincerely for Allaah. Then if the knowledge of narrations can be tainted, then what do you think about the knowledge of logic, controversial debating, philosophy of the earlier peoples; which strip away Eemaan and produce doubts and throw a person into confusion. These were not, by Allaah, from the knowledge of the Companions, nor the Taabi`een, nor from the knowledge of alAwzaa`ee, ath-Thawree, Maalik, Aboo Haneefah, Ibn Abee Dhi·b, or Shu`bah; nor, by Allaah, were they known by Ibn al-Mubaarak; nor by Aboo Yoosuf who said: “Whoever seeks the Religion through rhetorical theology (al-kalaam) will become an evil heretic”; nor by Wakee`, Ibn Mahdee, Ibn Wahb, ash-Shaafi`ee, `Affaan, Aboo `Ubayd, Ibn al-Madeenee, Ahmad Aboo Thawr, al-Muzanee, al-Bukhaaree, al-Athram, Muslim, anNasaa·ee, Ibn Khuzaymah, Ibn Suraij, Ibn al-Mundhir, and their like. Rather their knowledge was the Qur·aan, the Hadeeth, Fiqh, Grammar, and the like. Yes Sufyaan also said, in what al-Firyaabee heard from him: “There is no action more excellent than seeking the Hadeeth, as long as the intention is correct regarding it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: And I heard him say: “If we wanted to narrate Hadeeth to you exactly as we heard it, then we would not narrate a single hadeeth to you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Firyaabee said: I heard Sufyaan say: “I entered upon al-Mahdee and I said: “It reached me that Ibn `Umar spent twelve deenars upon his Hajj, and you are involved in what you are involved in.” So he became angry and said: ‘Do you want me to be as you are?!’ So I said: ‘If you are not as I am, then at least reduce from what you are doing. “Damurah said: I heard Maalik say: “Iraaq used to wage war upon us with dirhams and garments, and then it waged war upon us with Sufyaan ath-Thawree.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: The virtues of this Imaam occur in a volume complied by Ibn alJawzee; and I have abridged it and brought a good quantity of that in my ‘Taareekh’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saalih Jazarah said: “Sufyaan was a greater memorizer and had more hadeeth than Maalik. However Maalik carefully selected the narrators; and Sufyaan was a greater memorizer then Shu`bah. His ahaadeeth amounted to thirty thousand, whereas the ahaadeeth of Shu`bah were about ten thousand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Sufyaan was born in the year 97 H. He began seeking Hadeeth whilst he was a youth, since his father was one of the scholars of Koofah. He (Sufyaan) died in Basrah, in hiding from al-Mahdee, since he was one who spoke out with the truth and strongly criticized. He died in Sha`baan in the year 161 H -radiyallaahu `anhu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is authentic from Ma`daan: from ath-Thawree, regarding His Saying -He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Sooratul-Hadeed (57): 4]<br />
[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He is with you</strong></span>]], so he said: “His knowledge,” and this is what is reported from a group of the people of Tafseer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Laalikaa·ee in ‘as-Sunnah’: al-Mukhallis related to us: Abul-Fadl Shu`ayb ibn Muhammad related to us: `Alee ibn Harb ibn Bassaam related to us: I heard Shu`ayb ibn Harb say: I said to Sufyaan ath-Thawree:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">‘Tell me a saying about the Sunnah, through which Allaah will benefit me, and when I stand in front of Him and He asks me about it I can say: ‘O my Lord! Sufyaan told this to me.’ So that I will be saved and you will be taken.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">He said: “Write: In the name of Allaah, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy. The Qur·aan is the Speech of Allaah. It is not created. It came from Him, and it will return to Him. Whoever says other than this then he is an Disbeliever; and <em>Eemaan</em> is statement and action and intention, it increases and decreases; and to give precedence to the two Shaikhs [i.e. Aboo Bakr and `Umar]…” until he said: “O Shu`ayb, what you have written will not benefit you until you hold wiping over the leather socks, and until you hold reciting ‘<em>Bismillaahir-Rahmaanir-Raheem</em>’ quietly (in the Prayer) to be better than reciting it loudly; and until you have <em>Eemaan</em> in Pre-Decree (al-Qadr); and until you hold praying behind every righteous or sinful (<em>imaam</em>); and that the Jihaad continues until the Day of Resurrection; and having patience under the flag of the ruler, whether he is tyrannical or just.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">So I said: ‘O Aboo `Abdillaah, is that every Prayer?’ He said: “No, rather the <em>Jumu`ah</em> Prayer, and the two `Eid Prayers: pray them behind whoever you reach. As for the rest of that, then you have a choice, so do not pray except behind one whom you trust in, and you know that he is from the people of the Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">If you stand before Allaah and He asks you about this, then say: “O my Lord, Sufyaan ibn Sa`eed related it to me; and then leave me to my Lord &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is established from Sufyaan, and the Shaikh of al-Mukhallis is reliable -may Allaah have mercy upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[‘Tadhkiratul-Huffaaz’ (1/203-207)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[For the full narration, and a longer biography of Sufyaan refer to the book ‘Mountains of Knowledge.’]]</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;">(Abridged from ‘Siyar A`laamin Nubalaa·’ of Imaam adh-Dhahabee)</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;">Translated by Abu Talha Dawud Burbank <em>rahimahullaah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“`Abdullaah ibn `Abbaas ibn `Abdul-Muttalib -radiyallaahu `anhumaa- the Imaam, the ocean of knowledge, the great scholar (<em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>abr</em>) of the Ummah, and the Imaam of Tafseer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul-`Abbaas, al-Haashimee, the son of the paternal uncle of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), and the father of the khulafaa· [i.e. the later `Abbaasid caliphs.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was born in the mountain pass of Banoo Haashim, three years before the Hijrah. He accompanied the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) for about thirty months, and Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) died when he was thirteen years old. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) supplicated for him that Allaah should grant him knowledge and understanding of the Religion, and should teach him explanation of the Book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Khaalid al-Hadhdhaa· said: from `Ikrimah: from Ibn `Abbaas who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) stroked my head and supplicated for wisdom for me.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Aboo `Aasim: Shabeeb ibn Bishr related to us: `Ikrimah related to us: from Ibn `Abbaas who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) went to relieve himself, then he moved away and found a covered pot (of water), so he said: &lt;&lt; Who brought this? &gt;&gt; So `Abdullaah (ibn `Abbaas) said: “It was I”, so he said: &lt;&lt; O Allaah teach him explanation of the Qur·aan. &gt;&gt;</span></strong> [Saheeh: ‘Sharhut-Tahaawiyyah’ (no. 180), ‘as-Saheehah’ (no. 2589)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-al-A`mash: from `Abud-Duhaa: from Masrooq who said: Ibn Mas`ood said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“What a fine explainer of the Qur·aan is Ibn `Abbaas! If he had reached our age, then none of us would have attained a tenth of his knowledge.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-al-A`mash: from Aboo Waa·il:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> “`Alee placed Ibn `Abbaas in charge of the Hajj, so he gave a khutbah that day which was such that if it had been heard by the Turks and the Romans they would have accepted Islaam. Then he recited Sooratun-Noor to them and began explaining it.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He narrated a good number of narrations from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), and from `Umar. `Alee, Mu`aadh, his father al-`Abbaas, `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn `Awf, Aboo Sufyaan Sakhr ibn Harb, Aboo Dharr, Ubayy ibn Ka`b, Zayd ibn Thaabit, and a large number of others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He recited Qur·aan with Ubayy (ibn Ka`b) and Zayd (ibn Thaabit). Mujaahid, Sa`eed ibn Jubayr, and a group took the recitation from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who narrated from him are: his son `Alee, the son of his brother `Abdullaah ibn Ma`bad, and his freed slaves: `Ikrimah, Miqsam, and Aboo Ma`bad Naafidh; and Anas ibn Maalik, Abut-Tufayl, Aboo Umaamah ibn Sahl, and his brother Katheer ibn `Abbaas; and `Urwah ibn az-Zubayr, `Ubaydullaah ibn `Umar, Taawoos, Abush-Sha`thaa· Jaabir, `Alee ibn al- Husayn, Sa`eed ibn Jubayr, Mujaahid ibn Jabr, al-Qaasim ibn Muhammad, Aboo Saalih as-Sammaan, Aboo Rajaa· al-`Utaaridee, Abul-`Aaliyah, `Ubayd ibn `Umayr and his son `Abdullaah `Ataa· ibn Yasaar, Ibraaheem ibn `Abdullaah ibn Ma`bad, and Arbadah at-Tameemee &#8211; the companion of the ‘Tafseer’, and Aboo Saalih Baadhaam, Taleeq ibn Qays al-Hanafee, `Ataa· ibn Abee Rabaah, ash-Sha`bee, al-Hasan, Ibn Seereen, Muhammad ibn Ka`b al-Qurazee, Shahr ibn Hawshab, Ibn Mulaykah, `Amr ibn Deenaar, `Ubaydullaah ibn Abee Yazeed, Aboo Jamrah Nasr ibn `Imraan ad-Duba`ee ad-Dahhaak ibn Muzaahim, Abuz-Zubayr al-Makkee, Bakr ibn `Abdullaah al-Muzanee, Habeeb ibn Abee Thaabit, Sa`eed ibn Abil-Hasan, Ismaa`eel as-Suddee, and many others besides them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And ‘at-Tahdheeb’ mentions <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>a hundred and ninety seven people who narrated from him</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-al-Madaa·inee: from Nu`aym ibn Hafs: that Aboo Bakr said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Ibn `Abbaas came to us in Basrah, and there was not anyone the like of him amongst the `Arabs in his body, his knowledge, his explanation , his handsomeness and his completeness.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-`Abdur-Razzaaq: from Ma`mar who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The greater part of the knowledge of Ibn `Abbaas was taken from three men: `Umar, `Alee and Ubayy ibn Ka`b &#8211;<em>radiyallaahu `anhum</em>.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Aboo Bakr ibn `Ayyaash: from Muhammad ibn `Amr: from Aboo Salamah: from Ibn `Abbaas who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I used to hear that a man would have a hadeeth, so I would go to him and sit until he came out. So then I would ask him; and if I had wished I could have got him to come out to me.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Zaa·idah: `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn `Abdullaah ibn al-Asbahaanee related to us: that `Abdullaah ibn Shaddaad, will you not be amazed? A boy came to me after I had laid down to take the noon siesta, and said: ‘There is a man at the door requesting permission to enter.’ So I said: “He must have come for some need, so grant him permission to enter.” He said: So he entered and said: ‘Will you not inform me about that man.’ So I said: “Which man?” So he said: ‘`Alee ibn Abee Taalib: when will he be returned to life?’ So I said: “Subhaan Allaah! (I declare Allaah free of all imperfections!) When everybody in the graves is resurrected.” So he said: ‘I do not see except that you are saying the same as those stupid people.’ So I said: “Get him out or I will beat him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Ma`mar: from Qataadah: from Mutarrif who said: “I heard Ibn `Abbaas say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Revising knowledge for an hour is better than spending the whole night awake (in Prayer).”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His mother was Ummul-Fadl Lubaabah bint al-Haarith ibn Huzn ibn Bujayr al-Hilaaliyyah, descended from Hilaal ibn `Aamir.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He had a group of children; the eldest being al `Abbaas -after whom he took his kunyah; and `Alee -the father of the khulafaa· and he was the youngest of them, and al-Fadl, and Muhammad, and `Ubaydullaah, and Lubaabah and Asmaa·.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was a person who was pleasant-looking and handsome, tall in stature, imposing, complete intellect, quick in understanding, a man complete in his characteristics.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His children al-Fadl, Muhammad and `Ubaydullaah died without offspring; whereas Lubaabah produced children and descendants from her husband `Alee ibn `Abdullaah ibn Ja`far ibn Abee Taalib; and his other daughter Asmaa·, who was married to her paternal cousin `Abdullaah ibn `Ubaydullaah ibn al-`Abbaas, gave birth to Hasan and Husayn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn `Abbaas went with his parents to the place of Hijrah [al-Madeenah] in the year of the Conquest, having accepted Islaam before that. So it is established from him that he said: <strong>“I and my mother were from the weak ones (who were excused from migrating): I was a child and my mother from the women.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Khaalid al-Hadhdhaa·: from `Ikrimah: from Ibn `Abbaas that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) wiped my head and supplicated for wisdom for me</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[al- Bukhaaree’s narration (no. 75) is: “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Once the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) embraced me and said: &lt;&lt; O Allaah bestow upon him knowledge of the Book</strong></span> &gt;&gt;.]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Shihaab narrated: from `Ubaydullaah: from Ibn `Abbaas who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I came riding an ass, and I was close to puberty, and Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) was leading the people in Prayer in Minaa.”</strong></span> [[al-Bukhaaree: no. 492]…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Sa`eed ibn Yoonus said: Ibn `Abbaas went on military expedition to Africa with Ibn Abee Sarh; and fifteen of the people of Egypt narrated from him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo `Abdillaah ibn Mandah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“His mother was Ummul-Fadl, the sister of Ummul-Mu·mineen Maymoonah, and he was born two years before the Hijrah.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was light-skinned and tall; his complexion was tinged with yellow. He was stout and he was handsome, fair of face, and he had hair up to the ears. He dyed with henna, and the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) supplicated for wisdom for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: He was the maternal cousin of Khaalid ibn al-Waleed al- Makhzoomee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa`eed ibn Saalim narrated: Ibn Jurayj narrated to us, saying: we were sitting with `Ataa· in al-Masjidul-Haraam and were speaking about Ibn `Abbaas. So `Ataa· said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I never see the moon on the fourteenth night [[i.e. when full and bright]] except that it reminds me of the face of Ibn `Abbaas.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibraaheem ibn al-Hakam ibn Abaan narrated: from his father: from `Ikrimah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“When Ibn `Abbaas passed along a path-way the women in the walled gardens would say: ‘Is it musk that has gone by, or was it Ibn `Abbaas?’.”…</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hammaad ibn Salamah and others narrate: from `Abdullaah ibn `Uthmaan ibn Khuthaym: from Sa`eed ibn Jubayr: from `Abdullaah [Ibn `Abbaas who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I spent the night in the house of my maternal aunt Maymoonah and I placed some water for the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) to take a bath, so he said: &lt;&lt; Who has placed this? &gt;&gt; So they said: ‘`Abdullaah’, so he said: &lt;&lt; O Allaah grant him knowledge of explanation, and grant him understanding of the Religion. &gt;&gt;</strong></span> [[Saheeh: Ahmad, at-Tabaraanee…]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Zur`ah ad-Dimashqee reports in his ‘Taareekh’ from Ibn `Umar that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“He [i.e. Ibn `Abbaas] is the most knowledgeable of the people regarding that which Allaah sent down to Muhammad.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Nu`aym reports in ‘<em>al-Hilyah</em>’ from Shaqeeq who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Ibn `Abbaas delivered a khutbah to us whilst he was in charge of the Hajj. So he started reciting Sooratul-Baqarah. So he would recite and then explain. So I began saying to myself: I have never seen or heard the speech of a man the like of it; if the Persians and the Romans were to hear it they would enter into Islaam. ….</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saalih ibn Rustum al-Khazzaaz narrated: from Ibn Abee Mulaykah: I accompanied Ibn `Abbaas from Makkah to al-Madeenah. So when he camped at a place he would spend half of the night standing in Prayer. So Ayyoob asked him: ‘How had his recitation used to be?’ He said: He recited:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَجَاءَتْ سَكْرَةُ الْمَوْتِ بِالْحَقِّ ۖ ذَٰلِكَ مَا كُنتَ مِنْهُ تَحِيدُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;">And the stupor of death will come in truth: this is what you sought to flee from</span>]]. [Soorah Qaaf (50): 19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he would recite it slowly and carefully, and be sobbing a great deal.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jurayj narrated: from Ibn Abee Mulaykah: that Ibn `Abbaas said: “The people have passed away and the apes remain.” It was said: ‘What are the ‘apes’?’ So he replied: “Those who resemble the people but are not people.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taawoos narrated: from his father: from Ibn `Abbaas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Mu`aawiyah said to me: ‘Are you upon the way of `Alee?!’ So I replied: ‘No, nor upon the way of `Uthmaan. I am upon the way of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Taawoos who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I did not see anyone greater in the respect they showed to Allaah’s prohibitions than Ibn `Abbaas [and whenever I remember him I wished I would weep].</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jareer ibn Haazim narrated: from Ya`laa ibn Hakeem: from `Ikrimah: from Ibn `Abbaas who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;">“When Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) passed away, I said to a man from the Ansaar: “Come let us ask questions of the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) because they are many at this time.” So he said: ‘How surprising of you, O Ibn `Abbaas! Do you think that the people will come to need you, when there are amongst the people the Companions of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) those whom you see?!’ So he left that ,and I began asking. So whenever I heard that a man had a hadeeth I would go to him whilst he was taking the noon siesta. So I would place my cloak as a pillow at his door, and the wind would blow dust over me. Then the man would come out and see me and say: “O cousin of Allaah’s Messenger! Why didn’t you send a message so that I should come to you?’ So I would say: “It is more fitting that I should come to you and ask you.” So the man [of the Ansaar] remained until he found the people gathering around me, so he said ‘This youth was more intelligent than me.’”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdul-Malik ibn Abee Sulaymaan narrated from Sa`eed ibn Jubayr who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;">“Some men of the Muhaajiroon felt that they had a grievance with `Umar because of the fact that he brought Ibn `Abbaas close to him [in gatherings] and did not do so with them; and he used to question him. So `Umar said: “Today I will show you something that will cause you to recognize his excellence.” So he asked them about this Soorah:</span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا جَاءَ نَصْرُ اللَّهِ وَالْفَتْحُ</span></h3>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">[When comes the Help of Allah (to you, O Muhammad (Peace be upon him) against your enemies) and the conquest (of Makkah)] </span><span style="color:#000080;">[Sooratun-Nasr (110)]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;">So some of them said: ‘It is a command from Allaah for His Prophet that when he saw them entering into Allaah’s Religion in crowds he was to praise Him and seek His forgiveness.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;">So `Umar said: ‘O Ibn `Abbaas! Speak!’ So he said: “He informed him when he was going to die. Meaning: It will be a sign for the approach of your death, so praise your Lord and seek His forgiveness.” [[So `Umar said: I do not know about it except what you have said.]]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yazeed ibn Ibraaheem narrated: from Sulaymaan al-Ahwal: from Taawoos: from Ibn `Abbaas that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Concerning a single matter I would ask thirty of the Companions of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Its chain of narration is ‘Saheeh’…]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Ikrimah: I heard Mu`aawiyah say to me:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Your master [i.e. Ibn `Abbaas], by Allaah, is the most knowledgeable one of those who have died and those who are alive.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is related from `Aa·ishah that she said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The most knowledgeable person about the Hajj who remains is Ibn `Abbaas.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: And he used to hold Hajj Tamattu` as being what is essential.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">..Ibn Jurayj narrated: from Taawoos who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;I did not see anyone with more piety than Ibn `Umar, nor anyone more knowledgeable than Ibn `Abbaas.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujaahid said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“I never saw anyone the like of Ibn `Abbaas; and he was, at the time he died, the great scholar of this Ummaah.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-A`mash narrated: from Mujaahid who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Ibn `Abbaas used to be called ‘the ocean’ (<em>al-Bahr</em>) because of his extensive knowledge.”…</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Masrooq narrated, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“When I would see Ibn `Abbaas I would say: ‘He is the most handsome of the people’, and when he uttered something I would say: ‘He is the most eloquent of the people’, and when he talked I would say: ‘He is the most knowledgeable of the people.’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Qaasim ibn Muhammad said: “I never saw anything futile in the gathering of Ibn `Abbaas.”…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo `Awaanah narrated: from Abul-Juwayriyah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> ‘I saw the Izaar of Ibn `Abbaas half way down his shins, or above that and he had a roman cloak upon him and he was praying.’…</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hazm said in his book ‘al-Ihkaam’: Aboo Bakr Muhammad ibn Moosaa ibn Ya`qoob ibn al-Ma·moon, one of the imaams of Islaam, gathered together the verdicts of Ibn `Abbaas in twenty volumes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The debate of Ibn `Abbaas -radiyallaahu `anhumaa- with the Khawaarijee</strong></span> which resulted in the majority of them returning from their innovation to the truth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AT-TABARAANEE reported in ‘<em>al-Mu`jamul Kabeer</em>’ (no. 10598): “Ishaaq ibn Ibraaheem ad-Dabaree narrated to us: from `Abdur-Razzaaq. Further Isnaad: And `Alee ibn `Abdil-`Azeez narrated to us: Aboo Hudhayfah Moosaa ibn Mas`ood narrated to us: both of them from `Ikrimah ibn `Ammaar that Aboo Zameel al-Hanafee narrated to us: that `Abdullaah ibn `Abbaas narrated to us, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">“When the (<em>Khawaarij</em>) separated themselves off in Haarooraa and gathered themselves together in some abode. So I said to `Alee: “O Ameerul Mu·mineen pray the Prayer in its earliest time so that I can then go and speak to those people.” So he said: ‘I fear for you from them.’ So I dressed in the best clothes I could and wore this Yemeni cloak. So I went to them and entered upon them whilst they were resting at the time of the start of the afternoon heat. So I entered upon a people who were such that I have never seen a people who strove harder in worship than them. Their hands were like the knees of camels, and their faces were scarred with the traces of prostration. So when I entered they said: ‘Welcome, O Ibn `Abbaas, what has brought you here?’ So he said: “I came to narrate to you from the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم): the Revelation came down and they know best about its explanation.” So some of them said: ‘Don’t speak with him’ and others said: ‘Rather we will speak with him.’ He said: I said: “Tell me the criticism you have of the son of the uncle of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), his son in law, and the first of those who believed in him; and the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) are along with him.” They said: ‘We criticize him for three things.’ I said: “What are they?” </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">They said: ‘The first of them is that he caused men to pass judgement in Allaah’s Religion, whereas Allaah said:</span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنِ الْحُكْمُ إِلَّا لِلَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;">Judgement is only for Allaah</span>]].’ [Soorah Yoosuf (12): 40]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">He said: “And what else?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"> So they said: ‘He fought but did not take any females captured as slaves girls, nor did he seize war-booty. So if the enemy were Disbelievers, then their property was lawful for us; and if they were Believers, then it was forbidden for us to shed their blood.’ </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">He said: I said: “And what else?” </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">They said: ‘He erased his title ‘Ameerul-Mu·mineen’ (chief of the Believers), so if he is not the chief of the Believers, then he must be the chief of the Disbelievers.’ </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">He said: I said: “What do you think if I recite to you from the decisive Book of Allaah, and I narrate to you from the Sunnah of your Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) that which you cannot deny, will you turn back?” They said: ‘Yes’. He said: So I said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">“As for your saying that he caused men to judge in Allaah’s Religion, then He says:</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تَقْتُلُوا الصَّيْدَ وَأَنتُمْ حُرُمٌ ۚ وَمَن قَتَلَهُ مِنكُم مُّتَعَمِّدًا فَجَزَاءٌ مِّثْلُ مَا قَتَلَ مِنَ النَّعَمِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">up to His Saying:</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"> يَحْكُمُ بِهِ ذَوَا عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe, do not kill game whilst in a state of ihraam; and whoever of you does that intentionally, then the penalty is a sacrifice equal to the animal killed, as adjudged by two just men among you</span>.]] [Sooratul-Maa·idah (5): Aayah 95]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">And said, with regard to a woman and her husband:</span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ شِقَاقَ بَيْنِهِمَا فَابْعَثُوا حَكَمًا مِّنْ أَهْلِهِ وَحَكَمًا مِّنْ أَهْلِهَا </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;">If you fear a breach between the husband and wife then send an arbitrator from his family and an arbitrator from her family</span>]] [Sooratun-Nisaa· (4): 35]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">I adjure you by Allaah; does the judgement of men for the sparing of their blood and their persons and rectification of relations between them have more right, or their judgement with regard to a rabbit whose price is a quarter of a dirham?” They said: ‘O Allaah: For sparing their blood and rectifying between them.’ He said: “Have you abandoned this criticism?” They said: ‘O Allaah, yes.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">Then as for your saying that they fought but did not take captured females as slave-girls and did not take war-booty: then would you take your mother as a slave-girl and make lawful from her that which you make lawful regarding other then her, for in that case you would be Disbelievers; and if you claim that she [i.e. `Aa·ishah-<em>radiyallaahu `anhaa</em>] is not your mother, then you are Disbelievers and have left Islaam because Allaah -the Mighty and Majestic-says:</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">النَّبِيُّ أَوْلَىٰ بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ مِنْ أَنفُسِهِمْ ۖ وَأَزْوَاجُهُ أُمَّهَاتُهُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;">The Prophet has more right upon the Believers than their own selves, and his wives are as their mothers</span>]] [Sooratul-Ahzaab (33): 6]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">so you are between two deviations and may choose whichever of them you please. Do you abandon this argument?” They said: ‘O Allaah, yes.’ </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">He said: “As for your saying that he erased his title of ‘Ameerul- Mu·mineen’, then Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) called, on the day of Hudaybiyyah to write an agreement between him and them. So he said: &lt;&lt; Write: This is the judgement agreed to by Muhammad, the Messenger of Allaah. &gt;&gt; So they said: ‘By Allaah, if we knew you to be Allaah’s Messenger we would not prevent you from the House, nor would we have fought against you. But rather write: Muhammad the son of `Abdullaah.’ So he said: &lt;&lt; By Allaah I am the Messenger of Allaah even if you reject me. Write, O `Alee: Muhammad the son of `Abdullaah. &gt;&gt; So Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) was more excellent than `Alee. So do you abandon this criticism?” They said: ‘O Allaah, yes.’ </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">So twenty thousand of them returned and four thousand remained and were killed.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Hasan: ‘as-Saheehul-Musnad min Fadaa·ilis-Sahaabah’ of Mustafaa al- `Adawee (pp. 427-428)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn `Abbaas died in Taa·if in the year 68 H, and Muhammad ibn al- Hanafiyyah [the son of `Alee ibn Abee Taalib and Khawlah bint al- Hanafiyyah] lead the funeral prayer over him, and said: “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Today the wise scholar (rabbaanee) of this Ummah has died</strong></span>.” -radiyallaahu `anhumaa.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>ABOO HURAIRAH -radiyallaahu `anhu</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(Abridged from ‘Siyar A`laamin Nubalaa·’ of Imaam adh-Dhahabee)<br />
Translated by Abu Talha Dawud Burbank <em>rahimahullaah</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Aboo Hurairah ad-Dawsee, al-Yamaanee, the great memorizer, the jurist, the Companion of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم): <strong>`Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Sakhr</strong> in the most well-known saying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His name in the times of ignorance was <strong>`Abd-Shams</strong>. He said: “My father gave me the ‘kunyah’ of Aboo Hurairah (‘Father of the kitten’) because I used to tend some sheep and I found some wild kittens. So when he saw them and heard them he said: ‘You are the father of the cat,’ and my name was `Abd-Shams.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">at-Tabaraanee said: His mother -radiyallaahu `anhaa- was Maymoonah bint Sabeeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Hurairah performed hijrah and arrived at the time of the conquest of Khaybar in the seventh year.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He memorized a huge amount of knowledge from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), no one else acquired as much as him. He also took from Aboo Bakr, `Umar, Ubayy ibn Ka`b and Ka`b.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who narrated from him included al-Agharr Aboo Muslim, Sa`eed ibn al-Musayyib, Basheer ibn Naheek, Hafs ibn `Aasim, Humayd ibn `AbdirRahmaan az-Zuhree, Humayd ibn `Abdir-Rahmaan al-Himyaree, Aboo Saalih as-Sammaan, Khallaas ibn `Amr, Saalim Abul-Ghayth, Sa`eed alMaqburee -and his father Aboo Sa`eed, Sa`eed ibn Marjaanah, Salmaan alAgharr, Aboo Haazim Salaman al-Ashja`ee, Aboo Yoonus Sulaym ibn Jubayr, Sulaymaan ibn Yasaar, Shahr ibn Hawshab, Saalih mawlaa atTaw·amah, Damdam ibn Jaus, Taawoos, ash-Sha`bee, Aboo Idrees alKhawlaanee, Aboo `Uthmaan an-Nahdee, `Abdur-Rahmaan al-A`raj, Iraak ibn Khaalid, `Ikrimah, `Urwah, `Ataa·, Mujaahid, Ibn Seereen, Muhammad ibn Ziyaad al-Jumahee, Muhammad ibn Ka`b, Moosaa ibn Wardaan, Nu`aym al-Mujmir, Naafi` mawlaa Ibn `Umar, Hammaam ibn Munabbih, and a very great number of people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was one of the treasure-houses of knowledge, and one of the major imaams in verdicts, along with his great dignity and excellence, his worship and his humility.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Bukhaaree said: &#8220;<strong>Eight hundred people narrated from him</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is said: He was yellowish-brown, broad-shouldered, having his central incisor teeth widely spaced, he had two locks of hair and he used to dye with red dye. He was a poor man from the people of ‘as-Suffah’, he experienced hunger and need.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then after the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) his condition improved and his wealth increased, and he was a person who worshipped and remembered Allaah a great deal. He came to be the governor of al-Madeenah and deputed for Marwaan in his leadership, and he used to pass through the market of al-Madeenah with a bundle of firewood, saying: “Make room on the path for the chief”, and he used to joke -radiyallaahu `anhu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul-Qaasim ibn Nahhaas: I heard Aboo Bakr ibn Abee Daawood say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> “I saw Aboo Hurairah in a dream, whilst I was in Sijjistaan and was compiling his ahaadeeth, and he had a thick beard, was brown, and was wearing coarse clothes. So I said to him: “I love you”. So he replied: “I am the first student of ahaadeeth in the world.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ismaa`eel ibn Abee Khaalid: from Qays: from Aboo Hurairah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“When I migrated to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) I said along the way: ‘Oh what a long wearing night; yet it brought about rescue from the land of Unbelief’.” He said: “And a slave belonging to me ran away. So when I came and gave the pledge of allegiance the slave appeared, so the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: &lt;&lt; This is your slave, O Hurairah. &gt;&gt; So I said: “He is free for the Face of Allaah”, so I set him free.”</span></strong> [al-Bukhaaree: (no. 2531)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Ayyoob: from Muhammad: that Aboo Hurairah used to say to his daughter:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Do not wear gold, because I fear for you the blazing flame.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Saalim ibn Hayyaan: from his father: from Aboo Hurairah that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;I grew up as an orphan, and performed <em>Hijrah</em> as a poor man, and I used to be a hired worker for the daughter of Ghazwaan and my wages were food for my stomach and a turn upon the riding beast. So I would drive the camels along when they rode, and I would collect firewood when they stopped somewhere. So All praise is for Allaah Who gave strength and authority to the Religion and Who made Aboo Hurairah an <em>Imaam</em>.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-az-Zuhree: from Saalim: that he heard Aboo Hurairah say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“A people in the state of <em>ihraam</em> asked me about people not in the state of <em>ihraam</em> giving them as a gift some game that had been hunted, so I told them to eat it. Then I met `Umar and informed him of this, so he said: ‘If you had given them a different verdict I would have punished you’.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Qays ibn Abee Haazim: from Aboo Hurairah who said: “I came on the day of Khaybar after they had finished fighting.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Ibn Seereen said: Aboo Hurairah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“I would sometimes faint between the grave and the <em>minbar</em> because of severe hunger to the extent that the people would say: ‘He is possessed’, so a man would sit upon my chest. So I would raise up my head and say: “It is not what you think, it is just hunger.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Ahmad narrated in his ‘Musnad’ from Aboo Katheer as-Suhaymee from Aboo Hurairah who said: Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>O Allaah make this slave of yours -meaning Aboo Hurairah- and his mother beloved to your believing servants, and make them beloved to the two of them</strong>.</span> &gt;&gt; [Muslim: (2491)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Ibn Abee Dhi·b: from al-Maqburee: from Aboo Hurairah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“ I preserved two sack-fulls of knowledge from Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). So as for one of them, then I distributed it amongst the people; and as for the other one, then if I had opened it, then my throat would have been cut off.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[alBukhaaree: (no. 120): Ibn Hajr said in ‘Fathul-Baaree’: The scholars understand the sack of knowledge which he did not spread to be the ahaadeeth which gave the names of the evil rulers, and their conditions, and their times; and Aboo Hurairah used to allude to some of that but not state it plainly, out of fear of them for himself.]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-al-A`mash: from Aboo Saalih as-Sammaan who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Aboo Hurairah was one of the greatest memorizers amongst the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-ash-Shaafi`ee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Aboo Hurairah was the greatest memorizer who narrated hadeeth in his time.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kahmas narrated from `Abdullaah ibn Shaqeeq who said: Aboo Hurairah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> “I do not know anyone from the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) who memorized more of his ahaadeeth than me.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Aboo Daawood at-Tayaalisee: `Imraan al-Qattaan related to us: from Bakr ibn `Abdillaah: from Aboo Raafi`: from Aboo Hurairah that he met Ka`b and began narrating to him and asking him. So Ka`b said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I have not seen anyone who has not read the <em>Tawraat</em> having better knowledge of what is contained in it than Aboo Hurairah.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Hushaym: from Ya`laa ibn `Ataa·: from al-Waleed ibn `Abdir-Rahmaan: from Ibn `Umar that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> “O Aboo Hurairah: You were the one amongst us who most closely accompanied Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and the most knowledgeable of us of his ahaadeeth.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Hammaad ibn Zayd: from `Abbaas al-Jurayree: I heard Aboo `Uthmaan anNahdee who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I took Aboo Hurairah as a guest for seven days; so he, his wife and his servant followed each other, dividing the night into three. One would pray and then awaken the next who would pray, and would then awaken the third.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Ibraaheem ibn Yoosuf related to us: Ibn Rawaahah related to us: as-Silafee related to us: Ibn al-Busree related to us: as-Sukkaree related to us: asSaffaar related to us: ar-Ramaadee related to us: `Abdur-Razzaaq related to us: Ma`mar related to us: from Muhammad ibn Ziyaad who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Mu`aawiyah used to appoint Aboo Hurairah to be the governor of alMadeenah, but if he became angry with him he would send Marwaan to replace him, but it would not be long before he would re-appoint Aboo Hurairah and remove Marwaan. So he said to a black slave: “Stand at the door and do not prevent anyone from entering except Marwaan. So the servant did so. Then later when it became the turn of Marwaan he entered and said: “We were prevented (from entry)!” So he replied: ‘‘The one having the most right that I should not deny him is you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Khuthaym ibn `Iraak narrated from his father: from Aboo Hurairah that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) had gone off to Khaybar when I came as a muhaajir to al-Madeenah. So I prayed the Dawn Prayer behind Sibaa` ibn `Urfutah whom he had left in charge and in the first rak`ah he recited Soorah Maryam, and in the other one [Sooratul-Mutaffifeen] So I said: “Woe to my father! How rare it is to find a man in the land of the Azd except that he has two measures: a measure for himself and another one to short-change the people with.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Humayd ibn `Abdir-Rahmaan al-Himyaree said: “He accompanied (the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) for four years.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He suffered hunger and poverty, and adhered to the mosque. When he migrated he had a slave of his along with him but he fled and got away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hishaam: from Muhammad [i.e. Ibn Seereen] who said: we were in the presence of Aboo Hurairah [and he was wearing two linen garments dyed with red clay], and he blew his nose and wiped it upon his upper garment and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“All praise is for Allaah who has provided Aboo Hurairah with linen to blow his nose on! For I have seen a time when I would faint between the house of `Aa·ishah and the minbar because of severe hunger. So then a man would pass by and sit upon my chest </span></strong><span style="color:#000000;">[thinking that I had become possessed]</span><strong><span style="color:#000000;">. So I would raise up my head and say: “It is not what you think, it is just hunger.”</span></strong>[[al-Bukhaaree: no. 7324]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I [i.e. adh-Dhahabee] say: Those who saw him would think that he was possessed, and so sit on him to recite ‘ruqyah’ upon him, or the like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…from `Aamir: from Aboo Hurairah that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> “I was in as-Suffah </strong>[[a shaded place at the rear of the mosque of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) where the poor and those with no accommodation would stay]]<strong> so Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) sent some `Ajwah dates to us, so we would take two dates together because of our hunger; and when one of us wanted to take two dates at a time he would say to his companion: I am taking two dates at a time, so do likewise.”</strong></span>[[‘as-Saheehah’: 2323]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujaahid narrated: that Aboo Hurairah used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"> “By Allaah, besides Whom none has the right to be worshipped, I used to lay down on the ground resting upon my liver because of hunger, and I used to tie a stone upon my belly because of hunger. One day I sat by the way where the people would come out, and Aboo Bakr passed by. So I asked him about an Aayah from the Book of Allaah, and I only asked him so that he would satisfy my hunger, but then he carried on and did not do so. Then `Umar passed by me and so I asked him about an Aayah from the Book of Allaah, and I only asked him so that he would satisfy my hunger, but then he carried on and did not do so. Then Abul-Qaasim (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) passed by me and smiled when he saw me and recognized what was in my heart and on my face. He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>O Aboo Hirr!</strong> &gt;&gt; I replied: “At your service, O Messenger of Allaah.” He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Follow me</strong> &gt;&gt;. So he proceeded and I followed him, and he entered his house. So I requested permission to enter and was admitted. So he entered and found some milk in a bowl. So he said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Where is this milk from?</strong> &gt;&gt; So they said: ‘It was presented as a gift by such and such man, or such and such woman.’ He said: &lt;&lt;<strong> O Aboo Hirr!</strong> &gt;&gt; I said: “At your service, O Messenger of Allaah!” He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>go to the people of ‘Suffah’ and call them to me</strong> &gt;&gt; and the people of ‘Suffah’ were the guests of Islaam: they did not have families, wealth or any person to support them. So whenever some charity came to him he would send it to them, and he would not take anything from it himself; and whenever something was sent to him as a gift he would send something to them and take some of it himself, and cause them to share in it. So his order upset me and I said (to myself): ‘How will this small quantity of milk be enough for the people of ‘as-Suffah’?!’ I felt I was more entitled to drink from that milk in order to strengthen myself by it. But if they came, then he would command me to give it to them; and then what would remain of that milk for me?!’ However I could not but obey Allaah and obey His Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). So I went to them and invited them and they came. So they sought permission to enter and he admitted them. So they took their seats in the house. He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>O Aboo Hirr!</strong> &gt;&gt; I said “At your service, O Messenger of Allaah!” He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Take it and give it to them</strong>. &gt;&gt; So I took it and started by giving it to one man who drank until he was full, and then he returned it to me. Then I gave it to the next man who drank until he was full and then returned it to me, until I came to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and all of the people had drank until they were full. So he took the bowl and placed it upon his hand, then he looked at me and smiled, and said: &lt;&lt; <strong>O Aboo Hirr!</strong> &gt;&gt; I said: “At your service, O Messenger of Allaah!” He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>There remain I and you</strong>. &gt;&gt; I said: “You have spoken the truth, O Messenger of Allaah.” He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Sit down and drink.</strong> &gt;&gt; So I sat down and drank. He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Drink!</strong> &gt;&gt; So I drank, and he kept on saying: “Drink!” until I said: “No, by the One Who sent you with the truth, I have no more room for it.” He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Hand it to me</strong>. &gt;&gt; So I gave him the bowl, and he praised Allaah and mentioned Allaah’s Name upon it and drank the remainder.”</span> [al-Bukhaaree: (no. 6452)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…Aboo Katheer as-Suhaymee and his name was Yazeed ibn `AbdirRahmaan narrated: that Aboo Hurairah narrated to me, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“By Allaah, Allaah has not created a true Believer who hears of me except that he loves me.” I said: ‘How do you know that?’ He said: “My mother was a Mushrik woman, and I used to call her to Islaam but she would not accept it from me. So I called her one day but she said something disagreeable to me about Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). So I went to Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and I was weeping. So I informed him and asked him to supplicate for her, so he said: &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#808000;">O Allaah guide the mother of Aboo Hurairah</span>.</span> &gt;&gt; So then I went out running to give her the good news. So I arrived and the door was closed and I heard the splashing of water, and she heard the sound of my footsteps. So she said: ‘Wait as you are!’ Then she opened the door, and she had put her gown on, and had been too hasty to put on her khimaar. So she said: ‘I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and that Muhammad is His Slave and His Messenger.’ He said: “So I went back to Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) weeping with joy just as I had wept from sorrow, and I informed him, and I said: “Make supplication to Allaah that he should cause me and my mother to be beloved to His believing servants. So he said: &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#808000;">O Allaah make this slave of Yours and his mother beloved to Your believing servants, and cause them to be loved by these two</span>. &gt;&gt;” &#8211;</strong></span>“Its chain of narration is ‘hasan’.” [[Reported by Ahmad (2/319-320), and Muslim (no. 2491)]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Shihaab: from Sa`eed [Ibn al-Musayyib] and Aboo Salamah: that Aboo Hurairah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> “You people say that ‘Aboo Hurairah narrates too many ahaadeeth from Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)! And you say that why is it not the case that the <em>Muhaajiroon</em> and the <em>Ansaar</em> do not narrate like him!’ But my brothers from the <em>Muhaajiroon</em> were busy in the markets, and my brothers from the <em>Ansaar</em> were busy working upon their property. But I was a poor man from the poor people of ‘<em>as-Suffah</em>’. I used to adhere to Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and be content with what filled my stomach. So I would be present when they were absent, and remember when they would forget; and Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said to us one day: &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#808000;">No one will spread out his garment till I have finished what I am saying, and then gather his garment upon himself except that he will preserve whatever I say</span>. &gt;&gt; So I spread out a striped cloak which I had upon me until he finished what he was saying, and then gathered it upon my chest. So I did not forget anything from that narration.”</span></strong> [[al-Bukhaaree (no. 2047) and Muslim (no. 2492)]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">az-Zuhree, also: from al-A`raj: from Aboo Hurairah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> “You claim that I narrate excessively from Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)! Whereas the truth is known by Allaah. I was a poor man who accompanied Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and contented myself with whatever filled my stomach. So he narrated to us one day and said: &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#808000;">Whoever will spread out his garment, will never forget anything which he heard from me.</span> &gt;&gt; So I did so, and by the One Who sent him with the truth I have never forgotten anything which I heard from him.”</span></strong> [[al-Bukhaaree (nos. 118 &amp; 2350); Muslim (no. 2492)]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…al-Maqburee: from Aboo Hurairah who said: I said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“O Messenger of Allaah who will be the most fortunate of people to attain your intercession?” He said: &lt;&lt;<span style="color:#808000;"> I thought that none would ask me about this before you, because I have seen your eagerness upon learning hadeeth: The most fortunate of the people to attain my intercession on the day of resurrection will be whoever says: ‘None has the right to be worshipped except Allaah’, sincerely from his heart</span>. &gt;&gt;</strong></span> [[al-Bukhaaree (no. 99)]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ash-Shaafi`ee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Aboo Hurairah was the best memorizer of those who narrated hadeeth in his time</strong></span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…from Hammaam [ibn Munabbih] who said: I heard Aboo Hurairah say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“There is no one from the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) who has more hadeeth than me, except for `Abdullaah ibn `Amr because he used to write, whereas I did not write.”</strong></span> [[al-Bukhaaree (no. 113)]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdul-Waahid ibn Ziyaad and others: `Aasim ibn Kulayb narrated to us: My father narrated to us that he heard Aboo Hurairah, and he used to begin narrating hadeeth by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: &lt;&lt; Who ever lies upon me deliberately, then let him take his place in the Fire. &gt;&gt;”</strong></span> [[Ahmad: (2/413)]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…from Ibn `Umar that he said to Aboo Hurairah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>O Aboo Hurairah! You were the one from us who most closely adhered to Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), and the one from us who best memorized his ahaadeeth</strong></span>.” [[‘Saheeh Sunanit-Tirmidhee (no. 3836)]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Hurairah passed away in the year 58 H, and this was stated by a group; and others said: 59 H; and it was said: 57 H -radiyallaahu `anhu- at the age of 78.”</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">AT-TABAREE:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad ibn Jareer ibn Yazeed, Aboo Ja`far at-Tabaree: “The imaam, the outstanding scholar, the Mujtahid. The scholar of his time: Aboo Ja`far at-Tabaree, the author of excellent works.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was from the people of Aamul in Tabaristaan (a town 80 miles NE of Tehran in Persia). He was born in the year 224 H, and began seeking knowledge after the year 240 H. He travelled greatly and met the preeminent men. He was singular amongst the people of his time in knowledge, intellect and in the great number of his works. It is rare that anyone the like of him is seen&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Khateeb al-Baghdaadee said of him: ‘He gathered such branches of knowledge as were not attained by anyone from the people of his time. He had memorised the Book of Allaah; he was knowledgeable of the different modes of recitation; he had insight of the meaning; he was a learned jurist with regard to the rulings contained in the Qur·aan; he was a scholar of the details of the Sunnah and of its chains of narration; the authentic and the unauthentic; he knew the abrogating texts and the abrogated texts; he was knowledgeable of the sayings of the Companions and the Taabi`een; he was well-acquainted with the past events and history of the peoples, and he compiled the famous book: ‘Narratives and history of the nations’; and he compiled his ‘Tafseer’: the like of which has not been written. He also wrote a book entitled ‘Tahdheeb-Aathaar’, and I have not seen a similar work the like of it, but he did not complete it. He also wrote many books about the principles and details of Fiqh, and his preferred sayings from the sayings of the jurists. He had certain verdicts specific to him which were preserved’.” [‘Siyar A`laamin-Nubalaa·’ of adh-Dhahabee: (14/267-)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning his Tafseer (printed in thirty volumes) Aboo Haamid alIsfaraayeenee said: “If a person were to travel to China to obtain the Tafseer of Muhammad ibn Jareer it would not be too much.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikhul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah said: “As for the Tafseers that the people have with them, then the most authentic of them is the Tafseer of Muhammad ibn Jareer at-Tabaree, because he mentions the sayings reported from the Salaf with established chains of narration, and it does not contain innovation, and he does not report from those accused of being liars such as Muqtaatil ibn Bukayr and al-Kalbee.” [‘Majmoo`ul-Fataawaa’:13/385]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer said, concerning his ‘Tafseer’: “He authored a complete Tafseer which is such that it has no equal,” and concerning him: “He had high standing in worship, zuhd (abstaining from the unnecessary things of this world), piety, and establishing the truth: not being prevented from that by the blame of anyone. He had a fine voice in recitation, along with complete knowledge of the modes of recitation &#8211; upon the finest characteristics. He was one of the major righteous people, and one of the scholars of hadeeth who gathered in Egypt in the time of Ibn Tooloon; and they were: Muhammad ibn Ishaaq ibn Khuzaymah &#8211; the imaam of the imaams, Muhammad ibn Nasr al-Marwazee, Muhammad ibn Haaroon arRuwayaanee, and this one: Muhammad ibn Jareer at-Tabaree…” [‘al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah’ (11/156-)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Firghaanee said: “Muhammad ibn Jareer was of those who did not care about the blame of anyone for Allaah’s sake, along with the very great harm he suffered and the slanders he received from the ignorant, envious and apostates; but as for the people of knowledge and Religion, then they do not deny his knowledge, his abstinence with regard to this world and how he renounced it. He sufficed himself with a small inheritance left for him by his father in Tabaristaan.” And al-Firghaanee said: “I heard him say: “My father’s inheritance has been delayed, so I had to remove the sleeves of my robe and sell them.” [‘Tabaqaatush-Shaafi`iyyah’: (3/120), quoted in Dr. `Abdullaah at-Turkee’s introduction to ‘Jaami`ul-Bayaan’.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was mentioned about him that everyday for forty years he would fill forty pages with his writing; and that he originally proposed dictating his ‘history’ of a length of thirty thousand pages, and his Tafseer of similar length, but was dissuaded by his students and so reduced each of them to a tenth of the intended size, saying: “Indeed we belong to Allaah! Peoples’ eagerness has died!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">as-Suyootee said in ‘al-Itqaan’ (2/476): “So if you were to say: ‘Which of the tafseers do you direct us towards, and tell a person to rely upon?’ Then I say: The tafseer of Aboo Ja`far ibn Jareer at-Tabaree, about which the reputable scholars have agreed that its like has not been written in the field of tafseer. an-Nawawee said in his ‘Tahdheeb’: ‘No one has written the like of the book of Ibn Jareer in tafseer’.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He passed away at the time of Maghrib on the night of the 28th of Shawwal in the year 310 H, at the age of 86 -rahimahullaah.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">AS-SAM`AANEE:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The imaam, the outstanding scholar, the Muftee of Khuraasaan, Shaikh of the Shaafi`ees; Abul-Muzaffar Mansoor ibn Muhammad ibn `Abdil-Jabbaar ibn Ahmad, at-Tameemee, as-Sam`aanee, al-Marwazee, previously alHanafee, then ash-Shaafi`ee. He was born in the year 426 H…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He went out on foot to perform Hajj at a time when riding parties were prevented from travelling, so he and a group of people were captured by brigands. So he bore this with patience until Allaah freed him from these bedouins, and he performed Hajj and accompanied az-Zanjaanee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He used to relate: &lt; They took us captive, so I used to tend their camels. So it happened that their chief wanted to marry off his daughter, so they said: we will have to travel to a town to find someone to perform the marriage for us. So one of their men said: ‘The man who tends our camels is the jurist of Khuraasaan.’ So they asked me about some matters, and I answered them, and I spoke to them in correct Arabic, so they became embarrassed and excused themselves. So I performed the marriage for them, and said the (marriage) address, so they were happy and asked me to accept some reward from that, but I refused. So they conveyed me to Makkah in the middle of the year. &gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdul-Ghaafir said in his ‘Taareekh’: “He was the singular scholar of his age in excellence and behaviour, and in zuhd and piety. He came from a household of knowledge and zuhd. He acquired knowledge of Fiqh from his father, and he became one of the foremost amongst the people of speculation. He then studied the books of hadeeth, performed Hajj and returned, and abandoned the way upon which he had debated for thirty years and became a Shaafi`ee. He manifested this in the year 468 H and the people of Marw were thrown into turmoil and the common folk became perplexed. So letters were sent concerning him by the Ameer of Balkh which spoke harshly against him. So he left Marw in the company of DhulMajdayn Abul-Qaasim al-Moosawee and a group of students, and he was attended to by a number of the jurists. So he went to Toos, and proceeded on to Naysaaboor. So he was met by the students with a great reception in the time of Nizaamul-Mulk, and `Ameedul-Hadrah Aboo Sa`d. So they honoured him and gave him a position of great respect, and a gathering for admonition was established for him in the Shaafi`ee school; and he was an ocean with regard to admonition and he was a great memorizer, so he was greatly accepted by the people. He attained firmness and prominence in the Shaafi`ee madhhab and then he returned to Marw and taught there in the Shaafi`ee school, and an-Nizaam gave him precedence over his peers, and his students became apparent. Then he went off to Asbahaan in a state of high standing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He wrote the book ‘al-Istilaam,’ and the book ‘al-Burhaan,’ and ‘alAmaalee’ in Hadeeth, and he stood firmly with the people of the Hadeeth, the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah; and he was a thorn in the eyes of the opponents, and a proof for the people of the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[His grandson] Aboo Sa`d said: ‘My grandfather wrote a work of Tafseer, and in Fiqh, Usool and Hadeeth. His Tafseer is of three volumes’ … The Imaam Aboo `Alee ibn as-Saffaar said: ‘When I debate with AbulMuzaffar then it is as if I am debating with an imaam from the Taabi`een, because of the signs of the righteous people which I see in him.’ He also said about himself: “I never forgot anything which I had memorized.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230; He died in the year 489 H, having lived for sixty-three years &#8211; rahimahullaah.” [‘Siyar A`laamin-Nubalaa·’ (19/114-119)] Ibn al-`Imaad said about him in ‘Shadharaatudh-Dhahab’ (3/393): “The imaam, the eminent scholar, Abul-Muzaffar as-Sam`aanee Mansoor ibn Muhammad, at-Tameemee, al-Marwazee, al-Hanafee, then ash-Shaafi`ee. He learned Fiqh from this father and from others, and he was the imaam of his age in the madhhab of Aboo Haneefah. But when he performed Hajj, that which necessitated his moving to the madhhab of ash-Shaafi`ee became clear to him in al-Hijaaz. So when he returned to Marw he suffered great harm because of his changing over. He wrote many books regarding the Shaafi`ee madhhab and he wrote in refutation of the opponents, and he wrote ‘at-Tabaqaat’ which he excelled in, and he wrote a good and fine Tafseer…” -rahimahullaah.</p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">AL-BAGHAWEE:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Shaikhul-Islaam, the outstanding exemplary scholar, the Haafiz: ShaikhulIslaam, the reviver of the Sunnah, Aboo Muhammad al-Husayn ibn Mas`ood ibn Muhammad ibn al-Farraa·, al-Baghawee, ash-Shaafi`ee: the scholar of Tafseer; the compiler of works such as ‘Sharhus-Sunnah,’ ‘Ma`aalimut-Tanzeel,’ ‘al-Masaabeeh’ and the book ‘at-Tahdheeb’ upon the madhhab, and ‘al-Jam`u baynas-Saheehayn,’ and ‘al-Arba`eena hadeethan’ and other works.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He acquired knowledge of Fiqh from the Shaikh of the Shaafi`ees al-Qaadee Husayn ibn Muhammad al-Marwaroodhee, the author of ‘at-Ta`leeqah,’ before the year 460 H….</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Baghawee was given the title ‘Muhiyyus-Sunnah’ (the reviver of the Sunnah), and the ‘the pillar of the Religion’, and he was a person of nobility and an Imaam. He was a person of knowledge and outstanding scholar. He abstained from the superfluous things of this world and was satisfied with a little. He used to eat dry bread on its own, but was criticised by people for that, so he began accompanying it with oil. His father used to make and sell fur garments (al-Farraa·). He was granted blessing in his writings, and granted complete acceptance with regard to them: this was on account of his fine resolve, and true and sincere intention. The scholars vied in acquiring his works, and he would not deliver a lesson except in a state of purification. He was moderate in his dress: he wore a crude robe, and a small turban &#8211; upon the way of the Salaf- which he wore and tied as they did. He was firmly established in Tafseer, and fully proficient in Fiqh -may Allaah have mercy upon him…” [‘Siyar A`laamin-Nubalaa·’ of adh-Dhahabee: (19/439-)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was born in the town of Bagh (30 miles NW of Herat in Afghanistan) in Khuraasaan, and travelled throughout Khuraasaan seeking knowledge, finally settling in Marw ar-Roodh (SE Turkmenistan) where he taught and compiled his works, and died in the year of 516 H at over eighty years of age.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer said: “…He excelled in the branches of knowledge, and he was the foremost scholar of his time in them. He adhered to the Religion, was pious, a ‘zaahid,’ and a righteous worshipper.” -rahimahullaah. [‘al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah (12/206).’]</p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">IBN KATHEER:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“He is Abul-Fidaa·, `Imaadud-Deen, Ismaa`eel ibn (ash-Shaikh Abee Hafs Shihaabud-Deen) `Umar &#8211; who was the ‘khateeb of his village &#8211; ibn Katheer ibn Daw· ibn Katheer ibn Zar’ al-Qurashee, al-Basrawee in origin, adDimashqee with regard to his upbringing, nurturing and education. He was born in the town of Mijdal, in the district of the town of Busraa, to the [north-] east of Damascus, in the year of 701 H, and his father was a khateeb. His father died when he was four years old, so he was brought up by his brother, the Shaikh `Abdul-Wahhaab, and he learned Fiqh from him at the beginning of his affair.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he moved to Damascus in the year 706 H, at the age of five. He then acquired knowledge of Fiqh from Shaikh Burhaanuddeen Ibraaheem ibn</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdur-Rahmaan al-Fazaaree, well known as Ibn al-Firkaah &#8211; who died in the year 729 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also heard in Damascus from `Eesaa ibn al-Muta&#8220;im, and from Ahmad ibn Abee Taalib &#8211; who lived more than a hundred years and who was well known as Ibnush-Shihnah, and also known as al-Hajjaar -who died in year 730 H. Also from al-Qaasim ibn `Asaakir, and Ibnush-Sheeraazee, Ishaaq ibn al-Aamidee, and Muhammad ibn Zarraad. He closely accompanied the Shaikh Jamaaluddeen Yoosuf ibn az-Zakiyy al-Mizzee &#8211; the author of ‘Tahdheebul-Kamaal’ and ‘Atraaful-Kutubis-Sittah’ who died in the year 742 H; and he greatly benefited from him and became proficient in knowledge, and he married his daughter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also studied a great deal with Shaikhul-Islaam Taqiyyuddeen Ibn Taimiyyah, who died in the year 728 H. He closely accompanied him, loved him and benefited from his knowledge. He also studied with the Shaikh, the Haafiz, the historian Shamsuddeen adh-Dhahabee Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Qaaymaaz, who died in the year 748 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was granted ‘ijaazah’ (permission to narrate) in Egypt by Aboo Moosaa al-Qaraafee, and al-Husaynee, and `Alee ibn `Umar al-Waanee, Yoosuf alHutanee and others. Al-Haafiz Shamsuddeen adh-Dhahabee said of him in ‘al-Mu`jamulMukhtass’: “The imaam, the muftee, the outstanding muhaddith, the precise jurist, the critical and precise scholar of tafseer. He has a number of beneficial works.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajr said of him in ‘ad-Durarul-Kaaminah’: “He became occupied with hadeeth, carefully studying its texts and narrators. He could quote a great deal from memory and was delightful in speech. His works spread widely in his lifetime, and people benefited from them after his death. He was not upon the way of those muhadditheen who merely seek briefer chains of narration, and seek to distinguish shorter from longer chains of narration and other such disciplines of theirs; rather he was from the jurists of the muhadditheen.’…”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“His works included:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) ‘Tafseerul-Qur·aanil-Kareem,’ and it was one of the most beneficial books of tafseer based upon narrations. He would explain the Qur·aan with the Qur·aan, and then with the famous ahaadeeth from the dependable sources of the muhadditheen &#8211; along with their chains of narration. He discussed the chains of narration with the terms of rejection and acceptance, and made clear anything the narrations contained with regard to strangeness, being contrary to what is authentic, or confliction with the reliable reports. Then he would mention the reported sayings from the Companions and the Taabi`een.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Suyootee said: “The like of it, similar in form, has not been written.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) His history entitled ‘al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah,’ in which he mentioned the stories of the Prophets and the previous nations, based upon what occurs in the Noble Qur·aan and the authentic narrations…then he carefully detailed the Prophetic Seerah, and the history of Islaam to his time. Then he went on to mention the tribulations, signs of the Last Hour, the forthcoming battles and the conditions in the Hereafter….</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He died on Thursday, the 26th of Sha`baan in the year 774 H, at the age of 74; and al-Haafiz Ibn Hajr said: He lost his eyesight at the end of his life &#8211; rahimahullaah wa radiyallaahu `anhu.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from the introduction to ‘al-Baa`ithul-Hatheeth’; the biography was compiled by Shaikh Muhammad `Abdur-Razzaaq Hamzah.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-`Imaad said in ‘Shadharaatudh-Dhahab’ (6/231/232): “…He had many students; from them was Ibn Hajjee who said about him: ‘He was the greatest memorizer of the texts of hadeeth that we have come across, and the one best acquainted with their defects, and their narrators, and the authentic and the unauthentic from them, and his peers and his Shaikhs acknowledged that for him. I do not think, despite the frequency with which I went to him, that I ever met him except I took benefit from him.’ Others, as Qaadee Shahbah mentioned in his ‘Tabaqaat’ stated that he was a particularly close student of Ibn Taimiyyah, and used to defend him and follow many of his views; and he used to give verdict with his view regarding divorce, and he was put to trial because of it and suffered harm. He died in Sha`baan, and was buried…next to his Shaikh, Ibn Taimiyyah.” -rahimahullaah.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">ASH-SHAWKAANEE:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad ibn `Alee ibn Muhammad ibn `Abdullaah, ash-Shawkaanee, then as-San`aanee [the capital of Yemen]. He was born on Monday the 28th of Dhul-Qa`dah in 1173 H in the town of Hijrah Shawkaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He grew up in the manner of students of legislated knowledge, memorizing the Qur·aan and becoming proficient in it, and he memorized many of the texts before he began serious study by the age of ten. Then he sat with the major Shaikhs, and he greatly occupied himself with studying history in the sciences of the language. His father did not allow him to occupy himself with other than knowledge, nor to leave San`aa. He sat to deliver verdicts at the age of twenty, and he had thirteen lessons each day: some he delivered, and others he studied with his Shaikhs. [‘al-Badrut-Taali`’: (2/215, 218-219)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He authored 278 works, including works of Tafseer, Fiqh, Usoolul-Fiqh, the `Aqeedah of the Salaf, and in refutation of blind-following (taqleed). al-`Allaamah Hasan ibn Ahmad al-Bahkalee said…: (start of quote): “In the year 1250 H, in the month of Jumaadal-Aakhirah, our Shaikh Muhammad ibn `Alee ash-Shawkaanee passed away. He was the judge of the whole community, Shaikhul-Islaam, the verifier, the `Allaamah, the imaam, sultaan of the scholars, imaam of the world….</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in summary, he did not see anyone the like of himself; nor did he see anyone who had seen the like of him in knowledge, piety and establishment of the truth with strength of spirit and eloquence of tongue…. He was born on Monday, the 28th of the sacred month of Dhul-Qa`dah in the year 1172 H….</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He studied under his father, and studied continuously under the Qaadee, imaam of the details of Fiqh in his time Ahmad ibn Muhammad alHaraazee, and he derived benefit from him in Fiqh… He learned Arabic grammar and morphology from as-Sayyid al-`Allaamah Ismaa`eel ibn Hasan, and al-`Allaamah `Abdullaah ibn Ismaa`eel an-Nahmee, and al- `Allaamah al-Qaasim ibn Muhammad al-Khawlaanee… and in many of the branches of knowledge he studied constantly with the reviver of his time as Sayyid `Abdul-Qaadir ibn Ahmad al-Kawkabaanee; and in the science of hadeeth he took from al-Haafiz `Alee ibn Ibraaheem ibn `Aamir, and from other Shaikhs besides them….</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He authored magnificent, delightful, beneficial, and useful works in most branches of knowledge; from them ‘Naylul-Awtaar’ &#8211; a commentary upon ‘Muntaqal-Akhbaar’ of [Majduddeen `Abdus-Salaam] Ibn Taimiyyah &#8211; rahimahullaah- in four volumes the like of which is not to be seen in these times with regard to its careful verification and precision. He gave each matter its due right, with justice and fairness; and did not adhere to blindfollowing. He quoted the positions of the later scholars and of the Predecessors. His noble Shaikhs and other prominent scholars related it from him, and it spread throughout the lands in his lifetime. It was read to him many times, and the scholars derived benefit from it; and it was the only one out of his works that he was personally satisfied with, because of its high level of accuracy, and its close adherence to proof in the best manner. He wrote it during the lifetime of his Shaikhs, and they were able to point out certain points, which he edited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also wrote the large Tafseer entitled ‘Fathul-Qadeer’ which combined the sciences of narration of hadeeth, and its understanding… … And I [i.e. his student Hasan ibn Ahmad al-Bahkalee] learned from him in many of the fields of knowledge, and I took from him most of his noble works, and with his death the shining lamp of Yemen was extinguished for them; and I do not think that in precision and verification they will see the like of him.” (end of quote.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Lord of creation, the One free of all imperfections-blessed this Qaadee and Imaam from the vast ocean of His Generosity with three things which I do not know to have been combined in these later times for anyone besides him: Firstly: Vast and deep knowledge of all the different branches, types and forms of knowledge; secondly: the great number of students he had who were verifiers, people of nobility and precision: people of discerning intellect, and outstanding virtues…; thirdly: the great number of his skilled and precise works, and his intricate treatises and responses which in their number outstripped great scholars, and whose precision and exactness reached every possible limit…”-rahimahullaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[‘at-Taajul-Mukallal’ (pp.452-461) of `Allaamah Siddeeq Hasan Khaan alQanoojee; and the introduction to ‘Fathul-Qadeer.’]</p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>AS-SA`DEE:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Ash-Shaikh Aboo `Abdillaah `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Naasir ibn `Abdillaah ibn Naasir Aal-Sa`dee, from the tribe of Tameem. He was born in the town of `Unayzah in the district of al-Qaseem [Saudi Arabia], on the 12th of Muharram 1307 H and his mother died when he was four years old. Then his father died when he was seven years old, so he grew up as an orphan. However he had a fine up bringing and it was noticed that from an early age he was distinguished by intelligence and a desire to learn. He read the whole Qur·aan after the death of his father and then memorized it completely, and he was fully proficient in it at the age of eleven. Then he occupied himself with acquiring knowledge from the scholars of his land, and from those who came to his land. So he strove and exerted himself until he acquired a good portion of every branch of knowledge. Upon reaching the age of twentythree he sat to teach. So he would learn and also teach, and spend all of his time in that. This continued until the year 1350 H, when he took charge of all teaching in his town, and all students referred back to him. He took knowledge from Shaikh Ibraaheem ibn Hamd ibn Jaasir, and he was the first teacher he studied with. He described his Shaikh as a memorizer of hadeeth, and he would speak about his piety and how he used to love and take care of the poor. Often a poor person would come to him in winter and he would take off one of his two garments and give it to the poor person, even though he himself needed it and possessed very little himself &#8211; rahimahullaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from his Shaikhs was Muhammad ibn `Abdul-Kareem ash-Shibl, with whom he learned Fiqh, sciences of Arabic language and other than that. He also studied with ash-Shaikh Saalih ibn `Uthmaan al-Qaadee, the judge of `Unayzah. He learnt from him Tawheed, Tafseer, Fiqh: its Usool and its details, and the sciences of the Arabic language. He was the one whom he studied with the most, and he kept his company constantly until he passed away -rahimahullaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also studied with Shaikh `Abdullaah ibn `Aayid, and Shaikh Sa`b alQuwayjaree, and Shaikh `Alee as-Sinaanee, and Shaikh `Alee an-Naasir Aboo Waadee with whom he studied hadeeth, and took the six books and others from him with ‘ijaazah’ (permission to narrate).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also studied with Shaikh Muhammad ibn ash-Shaikh `Abdul-`Azeez Aal Muhammad al-Maani` (the director of cultural/educational affairs in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia at present); he studied with him in `Unayzah. Also from his Shaikhs was Shaikh Muhammad ash-Shanqeetee (who settled in the Hijaaz…) when he came to teach in `Unayzah. He studied with him Tafseer, Hadeeth, the sciences of Hadeeth, and the sciences of the language &#8211; such as grammar, morphology and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was upon a high level of virtuous manners, showing humility with the young and the old, and the rich and the poor. He used to spend some of his time sitting in gatherings with whoever wished to attend, so the gathering would be a gathering of knowledge. He was keen that these gatherings should discuss matters of knowledge and social affairs, and the people of the gatherings would derive great benefit from the useful discussions they involved themselves in. So their recreational gatherings were turned into gatherings of worship and knowledge. He would speak to each person with whatever befitted him, and would discuss with him matters that would be beneficial to his worldly life and his Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would frequently resolve dispute in a just manner which satisfied both sides.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He had great concern for the poor, the needy, and strangers and he would personally assist them as far as he was able, and he would encourage the wealthy people &#8211; those whom he knew to love doing good &#8211; to be compassionate towards them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was upon a very high level of good manners, chastity, purity of spirit, and firmly resolved and serious in all his affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was also the best of people in his manner of teaching, and the best at causing his students to understand…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He occupied himself most of all and benefited most from the books of Shaikhul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah and his student Ibnul-Qayyim. This benefited him greatly with regard to knowledge of Usool, Tawheed, Tafseer, and Fiqh and other branches of beneficial knowledge…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was especially proficient in Tafseer, having read a number of Tafseers and excelling in it. He authored a fine Tafseer, in a number of volumes…entitled ‘Tayseerul-Kareemir-Rahmaan fee Tafseer KalaamilMannaan’.… He passed away at the age of 69 in the year 1376 in the town of `Unayzah &#8211; rahimahullaah…”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">1. HIS LINEAGE:</span></strong> He was Aboo Muhammad, `Abdullaah ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Qudaamah ibn Miqdaam ibn Nasr ibn `Abdillaah ibn Hudhayfah ibn Muhammad ibn Ya`qoob ibn al-Qaasim ibn Ibraaheem ibn Ismaa`eel ibn Yahyaa ibn Muhammad ibn Saalim ibn `Abdillaah ibn `Umar ibn al-Khattaab-radiyallaahu `anhumaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Qurashee; al-Maqdisee; al-Jammaa`eelee; then ad-Dimashqee; as-Saalihee; al-Hanbalee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Qurashee:</strong> He was from the tribe of Quraysh, since he was descended from `Umar-radiyallaahu `anhu &#8211; who was `Adawee (i.e. from the sub-tribe of Banoo `Adiyy who were part of Quraysh).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Maqdisee:</strong> His family&#8217;s ascription to &#8216;Baytul-Maqdis&#8217; (Jerusalem) since they lived close to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Jammaa`eelee:</strong> In ascription to the village of Jammaa`eel where he was born; and it is a village on the hills of Nablus &#8211; a city about 40 miles north of Jerusalem in present day occupied Palestine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>ad-Dimashqee:</strong> In ascription to Damascus (in Syria) which is where his family migrated to, and where he lived for most of his life, and where he died.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>as-Saalihee:</strong> In ascription to the mosque of as-Saalihiyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His brother Shaykh Aboo `Umar said: <em>&#8220;They ascribe us to &#8216;as-Saalihiyyah&#8217; because we settled at the mosque of Aboo Saalih, not that we were righteous people (saalihoon).&#8221;</em> [And this is from piety since they were indeed a family of righteousness and rectification].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Hanbalee:</strong> In ascription to the Hanbalee madhhab, i.e. that he learned and was an expert in the madhhab, i.e. that he learned and was an expert in the principles and details of Fiqh followed by the students of Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal. [and he was not a blind follower].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">2. HIS BIRTH:</span></strong> He was born in the month of Sha`baan in the year 541H in the town of Jammaa`eel.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">3. HIS FAMILY:</span></strong> He was from a family who were noble in their lineage, their knowledge, and their piety.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>His father:</strong> Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Qudaamah was born in 491H and died in 558H. [He had his son at the age of 50]. He was one of the righteous scholars; famous for knowledge, zuhd and worship. He was the Khateeb of the mosque of Jammaa`eel. He educated his children and taught them the Qur&#8217;aan, and the hadeeth, and correct manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He died when Imaam Muwaffaqud-Deen was about 17 years old, so his elder son Muhammad ibn Ahmad &#8211; who was known as Aboo `Umar &#8211; continued his upbringing and education.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">4. HIS EARLY YEARS, AND HIS SEEKING KNOWLEDGE, AND HIS TRAVELLING TO SEEK KNOWLEDGE:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For the first ten years of his life he remained with his family in Palestine, and he began memorization of the Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then in 551H, when he was 10 years old, his father performed Hijrah (migration) with the family, fleeing from the invading Christians, and migrated to Damascus.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Damascus he completed memorization of the Qur&#8217;aan, and he memorized a large number of ahaadeeth. Then he memorized &#8216;Mukhtasar al-Khiraqee&#8217;-on the Fiqh of Imaam Ahmad. (Then later in life he wrote an explanation of it in 9 volumes, called al-Mughnee).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He remained in Damascus for 10 years, and at the age of twenty he undertook his first journey in search of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-In 561H: he travelled to the main city of knowledge and of the scholars at that time- Baghdaad. He was accompanied by his maternal cousin al-Haafidh `Abdul-Ghanee al- Maqdisee;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He inclined towards the study of Fiqh and his cousin towards hadeeth, however they accompanied each other to the lectures and acquired both;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There he studied with many of the scholars, amongst them: Shaykh `Abdul-Qaadir al-Jeelaanee (D. 561H), Ibnul-Battee, and Ibnul-Manniyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He remained in Baghdaad for four years. He studied &#8216;Mukhtasar al-Khiraqee&#8217; under `Abdul-Qaadir al-Jeelaanee, and then the Shaykh died 50 nights after his arrival; then they studied under Ibnul-Jawzee; then he remained with Ibnul-Manniyy, and learned the Fiqh of the Hanbalee madhhab with him, and its principles, and the different sayings of the scholars- and he excelled in that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then returned to Damascus.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; In 567H he again travelled to Baghdaad where he remained for a year seeking knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; In 573H he travelled to Makkah to perform Hajj, and he met the people of knowledge there; amongst them al-Mubaarak ibn at-Tabbaakh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then after performing Hajj in 574: &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; Then from Makkah he travelled to Baghdaad &#8211; where he again remained for a year seeking knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; Then from Baghdaad he returned to Damascus where he started to write works on many branches of knowledge, the most famous of his works being &#8216;al-Mughnee.&#8217;</p>

8. Shaykh Badr ibn `Abdillaah al-Badr (hafidahullaah) in his introduction to his checking of Ibn Qudaamah&#8217;s book &#8216;Ithbaat Sifaat-`Uluww&#8217; gathers a list of his Shaykhs numbering 67, and then said: &#8220;and many others besides them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">6. HIS STUDENTS: </span></strong>Amongst them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. al-Bahaa.ul-Maqdisee (d. 624H) who wrote &#8216;al-`Uddah Sharh al-`Umdah.&#8217;<br />
2. Diyaa.ud-Deen al-Maqdisee (d. 643H)<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">7. HIS PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION AND CHARACTERISTICS:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His student ad-Diyaa. al-Maqdisee said: &#8220;He was of full height, white, with a bright face, large distinct eyes; he was so handsome that it was as if his face was radiating light; he had a broad forehead and a long beard; a straight nose and his eyebrows joined. He had a small head, slender arms and legs; and a thin body; and full senses and faculties. He was extremely intelligent; and behaved in a fine manner&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibnul-Najjaar said: &#8220;al-Muwaffaq was the Imaam of the Hanbalees in the main congregational mosque of Damascus. He was fully reliable, an evidence (in narrating), noble. He had plentiful virtues; and he kept away from anything not befitting; he was pious, a worshipper.He was upon the way of the Salaf. Light and dignity could be seen upon him. A man would take benefit from seeing him even before hearing his speech.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer said: &#8220;He used to engage in optional prayers between the two night prayers (i.e. Maghrib and `Ishaa.) close to his place of prayer. Then when he had prayed the `Ishaa. prayer he would return to his house of the street of ad-Duwalla`ee by the bank of the river. He would take back with him those he could from the poor and needy, and they would eat with him, and his primary house was upon Qaasiyyoon&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ad-Diyaa. said: &#8220;He was fine in his manners: he would hardly ever be seen except that he was smiling. He would relate incidents and joke. I heard al-Bahaa. say; When the people read with him he would joke with us, and be cheerful and at ease. Once they complained to him about some children who studied with him, so he said; &#8220;They are children. They have to have some play, and you used to be just like them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And al-Bahaa. described him as being courageous, and said: &#8220;He used to go forward to the enemy, and he was wounded upon his hand; and he used to take part when the army and the enemy were firing at each other.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ad-Diyaa. said: &#8220;He used to pray with &#8216;Khushoo`&#8217; (humility and attentiveness). He would hardly ever pray the Sunnah prayer before Fajr and after `Ishaa. except in his house; and between the two night prayers he used to pray four rak`ahs, reciting: &#8216;as-Sajdah,&#8217; &#8216;Yaaseen,&#8217; &#8216;ad-Dukhaan,&#8217; and &#8216;Tabaarak.&#8217; He would hardly miss out on them. He used to stand in prayer in the last hours of the night reciting 1/7th of the Qur&#8217;aan. He would sometimes raise his voice and he had a beautiful voice.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">8. SCHOLARS&#8217; PRAISE OF HIM:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The very scholar of hadeeth, Aboo `Amr ibn as-Salaah said: &#8220;I have not seen the like of al-Muwaffaq.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Bakr ibn Ghaneemah &#8211; the muftee of Baghdaad &#8211; said: &#8220;I do not know anyone in our time who has reached the level of ijtihaad except for al-Muwaffaq.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sibt ibn al-Jawzee said: &#8220;He was an Imaam in many fields. After his brother Aboo `Umar and al-`Imaad, there was no one in his time who had greater &#8216;zuhd&#8217; or piety than him. He had a great deal of &#8216;hayaa.&#8217; (sense of shame), and he remained aloof from this world and its people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was easy and mild-mannered, humble, and he had love for the poor. He was fine in manners, generous and giving, whoever saw him then it was as if he had seen one of the Companions; and it was as if light came from his face. He was plentiful in worship.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah said: &#8220;After al-Awzaa`ee no one entered Shaam having more Fiqh knowledge and understanding of the religion than al-Muwaffaq.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ad-Diyaa. al-Maqdisee said: &#8220;He was an Imaam with regard to the Qur&#8217;aan and its explanation; an Imaam in the knowledge of hadeeth and its problematic matters; an Imaam in Fiqh &#8211; indeed the outstanding scholar of his time in that; an Imaam of knowledge of the disagreements of scholars; the outstanding scholar of his time in Laws of Inheritance; an Imaam in Usoolul-Fiqh; an Imaam in Arabic Grammar; an Imaam in mathematics; an Imaam in the movements and positions of stars and planets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Rajab al-Hanbalee said: &#8220;The Faqeeh, the Zaahid, the Imaam. Shaykhul-Islaam. The singular exception scholar.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Haafidh ibn Katheer said: &#8220;Shaykhul-Islaam. An Imaam. An outstanding scholar. There was not in his time, indeed even for a long time before him, anyone having greater knowledge of Fiqh than him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Rajab said: &#8220;He used to closely follow the texts in the matter of al-Usool (fundamentals and belief) and in other than it. He did not hold applying any acts of worship for which there was no narration. He used to order affirmation of the texts, and leaving them as they are &#8211; with regard to what occurs in the Book and the Sunnah from &#8216;as-Sifaat&#8217; (Allaah&#8217;s Attributes): Not altering them, not declaring how they are, not distorting the meaning; not interpreting them away with &#8216;ta&#8217;weel,&#8217; and not negating them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">9. HIS DEATH:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He died (rahimahullaah) on Saturday, the day of `Eidul-Fitr, in 620H, at the age of 79 in his home in Damascus. His funeral which had a huge attendance was held the next day and he was buried on the hill of Qaasiyyoon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">10. HIS WIFE, SLAVE-GIRLS AND CHILDREN:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He married his paternal cousin Maryam bint Abee Bakr ibn `Abdillaah ibn Sa`d al-Maqdisee. They had a number of children: (al-Majd) `Eesaa, Muhammad, Yahyaa, Safiyyah, and Faatimah. Then he took a slave girl, and then another. Then he married `Izziyyah- who died before him. All his sons died in his lifetime, and none of them had offspring except for `Eesaa- who had two righteous sons, however both of them died without any offspring. So the Shaykh had no remaining progeny.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">11. HIS WORKS:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dr. `Alee ibn Sa`eed al-Ghaamidee lists his work and they come to 38 in number.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>Died 1377H: Imaam Ahmad bin Muhammad Shaakir</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;">Author: Dr. Badee&#8217; Al-Lahaam</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"> Source: His editing of the book &#8220;Al-Ba&#8217;ith-ul-Hatheeth&#8221;</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"> Produced By: Al-Ibaanah.com</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was <strong>Ahmad Ibn Muhammad Shaakir</strong> bin Ahmad bin &#8216;Abdil-Qaadir. His lineage traces back to <span style="color:#993300;">Al-Husayn bin &#8216;Alee</span>, may Allaah be pleased with them both. He was born and died in Cairo, Egypt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His father, <strong>Shaikh Muhammad Shaakir</strong>, was among the men responsible for passing judgements (qadaa) and religious rulings (fatwa). He assumed the position of Chief Judge of Sudan in 1900. So while residing there, he enrolled his son, Ahmad, in the Ghawrdoon School. Then in the year 1904, Ahmad enrolled in the Institute of Alexandria (in Egypt) and then joined the Al-Azhar University, attaining the level of scholarly grade in 1917.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then took on some judicial positions. Then he was appointed judge and head of the highest religious court, in which position he served until 1951, when he retired with a pension.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He had a strong love for the <strong>subject of Hadeeth</strong>, such that he took an interest in its books (i.e. collections of Hadeeth) since 1909. And that was under the direction and instruction of his father. He obtained ijaazahs (written approvals) on Hadeeth from &#8216;Abdullaah bin Idrees As-Sanoosee, the Scholar and Muhaddith of Morocco, and from Ahmad bin ash-Shams Ash-Shanqeetee. He also learned under Shaikh Taahir Al-Jazaa&#8217;iree Al-Atharee and other scholars, whose specialization was the Prophetic Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Ahmad took on the role of working on a number of these books of the Sunnah. Among these books was the <b>Musnad</b> of Imaam Ahmad, which he worked on, covering close to a third of it, but without completing it. Also, he worked on <b>Sunan At-Tirmidhee</b> of which two volumes got printed. He also worked on <b>Saheeh Ibn Hibbaan</b>, of which the first volume was printed, and he wrote a valuable introduction for it. He also edited the book <b>Ar-Risaalah</b> of Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee, and the methodology he employed in verifying and checking it is considered an example to be followed. He also wrote an explanation of the book <b>&#8220;Ikhtisaar &#8216;Uloom Al-Hadeeth&#8221;</b> of Ibn Katheer, which is the present book. He also participated in the verification and checking (tahqeeq) of a number of books like <b>Sharh Sunan Abee Dawood</b>, <b>Kitaab Jamaa&#8217;ul-&#8216;Ilm</b> of Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee, <b>Al-Muhallaa</b> of Ibn Hazm, <b>Tafseer At-Tabaree</b> and others. He also wrote an excellent explanation to the <b>Alfiyyah</b> of Imaam Suyootee concerning Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His brother, Mahmood, said: &#8220;As for the most important book he wrote, then it was <b>&#8220;Nidhaam At-Talaaq&#8221;</b>, which shows his Ijtihaad and his lack of fanaticism towards one particular madh-hab.

<p style="text-align:justify;">He is <strong>Saalih bin Fawzaan bin ‘Abdillaah Aali Fawzaan</strong> from the people of Shamaasiyyah from the tribe of Dawaasir. He was born in 1354H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>His Upbringing and Education:</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His father passed away while he was young. So he was brought up in his household and learned the noble Qur’aan. He also learned the basics of reading and writing at the hands of the Imaam of the local town’s masjid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then joined the state school in his town in Ash-Shamaasiyyah when it opened in 1369H. He completed his primary education in the Faisaliyah School in Buraidah in 1371H. After this, he joined the educational institute in Buraidah at the time of its inception in 1373H and graduated from it in 1377H. Then he joined the College of Sharee’ah in Riyadh and graduated from there in 1381H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>His Advanced Studies:</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He achieved his Masters Degree in the subject of Fiqh</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He obtained his Doctorates Degree also in Fiqh. He received both of these degrees from the College of Sharee’ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>The Positions he was Given and Some of his Duties:</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was appointed a primary school teacher in 1372H before he joined the educational institute in Buraidah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was appointed a teacher in the educational institute in Riyadh after graduating from the College of Sharee’ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was then appointed a teacher in the College of Sharee’ah and then in the advanced studies of the College of Usool-ud-Deen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he taught at the advanced institute of judicial education, and later became a director there in 1396H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then went back to teaching there one more time after his scheduled period of administration came to an end.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was then appointed to the Council of Senior Scholars in 1407H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After this, he was appointed a member of the Permanent Committee of Educational Research and Religious Verdicts in 1411H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is also still a member of the Fiqh Assembly of Makkah which falls under the World Muslim League.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was a former member of the Supervisory Council for Callers during Hajj.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<p><strong>His Name, Kunyah, Nickname and Lineage</strong></p>
</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was the noble Imaam, the Haafidh, the Critic, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Zayn-ud-Deen</strong></span> ‘Abdur-Rahmaan bin Ahmad bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan bin Al Hasan bin Mohammad bin Abil Barakaat Mas’ood As-Salaamee Al Baghdaadee (due to his place of birth), Al Hanbalee (due to his Madh-hab), Ad-Dimashqee (due to his place of residence and death).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His Kunyah was <strong>Abul Faraj</strong>, and his nickname was Ibn Rajab, which was the nickname of his grandfather who was born in that month (of Rajab).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>His Birth and Upbringing</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was born in Baghdad in 736H and was raised by a knowledgeable family, firmly rooted in knowledge, nobility and righteousness. His father played the greatest role in directing him towards the beneficial knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>His Teachers</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He learned and took knowledge from the greatest scholars of the Ummah during his time. In Damascus, he studied under:</p>
<p>1. Ibnul Qayyim Al Jawziyyah,<br />
2. Zayn-ud-Deen Al ‘Iraaqee,<br />
3. Ibn An-Naqeeb,<br />
4. Mohammad bin Isma’eel Al Khabaaz,<br />
5. Dawood bin Ibraaheem Al ‘Ataar,<br />
6. Ibn Qaadee Al Jabal,<br />
7. Ahmad bin ‘Abdil Haadee Al Hanbalee.</p>
<p><strong>In Makkah, he heard from:</strong></p>
<p>8. Al Fakhr ‘Uthmaan bin Yoosuf An-Nuwayree.</p>
<p><strong>While in Jerusalem, he heard from:</strong></p>
<p>9. Al Haafidh Al ‘Alaa’ee.</p>
<p><strong>In Egypt, he heard from:</strong></p>
<p>10. Sadr-ud-Deen Abul Fath Al Maydoomee,<br />
11. Naasir-ud-Deen bin Al Mulook.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Educational Positions he was appointed to</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Rajab devoted himself to knowledge and spent all his time in researching, writing, authoring, teaching, working in the field of knowledge and issuing legal rulings. He was given a teaching position in the Hanbalee School in 791H but then it was taken from him. During the lifetime of his father, he was appointed the Halaqah (study circle) on Tuesday in the Central Masjid of Banu Umayyah. This was after the death of Ibn Qaadee Al Jabal, may Allaah have mercy on him, in 771H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>His Students</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Students of knowledge turned to Al Haafidh Ibn Rajab (rahimahullaah) to learn under him, benefit from his knowledge and hear his narrations. This was since he was an Imaam in the Science of Hadeeth – both in reporting and investigating. The reason for this was because he spent such a large portion of his time engrossed in that subject that he wasn’t known except through the Hadeeth. There was no one found that was more proficient in it (during his time) besides him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>From the most famous of his students were</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Abul ‘Abbaas Ahmad bin Abee Bakr bin ‘Alee Al Hanbalee, known as Ibn Ar-Risaam [d. 884H],<br />
2. Abul Fadl Ahmad bin Nasr bin Ahmad, the Muftee of the lands of Egypt [d. 844H],<br />
3. Dawood bin Sulaymaan Al Mawsilee [d. 844H],<br />
4. ‘Abdur-Rahmaan bin Ahmad bin Mohammad Al Muqree,<br />
5. Zayn-ud-Deen ‘Abdur-Rahmaan bin Sulaymaan bin Abil Karam, well known as Abu Shi’ar,<br />
6. Abu Dharr Az-Zarkashee [d. 846H],<br />
7. The Judge ‘Alaa-ud-Deen Ibn Al-Lahaam Al Ba’alee [d. 803H],<br />
8. Ahmad bin Sayf-id-Deen Al Hamawee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Scholars’ Praise for Him </strong><em>[This section was added to the translation for additional benefit.]</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qaadee Shuhbah said of him in his biography, as is stated in Al Jawhar-ul-Munaddad (pg. 48): <span style="color:#993300;">“He read and became proficient in the various fields of science. He engrossed himself with the issues of the (Hanbalee) Madh-hab until he mastered it. He devoted himself to the occupation of knowledge of the texts, defects and meanings of the Hadeeth. And he withdrew himself in seclusion in order to write.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hajr said of him in Inbaa-ul-Ghamr: <span style="color:#993300;">“He was highly proficient in the scientific disciplines of Hadeeth in terms of the names of reporters, their biographies, their paths of narration and awareness of their meanings.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibraaheem bin Mohammad Ibn Muflih said of him: <span style="color:#993300;">“He was the Shaykh, the great scholar, the Haafidh, the one who abstained from the worldly life. He was the Shaykh of the Hanbalee Madh-hab and he wrote many beneficial books.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>His Creed</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Rajab (rahimahullaah) treaded the Manhaj of the Salaf with regard to the issues of Eemaan and acquiring knowledge. And he supported it and defended it from the false arguments of the opponents. His books are loaded with that. And he wrote some treatises specifically on this topic such as his book ‘Bayaan Fadlu‘Ilm-is-Salaf ‘alaal-Khalaf.’ However, there can be found traces of Sufism in his books, may Allaah protect him from inclining towards it’s dangerous paths, due to what Allaah has given him from vast knowledge of the Narrations and a clear Salafee Methodology.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>His Madh-hab with regard to the Subsidiary Issues</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Fiqh, he (rahimahullaah) followed the Madh-hab of the venerable Imaam, Ahmad bin Hanbal, may Allaah have mercy on him. He is counted as being one of the major scholars of the (Hanbalee) Madh-hab, and of those who were highly proficient in it. What provides evidence for this is his book: ‘Al Qawaa’id Al Kubraa fil-Furoo&#8217;’ for this is one of his most prominent works on the subject of Fiqh, which shows his vast knowledge on the intricate details of Fiqh issues. This is such that Al Haafidh Ibn Hajr said in his book Ad-Durar: “He did excellent work in it.” And Ibn Qaadee Shuhba and Ibn Muflih said: “It indicates his complete knowledge of the (Hanbalee) Madh-hab.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in Kashf-udh-Dhunoon it states: “It is a book from the marvels of this time. And it is such that he sought to explain much in it. Some claim that he found the scattered principles of Shaykh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah and gathered them together, but that is not the case. Rather, he, may Allaah have mercy on him, was above that. This is what was stated.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al Haafidh Ibn Rajab, may Allaah have mercy on him, was deeply attached to the works of Shaykh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah, for he would issue legal rulings according to them and would constantly reference his books. This is since he served as a student under Ibnul Qayyim Al Jawziyyah, the most outstanding student of Shaykh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah, may Allah have mercy on all of them. But in spite of this, he (rahimahullaah) wasn’t a blind follower or a fanatical adherent (to his teacher). Rather, he would review, authenticate, verify and follow the evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>His Written Works</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al Haafidh Ibn Rajab, may Allaah have mercy on him, was considered one of the most able and famous scholars in his time at writing. Thus, he has numerous and beneficial works on the subjects of Tafseer, Hadeeth, Fiqh, History and Raqaa’iq (Heart-Softening Material). Amongst his books are:<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Haafidh Ibn Ahmed ‘Alee Al-Hakamee [d.1377H] rahimahullaah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>His Birth and Early childhood</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sheikh Haafidh Ibn Ahmed ‘Alee Al-Hakamee (rahimahullaah ta’aala) was one of the scholars from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and one of the most famous of those who lived in the 14th century of Hijrah to come from the southern region of the country.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sheikh Haafidh was born on the 24th of Ramadaan, 1342H (1924) in a coastal village called as-Salaam which lies south of the city of Jaazaan. When he was still just a small boy he moved with his family to the village of Al-Jaadi’, which lies about 6 kilometres east of the city of Saamitah because his father found that farmland and pastures were better there. However, his immediate family continued to commute between the two cities due to extenuating circumstances.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The young Haafidh was raised under the good and righteous guardianship of his father who taught him modesty, purity and good character. Before reaching the age of maturity, he worked as a shepherd herding his fathers’ sheep, which were the most important form of wealth to his family as well as the rest of the people in the society in those days. However, Haafidh differed from the other boys in his village because of his intelligence and his ability to memorize and understand quickly. He learned to write while he still a small boy and he memorized the entire Qur’an by the time he was twelve years old.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Seeking Knowledge and Religious Studies</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the young Haafidh reached the age of seven years, his father put both him and his older brother Muhammad into Qur’an memorization school in Al-Jaadi’. There he read the 30th and 29th parts of the Qur’an to the teacher and afterwards he and his brother finished learning to read the entire Qur’an with the proper rules of recitation in just a few months. Shortly thereafter, he completed memorizing the Qur’an in its entirety.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Next he concentrated on his writing skills until he perfected them and was able to copy the Qur’an with excellent handwriting. At the same time, he and his brother were busy reading and memorizing books of fiqh, inheritance law, hadeeth, tafseer, and Tawheed under the tutelage of their father since there was no one else suitable or trustworthy enough to teach them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the year 1358H (1940) the renowned reformer and great scholar, Sheikh ‘Abdullah Bin Muhammad Bin Hamd Al-Qar’aawee, traveled all the way from Najd to the city of Tihaamah in the southern part of the Kingdom after he heard about the level of ignorance and the spread of innovation in the region. Sheikh Qar’awee’s journey to the south had been in conjunction with the consultation of the Grand Muftee of Saudi Arabia at that time, Sheikh Muhammad Ibraheem Aala-Sheikh (rahimahullaah ta’aala). Sheikh Al-Qar’aawee vowed to shoulder the responsibility of calling to the true religion (of Islam) and correcting the beliefs in ‘Aqeedah (the Islamic belief) and the superstitions that were stuck in the minds of the ignorant people in the region.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In 1359H (1941) Haafidh’s older brother Muhammad went to Sheikh Al-Qar’aawee with a letter from the both of them requesting some books on Tawheed and expressing their regret at being unable to come (and study with him) because they were busy serving and seeing to their parents needs. They also requested that the Sheikh visit their village so that they might listen to some of his lessons. Sheikh Al-Qar’aawee accepted their invitation and went to their village where he met the young Haafidh and got to know him very well and saw in him promising signs of excellence and intelligence – which turned out to be a very accurate evaluation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sheikh Al-Qar’aawee remained in Al-Jaadi’ (their village) for a number of days teaching, and a group of elders as well as some youth from the local people attended the lectures. Amongst them was the young Haafidh who was the youngest of them in age, yet the fastest of them in memorizing and understanding the information given.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sheikh Al-Qar’aawee said about him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘And thus it was that I stayed a number of days in Al-Jaadi’. Haafidh attended the lessons and if he missed anything then he would get it from his classmates. He is like his name Haafidh (which means: one who memorizes), he preserves things (accurately) by heart as well as with his note taking. I used to dictate to all of the students and then explain the lesson and the older students used to ask him if they had trouble understanding something or (if they missed) writing something in their notes.’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Sheikh Al-Qar’aawee was ready to return to the city of Saamitah – which by this time he had already made his dwelling place and the centre for his da’wah activities – he asked the young Haafidh’s parents to permit him to employ someone to herd their sheep on Haafidh’s behalf in exchange for their permission that Haafidh and his older brother return with him to Saamitah so that they might seek knowledge there underneath his tutelage. But Haafidh’s parents refused the Sheikh’s request at first, insisting that their youngest son remain with them because of their great need for him. However, Allah decreed the life of Haafidh’s mother would end during the month of Rajab in the year 1360H (1942), so Haafidh’s father then allowed him and his brother Muhammad to study with the Sheikh two or three days a week and then return to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Haafidh began to study in Saamitah with the Sheikh who would dictate lessons to him after which he would return to his village. Haafidh was an inspired student who understood and memorized everything that he read or heard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sadly his father did not live long after that as he died on his way back from Hajj in the same year 1360H (1942). After that, Haafidh was able to study and gain knowledge (full time) so he went to his Sheikh and stayed with him, always learning and benefitting from him. Haafidh proved to be an exceptionally gifted student who learned very quickly. He was also very good at poetry and prose and he (eventually) authored many books in the major categories of Islamic knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Haafidh was only nineteen years old, Sheikh Al-Qar’aawee asked him to write a book about Tawheed and the ‘Aqeedah of the Salaf-us-Saalih (The Pious Predecessors), that would be easy for students to memorize, and that would also demonstrate just how much he has benefited from his reading and studying. The young Haafidh responded by writing a treatise in didactic prose entitled Sullam-al-Wusool ilaa ‘Ilm-il-Usool fee At-Tawheed (The means of arriving at the knowledge of the fundamentals of Tawheed) which he completed in the year 1362H (1944), and which met with the avid approval of his teacher as well as the other prominent scholars of his time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He followed this work other writings also in didactic prose on Tawheed, hadeeth terminology, fiqh, principles of fiqh, inheritance law, the biography of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم), and others, all o fwhich were originally published with the help of King Sa’ood Ibn ‘Abdul-’Azeez (rahimahullaah ta’aala).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It becomes clear for us through what Sheikh Haafidh Al-Hakamee left behind for us from his writings that he was profoundly affected by reading books that were written by the scholars of the Salaf about tafseer, hadeeth, fiqh, principles of fiqh, Islamic manners, Arabic language and grammar. As for ‘Aqeedah, then he was obviously very influenced by the writings of Sheikh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymeeyah and his famous student Ibn-ul-Qayyim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Some of His Other Achievements</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Sheikh ‘Abdullah Al-Qar’aawee realized the superiority of his student Haafidh, he appointed him as a teacher for the other students and they benefitted greatly from his lessons.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In 1363H (1945) Sheikh Al-Qar’aawee selected Haafidh to be the director of the Madrassa-tus-Salafiyyah institute in Saamitah, which was the first and the largest of all the schools that Sheikh Al-Qar’aawee established for the students of knowledge in the southern region of the kingdom. Haafidh was also made regional superintendent for all the schools in the neighboring villages and townships.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sheikh Al-Qar’awee went on to enlarge the schools in Tihaamah and ‘Aseer and he eventually established at least one school in every village in the south that taught Islamic studies. He appointed his students as teachers and administrators for these schools. However, when Sheikh Al-Qar’aawee had established literally hundreds of schools in the southern region he took his first student. Haafidh al-Hakamee, as his assistant while traveling and supervising the schools.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sheikh Haafidh traveled to many places in order to fulfill his responsibilities with Sheikh Al-Qar’aawee including As-Salaama-tul-’Ulya, the city of Beesh and Umm-ul-Khashab in northern Jaazaan. Afterwards, he returned to Saamitah again as director of the schools, in the region in order to help his Sheikh administer the many schools that he had established so taht the important improvements brought about by thsi da’wah might continue.</p>
<p>Such was the high opinion that Sheikh ‘Abdullah Al-Qar’aawee held of Haafidh, that he is known to have said about him:</p>
<p><strong>‘Indeed, he is one of my students, but he has surpassed me in knowledge with a far-aspiring ambition.’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of Sheikh Haafidh’s three wives was also the daughter of his noble Sheikh, Sheikh Al-Qar’aawee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most of Sheikh Haafidh Al-Hakamee’s time was spent trying to uplift the youth in his area and benefit them with his knowledge as much as he could. Some of his students are now renowned scholars in their own right having taken position as judges, teachers, and preachers everywhere in the southern region of the kingdom and elsewhere.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In 1373H (1955) a high school was opened in Jaazaan, the capital city of the southern region, and Sheikh Haafidh Al-Hakamee was chosen to be its first director in the same year. Then in 1374H (1956) a scholastic institute was opened in Saamitah by the General Directorate of Colleges and Institutes and Sheikh Haafidh Al-Hakamee was chosen to be its director as well. Sheikh Haafidh performed his administrative duties extremely well in addition to teaching some classes where he was known to give the students knowledge above and beyond the limited curriculum of the institute either himself or through some of the others in the institute.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>His Death</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sheikh Haafidh Al-Hakamee remained as the director of the scholastic institute in Saamitah until he performed Hajj in the year 1377H (1958). After completing the rights of Hajj, Sheikh Haafidh died in the city of Makkah from a sudden illness on the 18th of Dhul Hijjah, 1377H (1958) while he was still a young man of only 35 years and three months. It is there where he lies buried. May Allah, the Exalted, have mercy upon him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THE BIOGRAPHY OF AL-HAAFIZ IBN KATHEER</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is: the Imaam, the Haafiz, the Shaikh of the Muhadditheen, the Historian, the Explainer of the Qur·aan, `Imaaduddeen Abul-Fidaa· Ismaa`eel ibn `Umar ibn Katheer ibn Daw· ibn Katheer ibn Zar`, al-Qurashee; al-Busrawee, then ad-Dimashqee, the jurist, ash-Shaafi`ee. [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was born in Mijdal, a village to the east of Busraa-which is a town in the province of Damascus, in the year 701 H, where his father was a Khateeb.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the death of his father he moved, along with his brother Kamaaluddeen `AbdulWahhaab, to Damascus, in the year 707 H. He memorized the whole of the Qur·aan at the age of ten, and he read the different recitations,<br />
and he excelled in tafseer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He married Zaynab the daughter of al-Haafiz Abul-Hajjaaj al-Mizzee, and he closely accompanied him and learned from him. He gave great attention to the science of hadeeth, and qualified under him in it. He also accompanied Shaikhul-Islaam Taqiyyuddeen Ibn Taimiyyah and was a special student of his and defended him, and he followed him upon many of his opinions. He used to deliver verdicts in accordance with his view concerning the question of the three simultaneous divorces, that they count as a single divorce, and he was put to trial on account of this and suffered harm.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He gave attention to memorising the texts; and to awareness of the chains of narration, the hidden defects in narrations, the narrators, and to history, to the extent that he excelled in all of that whilst he was still a youth. He delivered verdicts, taught and debated. He excelled in Fiqh, Tafseer, and Arabic Grammar. He closely studied the narrators and the hidden defects in narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He became the Shaikh of the Saalihiyyah School, after the death of adh-Dhahabee; and the Shaikh of Daarul-Hadeeth al-Ashrafiyyah for a short while after the death of as-Subkee. Then this was taken from him after it was seized by Kamaaluddeen al-Ma`arree.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">HIS SCHOLARLY STATUS:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer had prominent status as is clear from the institutions of knowledge he headed; and the mosques in which he taught; and the works of Tafseer, History, and Hadeeth that he authored.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the schools that he took charge of, then they were: The Ashrafiyyah School of Hadeeth, the school of as-Saalihiyyah, the school of an-Najeebiyyah, the school of at-Tankaziyyah, and the school of an-Nooriyyah al-Kubraa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These were schools sought after by the students of knowledge from the east and the west, and their Shaikhs and teachers had high status. None were allowed to teach in them except those who were firmly grounded in knowledge and whose position amongst the scholars was established. Therefore, the scholars respected him and the hearts of the students of knowledge were attentive to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the mosques in which he delivered his lessons, then the most famous of them were &#8220;alJaami` al-Amawee&#8221;, the mosque of Ibn Hishaam, the Jaami` of Tankaz, the Jaami` of alFooqaanee-and he used to deliver the Khutbah in it also.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This being in addition to his writings which have filled the earth with knowledge, and from which people have benefitted in his lifetime and after his death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>THE SCHOLARS PRAISE OF HIM:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">adh-Dhahabee said: “The jurist, the muftee, the muhaddith&#8230; he gave special attention to the narrators, to the texts, and to acquiring knowledge of Fiqh. He elucidated, wrote works, debated, authored, explained (the Qur·aan), and attained precedence&#8230;” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said: “The imaam, the jurist, the muhaddith, the singular and outstanding scholar&#8230; He was a jurist knowledgeable in various fields, a precise muhaddith, a critical and verifying explainer (of the Qur·aan). He produced beneficial works. He was well aware of Fiqh, and had good understanding of Arabic and the Fundamentals (of Fiqh). He memorized a good portion of the texts, of tafseer, and the narrators. He heard (narrations) from me, and had good memorisation.” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hajjee said: “I never came to him except that I benefitted from him, and I was his constant companion for six years.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Habeeb said, as quoted from him by Imaam Ibn Hajr:[4] “He was an imaam, frequent upon tasbeeh [5] and tahleel [6], and he was at the head of the scholars of explanation (of the Qur·aan). He heard, gathered, and authored. People strove to listen to his sayings. He spoke in a manner that delighted, he narrated, and he brought benefit. The pages of his verdicts were sent to the lands, and he became famous for precision and verification. He attained leadership in knowledge in History, Hadeeth, and Tafseer.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul-Mahaasin ad-Dimashqee said: “He delivered verdicts and taught. He debated and excelled in Fiqh, Tafseer, and Grammar. He carefully studied the narrators and the hidden defects of narrations.” [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Haafiz Ibn Hajr said: “He could bring a great deal to mind, and he joked in a fine manner. His works spread throughout the lands within his life-time, and the people derived benefit through him after his death.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-`Aynee said, as quoted from him by Ibn Taghreebardee: “He was the example amongst the scholars and the great memorizers, and the reference point for the people of meanings and wordings. He heard, gathered, compiled, taught, narrated, and wrote works. He had an abundance of knowledge and awareness of Hadeeth, Tafseer, and History. He became famous for precision and verification. He attained the limit in knowledge of History, Hadeeth, and Tafseer; and he wrote many beneficial works.” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>HIS `AQEEDAH (CREED AND BELIEF):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He -rahimahullaahu ta`aalaa- was upon the `Aqeedah of the Salafus-Saalih (the Pious Predecessors). This is proven by his tremendous Tafseer, which is the most excellent tafseer that has made the `Aqeedah of the Salaf manifest. An example of that is his saying, in his explanation of His Saying -He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: Then He ascended over the Throne]]:<br />
[Sooratul-A`raaf (7): 54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Regarding this we follow the position of the Salafus-Saalih: Maalik, al-Awzaa`ee, athThawree, al-Layth ibn Sa`d, ash-Shaafi`ee, Ahmad, Ishaaq ibn Raahawaih, and others from the imaams of the Muslims, in the earlier and the later times: (and it is to let them pass)10 without saying how (takyeef),without declaring resemblance to the creation (tashbeeh), and without negating the attributes (ta`teel). Furthermore, what is immediately apparent to the minds of those who hold that the Creator resembles the creation is something negated for Allaah-the Most High, since nothing from the creation resembles Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing]].” [Sooratush-Shooraa (42): 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>HIS MOST PROMINENT TEACHERS:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer studied under many famous major Shaikhs, and the most important of them are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) Shaikhul-Islaam Taqiyyuddeen Ahmad ibn `Abdil-`Azeem ibn `Abdil-Haleem ibn `AbdisSalaam ibn Taimiyyah, who died in 728 H. al-`Iraaqee said within his biography of Ibn Katheer: “He was an especially close student of Shaikh Taqiyyuddeen Ibn Taimiyyah, and he defended him, and he followed him upon many of his views.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span class="body"><span class="subHdr">Imaam Abu Bakr Muhammad Ibn Al-Husayn Al-Aajurree</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="bodytext">He was Abu Bakr Muhammad Ibn al-Husayn al-Aajurree al-Baghdaadee, the Imaam, the Scholar of Hadeeth, the Example, the Shaykh of the Noble Haram, author of many beneficial works, truthful, the devout worshipper and the one who closely followed the Sunnah. He was born in Baghdad in the year 280H, later he moved to Makkah and died there in the year 360H after having lived there for some thirty years.</span>He heard from: Abu Muslim al-Kajjee, Muhammad Ibn Yahyaa al-Marwazee, Abu Shu`ayb al-Harraanee, Ahmad Ibn Yahya al-Halwaanee, al-Hasan Ibn ‘Alee Ibn Alwee al-Qattaan, Ja`far Ibn Muhammad al-Firyaabee, Musaa Ibn Haaroon, Khalf Ibn ‘Amr al-‘Ukbaree, ‘Abdullaah Ibn Naahiyah, Muhammad Ibn Saalih al-‘Ukbaree, Ja`far Ibn Ahmad Ibn ‘Aasim ad-Dimashkee, ‘Abdullaah Ibn al-‘Abbaas at-Tayaalisee, Haamid Ibn Shu`ayb al-Balkhee, Ahmad Ibn Sahl al-Usnaanee al-Muqri, Ahmad Ibn Musaa Ibn Zanjaway al-Qattaan, ‘Eesaa Ibn Sulaymaan, Abu ‘Alee al-Hasan Ibn al-Hubaab al-Muqri, Abu al-Qaasim al-Baghawee, Ibn Abee Dawood and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who narrated from him were: ‘Abdur-Rahmaan Ibn ‘Umar Ibn Nahaas, Abu al-Husayn Ibn Bishraan, his brother Abu al-Qaasim Ibn Bishraan, al-Muqri` Abu al-Hasan al-Hamaamee, Abu Nu`aym al-Haafidh and many from amongst the pilgrims and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Khateeb said about him: “He was a person possessing Deen (religious qualities), trustworthy and precise. He authored (some) works.&#8221; [Reported by Ibn Katheer in <i>Al-Bidaayah wa an-Nihaayah</i> (11/306) and Adh-Dhahabee in <i>As-Siyar</i> (16/134-136)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Atheer described him as being a Haafidh [See <i>Al-Kaamil fee at-Taareekh</i> (7/44)], as did Al-Haafidh Adh-Dhahabee in <i>Mukhtasar al-Uluw</i>(pg. 246).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Khalikaan said: “The Shaafi`ee Faqeeh, the Muhaddith, author of the famous book <i>‘Al-Arba`een’</i>, he was a righteous servant.&#8221; [Ibn Khalikaan in <i>Wafayaatul A`yaan</i> (4/292). Others such as Ibn al-Jawzee mentioned him amongst the Hanbalees.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Jawzee said about him: “He was trustworthy and precise, possessing Deen, a scholar and author.&#8221; [<i>Sifatus Safwah</i> (2/479)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said: &#8220;He gathered together knowledge and asceticism.&#8221; [<i>Manaaqib al-Imaam Ahmad</i> (pg. 515)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Suyootee said: “The Imaam, the Muhaddith, the Example. He was a scholar enacting what he taught, the follower of the Sunnah, possessing Deen, trustworthy and precise.&#8221; [<i>Tabaqaatul Huffaadh</i> (pg. 379)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The work he wrote on ‘Aqeedah was “<i>Ash-Sharee`ah</i>”, published in one volume with the tahqeeq (verification) of Muhammad Haamid Al-Fiqqee, and in six volumes with the tahqeeq of Dr. ‘Abdullaah Ibn ‘Umar Ibn Sulaymaan Ad-Dameejee. May Allaah have mercy on him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="body"><span class="subHdr">Imaam Abu ‘Abdillaah `Ubaydullaah Al-`Ukbaree, Ibn Battah</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="bodytext">He was Abu ‘Abdillaah `Ubaydullaah bin Muhammad Ibn Battah Al-`Ukbaree Al-Hanbalee, known as “Ibn Battah.”</span>He was the Imaam, the Hadeeth Master (<i>Haafidh</i>), the Hanbalee Legal Jurist (Faqeeh), the devout worshipper and ascetic. He was born in the year 304H in Ukbaraa, a land close to Baghdad, and died in the year 387H. His father was a Faqeeh and it was under his auspices that he began his studies and he often reports from him in his books. He was sent to Baghdad to study hadeeth while still young. Then he traveled to various lands such as Shaam, Basrah, Makkah and Thagur studying under a host of the leading scholars of his time and excelled in ‘Aqeedah, Hadeeth and Fiqh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He heard from the likes of Abu al-Qaasim al-Baghawee, Abu Dharr al-Baaghandee, Abu Bakr bin Ziyaad an-Naisabooree, Isma`eel al-Warraaq, al-Qaadee al-Mahaamalee, Muhammad bin Mukhlid, Abu Taalib Ahmad bin Nasr al-Haafidh, Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Thaabit al-‘Ukbaree, ‘Alee bin Abee al-Aqab, Ahmad bin Ubayd as-Saffaar, Ibn Saa`id and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A group of the scholars narrated from him such as: Abu al-Fath bin Abee al-Fawaaris, Abu Nu`aym al-Asbahaanee, Ubaydullaah al-Azharee, ‘Abdul-‘Azeez al-Azjee, Abu Ishaaq al-Barmakee, Abu Muhammad al-Jawharee, Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Eesaa as-Sa`see and others. He has been praised by more than one Imaam and was famous for enjoining the good and forbidding the evil. [See Ibn Katheer’s <i>Al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah</i> (11/368-369); Ibn Hajr’s <i>Lisaan al-Meezaan</i> (4/133+) and Adh-Dhahabee’s <i>Siyar A’alaam an-Nubalaa</i> (16/529-533)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Khateeb al-Baghdaadee said: Abu Haamid ad-Dawlee narrated to me that when Ibn Battah returned from his travels he confined himself to his house for forty years [only rarely going out]. He was not seen in the market place and neither was he seen breaking fast except on the day of ‘Eed. He used to enjoin the good and not a single bad narration [concerning people] would reach him except that he put it in a better light.&#8221; [See Al-Khateeb Al-Baghdaadee’s <i>Taareekh Baghdaad</i> (10/372)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">’Abdul-Waahid bin ‘Alee al-‘Ukbaree said, &#8220;I have not seen any of the scholars from the Ashaabul Hadeeth or other than them having a better disposition and mannerism than Ibn Battah&#8221; [See Al-Khateeb Al-Baghdaadee’s <i>Taareekh Baghdaad</i> (10/372)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad bin Muhammad al-‘Ateeqee said, &#8220;Ibn Battah was a righteous Shaykh, one whose supplications were answered.&#8221; [Ibn al-Jawzee in <i>Al-Muntadhim</i> (7/194)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu al-Fath al-Qawwaas said: “I mentioned the knowledge and asceticism of Ibn Battah to Abu Sa`eed al-Ismaa`eelee and so he went to him. When he returned he commented: ‘His [knowledge and asceticism] is beyond description.’&#8221; [Ibn Hajr Al-‘Asqalaanee in <i>Lisaan al-Meezaan</i>(4/134)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Mas`ood Ahmad bin Muhammad al-Bajlee, the Haafidh said, &#8220;I have loved the Hanbalees since the day I saw Abu ‘Abdillaah Ibn Battah.&#8221; [Ibn Abee Ya`laa in <i>Tabaqaatul Hanaabilah</i> (2/145)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-‘Imaad said: “…the great Imaam, the Haafidh, Ibn Battah, the Hanbalee Faqeeh and righteous servant.&#8221; [<i>Shadharaat adh-Dhahab</i> (3/122)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However in the field of hadeeth he has been criticized for his precision although in and of himself he is regarded to be truthful (<i>sadooq</i>). It is important to note that the scholars of Hadeeth have cleared him of the possibility of fabricating.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Refer to <i>Al-Mughnee fee ad-Du`afaa</i> (2/417), <i>Al-Uluw</i> (2/417), and <i>Siyar A’alaam an-Nubalaa</i> (16/529-533) of Adh-Dhahabee: <i>Al-Laa`ee</i> (1/85) of As-Suyootee, and others. A defense of him against a number of criticisms leveled against him can be found in Ibn al-Jawzee’s <i>Al-Muntadhim</i>(7/194+) and Al-Mu`allimee’s <i>At-Tankeel</i> (pp. 561-571).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At this point it is necessary to mention that the People of Innovation have capitalized on a statement concerning this great Imaam made by al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr al-‘Asqalaanee, may Allaah have mercy on him. Using this statement they have attempted to declare this Imaam a fabricator and liar, may Allaah forgive them and us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hajr in his notice of Ibn Battah begins by declaring him an Imaam and then proceeds to criticize him for his lack of precision in narration. He quotes the words of Al-‘Ateeqee about him that &#8220;…despite his lack of precision [in narrating] he was an Imaam in the Sunnah and an Imaam in Fiqh, possessor of miraculous events and one whose supplications were answered, may Allaah be pleased with him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then proceeds to mention a <i>munkar</i> narration concerning the Attributes of Allaah and after identifying Ibn Battah as being the source of this narration [although his being the culprit is differed over by the Scholars of Hadeeth], Ibn Hajr comments: “And I do not know what I should say about Ibn Battah after this.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It should be noted here that if Ibn Hajr thought Ibn Battah to be a liar or fabricator it would been necessary for him to mention this clearly, for the likes of this Haafidh could not possibly remain silent on such an issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, as-Suyootee, may Allaah have mercy upon him, further clarifies Ibn Hajr’s position on him. After quoting the above mentioned words of Ibn Hajr, he says: &#8220;I saw in the handwriting of Ibn Hajr in his notes to ‘<i>Mukhtasar al-Mawdoo`aat</i>’ of Ibn Darbaas [concerning this hadeeth], &#8220;This false addition that occurs at the end of it is not present here and so it is clear that it occurs due to the poor memory of Ibn Battah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in this narration Ibn Hajr explicitly clears Ibn Battah of intentional fabrication and hence his stance on him falls in line with the majority of Hadeeth Masters. Allaah knows best. [Ibn Hajr Al-‘Asqalaanee in Lisaan al-Meezaan (4/134) and As-Suyootee in <i>Al-Laa`ee al-Masnoo`ah</i> (1/75)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His books concerning ‘Aqeedah that have been published are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <strong><i>Al-Ibaanah al-Kubraa</i></strong> &#8211; in seven volumes with the checking (tahqeeq) of Yusuf bin Abdullaah al-Waabil, and<br />
2. <strong><i>Ash-Sharh wal-Ibaanah</i></strong> &#8211; with the checking (tahqeeq) of Dr. Ridaa Nu`saan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Battah passed away in 387H, may Allaah have mercy on him.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="Marker" style="color:#999999;">Author: Compiled from Several Sources<br />
Translator: Abu Talha Dawood Burbank rahimahullaah</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="bodytext"><b>His Name, Kunyah and Lineage: </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="bodytext">He is the Imaam, the Example, the Mujaahid, the Shaikh of the Hanbalee scholars and greatest of them in his time: Abu Muhammad Al-Hasan Ibn &#8216;Alee Ibn Khalf Al-Barbahaaree &#8211; an ascription to Barbahaar, which were medicines imported from India.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Birthplace and Early Life: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The references available do not mention anything about his birth or early life but it appears that he was born and brought up in Baghdad. This is apparent from his fame amongst its general public, not to mention its scholars. Furthermore, Al-Barabahaaree sat with a group of the companions of the Imaam of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah, Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, <i>rahimahullaah</i>. He studied under them and most of them came from Baghdad as will be explained. This shows that he grew up in an environment of knowledge and adherence to the Sunnah. This clearly had a great influence on his personality.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Barbahaaree was pre-eminent in seeking after knowledge and expanded great efforts to attain it. He acquired knowledge from a group of the senior students of Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, except that unfortunately, the references available to us only state two of them by name and they are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Ahmad Ibn Muhammad Ibn-ul-Hajjaaj Ibn &#8216;Abd-il-&#8216;Azeez Abu Bakr Al-Marwazee: The exemplary Imaam, scholar and Muhaddith, a student of Imaam Ahmad. He died on the sixth of Jumaadal-Oolaa in the year 275H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Sahl Ibn &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Yoonus At-Tustaree, Abu Muhammad: The Imaam, worshipper and one known for abstemiousness from this world. Many wise sayings are reported from him and many remarkable happenings. He died in the month of Muharram in the year 283H, at the age of about eighty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Knowledge and the Scholars&#8217; Praise for Him: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Al-Barbahaaree, <i>rahimahullaah</i>, was a formidable and imposing Imaam who spoke out with the truth and called to the Sunnah and to the following of narrations. He also had renown and the respect of the ruler. In his gatherings, various circles for the study of Hadeeth, the narrations and Fiqh were held. These were attended by many of the scholars of Hadeeth and Fiqh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholar, Abu &#8216;Abdillaah said: &#8220;If you see a person of Baghdad loving Abul-Hasan Ibn Bashshaar and Abu Muhammad Al-Barbahaaree, then know that he is a person of the Sunnah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His high status is shown by what his student, Ibn Battah, <i>rahimahullaah</i>, said: &#8220;I heard him &#8211; meaning Al-Barbahaaree &#8211; saying when the people were prevented from Hajj: <b>‘O People! If anyone needs assistance to the level of a hundred thousand Deenaars and a hundred thousand Deenaars and a hundred thousand Deenaars &#8211; five times &#8211; then I will assist him.’</b>&#8221; Ibn Battah said: &#8220;If he wanted it the people would have given it to him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards the scholars&#8217; praise for him, then a great deal has been reported:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abee Ya&#8217;laa said: &#8220;Shaikh of the Community in his time and the foremost of them in censuring the people of innovation and in opposing them with his hand and tongue. And he had renown with the rulers and prominence amongst those of knowledge. And he was one of the wise scholars, great and precise memorizers of the texts and one of the reliable believers&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Adh-Dhahabee said in <i>Al-&#8216;Ibar</i>: &#8220;&#8230;the exemplary scholar, Shaikh of the Hanbalees in &#8216;Iraaq in speech, action and sticking to what is lawful. He had great renown and total respect.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Al-Jawzee said: &#8220;&#8230;He gathered knowledge and had abstention from this world (zuhd) and was strong against the people of innovation.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer said: &#8220;The abstemious, man of knowledge, the Hanbalee scholar, the admonisher &#8211; and he was strict against the people of innovation and sin. He had great standing and was respected by the elite and by the common people.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Piety and Abstemiousness: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Al-Barbahaaree was known for both of these qualities. This can be seen by what Abul-Hasan Ibn Bashshaar mentioned: &#8220;Al-Barbahaaree shunned seventy-thousand Deenaars, which he inherited from his father.&#8221; Ibn Abee Ya&#8217;laa said: &#8220;Al-Barbahaaree strove greatly and stood firm for the Religion many times.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Position with Regard to the People of Innovation: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Al-Barbahaaree, <i>rahimahullaah</i>, was very stern against the people of innovations and deviant sects, opposing them with his tongue and his hand, all the while following the way of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah with regards to the treatment of the people of innovation and deviation. His desire was that this Religion remain pure and be kept free from all that the people of innovation and deviance sought to attach to it, whether the beliefs of the Jahmiyyah, the Mu&#8217;tazilah, the &#8216;Ash&#8217;arees, the Soofees or the Shee&#8217;ah and Raafidees.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He makes clear the methods employed by the people of deviant sects to give sanction to their innovations, and he warns us against falling into their ways and methods. He lays out for us the broad and clear outlines describing the people of deviant sects and innovations. It is as if you are looking straight at them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In summery, his position with regard to the people of deviant sects and innovations was clearly one of opposition and sternness due to his concern and love for the Sunnah and due to the efforts of every deviant innovator to attack it. His position is rightfully seen as a fine example of the positions of the Imaams of Ahl-us-Sunnah with regard to the people of innovation, deviation and misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Students: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A large number of students learned from this Imaam and benefited from him, since he was an example in both word and deed. And from these students are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The exemplary Imaam and Scholar, Abu &#8216;Abdillaah Ibn &#8216;Ubaydullaah Ibn Muhammad Al-&#8216;Ukbaree, well known as Ibn Battah, who died in Muharram of the year 387H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The exemplary Imaam, well known for his wise sayings, Muhammad Ibn Ahmad Ibn Isma&#8217;eel Al-Baghdaadee, Abul-Husayn Ibn Sam&#8217;oon, the admonisher, famous for his deeds and condition. He died in the middle of Dhul-Qa&#8217;adah in the year 387H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Ahmad Ibn Kaamil Ibn Khalf Ibn Shajarah, Abu Bakr, the narrator of this book from its author</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Muhammad Ibn Muhammad Ibn &#8216;Uthmaan, Abu Bakr, about whom Al-Khateeb Al-Baghdaadee (rahimahullaah) said: &#8220;It reached me that he used to lead the life of an ascetic and was upon good except that he reported some things that were weak and without basis.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>A Glimpse of His Words and Poetry: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu &#8216;Abdillaah Ibn Battah (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said: &#8220;I heard Abu Muhammad Al-Barbahaaree say: &#8216;Sitting in order to advise sincerely is to open the door of benefit and sitting in order to debate is to close the doors of benefit.'&#8221; And he said: &#8220;The people are in constant delusion.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From his poetry is:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Whoever satisfies himself with what suffices him –</em><br />
<em> Begins rich and continues in following the correct way:</em><br />
<em> How fine an attribute Allaah has made being satisfied with what suffices –</em><br />
<em> How many a humble person it has raised high</em><br />
<em> The soul of the youth feels constricted if it is poor</em><br />
<em> But if he is patiently dependent upon his Lord he would indeed be given ease and sufficiency.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Trial and Death: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Al-Barbahaaree, <i>rahimahullaah</i>, had renown and a position of great respect with the common people and the elite and also had status in the eyes of the ruler. However, his enemies from the people of the deviant sects and innovations did not cease in their efforts to incite the ruler against him and to cause anger in his heart against him. This was to the point that in the year 321H, the Khaleefah, Al-Qaahir ordered his minister Ibn Muqlah to arrest Al-Barbahaaree and his students. Al-Barbahaaree hid, however a group of his major students were captured and taken to Basrah. Allaah, the most High, punished Ibn Muqlah for this action by causing Al-Qaahir Billaah to become angry with him, so Ibn Muqlah fled and was removed from his post and his house was burned. Then Al-Qaahir Billaah was himself imprisoned on the sixth of Jumaadal-Aakhirah, 322H. He was stripped of his position and blinded in both eyes. Then Allaah, the Most High, granted that Al-Barbahaaree return to his place of honor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Abu &#8216;Abdillaah Ibn &#8216;Arafah, well known as Niftawaih died, his funeral was attended by many prominent people and scholars and the congregation was lead by Al-Barbahaaree and that occurred in Safar of the year 323H. It was in this year also that Al-Barbahaaree&#8217;s standing grew and his words carried greater weight and his students became apparent and spread out amongst the people, censuring the innovators. It reached the point that once when Al-Barbahaaree was on the western side of the city and sneezed, his students replied to him and (were so many that) the Khaleefah heard the noise they made in his apartment, so he asked about what had happened. So when he was informed he became afraid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The innovators still did not cease trying to cause the heart of the Khaleefah Ar-Raadee to turn against Al-Barbahaaree. This was to the point that Ar-Raadee gave the order to Badr Al-Harasee, his chief of police, that he should ride out in public in Baghdad with the proclamation that no two students of Al-Barbahaaree were allowed to meet together. Again he hid himself having previously settled in the west of the city, he now secretly moved to the east. He died in this state in the year 329H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abee Ya&#8217;laa said: Muhammad Ibn Al-Hasan Al-Muqri narrated to me, saying: My grandfather and also my grandmother related to me that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Abu Muhammad Al-Barbahaaree was hidden by the sister of Toozoon in the eastern side of the town in the alleyway of the public bathhouse&#8230;he was there for about a month then his blood ceased flowing. When Al-Barbahaaree died, still in hiding, the sister of Toozoon said to her servant: &#8216;Find someone to wash him.&#8217; So someone came to wash him and the door was kept locked so that no one would know. He alone stood to pray for him, but when the woman who owned the house looked, she found that it was full of men wearing white and green clothing. After he had ended the Funeral Prayer, she did not see anyone at all, so she called to her servant and said: &#8216;You have destroyed me along with my brother!&#8217; So he said: &#8216;Did you not see what I saw?&#8217; &#8216;Yes&#8217;, she replied. He said: &#8216;Here are the keys to the door and it is still locked.&#8217; So she said: &#8216;Bury him in my house and when I die bury me near him&#8230;'&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah have mercy on Imaam Al-Barbahaaree and grant him a great reward. He was an Imaam in truth, an example, knowing Allaah, and a follower of the Sunnah, and an unsheathed sword against the people of innovation and deviation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="body"><span class="subHdr">Imaam Abu Ja&#8217;far Ahmad Ibn Muhammad At-Tahaawee</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="Marker"><strong>Source</strong> : Shaikh al-Albaanee&#8217;s checking and notes to the Sharh and Matn  of Aqeedah Tahaawiyyah<br />
</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="bodytext"><b>His Name and Lineage: </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="bodytext">He was the Imaam, the Muhaddith, the Faqeeh, the Haafidh, the noble Scholar, Abu Ja&#8217;far Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Salaamah bin Salama &#8216;Abdul-Malik bin Salama Al-Azdee At-Tahaawee. Al-Azadee is an ascription to a well-known tribe from Qahtaan. At-Tahaawee is an ascription to the land Tahaa in Upper Egypt.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Search for Knowledge: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His lineage in knowledge is connected to his family and uncles, for his father was from the scholars and his uncle was the Imaam Isma&#8217;eel bin Yahyaa Al-Muznee. (Died 264H). He was born in 239H. When he reached the age of adolescence, he moved to Egypt in search of knowledge. Al-Muznee was the one with the most knowledge of Fiqh amongst the companions of Imaam Muhammad bin Idrees Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee in his land. And likewise his mother was from the people of knowledge and narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he linked with the scholars of Egypt as well as those who came to Egypt. And his teachers were many, as were his students.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every time the scope of his horizons would widen, he would find himself confused amidst a score of Fiqh issues. And he would not find the sufficient answers from his uncle that would soothe his confusion over these issues. So he began to examine what his uncle would do when he was faced with these kinds of contradictory opinions. His uncle would refer a lot to the books of the associates of Abu Haneefah (i.e. Hanafis), and he would favor many of the opinions of Abu Haneefah with regard to these issues. These favored opinions of his were recorded in his book &#8220;Mukhtasar Al-Muznee.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So after that he was left with no choice but to look into the books of the associates of Abu Haneefah and adopt their methodology in establishing fundamental principles and deriving subsidiary rulings. This is such that when he completed his knowledge of the madh-hab of Imaam Abu Haneefah, he changed to that madh-hab and became one of its followers. But this did not prevent him from opposing and contradicting some of the (erroneous) opinions held by the Imaam (Abu Haneefah) and preferring the opinions of the other Imaams (on certain issues). This is because he, may Allaah have mercy on him, was not a muqallid (blind follower) of Abu Haneefah. But rather he only saw the methodology of Abu Haneefah in Fiqh as being the most exemplary of methodologies, according to his opinion &#8211; so he treaded that path. This is why you will find him in his book &#8220;Ma&#8217;aanee Al-Athaar&#8221; affirming some views that his Imaam (Abu Haneefah) did not hold. What supports what we stated just now, is what Ibn Zoolaaq stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I heard Abul-Hasan &#8216;Alee Ibn Abee Ja&#8217;far At-Tahaawee say: I heard my father say: &#8216; (and he mentioned the virtues of Abu &#8216;Ubayd Harbaway and his Fiqh and said) He would ask me about (Fiqh) issues. So one day I gave my answer to one issue, so he said to me: &#8216;This is not the opinion of Abu Haneefah.&#8217; So I said: &#8216;O judge (Qaadee), do I have to hold the same opinion for every opinion that Abu Haneefah held?&#8221; So he said: &#8216;I didn&#8217;t think you were more than a blind follower.&#8217; I said to him: &#8216;And does anyone blindly follow someone except he who is a fanatic?&#8217; He said: &#8216;Or a simple-minded person.&#8217; So this story spread throughout Egypt, such that it became a proverb and the people memorized it.'&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was educated under many shuyookh, whom he took knowledge and benefited from. He had more than three hundred teachers. He would spend lots of time with those scholars that came to visit Egypt from different parts of the world, such that he would add to his knowledge what knowledge they had. This shows you the extent of the concern he had for benefiting and learning from the scholars, as well as the intense eagerness he had for acquiring knowledge. Many scholars praised him and described him as being reliable, trustworthy, a Faqeeh, intelligent, a good memorizer and a pious worshipper. He had a high proficiency in Fiqh and Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Scholars&#8217; Praise for Him: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Yoonus said: &#8220;At-Tahaawee was reliable, trustworthy, a Faqeeh, intelligent, the likes of whom one did not come afterward.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Adh-Dhahabee said in his At-Taareekh al-Kabeer: &#8220;He was the Faqeeh, the Muhaddith, the Haafidh, one of the elite personalities, and he was reliable, trustworthy, knowledgeable of Fiqh and intelligent.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer said in Al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah: &#8220;He was one of the reliable, trustworthy and brilliant scholars of Hadeeth (Haafidh).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He served as an intermediary for the knowledge between those who came before (Salaf) and those who came after (Khalaf). The scholars praised him and mentioned him as being a Muhaddith (scholar of Hadeeth), one whose report was reliable and an established narrator. He was distinguished and highly proficient in writing. And he became the most knowledgeable of Fiqh amongst the Hanafis in Egypt. This was even though he had a share in the Fiqh of all of the madh-habs of Fiqh and Hadeeth, and he knew of the various sciences of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Books: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his writings, then for the most part, they are verifications and compilations, containing many benefits. Among his writings is &#8220;Al-&#8216;Aqeedah At-Tahaawiyyah&#8221;, which we are writing the introduction for now, as well as for its explanation (by Ibn Abee Al-&#8216;Izz). Even though the size of the book is small, its benefits are many and its methodology is that of the Salaf. And you will find that it contains everything the Muslim needs concerning his Creed. There is also his book &#8220;Ma&#8217;aanee Al-Athaar&#8221;, which is a book in which he presents different areas of research in Fiqh along with their evidences. And during the course of his research, he mentions the issues in which there are differences of opinion amongst the scholars. And he lists the proofs and evidences for each opinion and debates them, outweighing which one appears to be the truth according to him. This book will accustom the student of knowledge with understanding Fiqh and it will acquaint him with the areas of difference of opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He left behind many other great works, close to forty different books, amongst which are: Sunan Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee, Mushkil Al-Athaar, Ahkaam-ul-Qur&#8217;aan, Al-Mukhtaar, Sharh Al-Jaam&#8217;i-ul-Kabeer, Sharh Al-Jaam&#8217;i-us-Sagheer, Ash-Shuroot, Nawaadir al-Fiqhiyyah and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam At-Tahaawee was well known and famous for commanding good and forbidding evil, for voicing out the truth and returning to that which he held to be the truth without being affected by the (other) scholars, rulers and associates.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufficient for us is the agreement of the majority of the scholars upon accepting this Creed, which has been truthfully called: &#8220;An Explanation of the Creed of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah.&#8221; And no one speaks against it except for those who rebel against the Creed held within it such as some remnants from the Mu&#8217;tazilah and the people of Hulool and Ittihaad (Sufi belief that Allaah is incarnate within His creation), and those who follow any opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Death: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam At-Tahaawee died on a Thursday at the beginning of Dhul-Qa&#8217;adah in 321H and was buried in the Qaraafah graveyard in Egypt. May Allaah have mercy on him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Imaam Abul-Qaasim Hibatullaah Al-Laalikaa&#8217;ee</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">Source: Intro to the Book &#8220;The Creed of Imam Bukhaaree&#8221;</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;">Translated by: Dawud Burbank rahimahullaah</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was Abul-Qaasim Hibatullaah, Ibn al-Hasan bin Mansoor ar-Raazee, at-Tabaree, al-Laalikaa’ee. The author of the encyclopedia of the ‘aqeedah of the Salaf called <i>Sharh Usool I’tiqaad Ahlis-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He lived in a time of great confusion and political strife and division. A time when innovations were widespread and were propagated by their profounder and followers, including the Mu‘tazilah, the Qadariyyah, the Khawaarij, the Murjiah, the Rawaafid and others besides them. Around his time many of the scholars of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah stood to author books in defense of the ‘aqeedah of the Companions, the Taabe’een and the Salaf after them and to warn against the widespread innovations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the book of al-Laalikaa’ee is the most comprehensive of all those books and its reader can delight in the abundance of knowledge and guidance contained therein. He reports from more than 180 people and this indicates the large number of Shaykhs he learnt from.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Amongst his students was the famous al-Khateeb al-Baghdaadee who said about him in his <i>Taareekh Baghdaad</i> (14/70): “We wrote from him and he used to understand and memorize (well).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer said about him in <i>al-Bidaayah</i> (12/24): “He used to understand and memorize and he (was always) concerned and anxious about hadeeth.” He was known for his precision and his perspicacity in hadeeth. One of his students saw Abul-Qaasim al-Laalikaa’ee after his death in a good dream.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Khateeb al-Baghdaadee mentions this and those after him narrate it from him, ‘Alee bin al-Hasan bin Jadaa al-’Akbaree said: ‘I saw Abul-Qaasim at-Tabaree in a dream and I said to him. What has Allaah done with you?’ He said: ‘He has forgiven me.’ I said: ‘For what reason?’ And it was as if he said in a word in a lowered, subdued voice: ‘The Sunnah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He died in the year 418H whilst he was middle-aged, before he became famous for his knowledge and his works, may Allaah have mercy upon him. Refer to the introduction to <i>Sharh Usoolil-Itiqaad</i> (1/65-101) by Ahmad Sa’d Hamdaan for more details.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><b>1315H–1389H: Shaikh ‘Abdullaah bin Muhammad Al-Qar’aawee</b></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;">Author: Fawaaz bin ‘Alee Al-Madkhalee</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> Source: His compilation “Tareeq-ul-Wusool ilaa Eedaah ath-Thalaathat-il-Usool. </span><span style="color:#999999;">Produced By:  <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/al-ibaanah-com/">Al-Ibaanah.com</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was <strong>Shaikh ‘Abdullaah bin Muhammad bin Hamad bin Muhammad Al-Qar’aawee</strong> [2] An-Najdee from the district of Qaseem in Najd. He played a great role in Calling to Allaah and spreading the authentic creed, particularly in the southern regions of Saudi Arabia, where this (Salafee) Da’wah thrived and prospered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, may Allaah have mercy on him, was born in Dhul-Hijjah of 1315H in the <strong>city of ‘Unayzah</strong>. His father passed away two months prior to his birth, so he was raised an orphan under the care and auspices of his mother and paternal uncle. He was brought up learning the basic elementary studies, uprightness, purification and memorization of the Qur’aan. During the first part of his life, he occupied himself with conducting business, but he changed to seeking knowledge. He traveled to India twice and then moved throughout the cities of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia seeking knowledge. So he traveled from Buraydah to Makkah and then to Madeenah, Riyadh, Ihsaa and Qatar. In fact, he even transcended beyond the Arabian Peninsula, visiting Iraq, Egypt and Syria.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Afterward, he commenced his Call to reformation, turning his attention to the southern region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. He settled in <strong>Saamitah</strong> and made it the center for his Da’wah. So he began calling the people to have Taqwaa of Allaah and to adhere to the beliefs of the pious predecessors (Salaf as-Saalih), with wisdom and fair admonition. Many students would gather around him, and so he would have a large following of people who came to him seeking knowledge. So he held gatherings, teaching them the Qur’aan, Tafseer, Tajweed, Tawheed, Hadeeth, Fiqh, Laws of Inheritance, and some of the sciences of the Arabic language. [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he focused on some of the neighboring towns of Saamitah and opened various educational institutes, appointing some of his main students as teachers in them – students the likes of <strong>Shaikh Haafidh Al-Hakamee (<i>rahimahullaah</i>)</strong>, about whom he said: “<span style="color:#008000;">He is one of my students, however he has surpassed me in knowledge by far</span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would supply these schools with everything that students stood in need of, such as books, notepads and so on, purchasing that with his personal donations. He would also go out in person to visit the neighboring villages on certain days to the point that the people turned towards seeking knowledge under him. The Shaikh’s schools spread out from the district of Tuhaamah to the district of ‘Aseer. He opened many schools and institutes within these regions and appointed his major students to teach in them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the main objectives of his Da’wah were to rectify the Creed in the people’s souls, to cultivate the true Islaam into the hearts of the Muslim youth and to guide them to the correct path. Prior to his arrival, the community was living upon ignorance and false notions. So the Shaikh, may Allaah have mercy on him, produced students that were strong in their Creed to guide the people and call them to Allaah. So his efforts were crowned with success and many of the people began to perform the obligations at their proper times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the last part of his life, he was afflicted with a painful sickness, as a result of which he was forced to move to Riyadh where he was admitted into its central hospital. On Tuesday, the 8th of Jumaadaal-Oolaa, 1389H, the Shaikh passed away, having reached around 73 years of age – a lifetime which he spent serving knowledge, seeking it and spreading it to the people. He, may Allaah have mercy on him, is regarded today as one of the Imaams of the Islamic Da’wah of the 14th Hijree Century, particularly in the districts of Tuhaamah and ‘Aseer, which serve as the birthplace of his Da’wah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For more about Imaam Al-Qar’aawee, refer to the book <strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Shaikh Haafidh bin Ahmad Al-Hakamee – His Life and Effects”</span> </strong>(pg. 31-35) written by our sheikh, Zayd bin Muhammad Al-Madkhalee, rahimahullaah, and the book <strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Shaikh ‘Abdullaah Al-Qar’aawee and his Da’wah in the South of the Kingdom”</span></strong> (pg. 12) by As-Sahlee.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Footnotes:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] <b>Translator’s Note: </b>This book was compiled by Fawaaz al-Madkhalee from classes Shaikh Zayd Al-Madkhalee (rahimahullaah) gave on the explanation of the famous book “The Three Fundamental Principles” in the First Shaikh ‘Abdullaah bin Muhammad Al-Qar’aawee Educational Seminar, which was held in 1415H in the district of Jaazaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] <b>Translator’s Note: </b><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Al-Qar’aawee</strong> was the nickname of his grandfather, which was an ascription to a town he lived in called al-Qar’aa, within the confines of the city of Buraydah</span>. See <i>Fatawaa al-Jaliyyah</i>, footnote 3 on (pg. 5).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Shaikh ‘Abdullaah Al-Qar’aawee served as one of the carriers of the Sunnah and one of the callers to it during that time period. He studied under the noble scholars of his region of Najd and elsewhere. He longed to be one of the callers to Allaah and to be one of those who would revive His Religion, aiding the truth, and guiding the people from deviation to the truth and from Shirk to Tawheed. He yearned to be from those who would warn the people against the evils that are the cause for Allaah’s Anger. So Allaah willed for him to be from those who called to his Path in the southern region of Saudi Arabia. This was due the suggestion of his teacher at that time, the former Muftee of Saudi Arabia, <strong>Shaikh Muhammad bin Ibraaheem (<i>rahimahullaah</i>)</strong>, to go there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This happened after Shaikh Al-Qar’aawee confided in him a dream he had in which he saw himself go down to the southern regions of Saudi Arabia. So he set out for the south and ended up in Jaazaan in the year 1358H. Thereafter, he advanced to the city of Saamitah, and Allaah benefited the people of these lands through him. So the people of the south learned the Book and the Sunnah from him and they began to understand the Religion of Allaah at his hands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he first came to Saamitah, he opened the first Madrasah Salafiyyah (Salafee School) there in Sha’baan 1358H, and began teaching in it shortly thereafter. The school was opened in the house of Shaikh Naasir bin Khaloofah, may Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>At the head of his students, were:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Shaikh Haafidh bin Ahmad al-Hakamee,</li>
<li>Shaikh Ahmad bin Yahyaa An-Najmee,</li>
<li>Shaikh ‘Umar Jardee Al-Madkhalee,</li>
<li>Shaikh Muhammad bin Ahmad Al-Hakamee, and</li>
<li>other scholars, at whose hands Allaah raised the Sunnah and subdued innovation.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">1353H-Present: Shaikh &#8216;Abdul-Muhsin bin Hamad Al-&#8216;Abbaad<br />
Produced By : Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Name and Lineage:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is the great scholar and Muhaddith, Shaikh ‘Abdul-Muhsin bin Hamad bin ‘Abdil-Muhsin bin ‘Abdillaah Al-‘Abbaad Aali Badr. The family of Aali Badr comes from the family of Jalaas, which originates from the ancient tribe of ‘Anazah, one of the descendent tribes of ‘Adnan (descendent of Prophet Isma’eel). His great-grandfather’s nickname was ‘Abbaad and so as a result some of his offspring inherited it from him, such as Shaikh ‘Abdul-Muhsin and his mother, the daughter of Sulaymaan bin ‘Abdillaah Aali Badr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh was born on a Tuesday night after ‘Ishaa prayer in the month of Ramadaan, 1353H in the city of Zulfi, Saudi Arabia. This is the city where he grew up and learned the basics of reading and writing.</p>
<p><b>His Early Studies:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While in Zulfi, he studied under Shaikh ‘Abdullaah bin Ahmad Al-Manee’, Shaikh Zaid bin Muhammad Al-Munaifee, Shaikh ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Ghaith with whom he completed the noble Qur’aan, and Shaikh Faalih bin Muhammad Ar-Roomee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the first elementary school opened in Zulfi in 1368H, he joined it in its third year and obtained his primary degree there in 1371H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After completing his primary studies, he moved to Riyadh and signed up with the Educational Institute there. This was the same year (1372H) that Imaam ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin Baaz moved to Riyadh from Kharj, where he had served as judge since 1357H, and the first year he taught in this Institute. Amongst the colleagues that he studied with at that time was Shaikh Muhammad Amaan Al-Jaamee, may Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After graduating from this institute, the Shaikh enrolled with the College of Sharee’ah in the Imaam Muhammad bin Su’ood Islamic University of Riyadh. During his last year at the college, he was appointed a teacher in the Educational Institute of Buraidah in 5/13/1379H. Then towards the end of that final school year, he returned back to Riyadh to take his final examination for the college. Allaah blessed him by granting him the ability to finish first amongst his whole class which consisted of over 80 graduates. They represented the fourth class of graduates from the College of Sharee’ah of the Imaam Muhammad bin Su’ood University. He also finished in the first rank amongst his class during his first three years at the college and when receiving his secondary degree from the Educational Institute of Riyadh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While in Riyadh, he was able to study under scholars the likes of Shaikh Muhammad bin Ibraaheem Aali Shaikh, Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin Baaz, Shaikh Muhammad Al-Ameen Ash-Shanqeetee, Shaikh ‘Abdur-Rahmaan Al-Afreeqee and Shaikh ‘Abdur-Razzaaq ‘Afeefee both in the University and in local masaajid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He studied specifically under <strong>Shaikh ‘Abdur-Rahmaan Al-Afreeqee</strong> in Riyadh in the year 1372H and then studied Hadeeth and its Terminology the following year under him. He would say about him: “He was a sincere teacher and a great scholar, as well as a counselor, guide and good example, may Allaah have mercy on him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also had a special relationship with Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin Baaz ever since the first time they met in 1372H. He studied formally under him in the fourth year of the College of Sharee’ah. Shaikh ‘Abdul-Muhsin mentioned: “Most of the contact I had with him would occur in between classes and in the masjid. I would also visit him in his home.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In 1380H, he transferred to teach in the Educational Institute of Riyadh. But when the Islamic University of Madeenah opened and the first college to be established there was the College of Sharee’ah, Shaikh Muhammad bin Ibraaheem Aali Shaikh selected him to work there as a teacher. Prior to this, towards the end of 1379H, Shaikh ‘Abdul-Muhsin had requested Shaikh Muhammad bin Ibraaheem, may Allaah have mercy on him, to put him in the teaching profession program, to which he agreed on the condition that when he completed the program he would teach at the Islamic University when it opened. Shaikh ‘Abdul-Muhsin replied that he was fully prepared for the task.</p>
<p><b>His Role in the Islamic University:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he began teaching at the Islamic University of Madeenah in 1381H and he was the first to deliver a class there. He accompanied his teacher, Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin Baaz, who taught at the University for the next fifteen years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He served as a member of the University’s committee from the time of its inception to 1393H. Then in 7/30/1393H, he was appointed vice-president of the Islamic University behind Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin Baaz, the president at that time, who nominated him amongst three candidates for the position, upon which King Faisal, may Allaah have mercy on him, selected him for the job.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh ‘Abdul-Muhsin stayed in this position up to 10/26/1399H when he was relieved of it at his own request. In the first two of these six years, he was the second-in-charge. Then when Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin Baaz, may Allaah have mercy on him, transferred to become president of the Educational Research and Religious Verdict Administration, he became first-in-charge. During these six years, the Shaikh did not stop giving two weekly classes for fourth-year students at the College of Sharee’ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh ‘Abdul-Muhsin says about this: <span style="color:#808000;">“I would go to him, i.e. Shaikh Ibn Baaz, before going to the University and sit with him for a little while. Shaikh Ibraaheem Al-Husayyin would also be with him and would read the (chapters on) <i>Mu’aamalaat</i> (business and social dealing between Muslims) to him from after Fajr till the sun rose. On one of these days, he said to me: ‘I had a dream last night where I saw a beautiful camel, which I was pulling and you were riding. And I led it to the Islamic University.’ And all praise be to Allaah, this dream came true for I served as vice-president under him for two years, then assumed his role as interim president after him for four years.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the time that he served as president of the University, about five-thousand manuscripts were added to its library. This was the same time that Shaikh Hammaad Al-Ansaaree was hired to bring books from libraries around the world. Shaikh Hammaad said: <span style="color:#993300;">“A majority of the classical works of the Salaf that were photocopied for the Islamic University were done at the time when Shaikh ‘Abdul-Muhsin served as president there.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said: <span style="color:#993300;">“I brought five-thousand manuscripts for the Islamic University during my travels. Most of the journeys I took for the purpose of obtaining manuscripts and photocopying them were done during the time that Shaikh ‘Abdul-Muhsin Al-‘Abbaad was president of the University.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most of these manuscripts were books of Hadeeth and books on the Creed of the Salaf. To get a clearer picture of the great service that Shaikh ‘Abdul-Muhsin did while president of the Islamic University, look at the following statement of Shaikh Hammaad Al-Ansaaree:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“A historical account should be written about Shaikh ‘Abdul-Muhsin Al-‘Abbaad. He did certain jobs in the University that I wish I could have recorded or taped. There were two times in the day that he would insist on working at his job even though it wasn’t required of him – in the morning and in the afternoon after ‘Asr. I went to visit him one time in his office after ‘Asr when he was president of the University and sat with him. I then asked: ‘Where is the coffee, Shaikh?’ He answered: ‘Its ‘Asr now and there is no one here to make it.’ One time I was determined to get to the University before him so I got in the car and went. When I arrived at the University, there was Shaikh ‘Abdul-Muhsin opening the door to the University before everyone else!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would also say: “Relate Shaikh ‘Abdul-Muhsin’s diligence at work to the people for there is no harm in this.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh ‘Abdul-Muhsin Al-‘Abbaad was also the reason why Shaikh Hammaad Al-Ansaaree wrote his famous book on <i>Tawassul</i>, which served as a refutation of a book written by ‘Abdullaah Al-Ghumaaree, which Shaikh ‘Abdul-Muhsin had brought back with him from his trip to Morocco.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Amongst the other milestones reached by the University under Shaikh ‘Abdul-Muhsin’s presidency was that it transferred from being a government facility to a private institution, the advanced studies department for the Master’s and Doctorate’s programs were formed, the faculties of Qur’aan and Islamic studies, Hadeeth, and Arabic language were created, the size of the University’s land increased to accommodate a proposed 20,000 students, and the University’s printing department was also established.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh ‘Abdul-Muhsin continues to teach at the University until this very day even though he is past the compulsory age of retirement. No one has taught longer at the Islamic University than him since he taught from its very first day until now. In addition to this, he also continues to hold lessons in the Prophet’s Masjid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufficient as testimony of the great role Shaikh ‘Adul-Muhsin Al-‘Abbaad has had on the Islamic University of Madeenah is what Shaikh Hammaad Al-Ansaaree said as recorded by his son, ‘Abdul-Awwal, in his biography of his father (2/597): <span style="color:#993300;">“The Islamic University (of Madeenah) is the university of Al-‘Abbaad, Az-Zayid and Shaikh Ibn Baaz.”</span> And then he began praising the days they spent together.</p>
<p><b>His Travels:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first trip that the Shaikh took outside of his hometown of Zulfi was when he went to Makkah for Hajj in 1370H. Then in 1371, he traveled to Riyadh to seek knowledge. He also traveled to Morocco. It is said that Shaikh ‘Abdul-Muhsin Al-‘Abbaad obtained his Master’s Degree from Egypt.</p>
<p><b>Some of the Shaikh’s profound Sayings:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I have in my possession notes from the various grades of school beginning from the third year of primary school, which are from the dearest and most precious of what I saved.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“From the most beloved of deeds to me and the most hoped for by me in the sight of my Lord is my immense love for the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger and my extreme hatred for those who hate them. And Allaah has indeed blessed me with boys and girls as children. I named four of my sons after the four rightly-guided Khaleefahs after first naming one with the name of the chief of Messengers, i.e. Muhammad. And I named some of my daughters after some of the Mothers of the Believers after naming one with the name of the leader of the believing women, i.e. Faatimah. I ask Allaah and seek a way to Him through my love for them and my hatred for those who hate them. And I ask Him to gather me in their company and to increase them in virtue and reward.”</p>
<p><b>His Students:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many of today’s scholars and well-known students of knowledge have studied under the Shaikh either through his classes in the University or the lessons he delivers in the Prophet’s Masjid. Amongst the most famous of them are:</p>

<p><b>His Connection with the Scholars:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He had a special relationship with many people of knowledge, especially those who would teach in the Islamic University, and not to mention those about whom he heard were people of virtue and good standing, As an example, he had a special relationship with <strong>Shaikh ‘Umar Fullaata</strong>, may Allaah have mercy on him, which can be seen in a lecture he delivered about him after his death, which was later transcribed and published.</p>
<p><b>His Writings:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh ‘Abdul-Muhsin Al-‘Abbaad has authored numerous books, some of which were either originally lectures or lessons he gave throughout the course of his life. Below are some of his well-known published books and treatises:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <i>‘Ishroona Hadeethan min Saheeh-il-Bukhaaree</i> [20 Hadeeth from the Narrations of Al-Bukhaaree]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">4. <i>‘Aqeedatu Ahlis-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah fis-Sahaabat-il-Kiraam</i> [The Creed of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah concerning the Noble Companions] This book is available on Al-Ibaanah.Com as a free downloadable e-book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. <i>Fadlu Ahlil-Bait wa ‘Uloo Makaanatihim ‘inda Ahlis-Sunnati wal-Jamaa’ah</i> [The Virtue of the Members of the Prophet’s Household and their High Status amongst Ahlus-Sunnah]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. <i>‘Aqeedatu Ahlis-Sunnah wal-Athar fil-Mahdee-il-Muntadhar</i> [The Creed of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Athar concerning the Awaited Mahdee] This book was originally a lecture the Shaikh gave, which Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin Baaz, was present for and praised, and announced he would publish before it was completed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. <i>Ar-Radd ‘alaar-Rifaa’ee wal-Bootee</i> [A Refutation of Ar-Rifaa’ee and Al-Bootee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. <i>Al-Intisaar Lis-Sahaabat-il-Akhyaar</i> [Supporting the Excellent Companions – A Refutation of the False Allegations of Hasan Al-Maalikee]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">10. <i>Sharh ‘Aqeedah Ibn Abee Zaid Al-Qayrawaanee</i> [An Explanation of the Creed of Ibn Abee Zaid Al-Qayrawaanee] This explanation is based on various lesson he would give in the masjid. Shaikh ‘Abdul-Muhsin was one of the first Salafee scholars, if not the first, to explain this book. Shaikh Hammaad Al-Ansaaree, who died in the middle of 1418H said: “No Salafee scholar explained the Creed of Ibn Abee Zaid Al-Qayrawaanee. Only the Asha’rees have explained it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. <i>Min Aqwaal-il-Munsifeen fis-Sahaabee al-Khaleefah Mu’aawiyah</i> [From the Statements of the Impartial on the Companion, the Caliph Mu’aawiyah] This book has been translated and is available in the English language.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">13. <i>Fat’h-ul-Qawee-il-Mateen bi-Sharh-il-Arba’een</i> [Allaah’s Aid in Explaining An-Nawawee’s 40 Hadeeth] An excellent book in which the Shaikh explains An-Nawawee’s 42 hadeeth and Ibn Rajab’s additional 8 hadeeth – 50 in total.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. <i>Sharh Shuroot as-Salaat</i> [An Explanation of the Conditions, Pillars and Requirements of Prayer] This is a brief explanation of the classical work of Imaam Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab, which is pending publication by Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh &#8216;Abdul-Muhsin has many more books and treatises attributed to him, whether from his writings or a transcription of his lectures and lessons, which have not been mentioned here.</p>
<p><b>The Scholars’ Praise for him:</b></p>
<p>The great scholar, Hammaad Al-Ansaaree, may Allaah have mercy on him, said about him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Verily, my eyes did not see the likes of Shaikh ‘Abdul-Muhsin Al-‘Abbaad in terms of piety.” [<i>Tarjamah Hammad Al-Ansaaree</i> (2/621)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is important to note that Shaikh Hammaad said this even though he had met and accompanied great scholars the likes of Muhammad bin Ibraaheem Aali Shaikh, Al-Mu’allimee, Ibn Baaz and Al-Albaanee. So this is a significant testimony.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since Shaikh ‘Abdul-Muhsin Al-‘Abbaad was well-versed in the field of Hadeeth, the great scholar, Imaam Al-Albaanee, would rely on some of his verifications, as can be seen in his <i>as-Saheehah</i> (5/276). While authenticating a hadeeth about the Mahdee and quoting Ibn Al-Qayyim as saying it was good, he said: “Shaikh Al-‘Abbaad concurred with it in his treatise on the Mahdee.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He had a very strong relationship with his teacher, Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin Baaz. Whever someone would come from Madeenah (to Riyadh), he would ask them about Shaikh ‘Abdul-Muhsin Al-‘Abbaad, Shaikh Hammaad Al-Ansaaree and Shaikh ‘Umar Fullaata. [<i>Jawaanib min Seerah Ibn Baaz</i> (pg. 261)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Al-Albaanee, may Allaah have mercy on him, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I do not know of anyone equal to him in this era with devotion to the Hadeeth and vast research of it. I cannot do without nor do I see that anyone else can do without his books and benefiting from them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Examples of his Piety:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Shaikh served as president of the Islamic University of Madeenah, he didn’t abuse his position and take it as an opportunity to oppress the workers and employees. Shaikh Hammaad Al-Ansaaree relates: “I went to the University at the time of ‘Asr when Shaikh ‘Abdul-Muhsin served as its president. And there would be no one in the University except for him and me. So I said to him: ‘Why don’t you bring someone who will open the University for you before you come?’ He replied: ‘I will not make anybody work at this time because it is a time of rest.’ This was at the time of ‘Asr.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One graduate from the University related that when the Shaikh was president there he would not like to stop the university car on the road to buy things for the house. Meaning: Since the car was just to take him to and from work, he would not like to abuse this by using it for personal reasons.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On another occasion, when his term of presidency ended, his driver saw him standing on the street waiting, so he passed by him as usual and offered to take him home, but he replied: “I wouldn’t think of it. My term as president has ended and I called my son to come and get me.”</p>
<p><b>Examples of his Humor and Joking:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">In his lecture on Shaikh ‘Umar Fullaata’s biography, Shaikh ‘Abdul-Muhsin said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“From the funny incidents between us is that I would always joke with Shaikh ‘Umar about his age and how old he was even though he did not look it. One year while we were on Hajj, we went inside one of the tents in ‘Arafaat where we saw a man whose hair had become completely white – even his eyebrows. So I told Shaikh ‘Umar: ‘This man is from your peers’ – meaning he is old. After we sat down, the man looked at me and said: ‘I am your student. You taught me during the night courses of the primary school in Riyadh.’ This was around 1374H. While I was studying in Riyadh, I would teach voluntary courses in the evening at that school where most of the students worked during the day. So Shaikh ‘Umar, may Allaah have mercy on him, saw that as an opportunity to turn the tables around on me. Thereafter, he kept asking that man over and over again: ‘You are Shaikh ‘Abdul-Muhsin’s student?’”</p>
<p><b>His Lessons:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As mentioned before, Shaikh ‘Abdul-Muhsin holds regular lessons at the Prophet’s Masjid in addition to teaching in the University. He also holds some classes in his masjid. From the classical works that he would explain in the Haram during his lessons there and which can be found in the tape library at the Haram:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. An explanation of the abridgement of <i>al-Alfiyyah</i> of As-Suyootee (57 tapes)<br />
2. An explanation of the Creed of Ibn Abee Zayd Al-Qayrawaanee (14 tapes)<br />
3. An explanation of <i>Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree</i>, which he did not complete (623 tapes)<br />
4. An explanation of <i>Sunan An-Nasaa’ee</i> (414 tapes)<br />
5. An explanation of <i>Sunan Abee Dawood</i> (272 tapes) and still ongoing<br />
6. An explanation of the Book of Fasting from <i>al-Lul’lu wal-Marjaan</i> (7 tapes)<br />
7. An explanation of <i>Adaab-ul-Mashee ilaas-Salaat</i> (14 tapes)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah reward the Shaikh for his great efforts in educating the Muslims and spreading the truth and may He preserve him. The telephone number of the Shaikh in Madeenah is 04/8475207.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">BIOGRAPHY OF THE SHAIKH `ABDUR-RAHMAAN IBN NAASIR AS-SA`DEE -rahimahullaahu ta`aalaa</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Abridged from the book ‘ash-Shaikh `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Naasir as-Sa`dee wa juhooduhu fee tawdeehil-`Aqeedah’ of Shaikh `Abdur-Razzaaq `Abdil-Muhsin al-`Abbaad]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Firstly: His lineage.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is the great scholar, the pious person, the Zaahid (one who abstained from the unnecessary things of this world), the jurist, the scholar of the principles of Fiqh. The great scholar of al-Qaseem, and our Shaikh, Aboo `Abdillaah `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Naasir ibn `Abdillaah ibn Naasir ibn Hamd Aal Sa`dee, from the tribe of Banoo Tameem.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Secondly: His birth.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was born in `Unayzah, in al-Qaseem, on the twelfth of Muharram 1307H, and he lived as an orphan, without either of his parents.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Thirdly: His upbringing.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His father gave importance to his cultivation, and before his death he instructed his eldest son to look after him, and he took on the task of caring for him in the best manner. So he was equipped with a righteous environment, and with a great desire to seek knowledge, and he exerted in it day and night, day after day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Fourthly: His characteristics.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) His physical characteristics: He was of medium height, his hair was dense; and he had a full, round face, and a dense beard. He was whitish in colour, with a reddish tinge. He had a handsome face, with light upon it, and a pure complexion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) His manners: He was good-humoured, and beloved to the people on account of his good nature.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anger would not be seen upon his face.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He had a great degree of humility and modesty, and he was amiable, to an extent that is rarely found. He was humble with the young and the old, the rich and the poor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He had a high level of manners, decency, uprightness, and firm resolve in all his affairs. He abstained from the unnecessary things of this world, and was one who witheld (from asking). He had selfrespect, despite his possessing very little. He felt compassion towards the poor, the needy, and the strangers. He would give money to the poor and needy students, so that they could free themselves from preoccupation with seeking a livelihood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He loved to bring about peace and rectification between the people. His clothing was moderate in fineness, and avoided conspicuousness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Fifthly: His life in the field of knowledge.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His overriding concern in his life was to derive the benefit of knowledge, and to utilize his time for that. So he began with memorization of the Qur·aan at an early age, and he had memorized it proficiently by the age of eleven. Then he began acquiring the rest of the branches of Islamic knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He did not restrict himself whilst seeking knowledge to a single field of knowledge; rather he studied many fields: so he studied Tafseer, Hadeeth, Creed and Belief, Fiqh, Usool, Science of Hadeeth, the sciences of the language, and other than this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh gave a great deal of attention to the books of the two Shaikhs of Islaam: Ibn Taimiyyah and Ibnul-Qayyim; he devoted himself to reading and revising them, and to memorising and understanding them, and to writing and abridging them..</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He first sat to teach at the age of twenty three, and he used to divide his time between learning and teaching. He would spend some time in reading to the scholars, and some time in sitting to teach the students. He would also spend some time in referring to the books, and in researching within them. He would not allow any of his time to be lost without his utilising it, to such an extent that teaching in his city fell to him, and all of the students relied upon him with regard to their education.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Sixthly: His Shaikhs.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) Shaikh Ibraaheem ibn Hamd ibn Jaasir (1241-1338 H). He was the first Shaikh whom he read to. He learned from him Tafseer and Hadeeth, and the Principles (Usool) of both of them.<br />
(2) Shaikh Muhammad ibn `Abdil-Kareem ash-Shibl (1257-1343 H). He learned from him Fiqh, and its Principles, and the sciences of the Arabic Language.<br />
(3) Shaikh Muhammad ibn ash-Shaikh `Abdil-`Azeez al-Muhammad al-Maani` (1300-1385 H). He learned from him the sciences of the Arabic Language.<br />
(4) Shaikh Muhammad al-Ameen ash-Shanqeetee (1289-1351 H). He learned from him Tafseer, Hadeeth, Science of Hadeeth, and the sciences of the Language.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Seventhly: His students:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) Shaikh Muhammad ibn Saaalih al-`Uthaymeen. He took over from his Shaikh in the duty of Imaam of the Congregational Mosque of `Unayzah, and in teaching, admonishing, and delivering the khutbah.<br />
(2) Shaikh `Abdullaah ibn `Abdir-Rahmaan al-Bassaam. Member of the Discretionary Committee in the Western Region.<br />
(3) Shaikh `Abdul-`Azeez ibn Muhammad as-Salmaan. He studied in the Imaamud-Da`wah Institute in ar-Riyaad, and he followed the path of his shaikh in authorship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Eighthly: His writings:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Ibn Sa`dee -rahimahullaah- gave great attention to writing works. He produced many works in the different fields of Islamic knowledge. Some have been printed, while others are, as yet, unprinted. So from the printed works are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- ‘al-Adillatul-Qawaati` wal-Baraaheen fee Ibtaal Usoolil-Mulhideen’;<br />
2- ‘al-Irshaad ilaa Ma`rifatil-Ahkaam’;<br />
3- ‘Bahjatu Quloobil-Abraar wa Qurratu `Uyoonil-Akhyaar fee Sharh Jawaami`il-Akhbaar’, and it is presently being prepared and attended to;<br />
4- ‘Tawdeehul-Kaafiyatish-Shaafiyah’;<br />
5- ‘at-Tawdeeh wal-Bayaan lishajaratil-Eemaan’;<br />
6- ‘at-Tanbeehaatul-Lateefah feemahtawat `alaihil-Waasitiyyah minal-Mabaahithil-Muneefah’;<br />
7- ‘Tayseerul-Kareemir-Rahmaan fee Tafseer Kalaamil-Mannaan’;<br />
8- ‘ad-Durratul-Mukhtasarah fee Mahaasin Deenil-Islaam’;<br />
9- ‘Risaalah fil-Qawaa`idil-Fiqhiyyah’;<br />
10- ‘Risaalah Lateefah Jaami`ah fee Usoolil-Fiqhil-Muhimmah’; and it is before your eyes, along with annotations upon it;<br />
11- ‘Tareequl-Wusool ilal-`Ilmil-Ma·mool bima`rifatil-Qawaa`id wad-Dawaabit wal-Usool’;<br />
12- ‘al-Fataawas-Sa`diyyah’.They were gathered after his death -rahimahullaahu ta`aalaa.<br />
13- ‘al-Qawaa`idul-Hisaan li-Tafseeril-Qur·aan’;<br />
14- ‘al-Qawlus-Sadeed fee Maqaasidit-Tawheed’;<br />
15- ‘Manhajus-Saalikeen wa Tawdeehul-Fiqh fid-Deen’;<br />
16- ‘al-Wasaa·ilul-Mufeedah lil-Hayaatis-Sa`eedah’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ninthly: His illness and death:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He fell ill in the year 1371 H, i.e. five years before his death, with the illness of high blood pressure and arteriosclerosis, and it would strike him time after time, and he bore it patiently, until he moved on to his Lord, at the time of Fajr, on Thursday the 22nd of Jumaadal-Aakhirah 1376 H &#8211; may Allaah forgive him, and his parents, and our parents, and all of the Muslims.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><b>1330H-1420H: Imaam ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin ‘Abdillaah bin Baaz</b></p>
<p>Author : BinBaz.Org.sa<br />
Source: BinBaz.Org.Sa [Abridged and with Additions]<br />
Produced By: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Name and Lineage:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was the noble and exemplary scholar, ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin ‘Abdillaah bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan bin Muhammad bin ‘Abdillaah Aali Baaz, may Allaah have mercy on him. Baaz was a family that had deep roots in knowledge. business, and agriculture. They were known for their virtues and character. Shaikh Sulaymaan bin Hamdaan, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in his book on the biographies of the Hanbalee scholars: “Their origin was in Madeenah, then one of their ancestors moved to Dur’eeyah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Birth and Early Youth:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was born in Riyadh, the capital city of Najd on the 12th of Dhul-Hijjah, 1330H. This is where he spent his childhood, adolescence and early adult years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Baaz was raised in an environment engrossed in knowledge, since Riyadh at that time was filled with scholars and people of guidance. It was also a place of security and peace since King ‘Abdul-‘Azeez had re-conquered it and established justice there based on the laws of Islaam. This was after Riyadh had been a place of endless turmoil and instability.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Baaz first started by learning the Qur’aan as was the custom of the Salaf, who would memorize and master the Qur’aan before moving on to other subjects. So he memorized the entire Qur’aan by heart before reaching the age of puberty. He then went on to study at the hands of the scholars in his area.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also important to note that his mother, may Allaah have mercy on her, played a large role in his path towards knowledge, since she would be the one who would constantly encourage and incite him towards acquiring knowledge, as he stated towards the end of one of his lectures, “My journey with the writers”, in which he discussed some examples of his life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Baaz had sight for the first part of his life. Then due to Allaah’s infinite wisdom, He willed that the Imaam’s sight weaken due to an eye disease in 1346H, which eventually lead to him completely losing his eyesight in 1350H when he was close to twenty years of age. However, this did not prevent him from his perseverance and diligence in seeking knowledge, which he continued to do and excel in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Remarkably, losing his eyesight was a means of benefit for Imaam Ibn Baaz, since he was able to achieve several advantages of which we will mention four, as an example and not to limit:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1. Reward from Allaah:</b> Imaam Al-Bukhaaree reported in his Saheeh a hadeeth qudsee, in which Allaah said: <b>“If my servant is tested with losing his two beloved (eyes), I will substitute them with Paradise.”</b>[Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: no. 5653]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>2. Strong Memorization:</b> Imaam Ibn Baaz was the Haafidh (Memorizer) of this era when it came to Knowledge of Hadeeth. If you were to ask him on a hadeeth found in the Six Collections of Hadeeth or other collections such as the Musnad of Imaam Ahmad, you would find him well versed in the hadeeth’s chain of narration, textual wording, the scholars who spoke on it, its narrators and its explanation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>3. Lack of Interest in Worldly Splendors:</b> Imaam Ibn Baaz refrained from chasing after the pleasures of the worldly life, living an abstentious and humble lifestyle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>4. High Determination:</b> Losing sight, only made Imaam Ibn Baaz more determined and perseverant in his quest for seeking and acquiring knowledge, to the point that he became one of the senior scholars, known throughout the world. Allaah indeed replaced the light in his eyes with light in his heart, love for knowledge, and following of the Prophet’s Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Teachers:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After memorizing the Qur’aan, Imaam Ibn Baaz, may Allaah have mercy on him, went on to study the other Islaamic sciences under many of the scholars of Riyadh, the most prominent of whom were:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Shaikh Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Lateef Aali Shaikh, the great-great grandson of Imaam Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab,<br />
2. Shaikh Saalih bin ‘Abdil-‘Azeez Aali Shaikh, the great-great grandson of Imaam Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab and the Chief Judge of Riyadh,<br />
3. Shaikh Sa’ad bin Hamad Al-‘Ateeq, Judge of Riyadh,<br />
4. Shaikh Hamad bin Faaris, Vice-Chancellor of the Treasury of Riyadh,<br />
5. Shaikh Sa’ad Waqqaas Al-Bukhaaree, from the scholars of Makkah whom he learned the science of Tajweed from in 1355H,<br />
6. Shaikh Muhammad bin Ibraaheem Aali Shaikh, former Chief Muftee of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. He attended his study circles for about ten years, learning all of the Islamic sciences from him, from 1347H to 1357H, when his teacher nominated him to be a judge. May Allah have mercy on all of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Educational Life:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Imaam Ibn Baaz was selected for being the Judge of the Kharj district, he accepted it unwillingly since he had no desire or love for position. But it was due to the encouragement of his teacher, Shaikh Muhammad bin Ibraaheem Aali Shaikh, and the order of King ‘Abdul-‘Azeez that he took up the position. So he went to ad-Dalam, the capital city of the Kharj district at that time, and the people greeted him warmly. As soon as he got out of the car that transported him there, he ascended the Central Mosque and prayed two rak’at, in accordance with the Sunnah. Then he rested for a while in the presence of the Ameer of ad-Dalam at that time, Naasir bin Sulaymaan al-Huqbaanee, may Allaah have mercy on him. Thereafter the people gathered around him and so he gave them a profound admonition. From the things he told them was that he had no desire to be the Judge of their district but that he was ordered and so he must obey the leader.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As soon as he commenced working at his position, Allaah brought much good through his hands and he judged the people with justice and kindness. He served in this position for a little over fourteen years. During this time, the Kharj district became a place of good and uprightness. Imaam Ibn Baaz would attribute this success to the good hearts of the people and their high esteem for virtue and justice. Because the courts were in ad-Dalam, he lived there in the Judge’s Residence given to him by Imaam ‘Abdullaah bin Faysal bin Turkee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Baaz was well known throughout the Muslim world for his religious verdicts (<i>fataawaa</i>) and his beneficial books. He would preside over committees for educational seminars in Saudi Arabia, and give various lectures over the telephone to Muslims outside of the Kingdom. He would also answer the questions of the people over the radio and during the blessed times of Hajj and Ramadaan. And his words would appear in Muslim newspapers, magazines, and articles throughout the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Books and Treatises:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though the Imaam was pressed for time as a result of his duties and role in giving da’wah and educating, he still made time to write books and treatises that addressed important issues, which the Muslims were in need of knowledge of. Amongst his most famous works were:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The Obligation of Following the Sunnah<br />
2. The Ideological Attack<br />
3. The Life and Call of Imaam Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab<br />
4. Three Treatises on the Prayer<br />
5. The Correct Belief and what Opposes It<br />
6. Important Lessons for the Muslim Ummah<br />
7. A Criticism of Arab Nationalism<br />
8. The Dangers of Tabarruj<br />
9. Two Essays on Fasting and Zakaat<br />
10. The Ruling on Pictures<br />
11. The Ruling on Celebrating the Prophet’s Birthday<br />
12. A Warning against Innovations</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there are many more books, which can be read and printed at the Imaam’s official web site binbaz.org.sa. This was in addition to his many fataawaa (religious verdicts) that were collected, compiled and published, which range in numerous volumes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Educational and Religious Positions:</b><br />
1. He served as a Judge in the Kharj District of Saudi Arabia for fourteen years from 1357H to 1371H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. He taught at the Educational Institute of Riyadh in 1372H and in the College of Sharee’ah after its inception in 1373H, covering the subjects of Fiqh, Tawheed and Hadeeth. He remained in this teaching position for nine years until 1380H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. In 1381H, he was appointed Vice-Chancellor of the Islamic University of Madeenah, where he served until 1390H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. He was then appointed as the Chancellor of the Islamic University of Madeenah in 1390H, after its former Chancellor, Shaikh Muhammad bin Ibraaheem Aali Shaikh died in Ramadaan of 1389H. He remained in this position until 1395H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. In 10/14/1395H, the King ordered that Imaam Ibn Baaz be appointed as Head of the Council for Islamic Research, Verdicts, Da’wah and Guidance. He held this position until 1414H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. In 1/20/1414H, the King appointed Imaam Ibn Baaz as the Chief Muftee of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. He held this position along with being the Head of the Council of Senior Scholars and the Head of the Committee for Islamic Research and Verdicts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>He also held the following positions:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Head of the Permanent Committee for Islamic Research and Verdicts,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. President and Member of the Founding Committee for the Muslim World League,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. President of the higher World League Council,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. President of the World Supreme Council for Mosques,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. President of the Islamic Fiqh Assembly in Makkah, which is under the Muslim World League,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. Member of the Higher Council of the Islamic University of Madeenah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. Member of the Supreme Committee for Islamic Propagation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Students:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Baaz, may Allaah have mercy on him, had numerous students that would attend his classes and study circles. The most famous and distinguished among them were:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Muhammad bin Saalih Al-‘Uthaimeen, former member of the Council of Senior Scholars, may Allaah have mercy on him,<br />
2. ‘Abdullaah bin Hasan Al-Qu’ood, current member of the Permanent Committee for Islamic Research and Fataawaa and of the Council of Senior Scholars,<br />
3. ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Ghudayyaan, current member of the Permanent Committee for Islamic Research and Fataawaa and of the Council of Senior Scholars,<br />
4. ‘Abdul-Muhsin Al-‘Abbaad, former Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor of the Islamic University of Madeenah,<br />
5. Saalih bin Fawzaan Al-Fawzaan, current member of the Permanent Committee for Islamic Research and Fataawaa and of the Council of Senior Scholars,<br />
6. Rabee’ bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee,<br />
7. ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin ‘Abdillaah Ar-Raajihee</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Physical Attributes and Appearance:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh, may Allaah have mercy on him, was of medium build, and neither tall nor short. He had a round face and was of a golden-brown color. He had a curved nose and a beard that was short on the cheeks but thick below the chin. His beard used to be black, but when too many white hairs started showing, he dyed it with henna. Indeed, his description resembled that of many of the scholars before him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He had a beautiful appearance. He would always try to wear white garments, and would love wide clothes, and thawbs that would reach the middle of his shin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Humility and Piety:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Imaam knew his own worth and so he would be very humble before Allaah. So he would treat the people in a kind manner, with gentleness and mercy. He would not transgress over anyone or show arrogance to anyone. He would not give a false impression of grandness nor would he get up to the leave when in the company of the poor and needy, or refrain from walking and intermingling with them. He would also never turn away from listening to the advice of those who were below him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What also showed his humbleness was that he would answer the invitation of his students and close friends to come to their wedding gatherings. He would always arrive early and ask one of the brothers to recite some <i>ayaat</i> from the Qur’aan, which he would then go on to explain to everyone present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Death:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Baaz passed away on Thursday, the 27th of Muharram, 1420H (5/13/1999), due to heart failure. He was 89 years old at the time. Millions of people throughout the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia gathered to witness his funeral prayer and he was buried in the ‘Adl Cemetery in Makkah. Muslims throughout the world mourned his loss and it was only a few months later that the Muslim world would lose another great scholar, Imaam Al-Albaanee, may Allaah have mercy on them both.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">FOREWORD</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allaah and may the peace and blessings of Allaah be on His Messenger. This book you have before you is a translation of a small pamphlet that was prepared, printed and distributed by Maktabah Al-Idreesee from San&#8217;aa, Yemen concerning &#8220;<em>The Scholars&#8217; Praise for Shaikh Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee Al-Madkhalee.</em>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This treatise was also made available over the Internet as a downloadable file in such sites as rabee.net and alsalafia.com. This is where we obtained our source for this current translation. So we encourage all readers who wish to access the Arabic source for this book to go to the above mentioned web sites and download the file called &#8220;<em>Shifaa-ul-&#8216;Aleel fee Thanaa-il-&#8216;Ulamaa &#8216;alaa Ash-Shaikh Rabee</em>&#8216;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There were many reasons for selecting this current book for translation and publishing. <strong>The first and most important</strong> of them was to allow the Muslims to become acquainted with who the scholars of our time are and to get a first hand look at how the scholars of Ahl-us-Sunnah praise and commend one another. <strong>Secondly</strong>, in recent times there have been big debates amongst the Muslims, especially those of them who adhere to the way of the Salaf, on certain issues concerning this noble Shaikh. We felt that this is largely due to their being unaware of who Shaikh Rabee&#8217; is and what the scholars have said about him. Shaikh Rabee&#8217;, as indicated by Shaikh AlAlbaanee, is in our current times, the leading personality in the field of Al-Jarh wat-Ta&#8217;deel (i.e. declaring who is reliable, trustworthy and upon the correct way from those who are unreliable and on a deviant way). At times, this field requires those specialized in it to speak about certain popular and renowned figures in order to clarify their mistakes or expose their deviations. So no doubt, Shaikh Rabee&#8217; has spoken against some callers and teachers in the Muslim world that are esteemed by many. But this was only part of his sincere advice, as he was fulfilling his duty of clarifying to the ummah the mistakes of certain people so that the Muslims will not follow them in that. But unfortunately the result of this at times is that the Muslims do not readily accept from him and question his authority, and even go further and ridicule and belittle him. So we felt that it was important, especially amidst the rumors and lies being spread about this noble scholar, to present our Muslim readers with the present treatise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, we ask Allaah to reward all those brothers in charge of putting the book together in its Arabic form, namely the brothers in Yemen. They have also included several footnotes, which add clarification to certain issues and they have categorized the treatise into easy to read and access sections. So may Allaah reward them with the best of rewards and may He make this treatise a source for strengthening and putting light to this blessed da&#8217;wah of the Way of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Written by abu maryam isma&#8217;eel alarcon</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">INTRODUCTION</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Verily, all praise is due to Allaah, we praise Him, we seek His assistance and we ask for His forgiveness. We seek refuge in Him from the evils of our souls and the evils of our actions. Whoever Allaah guides, no one can lead him astray and whoever is caused to go astray, there is no one that can guide him. I bear witness that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah &#8211; alone with no partners. And I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O you who believe, fear Allaah as He ought to be feared and do not die except while you are Muslims.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O mankind, fear Allaah who created you from a single soul (Adam) and from that, He created its mate (Eve). And from them He brought forth many men and women. And fear Allaah to whom you demand your mutual rights. Verily, Allaah is an ever AllWatcher over you.&#8221;</strong> [Surah An-Nisaa: 1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O you who believe, fear Allaah and speak a word that is truthful (and to the point) &#8211; He will rectify your deeds and forgive you your sins. And whoever obeys Allaah and His Messenger has achieved a great success.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Ahzaab: 70-71]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, the best of speech is the Book of Allaah, and the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam. And the worst of matters are those that are newly invented, for every newly invented matter is an innovation, and every innovation is a misguidance and every misguidance is in the Hellfire. To Proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah had indeed promised us that He would protect His Religion and that He would preserve His Book and His Prophet&#8217;s Sunnah, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Verily, We have revealed the Dhikr (Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah) and surely We will preserve it.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Hijr: 9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Allaah&#8217;s way of preserving His Religion &#8211; as well as His mercy for His servants &#8211; is that He has prepared for it men who will continue to pass it down to those that come after them, in its pure and unadulterated form, free from any defects. These are the individuals who recorded the Knowledge and the Religion in books while preserving that in their hearts &#8211; not growing weak or tired of doing that until they reached their graves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These people are the scholars &#8211; the adherents to the Qur&#8217;aan and the Hadeeth and the inheritors of the Prophets, who defend Allaah&#8217;s Religion and fight to clarify His Prophet&#8217;s Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has given the scholars a high and lofty position in Islaam, as well as an honorable rank amongst mankind, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Allaah will raise those who believe amongst you and who have been given knowledge, many levels.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Say: Are those who have knowledge equal to those who do not have knowledge?&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Mujaadilah: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has commanded us to refer our questions to them and to turn back to their sayings. And He made that like a certification on their part, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And We have not sent before you except men whom We gave revelation to. So ask the people of dhikr (remembrance, i.e. knowledge) if you don’t know.&#8221;</strong> [Surah An-Nahl: 43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of dhikr are the scholars &#8211; those who have knowledge of what Allaah revealed to His prophets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Ad-Dardaa, radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu, reported:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;I heard the Messenger of Allaah, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, say: &#8216;Whoever treads a path, by which he seeks knowledge, Allaah will pave a way for him to Paradise because of it. Verily, the angels lower their wings out of contentment for the seeker of knowledge. And indeed, everything in the heavens and in the earth &#8211; even the fish in the sea &#8211; asks forgiveness (from Allaah) for the scholar. The virtue of the scholar over the worshipper is like the virtue of the moon over all the stars. Truly, the scholars are the inheritors of the prophets. And indeed the prophets do not leave behind any deenar or dirham (currency) for inheritance, but rather they only leave behind knowledge as inheritance. So whoever takes hold of it, then he has taken hold of an abundant share (of inheritance).'&#8221;</span> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ayaat, ahaadeeth and athaar (narrations from the Salaf) concerning their high virtue are many. So they have the greatest share and the loftiest portion in terms of virtue and status. [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Brother, listen to the great words of the Imaam of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah, Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, when he spoke on the characteristics of the scholars and their effect on the people and the people&#8217;s effect on them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#3366ff;">&#8220;All praise be to Allaah who placed in every era, after the period of the messengers, remnants from the people of knowledge, who call those who deviated to guidance and who have patience with their harm. And with the Book of Allaah, they revive the dead and with the light of Allaah, they cause the blind to see. So how many people, whom the Devil has killed, have they revived? And how many people, who were lost and astray have they guided? So what a great effect do they have upon the people! And what an ugly effect do the people have on them! They (i.e. the scholars) take away from the Book of Allaah, the distortions of the extremists, the false claims of the liars and the wrong interpretations of the ignorant &#8211; those who hold high the banners of innovation and unleash the outbreaks of mischief (fitnah). So they are in disagreement with the Qur&#8217;aan, they are in opposition to the Qur&#8217;aan and they unanimously agree with one another to withdraw themselves from the Qur&#8217;aan. They say things about Allaah and about the Book of Allaah without knowledge. They talk about the ambiguous matters in speech and they deceive the ignorant people on matters that are obscure to them. We seek refuge in Allaah from the fitan (trials) of the misguided ones.&#8221;</span> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So look at the biographies of the noble and distinguished Scholars and Muhadditheen throughout the history and generations, from the time of the righteous Sahaabah and their Successors (Taabi&#8217;een), then those that came after them from the eminent Imaams, to this current day of ours. You will find that they sacrificed their lives, their wealth and their time for the sake of being sincere to Allaah, His Book, His Messenger, the Muslim leaders and their common folk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the right that these scholars possess over others is that they (the people) do not mention them except with goodness. And whoever mentions them in an evil way, then he is on other than the Correct Path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is from the principles of Ahl-us-Sunnah and from the requirements of their beliefs, that it is an obligation to love the People of the Sunnah, to praise and speak highly of them and to not criticize them. This is such that the Salaf, may Allaah have mercy on them, considered the criticizing of Ahl-us-Sunnah and those who defend the Sunnah to be from the signs of the people of innovation and misguidance. In fact, they would consider a person to be from the people of innovation by just him criticizing the scholars (alone).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, rahimahullaah, said: <strong>&#8220;If you see a man slander Hamaad Ibn Salamah then have doubt about his Islaam, for indeed he (Hamaad) was harsh against the innovators.&#8221;</strong> [AsSiyar (7/447)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Zur&#8217;ah, rahimahullaah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If you see a man from Koofah speak vilely about Sufyaan Ath-Thawree and Zaa&#8217;idah, then no doubt he is a Raafidee. And if you see a person from Shaam speak vilely about Mak-hool and AlAwzaa&#8217;ee, then no doubt he is a Naasibee. And if you see a person from Khurasaan speak vilely about &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Al-Mubaraak, then no doubt he is a Murji&#8217;ee. And know that all of these groups are united in their hatred for Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, because there is no one amongst them except that he has in his heart an arrow (ready) for him, which cannot be recovered from.&#8221; [Tabaqaat-ul-Hanaabilah (1/199-200)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Na&#8217;eem Ibn Hamaad, rahimahullaah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If you see a man from Iraq speak (badly) about Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, then have doubt about his Religion. And if you see a person from Basrah speak (badly) about Wahb Ibn Jareer, then have doubt about his Religion. And if you see a man from Khurasaan speak (badly) about Ishaaq Ibn Raahawaih, then have doubt about his Religion.&#8221; [Taareekh Baghdad (6/438) and Taareekh Dimashq (8/132)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Ja&#8217;far Ibn Muhammad Ibn Haaroon Al-Mukhramee, rahimahullaah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If you see a man attacking Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, then know that he is an innovator, a deviant.&#8221; [Taqdimah Al-Jarh wat-Ta&#8217;deel (pg. 308-309) and Taareekh Dimashq (5/294)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Haatim Ar-Raazee, rahimahullaah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If you see a person from Rayy or anyone else hating Abu Zur&#8217;ah, then know that he is an innovator.&#8221; [Taareekh Baghdad (10/329) and Taareekh Dimashq (38/31)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Abu Haatim, rahimahullaah, also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>A sign of the people of innovation is their battling against the people of Narrations</strong>.&#8221; [As-Sunnah of Al-Laalikaa&#8217;ee (1/179)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Abu &#8216;Uthmaan As-Saaboonee, rahimahullaah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The signs of the people of innovation are clear and obvious. The most apparent of their signs is their severe enmity for those who carry the reports of the Prophet.&#8221;</strong> [&#8216;Aqeedat-us-Salaf (pg. 101)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Safaareenee, rahimahullaah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And we are not focusing on mentioning the virtues of the people of Hadeeth, for indeed their virtues are well known and their merits are many. So whoever belittles them, then he is despicable and lowly. And whoever hates them, then he is from the backward party of the Devil.&#8221; [Lawaa&#8217;ih-ul-Anwaar (2/355)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among these distinguished scholars and eminent Mujaahideen is the Shaikh, the ‘Allaamah, Abu Muhammad Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee &#8216;Umair Al-Madkhalee, may Allaah continue to let him remain in defense of His Religion and cause us to benefit from this prolonging of his life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh, may Allaah preserve him, has truly worked hard to clarify the Sunnah, and he has struggled intensely to explain what the Correct Way is. All of this is from his sincerity to Allaah, His Book, His Messenger, the Muslims leaders and their common folk. So how many confused people did he cause to see, and how many people who went astray did he direct to the way of guidance? So we ask Allaah to grant him the best reward for what he has done on behalf of Islaam and the Muslims. And we ask Allaah to place him, as well as us, in the company of the prophets, the siddeeqeen (those who believed in the prophets), the martyrs, and the righteous &#8211; and what a great company they are.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, there is no doubt that for every good blessing that exists (for someone) there is someone envious of it, and for every truth, there is someone who rejects or denies it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh &#8216;Abdul-Lateef Aali Shaikh, rahimahullaah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;From the natural habit of the people of innovation is that when they are broke of possessing any proofs and the avenues (of arguing) have become constricted for them, they cast faults and blemishes on the Ahl-us-Sunnah and criticize them, while praising themselves.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Raafidah (group) met their ruin at the hands of the Prophet&#8217;s Companions, and so did the people of the Great Slander (against &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah). And likewise, Ahmad Ibn Abee Duwaad and others from the Mu&#8217;tazilah met their destruction with Ahmad Ibn Hanbal. And Ibn Makhloof AlMaalikee met his ruin at the hands of Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah. As-Subkee met his ruin at the hands of Al-Haafidh Adh-Dhahabee and so did Ibn Dihlaan and his followers from the Sufis at the hands of Shaikh-ul-Islaam Muhammad Ibn &#8216;Abdil-Wahhaab, as well as all the other followers of the Shaytaan who met their fate at the hands of the followers of Ar-Rahmaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this was due to Allaah testing His servants from Ahl-us-Sunnah to know who the truthful and believing ones were from the lying and hypocritical. And it was so Allaah could increase the reward of these servants of His, due to the criticism they receive from those who are astray and lead others astray.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In order to clarify the truth and to advise the ummah, we decided to distribute and spread these words and recommendations that the noble scholars have given to Shaikh Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee AlMadkhalee. This is so that one who is unaware (of the Shaikh) could know his status and so that the hearts of the believers could be at rest and tranquility and so that someone who is ruined at his hands does not fall into such a circumstance without first being informed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And all praise be to the One, through whose grace, all good deeds are completed. And may the peace and blessings of Allaah be on Muhammad and on his family and Companions. [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">A BIOGRAPHY OF SHAIKH RABEE’ IBN HAADEE AL-MADKHALEE [5]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>His Name and Lineage:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is the Shaikh, the ‘Allaamah , the Muhaddith, Rabee’ Ibn Haadee Ibn Muhammad ‘Umair AlMadkhalee from the tribe of Mudaakhala, a well-known tribe in the Jaazaan district in the southern part of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This is one of the tribes of Banoo Shabeel. Shabeel was Ibn Yashjab Ibn Qahtaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>His Birth:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was born in the village of Jaraadiyah, which is a small village to the west of the town of Saamitah, close to three kilometers away from it. Now, the village is connected to that town. He was born in the year 1351H, towards the last part of the year. His father passed away almost a year and a half after his birth, so he was raised and brought up in the house of his mother, may Allaah have mercy on her. She supervised him and took charge of raising him in the best possible manner, and she taught him good characteristics, such as honesty and trustworthiness and to be motivated about making the prayers. She would make him go pray, while under the supervision of his paternal uncle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>His Educational Upbringing:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Shaikh reached the age of eight, he joined the study circles of the village. There, he learned proper handwriting and recitation (of the Qur’aan). From those who taught him handwriting, were Shaikh Shaibaan Al-‘Areeshee and Al-Qaadee Ahmad Ibn Muhammad Jaabir Al-Madkhalee. He also learned under a third person, called Muhammad Ibn Husain Makkee from the town of Sibyaa’. He studied the Qur’aan under Shaikh Muhammad Ibn Muhammad Jaabir Al-Madkhalee, as well as the subjects of Tawheed and Tajweed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Afterwards he studied in the Salafee School of Saamitah. From the teachers whom he studied under in this school, were: the knowledgeable, Shaikh Naasir Khaloofah At-Tiyaash Mubaarakee, rahimahullaah, who was a famous scholar from the major students of Shaikh Al-Qar’aawee, rahimahullaah. He studied the books Buloogh Al-Maraam and Nuzhat-un-Nadhr of Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr under him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he joined the educational institute in Saamitah after that, and there he studied under a number of noble Mashaayikh, the most famous of whom, generally speaking, were: Shaikh Haafidh Ibn Ahmad Al-Hakamee &#8211; the well-known great scholar, rahimahullaah, and his brother, Shaikh Muhammad Ibn Ahmad Al-Hakamee. He also studied under the great scholar, the Muhaddith, Ahmad Ibn Yahyaa An-Najmee, may Allaah preserve him, and the Shaikh, the ‘Allaamah, Dr. Muhammad Amaan Ibn ‘Alee Al-Jaamee, rahimahullaah. He also studied under the Shaikh, the Faqeeh Muhammad Sagheer Khameesee the book Zaad Al-Mustaqni’ with regard to the subject of Fiqh. And there are many others whom the Shaikh studied under, such as in the subjects of Arabic Language, Literature, Eloquent Speech (Balaagha), etc. In the year 1380H, upon finishing his allotted time, the Shaikh graduated from the educational institute of Saamitah. In the beginning of the year 1381H, he joined the Faculty of Sharee’ah in Riyadh and stayed there for a period of one or two months. Then the Islaamic University of Madeenah opened, so he moved to Madeenah and joined the Islaamic University’s Faculty of Sharee’ah. He studied there for the length of four years and graduated in the year 1384H with a grade of Mumtaz (Excellent).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The teachers whom the Shaikh studied under while in the Islaamic University:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The Shaikh, the ‘Allaamah, the former Chief Muftee of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, ‘Abdul- ‘Azeez Ibn ‘Abdillaah Ibn Baaz, rahimahullaah, under whom he studied Al-‘Aqeedah AtTahaawiyyah.<br />
2. The ‘Allaamah, the Muhaddith, Shaikh Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee, rahimahullaah, under whom he studied the subject of Hadeeth and its chains of narration.<br />
3. The Shaikh, the ‘Allaamah, ‘Adul-Muhsin Al-‘Abbaad, under whom he studied the subject of Fiqh for three years, with the book Bidaayat-ul-Mujtahid.<br />
4. The Shaikh, the ‘Allaamah, the Haafidh and Mufassir, Muhammad Al-Ameen Ash-Shanqeetee, author of the book Adwaa-ul-Bayaan, under whom he studied the subjects of Tafseer and the Principles of Fiqh for four years.<br />
5. Shaikh Saalih Al-‘Iraaqee, under whom he studied ‘Aqeedah (Creed).<br />
6. The Shaikh, the Muhaddith, ‘Abdul-Ghaffaar Hasan Al-Hindee, under whom he studied the Science of Hadeeth and its terms.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After graduating from the Islaamic University of Madeenah, he worked as a teacher in one of the learning institutes of the Islaamic University for a while. Then he joined the Department for Higher Studies at Umm Al-Qurraa University, where he continued his studies, obtaining his Masters Degree in the subject of Hadeeth in 1397H, by having completed his dissertation, which is well known as “Between the two Imaams, Muslim and Ad-Daaraqutnee.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then in the year 1400H, he obtained his Doctorate Degree from Umm Al-Qurraa also, with the grade of Mumtaz (Excellent). And this was because of his checking of the book “An-Nukat ‘alaa Kitaab Ibn As-Salaah” of Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr, rahimahullaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After that, he went back to working as a teacher in the Islaamic University (of Madeenah) in the Faculty of Hadeeth, where he taught Hadeeth and its Sciences. He became head of the Dept. of Sunnah in the Department for Higher Studies several times. Now, he currently holds the position of chair-holding professor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>His Attributes and Characteristics:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh, may Allaah preserve him, is distinguished by his great humbleness in front of his (Muslim) brothers, students, questioners and visitors. He is humble with regard to his household, his clothes and his means of transportation &#8211; not liking to have luxury in any of these things. He is also always joyful and with a cheerful countenance. He doesn’t fatigue his students with too much talk. And his gatherings are always filled with readings in Hadeeth and the Sunnah and warnings against innovation and its people, to the extent that a person that doesn’t know him well or mix with him, may think to himself that the Shaikh doesn’t preoccupy himself except with doing this! He loves the Salafee Students of Knowledge and he is polite to them and treats them nicely. And he strives to assist them with their needs as much as he is able to, both physically and financially. His home is always open to the students of knowledge, to the point that not one day passes that he is able to eat his breakfast or lunch or dinner by himself. And he inquires about his students and assists them and shares with them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is among the persistent and enthusiastic callers to the Qur’aan and the Sunnah and the Creed of the Salaf. Many in these times cannot equal his great zeal and passion for the Sunnah and the Creed of the Salaf. And in our time, he is from those who are defending this methodology of the Salaf As-Saalih, day and night, in hidden and in open, without letting the accusations of critics censure him, for the sake of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>His Books:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His books are many, all praise be to Allaah. The Shaikh has written on many important and required topics, especially that of refuting the people of innovation and desires in these times, in which the rectifiers are few and the troublemakers are many. His books include:[6]</p>

30. &#8220;The Islaamic Ruling concerning the one who reviles Allaah&#8217;s Messenger or criticizes some part of His Message&#8221; &#8211; This is an article that appeared in the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Qabs (Issue 8576) on 9/5/1977.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh has other books that we did not mention here. We ask Allaah to assist him in completing the good and to grant him the ability to do what He loves and is pleased with. Surely, Allaah has power over that and He is Able to do it</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>THE SCHOLARS&#8217; PRAISE FOR THE SHAIKH, DR. RABEE&#8217; IBN HAADEE &#8216;UMAIR AL-MADKHALEE</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>1. The Muhaddith, the &#8216;Allaamah, Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In a cassette [7] the following question was presented to the Shaikh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Despite the stance that the two Shaikhs, Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee Al-Madkhalee and Muqbil Ibn Haadee Al-Waadi&#8217;ee, have taken in fighting against innovations and the deviant opinions and sayings, some of the youth have doubts as to if the two Shaikhs are upon the Salafee way.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Shaikh, rahimahullaah, answered by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Without a doubt, we praise Allaah, the Most High, for preparing for this upright Da&#8217;wah, which is based on the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah according to the methodology of the Salaf As-Saalih, numerous callers throughout the various parts of the Muslim lands. They are the ones who take charge of the communal obligation (fard kifaa&#8217;ee), when there are very few who take this responsibility in the Muslim world today. So degrading and belittling these two Shaikhs (Rabee&#8217; and Muqbil), who call to the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah and what the Salaf As-Saalih were upon and who wage war against those who oppose this correct methodology. As is quite clear to everyone, it either comes from one of two types of people. Either it comes from someone who is ignorant or someone who follows his desires&#8230; If he is ignorant, then he can be taught. But if he is one who follows his desires, then we seek Allaah&#8217;s refuge from the evil of this person. And we ask Allaah, Mighty and Sublime, to either guide him or break his back.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Shaikh, rahimahullaah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And furthermore, I want to say that what I saw from the writings of the Shaikh, Dr. Rabee&#8217;, was that they were beneficial. And I do not recall seeing any error on his part (in these books) nor any deviation from the methodology, which we are in conformity with him on and he with us.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, rahimahullaah, also said, commenting on the conclusion of the book <em>&#8220;Al-&#8216;Awaasim mimmaa fee Kutub Sayyid Qutb min Al-Qawaasim&#8221;</em> (Protection against the Dangers that are found in the Books of Sayyid Qutb):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Everything that you have refuted Sayyid Qutb in is true and correct. From this, it will become quite clear to every Muslim, who has some sort of Islaamic education, that reads this that Sayyid Qutb was not knowledgeable about Islaam, whether about its fundamental principles (Usool) or its subsidiary issues (Furoo&#8217;).[8] So may Allaah reward you, O brother (Rabee&#8217;) for fulfilling this obligation of clarifying and exposing his ignorance and deviation from Islaam.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>2. The Imaam, the Muhaddith, the &#8216;Allaamah, Shaikh &#8216;Abd-ul-&#8216;Azeez Ibn Baaz:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez Bin Baaz was asked about what he meant by his &#8220;Clarification&#8221; (a speech he gave), so he responded on (7/28/1412) in a cassette entitled &#8220;Explaining the Clarification&#8221;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This clarification that we spoke about &#8211; what was intended by it was the da&#8217;wah (call) of everyone &#8211; all of the callers and scholars &#8211; in a constructive criticism. And our intent was not our brothers in Madeenah from amongst the students of knowledge, teachers and callers. And our intent was not other than them from the people in Makkah or Riyadh or Jeddah. Rather, our intent was that of all the people in a general manner. And our brothers &#8211; the well-known mashaayikh in Madeenah &#8211; we have no doubt in them. They possess sound Creed and are from the Ahl-usSunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah, such as Shaikh Muhammad Amaan Ibn &#8216;Alee (Al-Jaamee), Shaikh Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee (Al-Madkhalee), Shaikh Saalih Ibn Sa&#8217;ad As-Suhaymee, Shaikh Faalih Ibn Naafi&#8217; and Shaikh Muhammad Ibn Haadee. All of them are known to us for their perseverance, knowledge and sound Creed…However, the callers to falsehood &#8211; those who hunt in murky water (i.e. aimlessly)9 &#8211; they are the ones who confuse the people. And they talk about these matters, saying &#8220;He meant by it such and such&#8221;, and this is not good. It is an obligation to take someone&#8217;s words according to the best manner of understanding.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in the tape &#8220;Sticking to the Salafee Manhaj&#8221;, which was recorded in the masjid of Shaikh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez Ibn Baaz (rahimahullaah) in Taa&#8217;if, Shaikh Rabee&#8217; gave a lecture on Thursday (3rd of Muharram 1413) called &#8220;Sticking to the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah&#8221;. In this talk, the Shaikh incited the people to follow these two sources while in the presence of Shaikh Bin Baaz. And after Shaikh Rabee&#8217; finished with his talk, Shaikh Ibn Baaz commented on it saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;In the Name of Allaah, and may the peace and blessings of Allaah be on Muhammad, his family, Companions and those who follow his guidance. All of us have listened to the words of the noble Shaikh Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee Al-Madkhalee on the subject of sticking to the Book and the Sunnah and warning against what opposes them and (warning against) the causes for splitting and dividing and being fanatical to one&#8217;s desires. And he has indeed done well and spoken correctly and benefited us, may Allaah reward him and multiply his reward. This is the obligation upon all of the ummah &#8211; to stick to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah and refer to them for judging affairs &#8211; whether small or big. So we ask Allaah that He grant the noble Shaikh Rabee&#8217; every good and that He reward him for his talk…&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the tape &#8220;Questions from Sweden&#8221;, Shaikh Ibn Baaz was asked about Shaikh Rabee&#8217; and responded by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed, Shaikh Rabee&#8217; is from the scholars of the Sunnah &#8211; (and then he mentioned Shaikh Muhammad Amaan Al-Jaamee with him and said) &#8211; the two of them are know to me for their knowledge and virtue.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also refer to the book &#8220;The Methodology of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah in Criticizing Men, Books and Groups&#8221; (of Shaikh Rabee&#8217;) to see Shaikh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez Ibn Baaz&#8217;s good words for this book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Truly, we don’t know any man that is upon what Shaikh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez Ibn Baaz was upon &#8211; inwardly and outwardly &#8211; from love of the Sunnah and support for its people and hatred for innovation and warning against its people, like Shaikh Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee is. The Shaikh did not cease to love him, praise him and recommend him &#8211; in fact, he granted him permission to something greater than all of this, and it was permission for him to teach in his masjid in Makkah. There he taught his well-known class on Fat&#8217;h-ul-Majeed &#8211; which continues until today &#8211; and this is a proof that the Shaikh died while he was pleased with him and with his manhaj (methodology). [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">3. The Muhaddith, the &#8216;Allaamah, Muqbil Ibn Haadee Al-Waadi&#8217;ee:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the cassette entitled &#8220;Questions from Hadhramaut&#8221;, Shaikh Muqbil was asked: &#8220;What is your opinion concerning those who say that Shaikh Rabee&#8217; is mutahawwir (rash and hasty)?&#8221; So the Shaikh responded by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Shaikh Rabee&#8217; has experience in knowing the current state of affairs because he lived with the Ikhwaan Al-Mufliseen for a long period of time. All praise be to Allaah, he is the best at rectifying these affairs and refuting the innovations of the innovators, so I ask Allaah to preserve him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the cassette &#8220;Question regarding the Sunnah posed to the great scholar of the lands of Yemen: Questions from the youth of Taa&#8217;if&#8221;, the Shaikh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;From those who have the most insight and knowledge of the groups (jamaa&#8217;aat) and the pollution of these groups in our time is the brother, Shaikh Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee, may Allaah preserve him. Whoever Shaikh Rabee&#8217; says about that he is a hizbee (partisan), then you will discover after a few days that he is really a hizbee.[11] You will remember that. An individual may conceal himself in the beginning &#8211; he doesn&#8217;t want that his true nature be discovered. But when he gains strength and followers and he knows that talk abut him will not harm him, he manifests and reveals what he is truly upon. So I advise that his (Shaikh Rabee&#8217;s) books be read and that benefit be derived from them, may Allaah preserve him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>4. The Shaikh, the &#8216;Allaamah, Muhammad Ibn Saalih Al-&#8216;Uthaimeen:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the cassette &#8220;Al-&#8216;Uthaimeen&#8217;s Meeting with Rabee&#8217; Al-Madkhalee and Muhammad Al-Imaam&#8221;, the Shaikh, rahimahullaah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed, we praise Allaah that He has enabled our brother, Doctor Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee AlMadkhalee to visit this province (in Saudi Arabia) so that those who are unaware of certain matters may know that our brother is on the side of the Salafiyyah &#8211; the way of the Salaf. May Allaah grant success to him and us. And I do not mean by &#8220;salafiyyah&#8221; that it is a separate and individual party (hizb) that opposes those apart from it amongst the Muslims. Rather what I mean by &#8220;salafiyyah&#8221; is that he is following the way of the Salaf in his methodology and especially in comprehending Tawheed and denouncing those who oppose it. And we all know that Tawheed is the foundation of the Message for which reason Allaah sent his messengers… Our Brother Shaikh Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee&#8217;s visit to this province and specifically to our region of &#8216;Unayzah, no doubt it will have an effect here. And it will become clear to many of the people what they were unaware of due to their inflaming, propagating and allowing their tongues to talk freely.12 And how many are the people that feel sorrow for what they have stated against the scholars when it becomes clarified to them that they were in fact correct.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then on the same tape, one of the people in the gathering said: “There is a question concerning the books of Shaikh Rabee’?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he, rahimahullaah, responded: “It is clear that this question is in no need of my response, for as Imaam Ahmad was once asked about Ishaaq Ibn Raahawaih – may Allaah have mercy on them all – so he said: “The likes of me is asked about Ishaaq? Rather Ishaaq should be asked about me!”13 I have already spoken at the start of my talk about what I know of Shaikh Rabee’, may Allaah gave him tawfeeq. And I still insist on what I stated then until now. And his coming here and his talk in which he informed me of what he did &#8211; no doubt &#8211; are from the things that only increases a person in his love for him and his supplicating for him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the tape “Shaikh Rabee’s meeting with Shaikh Ibn ‘Uthaimeen concerning the manhaj”, he, rahimahullaah, was asked the following question:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“We know about many of the deviations of Sayyid Qutb, but the only thing that I have not heard about him, but which I heard from one of the students of knowledge and which I am not satisfied with – is that Sayyid Qutb was from those who held the belief in wahdat-ul-wujood. Naturally, this is clear-cut disbelief. So was Sayyid Qutb from those who held the belief in wahdat-ulwujood? I hope for your response and may Allaah reward you. With good.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Shaikh, rahimahullaah, responded: “My examination of the books of Sayyid Qutb is little and I do not know of the condition of this man. However, the scholars have written remarks about his book on tafseer (i.e. Fee Dhilaal-il-Qur’aan), such as the books of Shaikh ‘Abdullaah Ad-Duwaish, rahimahullaah. Also, our brother Shaikh Rabee’ Al-Madkhalee wrote some remarks about Sayyid Qutb concerning his tafseer and other aspects. So whoever wants to refer to them, then he should refer to them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was also asked about Shaikh Rabee’ in the cassette “Questions from Sweden” and responded:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“With respect to Shaikh Rabee’, I do not know anything of him except good. And the man is one who possesses (knowledge and following of) the Sunnah and Hadeeth.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another tape entitled “Unveiling the contradictions of Ahmad Salaam”, which was a telephone link-up from Holland, the question was posed to the Shaikh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“What is your advice to the one who prevents the tapes of Shaikh Rabee’ Ibn Haadee from being distributed claiming that they will lead to fitnah (turmoil), and that in these tapes is praise for the leaders in Saudi Arabia &#8211; and this praise of his for the leaders is hypocrisy?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Shaikh answered: “Our view is that this is a mistake and a great error. Shaikh Rabee’ is from the scholars of the Sunnah and from the people of goodness. And his Creed is sound and his methodology is upright. But when he spoke out against some (popular) figures amongst the people of recent times, and he deafened them with (his exposition of) these faults…”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>5. Shaikh Dr. Saalih Ibn Fawzaan Al-Fawzaan:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his introduction to (Shaikh Rabee’s) book “Methodology of the Prophets in Calling to Allaah” (pg. 12-13), the Shaikh says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And this is because Islaam calls to gathering together upon the truth, as Allaah says: ‘That you should establish the Religion and not make division within it.’ [Surah Ash-Shooraa: 13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says: ’And hold firmly onto the Rope of Allaah – all of you together – and do not divide (into sects).’ [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since clarifying and explaining this matter is an obligation, a group amongst the scholars &#8211; that have protectiveness (of this Religion) and the ability to verify – took the responsibility of cautioning against the errors of these groups. And they took charge of explaining their opposition to the Call towards the Methodology of the Prophets, so that perhaps these groups may return to the truth &#8211; for indeed, arriving at the truth is the objective of the believer – and so that those who are unaware of the errors of these groups will not continue to be deceived by them. And from those scholars that have taken charge of this duty, acting on the hadeeth &#8211; (‘The Religion is sincerity. Religion is sincerity. Religion is sincerity.’ We said: ‘To who, O Messenger of Allaah?’ He said: ‘To Allaah, His Book, His Messenger, the Muslim leaders and their common folk’) – from those who clarified and advised is Shaikh Dr. Rabee’ Ibn Haadee Al-Madkhalee. In this book, which is before us, entitled “Methodology of the Prophets in Calling to Allaah”, he has explained &#8211; may Allaah grant him success and reward him with good &#8211; the methodology of the Messengers in Calling to Allaah according to what is stated in the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger. And he has compared this with the methodology of the opposing groups so that the difference between the methodology of the messengers and those various methodologies in opposition to the methodology of the messengers can become clear…”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his introduction to the book (also by Shaikh Rabee’) “One Group not many groups and One Path, not several”, the Shaikh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“However, during recent times, there appeared groups that ascribed themselves to the Da’wah and which were guided by leaders specific to their groups. Each of these groups made a specific methodology for themselves the result of which was dividing, differing and a constant struggle between these groups – all of which the Religion forbids and which the Book and the Sunnah prohibit. So when the scholars refuted this methodology employed by these groups, which was foreign to Islaam, some brothers set out to defend them. And from the people that defended these groups was the Shaikh ‘Abdur-Rahmaaan ‘Abdul-Khaaliq, by way of his printed treatises and recorded cassettes. He did all of this in spite of being advised not to do it by his brothers. Then he added to that, his reproaching and condemnation of those scholars that didn’t agree with him in his actions. And he labeled them with descriptions that were unbefitting of them, and he did not desist from that – not even against some of the sheikhs that taught him! The noble Shaikh, Rabee’ Ibn Haadee Al-Madkhalee took the responsibility of refuting him in this book, which the reader holds before him, by the title ‘One Group not many groups and One Path, not several.’ And I have read it and found that it sufficiently fulfills its objective, all praise be to Allaah.” And in the cassette “Questions from Sweden” (recorded on Rabee’-ul-Aakhira 1417H), the Shaikh said after mentioning Shaikh Rabee’ along with a group of other scholars:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“They are from the prominent scholars that have an active role in the Da’wah (Call) and in refuting those who desire to deviate from the correct way of the Da’wah. So his tapes must be distributed for there is a huge benefit in them for the Muslims.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>6. The &#8216;Allaamah, Shaikh Muhammad Ibn ‘Abd-il-Wahhaab Marzooq Al-Bannaa:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his introduction to the book “One Group not many groups and One Path, not several”, the Shaikh, may Allaah preserve him, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I know Dr. Rabee’ Ibn Haadee Al-Madkhalee from the days when I was a student at the Islamic University (in Madeenah) as someone who was anxious to learn the Sunnah and the Way of the Salaf As-Saalih, as well as to follow that methodology and call others to that Straight Path. I graduated with him and the brothers ‘Abdur-Rahmaan ‘Abdul-Khaaliq, ‘Umar Sulaymaan AlAshqar and Shaikh Muhammad Amaan Al-Jaamee along with some Sudanese students that were upon the same methodology of Da’wah in Sudan during the summer recess of that year. And amongst the best of those (of us) who stood firm on this path (of the Way of the Salaf) was Shaikh Rabee’ Ibn Haadee Al-Madkhalee. We ask Allaah that He continue his firmness, for he has filled the gap by defending the Sunnah and clarifying the mistakes of some people whom we bear witness to their virtuousness, yet whom many people are deceived by. This is such as his advice to the son, Shaikh ‘Abdur-Rahmaan (‘Abdul-Khaaliq) in the book ‘One Group not many groups and One Path, not several.’ And in this book, he clarifies the truth that he holds, so may Allaah reward him with the best reward and may He grant us, the brother ‘Abdur-Rahmaan, and all of the brothers, the methodology of the Straight Path. And may He protect us all from the deviant paths. And I have come to know of the death of Shaikh Muhammad Amaan Al-Jaamee, may Allaah forgive him and grant him a spacious place in Paradise. He was indeed among those who defended the Sunnah and who called to following the Way of the Salaf. I ask Allaah that He accept his efforts and that he forgive him and us.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>7. Shaikh Muhammad Ibn ‘Abdillaah As-Subayyal,</strong></span> chief caretaker of the affairs of Masjid Al-Haraam and Masjid An-Nabawee and the Imaam and khateeb of Masjid Al-Haraam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the book “An-Nasr-ul-‘Azeez ‘alaa Ar-Radd-il-Wajeez” (pg. 11), he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“All praise be to Allaah, and the peace and blessings on the one whom no prophet will come after him, Muhammad, and on his family and Companions. To proceed: Indeed, the noble Shaikh Rabee’ Ibn Haadee Al-Madkhalee, who is a professor at the Islaamic University of Madeenah, is from the well-known scholars and popular callers in the scholarly and educational circles in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. He is known for his authority in the sciences of the Sunnah as well as other subjects from the Islaamic Sciences. The Shaikh has a big role in calling to Allaah upon the methodology of the Salaf As-Saalih, defending the correct Salafee Creed and refuting those amongst the people of innovation and desires that oppose it by what is mentioned to him, so he is well thanked for that. So we ask Allaah to continue His blessing on him and that He increase him in his ability and his focus.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the cassette “Unveiling the contradictions of Ahmad Salaam” (tape 1), the following was recorded:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question: “What is your advice to the one who prevents (the distribution of) the tapes of the well known scholars from Ahl-us-Sunnah, such as Shaikh Muhammad Amaan Al-Jaamee, rahimahullaah, and Shaikh Rabee’ Ibn Haadee Al-Madkhalee, hafidhahullaah, to the point that he says that the Shaikh’s tapes will bring about fitnah?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh answered: “I seek refuge in Allaah, I seek refuge in Allaah…no. Look, the tapes of these two Shaikhs are from the best of tapes. They call the people to the Sunnah and to cling tightly onto the Sunnah, but no one talks bad about them except one who follows his desires. Most of the people that talk about them are the people of sects and parties – those who affiliate themselves with one of the groups or parties. They are the ones who make such statements. As for these two Shaikhs, then they are known for sticking to the Sunnah and for possessing a Creed in accordance with the way of the Salaf. And they are from the best of people.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>8. Shaikh Ahmad An-Najmee:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the first cassette of the tape set &#8220;The Rulings of the Scholars on the Statements of &#8216;Adnaan &#8216;Aroor&#8221;,[14] the Shaikh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;As for Shaikh Rabee&#8217; &#8211; he is known for his effort in clarifying the Sunnah and refuting the innovators. May Allaah reward him with good.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>9. Shaikh &#8216;Ubaid Al-Jaabiree:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was asked about Shaikh Rabee&#8217; on the cassette &#8220;A Clarification of some of the Errors of &#8216;Adnaan &#8216;Aroor, and it was said to him: &#8220;There is a lot of talk going on about Shaikh Rabee&#8217; &#8211; is he considered one of the scholars of the Muslims?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he responded: &#8220;Shaikh Rabee&#8217;, all praise be to Allaah, is well-known with the elite personalities and the scholars. And furthermore, our shaikh (teacher), Shaikh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez Bin Baaz has praised and approved of him. And I would not think that you would present this question to me.&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">CLOSING REMARKS</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a small treatise containing some of the praises of the scholars for Dr. Shaikh Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee Al-Madkhalee, may Allaah preserve him and guard him and make Paradise his and our final abode. These statements are only a small portion of the many praises that the scholars &#8211; those living and those who have passed away &#8211; have given to this noble scholar (Shaikh Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the testimony of the people of knowledge is sufficient for us as testimony. And Allaah has called on their testimony in His Book concerning the greatest matter that requires one&#8217;s testimony and that is Tawheed, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Allaah bears witness that No deity has the right to be worshipped, and so do the angels and those who have been given knowledge. (He is always) maintaining His creation with justice. There is no deity worthy of worship except Him, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Aali-&#8216;Imraan: 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And dear brother, do not be like the one about whom Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And when (news of) a matter comes to them concerning (matters of) security or fear, they propagate it…&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But rather implement the saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;But if they had only returned it back to the Messenger and those in authority amongst them, those amongst them who are able to derive a correct conclusion from it would have understood it (and made it known to them).&#8221;</strong> [Surah An-Nisaa: 83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And beware O brother of being from those about whom Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And those who harm the believing men and believing women undeservedly, they bear (on themselves) the crime of slander and plain sin.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Ahzaab: 58]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And remember the saying of the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Whoever says something about a believer that is not true about him will be locked away in the boiling puss of the Hellfire, until he turns back from what he said.&#8221;</strong> [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In these times, the false rumors and claims (against Shaikh Rabee’) have become widespread, but:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Indeed Allaah will defend those who believe. Verily Allaah does not love every treacherous, ungrateful person.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Hajj: 38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So O servants of Allaah, do not listen to what these prejudiced and spiteful people say in their belittling and defaming of the Ahl-us-Sunnah. Rather act on the saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O you who believe, if an evildoer comes to you with some news, then verify it, lest some people be afflicted by you due to ignorance and then you will feel remorse for what you did later.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Hujuraat: 6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And take heed of the saying of the Prophet: <strong>&#8220;It is enough of a lie for a person that he narrate everything he hears.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is our conclusion and may Allaah send His peace and blessings on our sayyid, Muhammad, his family and Companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]The source of this treatise was originally compiled by Al-Idreesee Salafi Bookstore of San&#8217;aa, Yemen under the supervision of the brother, Shaikh &#8216;Alee Hamood Al-Idreesee, may Allaah preserve him. Then some noble brothers placed additions to it, so may Allaah reward all of them with the best of rewards.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] This biography was taken from the book of Shaikh Rabee&#8217; &#8220;At-Ta&#8217;assub Adh-Dhameem wa Aathaaruhu&#8221; (The condemned form of fanaticism and its Effects), with some additions made to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] Translator’s Note: The titles of the Shaikh’s books have been translated into English, however, this does not mean that they are available in the English language. From the list, we only know of one that has been translated and printed in English and it is “The Methodology of the Prophets in Calling to Allaah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]Translator’s Note: All cassette titles were translated from Arabic to English. This does not mean that the tape is available in the English language unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] How can the Qutubi Surroris make this man &#8211; Sayyid Qutb &#8211; a mujaddid and an Imaam when he was ignorant of the fundamental aspects of Islaam before the subsidiary aspects!! By Allaah, this is something very strange! So abandon your lies O you whom Allaah has tested by means of this man and defending of him. Can someone who is ignorant of the fundamental aspects of Islaam be considered a mujaddid (reviver)?! What will he revive? Rather, this kind of person can only be a mujaddid (reviver) of innovations and a reviver of diseases that are deadly to Islaam and to the Muslims. And this is known from his books, for he has revived the views of the Jahmiyyah and the Mu&#8217;tazilah and the views of the Rawaafid and the Khawaarij and the views of the Sufis, such as that of wahdat-ul-wujood (Allaah and the creation are all one existence). This is what Sayyid Qutb has revived, so how can someone who has this condition be considered an Imaam? &#8211; unless he is an Imaam of misguidance! And that is what he is, may Allaah protect us from his fitnah and his evil. Many of the scholars have refuted Sayyid Qutb, including Shaikh &#8216;Abdullaah Ad-Duwaish, Shaikh Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee Al-Madkhalee (in four separate books) and Shaikh Mahmood Shaakir. The latter has refuted Sayyid Qutb in the issue of his reviling of the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger. But Sayyid Qutb did not pay heed to the refutation of Shaikh Mahmood Shaakir and instead was proud and stubborn and persisted in his reviling and belittling of the Companions as is quite clear in the Introduction of the book &#8220;Mataa&#8217;in Sayyid Qutb fee Ashaabi Rasoolillaah&#8221; (The Abuses of Sayyid Qutub against the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger) of Shaikh Rabee&#8217; [Second Printing]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] The ones whom Shaikh Ibn Baaz, rahimahullaah, is referring to here are: Salmaan Al-&#8216;Awdah, Safar AlHawaali and Muhammad Sa&#8217;eed Al-Qahtaanee, as well as all others that stand in need of clarification. And the Shaikh has called them &#8220;callers to falsehood&#8221; and &#8220;those who hunt in murky water (i.e. aimlessly)&#8221;, wa laa Hawla wa laa Quwata illaa Billaah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] How can he not be pleased with him and his methodology when it is the methodology of the Salaf AsSaalih (Righteous Predecessors) in protecting the Tawheed and the Sunnah from the distortions and lies of the people of innovations and misguidance?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]By Allaah, he has spoken the truth, for Shaikh Rabee&#8217; has informed us of (the condition of) many people and after a while, that which the Shaikh said about them began to manifest itself, may Allaah preserve him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12] These are the Hizbees (partisans) from the Ikhwaan Al-Muslimeen and the Suroori Qutubis!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] This is an assertion from the great scholar, Ibn &#8216;Uthaimeen, to the fact that Shaikh Rabee&#8217; is the Carrier of the Flag of Al-Jarh wat-Ta&#8217;deel. And also, this is a sign of the Shaikh&#8217;s humbleness, may Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14] This &#8216;Aroor has invented false and corrupt principles by which he tries to defend the people of innovation and misguidance. And he is from the extremists with regard to promoting Sayyid Qutb, to the point that he said: &#8220;I do not know of any person on the face of this earth that has spoken about the minhaaj (methodology) in the manner that Sayyid Qutb has spoken about it&#8221;!!! And he has many statements in which he praises Sayyid Qutb and commends and exalts his books. And &#8216;Aroor is well known for lying and falsifying information about him (i.e. in favor of Sayyid Qutb), may Allaah protect us from the evil of the Qutubis. And we ask Allaah that He expose them day after day. Many of the scholars have refuted &#8216;Aroor and have clarified his falsifications, deceptions and lies on the Salafees &#8211; not to mention Shaikh Rabee&#8217; from one perspective and &#8216;Aroor&#8217;s excessiveness with regard to Sayyid Qutb from another perspective. So O brothers, strive to find out about &#8216;Aroor and every misguided innovator so that you can beware of them, especially in these times in which the people of innovations, desires and calamities are many.</p>

He answered: O <em>Ameer al-Mumneen</em>! This is the sound of the mercy of Allaah, so how would it be if you heard the sound of the punishment of Allaah! ?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-‘Awza’ee said : Umar bin AbdulAzeez wrote a letter to us, no one memorized it except me and Makhool : ‘To proceed, indeed whoever remembers death a lot, then he is pleased with little in this world, and he who adds his speech in comparison to his action, then he lessens his speech except with that which will benefit him and as-salaam.’</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to Imaam Ahmad &amp; said : O Aba Abdillaah, look at these ahaadeeth indeed there is a mistake in them. So Imaam Ahmad said: Go to Abu Zakariya, for indeed he knows the mistake.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahya bin Manda said: It is said that Abu Huraira <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211; </em>had the most powerful memory from this <em>Ummah</em>, then it is Abu Zura’h ar-Razee.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hatim, Muhammad bin Idrees bin al-Mundhir al-Qhatfaanee ar-Raazee, who died in 277 A.H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He first started to memorize narrations when he was 14 years old, he was so knowledgeable that by just looking at the hadeeth he could give a judgement on it, whether it was authentic or not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hatim and Abu Zura’h were good friends.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam adh-Dahabee said: If Abu Hatim says someone is <em>thiqa’</em> (trustworthy), then hold onto his saying, because he does not make anyone <em>thiqa’</em> (trustworthy) except a narrator who has authentic hadeeth.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">It is said that the town from which an-Nisaa’ee came from, was named Nisa’ which means women, and the story behind it’s name is because when the Muslims came to conquer it during the earlier period of Islaam, the men were not present in the town, so the women came out to fight, when the Muslims saw that, they did not fight, because women are not fought against.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer mentions that Imaam an-Nisaa’ee was very beautiful and his face was like a candle.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>His Name &amp; Lineage</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AbdulAwal bin Hamad al-Ansaari said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Shaykh Hamad bin Muhammad al-Ansaari al-Khazraji as-Sa’adi – in lineage to Sa’ad bin ‘Ubadah al-Ansaari, the noble Companion -Radi Allaahu anhu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh left Africa, &#8211; the country of Mali- due to the humiliating colonisation over Africa at that time.  This was the French colonialism which was filthy, unrelenting, and terribly violent. It had eaten up everything whether it was green and alive, or dry and dead. It prevented people from becoming religious and seeking knowledge, it demolished the rights of the people of Islaam, in addition to many other problems, difficulties and types of corruption.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Shaykh was born in 1344 A.H. in a town called ‘Tadd Makkah’ in West Africa in the country of Mali.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Shaykh said: I was born in 1344 A.H. and that was the year King AbdulAziz took over al-Madina an-Nabaweeyah.  I came to know this while preparing for Hijra, I asked my mother when was I born? She replied: ‘In the year Ahl-ul-Najd[4] took over al-Madinah.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Shaykh’s father passed away when he was eight years old, so he was orphaned and lived in the shelter of his uncle, his mother’s brothers and his mother. Also those around him from amongst his relatives both on his father’s side and his mother’s side were students of knowledge, scholars, Muftis and judges.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he grew up in a purely knowledge based environment, in an environment where there were nothing of the modern day conveniences whatsoever, such as electricity, cars and planes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He lived in the most beautiful of surroundings, of greenery, forests, pure fresh water, beautiful breezes and clean air.  I heard him say more than once: ‘Indeed no one would wish to leave it due to all the goodness that was there, which was unlimited supplies of food, drink, in addition to recreation and other things.’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The people at the time of the Shaykh would memorise the Qur’aan using slates and boards.  The Shaykh of the scribes would write one or four Ayaat and the students would go away and memorise them, and then recite them to the teacher, then the teacher would wipe it clean and write other Ayaat for the students, and this is how they would memorise the whole Qur’aan.’[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘We in my country would share one book between a hundred men, and that was due to the absence of books.  We would divide up one book into sections of papers each person would take a section read it and memorize it.’[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Hijra From Mali to Saudi Arabia</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Shaykh used to tell us that he had a book of poetry that he had to leave behind in Africa, he did not bring it with him when he migrated to this blessed land (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia). This was because he left Africa escaping with only a Mus’haf (Qur’aan) fearing the colonialism of the French and the British.  The colonists would not allow anyone from the people of Africa to leave to go to the Haramain (the two major Masajid).  The Shaykh would tell us, that when he prepared to leave with two of his relatives, they had to leave in the night riding an animal, each one of them had a camel and they left, they <span style="color:#993300;">spent two years on their journey until they reached the port of Jeddah</span>.’[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I heard my father saying: ‘My journey from my country until I reached the Haramain (Makkah &amp; Madina) was an adventure.’[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard my father say: ‘When I exited from Mali, there were only two people with me on the journey, Shaykh ‘Amaar and Shaykh Uheed.  We left from the country in the year 1365 A.H. we would walk during the night and sleep during the day – it took us a complete year for the journey.’[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Nigeria</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘They passed by many countries like: ‘Niger’, ‘Nigeria’ ‘Sudan’ and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My father -Rahimullaah- met with some of the people knowledge in Nigeria, he met the Shaykh, the reviver, the scholar, as-Salafi, Abdullaah bin al-Mahmood ash-Shareef al-Hussni al-Madani, who spread the Dawat-us-Salafeeyah in the deserts of Mali.  Allaah guided nations of people on his hands away from the misguidance of grave worship, Tawwasul[12] with the righteous people, superstitions and Bida’ which had become widespread at their time in some of the African deserts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Abdullaah whom my father -Rahimullaah- met in Nigeria had come over from this blessed country (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia – may Allaah Ta’ala protect it &amp; honour it). Shaykh Abdullaah had from a young age spent this life in al-Madina an-Nabaweeyah, and he was the Imam of the Masjid an-Nabaweeyah ash-Shareef, and he was also a teacher there.’[13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘When my father met Shaykh Abdullaah al-Mahmood in Nigeria, he took many benefits and advice from him, the most important being when Shaykh Abdullaah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">‘O my son, when you reach the land of the Haramain, then adhere to the books of Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah and Ibn Qayyim.  And it is upon you to disseminate the ‘Aqeedah of the Salaf and spread their books. It is upon you to teach the people ‘Aqeedah and knowledge.’</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AbdulAwal bin Hamad al-Ansaari continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I heard my father say: ‘I was greatly affected by his advice, and I took that advice and it held a great status in my heart, and I decided to act upon that advice.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed Shaykh Abdullaah bin al-Mahmood al-Madani took permission from king AbdulAziz -Rahimullaah- to travel to Africa for Dawa’, and he gave him permission. When the Shaykh arrived in Africa he opened a school for learning Qur’aan, and Tawheed as-Salafi, we the younger ones benefitted from it, but the elders did not benefit from it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Shaykh gave Dawa’ there for thirty years and he died in 1373 A.H.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then my father said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">‘The reason why Shaykh Abdullaah al-Madani left Madina, was because the people of Madina [at that time].  When the Shaykh would go out to lead the prayer [in the Prophet’s Masjid] he would not allow the shops to be left open, he would not lead the people in the Masjid an-Nabawee until they closed their shops. So the people complained to King AbdulAziz about him, when the complaint reached him, the King AbdulAziz -Rahimullaah- wrote to the Shaykh and said: ‘I am certain that the people of Madina are not truthful, however to prevent chaos I hope that you will resign.’ So the Shaykh resigned and wrote to him and after that he went to Mali.’</span>[14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sudan</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘My father also met Shaykh Tahir as-Sowakinee in the country of Sudan, and took from him the knowledge of hadeeth and on his hands he became familiar with the books of hadeeth.  Shaykh Tahir was a scholar from the scholars of Sudan in hadeeth and other sciences; he had a great concern for the knowledge of hadeeth. Indeed I heard my father saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed I was affected by Shaykh Tahir as-Sowakinee in the knowledge of hadeeth, he advised me to learn it, and to acquire its books and to follow the Manhaj of its people.’[15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Makkah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘My father met with Shaykh Hamid Faqeeh in Makkah, and was greatly affected by him in more than just his knowledge or spreading the ‘Aqeedah of the Salaf, and his love for the books of Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah and his student Ibn Qayyim. Also the books of the Imams of Dawa’ beginning from its Imam Muhammad bin AbdulWahab at-Tameemi -Rahimullaah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I entered Makkah and I saw the gathering of Hamid Faqeeh.  I saw that he was strong in Salafi Tawheed, so I sat there until the Adhan of Isha.  Then when I was alone with him I asked him: ‘O Shaykh how did you learn Tawheed?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: your question is excellent.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he narrated the famous story to me.’[16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I met with Shaykh Hamid Faqeeh once and I said to him: Salafiyoon are a rarity in Egypt, and you are a Salafi, so how did Salafeeyah come to you?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘I had graduated from the university of Cairo or Azhar, and while I was travelling back to my village carrying my university certificate I passed by a farm and I saw an old Shaykh sitting there and I gave him Salam, so he said to me what is that in your hands?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: ‘A graduation certificate.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Next to the Shaykh was the book ‘Kitab al-Tawheed’ with its explanation of ‘Fath al-Majeed’ the Shaykh stood up and walked off to take care of something and he was away for sometime. I picked up the book to read, then later on the Shaykh returned, I asked him about this book, and I told him that I was amazed by it.  He began explaining the ‘Aqeedah of the Salaf to me.  He said: ‘O my son it is upon you to spread Tawheed and the ‘Aqeedah of the Salaf, because indeed you did not learn that in the university from where you graduated.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from then on I began calling to the ‘Aqeedah of the Salaf, and this Shaykh was a farmer in that farm.’[17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘He also met Shaykh Yahya al-Muallami, the brilliant scholar of hadeeth the scholar of his time in the knowledge of hadeeth, he adhered to him and took from him love for the knowledge of hadeeth and learning it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hamad al-Ansaari said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘My Shaykh AbdurRahman al-Mu’alami -Rahimullaah- would research a very great deal.  He would research into more than one book at one time.  I would sit with him in the library of the Haramain, and he would give me books and say ‘look for such and such thing.’ But I could not find it, when I would give them back he would say to me: ‘Here it is, where are you?’  This was in the year 1367 A.H. at that time I was not paying attention and being hasty.’[18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘He also adhered to Shaykh Taqi uddeen al-Hilali, sticking to him for a long time and benefitting from him in more than one science from the sciences of knowledge.’[19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Riyadh</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘My father travelled to Riyadh in 1373 A.H. and met Shaykh Muhammad bin Ibraheem ‘Ala-Shaykh -Rahimullaah- the general Mufti of this blessed land.  Shaykh Muhammad bin Ibraheem encouraged him to teach in the Jamia Masjid of Riyadh, my father would teach the books of ‘Aqeedah, and hadeeth to the youngsters, as the Shaykh had ordered him to, due to what he saw from my father of knowledge, understanding, cleverness, intelligent and concern for the ‘Aqeedah Salafeeyah.’[20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Hamad said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I came from Riyadh in the year 1385 A.H. and Shaykh at-Tayyib ibn Is’haq had died in 1365 A.H.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AbdulAwal bin Hamad al-Ansaari said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘at-Tayyib bin Is’haq al-Ansaari was one of the senior scholars of the Salafeeyeen in al-Madina an-Nabaweeyah, of those who made Hijra a long time ago from Mali.’[21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Madina Nabaweeyah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Also when my father was in Madina before he went to Riyadh he met Shaykh Ibn Turki – and he was from the scholars of Madina at that time – and my father read ‘Saheeh al-Bukhari’ to him and the ‘Aqeedah of the Salaf and was affected by him.  Shaykh Ibn Turki was very strict, and this was clear and apparent to everyone.  He was a scholar, a Zahid[22], there were very few like him in his Zuhd in Madina Nabaweeyah at that time.’[23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘He studied under a number of scholars of al-Madina an-Nabaweeyah in Dar al-Uloom ash-Sharia’, from them were Shaykh al-Khaleel -Rahimullaah- and Shaykh Abu Bakr Shareef al-Timbaktooee – who was a teacher in the Masjid Nabawee Shareef near the Rawdah.’[24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘My father taught ‘Sunnan Tirmidhi’ in the Masjid Nabawee until he finished it completely, likewise he taught Arabic grammar, the study of the forms of words, and some sciences and hadeeth.’[25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The reader should know that my father utilized himself from the time he came to this blessed land, in giving service to the knowledge of hadeeth and the ‘Aqeedah Salafeeyah. He was a teacher in the Islamic University, in its institutes, faculties and in higher studies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would encourage students of knowledge to spread the ‘Aqeedah Salafeeyah, to learn it, and teach it and he would clarify the ‘Aqeedah Salafeeyah for them with an excellent explanation.’[26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Establishing the Islaamic University</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AbdulAwal bin Hamad al-Ansaari said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I heard him say: ‘When the order came to launch an Islaamic University, there was a difference of opinion of where it should be.  So I suggested to Shaykh Muhammad bin Ibraheem ‘Ala-Shaykh -Rahimullaah: ‘It would be good if you established it in al-Madina since previously there was an Islaamic University in Madina which was none other than Abu Bakr -Radi Allaahu anhu- who represented the Arabs, and Bilal who represented al-Habasha etc.’[27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Term ‘al-Munawarah’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hamad al-Ansaari said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I searched for the origin of what people say these days of <span style="color:#ff6600;">al-Madina ‘al-Munawarah</span>’ and I found that the first people to label it ‘al-Munawarah’ were the ‘Uthmaanyoon’.  As for the Companions and the Successors and those after them, then for many centuries they called it <span style="color:#ff6600;">al-Madina an-Nabaweeyah</span>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AbdulAwal bin Hamad al-Ansaari commented:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I noticed from my father -Rahimullaah- that if he saw a person write ‘al-Munawarah’, he would say to him to wipe out the word ‘al-Munawarah’ and write ‘an-Nabaweeyah.’[28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed the people of knowledge apply the term ‘an-Nabaweeya’ to al-Madina.’[29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Applying the word ‘al-Munawarah’ after the word al-Madina was introduced by the non-Arabs.  What was well known by the Companions and the Successors was the addition ‘an-Nabaweeyah’. Likewise, adding the term ‘al-Mukkarama’ to Makkah is not known.’[30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Rain in Madina</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hamad al-Ansaari said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed rain is good for the health, now when we have became deprived of it we have become sick.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There used to be a lot of water springs in al-Madina an-Nabaweeyah, and there used to be a spring of water right next to the Masjid Nabawee.  It had fish in it due to the large quantity of water and its great amount, and that was in the year 1369 A.H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I came to Madina again in 1385 A.H. I asked about it and it was said to me the water springs had lost their pressure and dried up and were taken away by people digging artesian wells.’[31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hamad al-Ansaari said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘At our time in al-Madina Nabaweeyah there used to be a well in every house, for those who used to live in houses.’[32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Manuscripts</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘During my travels I brought five thousand manuscripts for the Islamic University on their account. Most of my travels which were for acquiring manuscripts and copying them were during the administration of Shaykh AbdulMuhsin al-Abbad of the university.’[33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Muhammad Nasir-uddeen al-Albaani</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed Shaykh al-Albaani made ‘al-Musnad’ easy for us, he made it really easy in an excellent manner by which he compiled lists for the Companions mentioned in ‘al-Musnad’ and before this we would have great difficulty in finding the hadeeth.’[34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed Shaykh al-Albaani studied knowledge abundantly and sufficiently, and he took the trade of mending watches for livelihood just as the Imams in the beginning used to do so. Indeed each one of them used to have a skill for his livelihood, for example Abu Hanifa was a cloth merchant.’[35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘When I was in Damascus I used to visit al-Albaani in his house in ‘Safha, Mount Qassiyoon’.  I would stay awake the night with him after Isha until the end of the night, and that was so I could look into his books and his library was a good size.  Indeed Shaam[36] has been deprived of the Shaykh Nasir al-Albaani, there is none present like him in Shaam, especially in his field of expertise.’[37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Likewise I also used to phone Shaykh AbdulAziz bin Baz, there is no Muhaddith who exists like him, even though he has many duties which have come between him and being free to specialise in the knowledge of hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition to this, indeed I would refer to Shaykh Albaani regarding some matters, because he posses vast research in to the knowledge of hadeeth.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Meeting Shaykh Albaani &amp; Muhammad al-Banna</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Hamad said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘We met two noble generous brothers in Casablanca (Dar al-Bayda), Shaykh Nasir-uddeen Albaani and brother Muhammad al-Banna on their way to London, dispatched to teach in London.  We really enjoyed their company on Wednesday night, the following morning we were to leave the lands of Morocco.  That night was sociable, pleasant, relaxed, filled with the Prophetic Ahadeeth, and splendid guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also attended, on that Wednesday evening an excellent lecture entitled: ‘Straightening the rows in the prayer is from establishing the prayer’ which was delivered by Shaykh Nasir-Uddeen Al-Albaani in the Masjid al-Muhammadi in Casablanca.’[38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani (d.1420A.H) -Rahimullaah- said about him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This is along with my awareness and appreciation of his knowledge, his excellence, and his benefitting the students especially in the Islamic University, may Allaah reward him with goodness.’[39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>He Used to Love the Sunnah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dr. Waleed al-Firyaanee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari’s life was not one of play and uselessness or a life of being meek and lethargic, rather it was a living example for a biography of a serious scholar who turned down the enjoyments of this life and its pleasures. He sacrificed his time and effort for knowledge and teaching.  He -Rahimullaah- would exemplify the guidance of the Salaf as-Salih in his look, in his appearance, his character, his manners, his good behaviour, his humility, and him turning away from everything, which may violate and dishonour knowledge and the prestige of the scholars. He had Islaamic awareness, he was a Zahid. He possessed honesty in his tongue, and purity in the heart, and contentment. May Allaah have vast mercy upon the deceased.’[40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>From His Students</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Is Shaykh Rabee al-Madkhali from your students?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh replied: ‘Yes, he is from my students.’[41]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed Muqbil al-Wada’iee was my student; I was the one who chose the topic [for his Master’s Degree].[42] He would read to me in my house, the days I used to live in Sharqeeyah district.  I used to advise him and say to him O Muqbil, you came from your country to seek knowledge so do not mix with those people[43], leave them and mixing with them, and turn towards that for which you travelled for.  However he was trialled and tested and he fell into that which I warned him against – I used to say to him: ‘I hope that you will be for Yemen in our time as Shawkaani was in his time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muqbil was a student the like of whom I have never seen in energy and seeking knowledge.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AbdulAwal bin Hamad added: ‘When my father said: ‘those people’ he meant those who have something against the Saudi Salafi state.’[44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AbdulAwal bin Hamad al-Ansaari said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Shaykh AbdurRahman Muhiddeen narrated to me that he was the last person to gain an Ijazah from my father.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AbdulAwal adds: ‘Ijazah for what my father had of narrations in Hadeeth and other works.’[45]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And indeed Shaykh Ali Faqihi is my student, he would adhere to me strongly.  He would come to visit me in Makkah to take from me, and due to his great concern for knowledge, he would sleep in the library next to the books.’[46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed Hafidh Hakami is my student’ – my father means the author of many works and poetry who died along time ago.’[47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh’s Death</strong>[48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The reader should know that my father -Rahimullaah- sacrificed his wealth, time, his life from a tender age to meet Allaah Ta’ala after suffering from a medical error which led him to fall into a coma that lasted nine months, then he died [1418A.H] and was buried near the graves of the Prophet’s -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- daughters and his wives, near the entrance of Baqia’ al-Gharqad on the left of the entrance.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Also from those who are buried there near that place in that spacious graveyard is the Shaykh, the scholar Umar bin Muhammad al-Falata who used to love and revere my father, and he knew his worth, rank, his knowledge and his extensive research and his love for spreading the ‘Aqeedah of the Salaf and the knowledge of hadeeth.’[49]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘He was prayed upon in the Masjid Nabawee on Wednesday 21st of Jumada al-Aakhir 1418 A.H. – corresponding to 22nd October 1997.’[50]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>From the Okaz Newspaper</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘During these past two weeks al-Madina al-Munnawara has lost two scholars from its senior scholars. Those who were known for research and deriving verdicts, high aspirations in the field of Dawa’ and a large number of the senior scholars of the Kingdom had graduated at their hands. They, who have travelled from our world are the noble Shaykh, Scholar, Muhaddith Hamad bin Muhammad al-Ansaari after suffering from an illness, and likewise the noble Shaykh, the judge, AbdulAziz bin Muhammad ash-Shibal who departed and met his Lord facing Him while he was in Sajda’ in the ‘Rawda ash-Shareef’ in the Masjid an-Nabawee ash-Shareef.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Beginning with the scholar, Muhaddith, Shaykh Hamad al-Ansaari, since indeed a number of the senior scholars of the Kingdom have spoken about him, whereby the noble Shaykh Abdullaah al-Bassam, who is a member of the committee for the Senior Scholars, said about Shaykh Hamad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I have known Shaykh Hamad due to his strength of his knowledge regarding the knowledge of hadeeth whereby he was strong and sturdy in it, and a reference point for every question.  I have known him to be Salafi in ‘Aqeedah upon the Manhaj of the Salaf.  He made great efforts in education and teaching and researching books.  I ask Allaah to forgive him and compensate the students of knowledge with other than him.’[51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace  and blessings be upon our final  Prophet Muhammad, his  family, his companions  and all those who  follow his  guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Author of Ar-Raheeq Al-Makhtum: The Sealed Nectar, When the Moon Split, History of Islam, and History of Makkah / Madinah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Autobiography</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is due to Allah, the Rabb of all mankind, Jinn and all that exists. May the peace and blessings of Allah be upon our Prophet, the Seal of all Messengers, Muhammad, his family, Companions and all those who follow him until the Day of Judgement (Aameen).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[The following is an updated outline on the life of Shaykh Safiur-Rahman Mubarakpuri, may Allah have mercy upon him, based on the brief biography detailing his life and professional career presented to the Muslim World League while compiling this book (The Sealed Nectar) for publication.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Name and Lineage</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Name: Safiur-Rahman<br />
Kunyah: Abu Hisham</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Lineage: Safiur-Rahman bin Abdullah bin Muhammad Akbar bin Muhammad Ali bin AbdulMumin bin Faqirullah Mubarakpuri, Azami. Date and Place of Birth</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was born in the year 1942 C.E., in Husainabad, a village at a distance of one mile from the north side of Mubarakpur (Azamgarh District), a town famous for cottage industry in the northern province of India.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Educational Background</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I started my studies at home reading the Qur’an from my grandfather and uncle. Then I was admitted to Madrasah Arabia Darut-Taleem, in Mubarakpur, and began my basic Islamic education in Arabic and Persian languages.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Shawwal 1337 A.H. (June 1954 C.E.), I received admission to the Madrasah Ehyaul-Uloom, in Mubarakpur, for further education in Islamic studies and Arabic literature. Two years later, in Shawwal 1375 A.H. (May 1956 C.E.), I joined the Madrasah Faid Aam, Maunath Bhanjan, Azamgarh District for higher studies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Upon completion of seven years of study in Islamic courses, I received a Master Degree from the same Institute in Sha’ban 1380 A. H. I also received the Certificates of Maulvi in 1959 C.E. and Alim in 1960 C.E. from the Government Education Board on passing their examinations with high grade. After changes in the system of the Arabic schools, I participated in the Fadil Degree examination under the Government Education Board, successfully passed double Fadil examinations in 1976 and 1978 C.E. with high honors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Professional Life</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After completing my studies at the Madrasah Faid Aam in 1961 C.E., I began teaching, preaching, lecturing and delivering sermons. However, unfavorable circumstances did not permit me to stay in one place for long. In March 1963 C.E., I joined the Madrasah Faid Aam in Maunath Bhanjan as a Teacher. Then I was transferred to the Madrasah Darul-Hadeeth in the same city in February 1966 C.E.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In January 1969 C.E., I was appointed as the Principal at the Madrasah Faidul-Uloom at Seoni (M.P.), India. After four years, in 1972 C.E., I was requested to serve in my native Institute Madrasah Arabia Darut-Taleem as Principal. After spending two years, I was invited by Jamiah Salafiyah Banaras to join as a Professor (Ustadh). I was appointed in Shawwal 1394 A.H. (October 1974 C.E.) working in various academic departments till Dhul-Hijjah 1408 A.H. (July 1988 C.E.).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A research institute was established in 1408 Hijrah at the Islamic University of Al-Madinah AlMunawwarah known as &#8220;The Center for the Services of the Prophet’s Biography.’’ I was selected to work there and was entrusted the duty of preparing an encyclopedia on the subject of the life history of the Noble Prophet (May the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as a research scholar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Books and Compilations</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the mercy of Allah Who favored me and provided me the ability of writing from the very beginning of my career. During my teaching period, I wrote and compiled about seventeen books in the Urdu and Arabic languages. When the monthly Urdu magazine Muhaddith of Jamiah Salafiyah was published in 1980 C.E., I was appointed as Chief Editor of the magazine section up to September 1988 C.E., until I joined the Islamic University at Al-Madinah AlMunawwarah. During that period, I wrote a number of articles on social, historical, political and religious topics which were well received by many people. Al-Hamdu lillah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O our Rabb , accept from us with goodly acceptance and seek it grow in a good manner.’’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Safiur-Rahman<br />
Al-Mubarakpuri</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>PS</strong>: Shaykh Safiur-Rahmaan Mubarakpuri (rahimahullaah) passed away 1st Dec 2006 C.E., in Mubarakpur, India, after Salaatul-Jumu’ah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mubarakpuri wrote and compiled seventeen books in Urdu and Arabic. Several books were translated into English, including:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b class="headline">1346H-1429H: Shaikh Ahmad bin Yahyaa An-Najmee</b></p>
<p class="article" style="text-align:left;">Author: <strong>Shaikh Muhammad bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee</strong><br />
Source: His introduction to the Shaikh’s book “<i>Al-Mawrid-ul-‘Adhb az-Zilaal</i>”.  Published by : al-ibaanah. com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>His Name and Lineage: </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is our noble Shaikh, the &#8216;Allaamah, the Muhaddith, the Faqeeh, the present Muftee of the district of Jaazaan and carrier of the Banner of the Sunnah and Hadeeth in it &#8211; Shaikh Ahmad bin Yahyaa bin Muhammad bin Shabeer An-Najmee Aali Shabeer from Banee Hummad, one of the well known tribes of the district of Jaazaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>His Birth: </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh, may Allaah preserve him, was born in the village of Najaamiyyah on the 22nd of Shawaal of 1346H, and was raised in the house of his two righteous parents &#8211; which have no equal in comparison.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of this, both his parents made a pledge to Allaah on him that they would not burden him with any type of worldly jobs, and Allaah made what they wished come true.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They would both constantly keep guard of their son to the point that they would not even let him play amongst the children. When he reached the age of puberty, they entered him into the schools of the town, where he learned to read and write. He learned to recite the Qur&#8217;aan in the national school before the arrival of Shaikh &#8216;Abdullaah Al-Qar&#8217;aawee, <i>rahimahullaah</i>, three times to that area, the last of which occurred in 1358H when he remained there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He first read the Qur&#8217;aan to Shaikh &#8216;Abdu Ibn Muhammad &#8216;Aqeel An-Najmee in 1355H. Then he read it to Shaikh Yahyaa Faqeeh &#8216;Abasee, who was from Yemen and who had come to Najaamiyyah and stayed there. Our Shaikh studied under him in the year 1358H. But when Shaikh &#8216;Abdullaah Al-Qar&#8217;aawee arrived at Najaamiyyah, there occurred a debate between him and this teacher concerning the issue of Allaah&#8217;s Rising – for he was an &#8216;asharee. So Shaikh Al-Qar&#8217;aawee defeated him and he fled from the town after that. <b>&#8220;And so the roots of the people who did wrong were cut off &#8211; all praise be to Allaah, Lord of the Worlds.&#8221;</b> [Surah Al-An’aam: 45]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>His Educational Upbringing: </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After their &#8216;asharee teacher left, the Shaikh, along with his two paternal uncles, Hasan bin Muhammad An-Najmee and Husayn bin Muhammad An-Najmee, began to frequently attend Shaikh Al-Qar&#8217;aawee&#8217;s classes for some days in the city of Saamitah, but this did not last. This was in the year 1359H. In 1360, in the month of Safar to be exact, our Shaikh joined the Madrasah Salafiyyah (Salafee School) and recited the Qur&#8217;aan, this time under the order of Shaikh &#8216;Abdullaah Al-Qar&#8217;aawee (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) to Shaikh &#8216;Uthmaan bin &#8216;Uthmaan Hamlee (<i>rahimahullaah</i>). This was such that he recited the entire Qur&#8217;aan to him with tajweed and memorized the books &#8220;<i>Tuhfat-ul-Atfaal</i>&#8220;, &#8220;<i>Hidaayat-ul-Mustafeed</i>&#8220;, &#8220;<i>Thalaathat-ul-Usool</i>&#8220;, &#8220;<i>Al-&#8216;Arba&#8217;een An-Nawawiyyah</i>&#8221; and &#8220;<i>Al-Hisaab</i>.&#8221; And he perfected the discipline of handwriting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would sit in the study circle, which Shaikh Al-Qar&#8217;aawee had set up there, until the time when the younger students departed after the Dhuhr Prayer. Then he would attend the circle for the elder students, which Shaikh &#8216;Abdullaah Al-Qar&#8217;aawee was in charge of personally teaching. So he would sit in this class from after the Dhuhr Prayer till the time of the &#8216;Ishaa Prayer. Then after praying (&#8216;Ishaa), he would return to his town of Najaamiyyah with his two uncles (Hasan and Husayn).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After four months, Shaikh &#8216;Abdullaah Al-Qar&#8217;aawee granted him permission to be part of his study circle for elder students, which he taught himself. So he read to the Shaikh the following books: &#8220;<i>Ar-Raheebah</i>&#8221; concerning Laws of Inheritance, &#8220;Al-Aajroomiyyah&#8221; concerning Arabic Grammar, &#8220;Kitaab At-Tawheed&#8221;, &#8220;Buloogh Al-Maraam&#8221;, &#8220;Al-Bayqooniyyah&#8221;, &#8220;Nukhbat-ul-Fikr&#8221; with its explanation &#8220;<i>Nuzhat-un-Nadhr&#8221;, &#8220;Mukhtasaraat fee Seerah&#8221;, &#8220;Tasreef Al-Ghazee&#8221;, &#8220;Al-&#8216;Awaamil fee An-Nahw&#8221;, &#8220;Al-Waraqaat</i>&#8221; concerning the Principles of Fiqh, and &#8220;<i>Al-&#8216;Aqeedat-ut-Tahaawiyyah</i>&#8221; with its explanation from Shaikh &#8216;Abdullaah Al-Qar&#8217;aawee &#8211; this was before they had seen its explanation from Ibn Abeel-&#8216;Izz. He also studied parts of the book &#8220;<i>Al-Alfiyyah</i>&#8221; of Ibn Maalik and &#8220;<i>Ad-Durar Al-Bahiyyah</i>&#8221; with its explanation &#8220;Ad-Daraaree Al-Madiyyah&#8221; concerning Fiqh &#8211; both of which were written by Ash-Shawkaanee (<i>rahimahullaah</i>). This goes as well for other books – those they were assigned to study, like the books mentioned above, those concise treatises and small pamphlets they studied for cultural education, or those books they would reference when researching such as <i>Nayl-ul-Awtaar, Zaad Al-Ma&#8217;aad, Noor-ul-Yaqeen, Al-Muwatta and Al-Ummahaat</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In 1362H, Shaikh &#8216;Abdullaah (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) distributed portions of the Umahaat (Hadeeth Books) he had present in his library to his students, which consisted of Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, Sunan Abee Dawood, Sunan An-Nasaa&#8217;ee, and the Muwatta of Imaam Maalik. So they (his elder students) began to read these books to him, but they weren’t able to complete them since they had to depart due to a drought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In 1364H, they returned and read them to him. This is when Shaikh &#8216;Abdullaah gave him the ijaazah (religious authorization) to report from <i>Al-Umahaat as-Sittah</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In 1369H, he studied two books under Shaikh Ibraaheem bin Muhammad Al-&#8216;Amoodee, (<i>rahimahullaah</i>), the Judge of Saamitah at that time, which were: (1) &#8220;<i>Islaah-ul-Mujtami&#8217;</i>&#8221; and (2) the book of Shaikh &#8216;Abdur-Rahmaan bin Sa&#8217;adee (rahimahullaah) on Fiqh, which is organized in the form of questions and answers, entitled: &#8220;<i>Al-Irshaad ilaa Ma&#8217;rifat-il-Ahkaam</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, at the order of Shaikh &#8216;Abdullaah Al-Qar&#8217;aawee, he studied Grammar under Shaikh &#8216;Alee Ibn-ush-Shaikh Ziyaad As-Sumaalee, going over the book &#8220;<i>Al-&#8216;Awaamil fin-Nahwi Mi&#8217;ah</i>&#8220;, as well as other books on Grammar and Morphology.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In 1384H, he attended the study circles of the (former) Muftee of the Saudi Lands, Shaikh Muhammad bin Ibraaheem Aali Shaikh (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) for the length of close to two months. In these circles, Imaam Aali Shaikh would teach Tafseer Ibn Jareer At-Tabaree with the recitation of &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez Ash-Shalhoob. In the same year, he also attended the gatherings of our teacher, the Imaam, Shaikh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez Ibn Baaz (<i>rahimahullaah</i>), for the length of close to a month and a half. This class was on Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree and occurred between the Maghrib and &#8216;Ishaa prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>His Teachers: </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From what you have read above, it is clear that his teachers, in order, include:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Shaikh Ibraaheem bin Muhammad Al-&#8216;Amoodee &#8211; the judge of Saamitah in his time.<br />
2. Shaikh Haafidh bin Ahmad Al-Hakamee, may Allaah have mercy on him.<br />
3. The Caller and Reformer (mujaddid) of the southern regions of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Shaikh &#8216;Abdullaah Al-Qar&#8217;aawee, may Allaah have mercy on him.<br />
4. Shaikh &#8216;Abdu bin Muhammad &#8216;Aqeel An-Najmee.<br />
5. Shaikh &#8216;Uthmaan bin &#8216;Uthmaan Al-Hamlee.<br />
6. Shaikh &#8216;Alee Ibn Ash-Shaikh &#8216;Uthmaan Ziyaad As-Sumaalee.<br />
7. The Imaam and former Muftee of the lands of Saudi Arabia, Shaikh Muhammad bin Ibraaheem Aali Shaikh, may Allaah have mercy on him.<br />
8. Shaikh Yahyaa Faqeeh &#8216;Abasee Al-Yemenee</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>His Students: </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Shaikh, may Allaah preserve him, has many, many students. For someone who has spent the amount of time he spent teaching, which is almost half a century, you can just imagine how many students he will have. If we were to list their number, that would require a large book in itself. So I will only mention a short example of them, by which one can go by in determining his other students. So from among his students are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Our Shaikh, the &#8216;Allaamah, the Muhaddith, the Defender of the Sunnah, Rabee&#8217; bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee<br />
2. Our Shaikh, the &#8216;Allaamah, the Faqeeh, Zayd bin Muhammad Haadee Al-Madkhalee<br />
3. Our Shaikh, the Noble Scholar, &#8216;Alee bin Naasir Al-Faqeehee</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is sufficient to just mention these three names here. And this is due to the widespread fame they have in the circles and gatherings of knowledge, so no one can blame us for doing so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>His Aptitude and Intelligence: </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh possesses a very high level of intelligence. The following is a story that indicates the intelligence and good memory he had since childhood:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The uncle, Shaikh &#8216;Umar bin Ahmad Jardee Al-Madkhalee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When Shaikh Ahmad would attend classes at the Salafee School in Saamitah, along with his two uncles, Hasan An-Najmee and Husayn An-Najmee, during 1359H when he was 13, he would listen to the classes that Shaikh &#8216;Abdullaah Al-Qar&#8217;aawee gave to his elder students and would memorize them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`I say: This is what caused Shaikh &#8216;Abdullaah Al-Qar&#8217;aawee to let Shaikh Ahmad join his classes for adults, which he was in charge of teaching himself. This was because of what the Shaikh (Al-Qar&#8217;aawee) saw of his superiority, quickness in memorizing and intelligence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>His Works: </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Shaikh, may Allaah preserve him, worked as a volunteer teacher in the schools of his Shaikh &#8216;Abdullaah Al-Qar&#8217;aawee. When the salary positions began, he was assigned the duty of a teacher in his town of Najaamiyyah. This was in 1367H. Then in 1372H, he transferred to being Imaam and teacher in the town (masjid) of Abu Subaila in Baalhurrath.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In 1/1/1374H, when the educational institute (<i>ma’ahad</i>) of Saamitah opened, he was assigned the position of a teacher in it, where he served until the year 1384H.[1] Then he resigned from this post with the hopes of getting the opportunity to teach in the Islamic University of Madeenah, so he traveled there. [2] However, certain circumstances took place that didn&#8217;t allow that to occur, so he returned back to his district and Allaah decreed for him to be appointed the position of religious admonisher and guide for the Ministry of Justice of the District of Jaazaan. So he took the role of admonishing and advising in the best of manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On 1/7/1387H, he returned to being a teacher at the educational institute in the city of Jaazaan at his request. Then at the beginning of the school year of 1389H, he returned to teaching at the institute of Saamitah. He remained there as a teacher until he retired in 1/7/1410H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since that time up until the time that I am writing these lines, he has kept himself busy teaching in his home, in his local masjid and in other masaajid of the district, holding weekly classes as well as taking on the role of providing fataawaa (for questions).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In doing all of this, he has acted in accordance with the final advice of his teacher, which was to remain constant in teaching and in taking care of the students, especially the foreign ones among them who left their families (to study). He had remarkable patience in accomplishing this, so we ask Allaah that He reward him on our behalf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also abided by his teacher, Shaikh Al-Qar&#8217;aawee&#8217;s final advice by continuing in his studies and researching and learning from others. This is especially with regard to the sciences and principles of Hadeeth and Fiqh, for it was such that he surpassed his colleagues and had a powerful command in that matter. May Allaah bless his life and knowledge and benefit us with his efforts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>His Books of Knowledge: </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Shaikh, may Allaah preserve him, has written many books, some of which have been printed and some which have not. We ask Allaah to facilitate the publishing of those books so that benefit can be attained from them. Some of his books include:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <i>Awdah-ul-Ishaarah fee Ar-Radd &#8216;alaa man abaaha Al-Mamnoo&#8217; min-az-Ziyaarah</i>.<br />
2. <i>Ta&#8217;sees-ul-Ahkaam Sharh &#8216;Umdat-ul-Ahkaam</i> &#8211; only a very, very small portion of it was printed.<br />
3. <i>Tanzeeh-ush-Sharee&#8217;ah &#8216;an Ibaahat-il-Aghaanee al-Khalee&#8217;ah</i>.<br />
4. <i>Risaalat-ul-Irshaad ilaa Bayaan-il-Haqq fee Hukm-il-Jihaad</i> (A book explaining the ruling on Jihaad)<br />
5. <i>Risaalatun fee Hukm-il-Jahr bil-Basmalah</i> (The Ruling on pronouncing Bismillaah out loud in prayer)<br />
6. <i>Fat&#8217;h-ur-Rabb-ul-Wadood fil-Fataawaa war-Rudood</i> (A collection of verdicts)<br />
7. <i>Al-Mawrid-ul-Adh&#8217;b az-Zilaal feemaa intaqada &#8216;alaa ba&#8217;ad-il-manaahij ad-da&#8217;wiyyah min Al-&#8216;Aqaa&#8217;id wal-&#8216;A&#8217;amaal</i>. (A book refuting two modern-day deviant sects: the Tablighi Jama’at and the Ikhwaan-ul-Muslimoon).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also has other beneficial books that he has put forth for the Muslims, may Allaah reward him with the best of rewards and benefit Islaam and the Muslims with him. And may the peace and blessings of Allaah be on our prophet, Muhammad, his family and Companions, Ameen.</p>

I wanted to be close to the two of them and take knowledge from them. I strongly desired this, but Allaah did not will it for me. So after that, I tried to enroll in the University (of Madeenah) but Allaah did not decree that for me either.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad bin Khaleel Hasan Harraas was born in Egypt in 1335H (1915) in a small town known as Sheen which was part of the city, Kafr El-Sheikh. At that time Kafr El-Sheikh was the capital city of the Gharbia governorate. Today, Kafr El-Sheikh is a governorate in its own right while Tanta has now become the capital of the Gharbia governorate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080513142151im_/http://www.al-ibaanah.com:80/i/t.gif" width="1" height="416" align="justify" border="0" /><b>His Upbringing and Early Studies:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh was raised in a religious environment as he received his primary formal education in the Azhari school system in 1926. After successfully completing these primary studies, he enrolled in the College of Usool-ud-Deen of Al-Azhar University where he studied until he graduated in 1940 receiving the highest honors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Afterward, he enrolled in the advanced studies program and in 1945 he obtained his doctorate&#8217;s degree basing his dissertation on the subject: &#8220;Ibn Taimyyah and his Critique of the Methods employed by the Theorists.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This shows that he had embraced the methodology of the Salaf at a very early stage in his life, i.e. before completing his academic studies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Duties and Positions:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After graduating from Al-Azhar&#8217;s collegiate program, Shaikh Muhammad Khaleel Harraas began teaching in the Educational Institute at Zakazik.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then when he obtained his doctorate&#8217;s degree, he was hired as a professor in the College of Usool-ud-Deen in Al-Azhar University, teaching the subject of Islamic Creed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also served as head of the Ansaar-us-Sunnah al-Muhammadiyyah Organization in Zakazik, until he was later put in charge of the organization&#8217;s branch in Tanta after he helped establish it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was then selected to serve as deputy to the main head of the Ansaar-us-Sunnah al-Muhammadiyyah Organization of Egypt at that time, Shaikh &#8216;Abdur-Rahmaan Al-Wakeel. This nomination took place in a general assembly meeting held on the 15th of Muharram, 1385H (7/9/1960).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Afterward, he was selected to teach in the College of Sharee&#8217;ah of the Umm-ul-Qurraa University in Makkah where he spent seven years. While there, he established a branch for the subject of Creed in the Advanced Studies department and served as head of this branch up until he passed away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Azhar University showed great opposition to his transfer to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to the point that King Faisal, may Allaah have mercy on him, had to insist upon his request for him. In the end, lieutenant general, &#8216;Abdur-Rahmaan Ameen, intervened and the government of Egypt finally agreed to his transfer. Al-Azhar opposed his transfer because they knew Shaikh Harraas would bear the banner of the methodology of the Salaf in full force and fight against the tactics of the theorists and misguided sects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also served as the head of the Islamic Da&#8217;wah Organization in the Gharbia governorate after founding it with Dr. &#8216;Abdul-Fattaah Ibraaheem Salaamah in 1393H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Scholarly Status:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Muhammad Khaleel Harraas held a distinguished scholarly position for he was known throughout the circles of knowledge for his deep and intricate understanding of the issues of Creed, the proponents of rhetoric, and the philosophical ideologies of the east and west. He was systematic in his research, precise in his comprehension, organized in his presentation, and completely well-versed in the subject he intended to clarify. And he was unique in his ability to solve problems and clarify ambiguities with regard to scholastic issues.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was unrelenting when it came to clarifying the truth, presenting evidences, broadening understandings, and silencing opponents. This could be seen from him in his lectures &#8216; which would last hours &#8216; as well his writings and performance in the classroom while teaching.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One particular lecture he delivered in Al-Azhar that was comprehensive and later published by Al-Azhar amongst their collections of lectures, courtesy of Muhammad Al-Bahee, may Allaah have mercy on him, was the lecture: &#8216;The Divine Attributes according to Ibn Taimiyyah.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his introduction to the Shaikh&#8217;s explanation of <i>al-&#8216;Aqeedat-ul-Waasitiyyah</i>, Shaikh &#8216;Abdur-Razzaaq &#8216;Afeefee said: &#8216;The book of Shaikh Muhammad Khaleel Harraas is one of the most valuable, clear, and concise explanations (of <i>al-&#8216;Aqeedat-ul-Waasitiyyah</i>).&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Abul-Fidaa, Sayyid &#8216;Abdul-Maqsood bin &#8216;Abdir-Raheem Al-Atharee said in his introduction to the Shaikh&#8217;s book <i>Fasl-ul-Maqaal fee Nuzool &#8216;Eesaa</i>: &#8216;The author has done an excellent job in refuting those who hold this belief, i.e. those who reject what is authentically attributed on the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) with regard to that. In spite of this treatise being small in size, it comprises the evidences and refutes the opponents. So may Allaah have mercy on the author and reward him greatly on behalf of Islaam.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The publisher of one of the Shaikh&#8217;s books, <i>Da&#8217;wat-ut-Tawheed</i>, &#8216;Abdul-Fattaah Az-Zainee said: &#8216;It is only proper that Dr. Muhammad Khaleel Harraas, head of the Creed and Philosophy department in Al-Azhar University and one of the callers of Ansaar-us-Sunnah in Egypt, author a book such as this, for how many lectures of his did I hear from him personally and benefited from immensely in which he would explain the Tawheed that the messengers called to. And I saw him in the last part of his life, may Allaah have mercy on him, defending the Sunnah and refuting those who reject ahaadeeth found in Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim based on their intellects. So may Allaah have mercy on him and all of the Muslim scholars.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his biographical account of the Shaikh, &#8216;Alawee bin &#8216;Abdil-Qaadir As-Saqaaf said: &#8216;He, may Allaah have mercy on him, was Salafee in his Creed, strict with regard to the truth, and strong in his ability to establish proof and clarify matters. He spent his entire life teaching and writing. And he spread the Sunnah and the Creed of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Amongst the scholars of his time that he had met and kept a good relation with and who would praise him and advise people to read his books were: Shaikh &#8216;Abdur-Razzaaq &#8216;Afeefee, Shaikh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez bin Baaz, Shaikh Haamid Al-Fiqqee, Shaikh &#8216;Abdur-Rahmaan Al-Wakeel and Shaikh Muhammad Amaan Al-Jaamee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Efforts in Spreading the Creed of the Salaf:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dr. Muhammad Khaleel Harraas lived a life full of sacrifice and struggle all in the name of trying to establish the balanced and true methodology and to reinforce the Call to the Way of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He worked hard to fight against polytheism, innovation, misguided groups, destructive beliefs, and deviant ideologies. He would employ all avenues and use any opportunity presented to him in order to achieve this, such as within the classes he gave at the institutes and universities, his general lectures, his articles for the al-Hadee-un-Nabawee magazine, his publication of books and treatises, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the death of Dr. Harraas, Muhammad &#8216;Abdul-Hameed Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee, former head of the Ansaar-us-Sunnah al-Muhammadiyyah of Egypt, said about him: &#8216;And so Khaleel has passed on like this and therefore a noble Salafee scholar has died. For how long did he carry the weight of calling to Allaah and struggling in His path on his shoulders! He would wage war against idolatry with every ounce of strength in him. And he would concentrate all his energy and time in teaching the Sunnah and warning against innovation. He would face such hardships from oppressors, endure such plots from innovators and experience such atheism from heretics the likes of which no one would be able to tolerate except for the patient and forbearing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was in truth a sincere caller &#8216; neither lethargic nor lazy. Rather, he was always moving, active and untiring wherever he was, whether in the village, the city or other places he traveled to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dr. Muhammad Khaleel Harraas&#8217;s connection with the Ansaar-us-Sunnah al-Muhammadiyyah Organization began around 1360H during the time of its founder, Shaikh Muhammad Haamid Al-Fiqqee. This was while Shaikh Harraas was still a teacher at the Religious Institute in Zakazik, the place where he first began spreading the call to Tawheed. During this point in his life, he was also busy preparing his doctorate&#8217;s dissertation on the subject of Ibn Taimiyyah, may Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Afterward in 1945, while in the College of Usool-ud-Deen at Al-Azhar University, Shaikh Muhammad Khaleel Harraas obtained his doctorate&#8217;s degree and was subsequently appointed as a professor in the same college (of Usool-ud-Deen) within the University (Al-Azhar). He would toil tirelessly to spread the Creed of the Salaf throughout the classrooms of Al-Azhar and launched a full-scale offensive against the beliefs of the people of rhetoric, clarifying how they deviated away from the beliefs of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah. Most of his material would be extracted from the works of Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah and his student Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would also deliver exhaustive scholarly lectures filled with narrative and intellectual evidences. This includes the lecture he delivered in Al-Azhar which was published amongst Al-Azhar&#8217;s lectures under the supervision of Dr. Muhammad Al-Bahee with the title: &#8216;<i>As-Sifaat-ul-Ilaahiyyah &#8216;inda Ibn Taimiyyah</i>&#8216; [The Divine Attributes according to Ibn Taimiyyah].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dr. Harraas was diligent and eager to produce a generation of students that would understand the Creed of the Salaf to the point that it flowed from them like blood from their veins. This was so that they could in turn carry its banner after learning from him and proclaim it to their people, family and communities. So he would not deliver lectures to just give pure information, rather he would add a spiritual and doctrinal aspect to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Amongst his efforts in manifesting the way of the Salaf while at the University of Al-Azhar and demonstrating his firmness upon it was the fact that he based his research paper for obtaining his professor&#8217;s degree on the subject: &#8216;Ibn Taimiyyah, the Salafee.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh encountered great opposition and harm due to this enthusiasm and zeal of his for following the way of the Salaf. He endured many problems and obstacles from both the University of Al-Azhar&#8217;s administration and some of his teachers and colleagues. An example of this is the one mentioned previously when Al-Azhar at first refused to transfer him to Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, no matter who you ask, Dr. Harraas played a prominent role and exerted tremendous effort in spreading the Creed of the Salaf in Al-Azhar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Articles in the <i>Al-Hadee-un-Nabawee</i> Magazine:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dr. Muhammad Khaleel Harraas also worked at spreading the methodology of the Salaf by way of contributing serialized articles that he would write regularly for the Ansaar-us-Sunnah Organization&#8217;s magazine at that time &#8216;<i>al-Hadee-un-Nabawee</i>.&#8217; This magazine served as the voice of the organization during that era and it would traverse the farthest regions of the Muslim world, spreading the call to the Way of the Salaf, bearing the banner of Tawheed, and raising high the slogan of the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh would write articles for three ongoing segments in the magazine where he would clarify the Creed and refute those affected by the ideologies of intellectualism and innovation who would reject <i>ahaadeeth</i>. The titles of these segments were:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1. The Creed of the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah:</b> Under this segment, the Shaikh set out to clarify the correct creed derived from the two pure sources of the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Amongst the subjects he presented in this series was: Allaah&#8217;s Existence in two parts and Allaah&#8217;s Oneness in more than forty parts. In these articles, he discussed issues related to Allaah&#8217;s Lordship, Allaah&#8217;s Oneness in worship, certain acts of worship such as supplication and seeking assistance from Allaah, Allaah&#8217;s Oneness in His Names and Attributes and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>2. Allaah rises over His Throne even though the Deniers may Hate it:</b> This consists of a refutation of an article written in the <i>al-&#8216;Itisaam</i> magazine. In these series of articles, the Shaikh clarifiedsthe creed of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah with regard to Allaah rising over His Throne, while refuting the people of rhetoric and philosophy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>3. The Pillar of the Sunnah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Religious Verdicts in the <i>Al-Hadee-un-Nabawee</i> Magazine:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Muhammad Khaleel Harraas was put in charge of answering readers questions sent in the <i>al-Hadee-un-Nabawee</i>magazine after the death of Professor Abul-Wafaa Muhammad Darweesh, may Allaah have mercy on him. Questions would be sent in from all parts of the Muslim world the magazine would reach and they would cover a wide range of topics and sciences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that taking charge of such a duty requires a great deal of researching and examining of the books of the scholars in order to prepare answers for these numerous questions on distinct subjects. A portion of these questions would also be on issues pertaining to Creed, Tawheed and the Sunnah. Dr. Harraas continued to fulfill this most important duty up until the time that the magazine seized publication, which was in 1387H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Lectures in the Organization&#8217;s Center as well as in the Cities, Villages and Colleges:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the methods and ways employed by the Ansaar-us-Sunnah Organization to spread the call to Tawheed and the Prophetic Sunnah were the weekly lectures and programs they would hold in their main center on Sundays and Wednesdays.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dr. Muhammad Khaleel Harraas had an active role in organizing these lectures. He would deliver talks that would focus on clarifying the Creed of the Salaf, backing that up with proofs from the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah and statements of the Companions, Taabi&#8217;een and Muslim Imaams. His lectures would be widely circulated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to the cities and villages, the center would organize outings in which they would go visit the various branches of the organization throughout the cities and villages of Egypt to give academic lectures and lessons, to attend general assembly meetings to select administrative boards for those branches, or to participate in specific events such as opening a masjid or announcing a new branch.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Harraas played a big part in this area as he would participate in these <i>da&#8217;wah</i>, administrative and inspectional trips.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would also deliver academic lectures in universities, taking advantage of those opportunities to present the Call to the Way of the Salaf to the audience members, which would consist of teachers, students and faculty members.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At times, he would also give valuable points of advice to the youth of Al-Azhar close to the end of the school year so that they could go back to their towns and families properly equipped with the creed of the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Formation of the Ansaar-us-Sunnah al-Muhamadiyyah Organization in Tanta:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After Shaikh Muhammad Khaleel Harraas embraced the methodology of the Salaf, he began to proclaim the Call to Allaah in the institutes, universities, cities and villages. Amongst these cities was his town of Tanta. However, when he realized that the call of individuals dies with the death of those individuals, he worked to form a branch for the Ansaar-us-Sunnah al-Muhammadiyyah Organization in Tanta. After forming this branch, he assumed its leadership and as a result was able to spread Tawheed, revive the Sunnah, demolish polytheism, and exterminate innovation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Fat&#8217;hee Ameen &#8216;Uthmaan said: &#8216;When Shaikh Harraas formed the Ansaar-us-Sunnah al-Muhammadiyyah Organization in Tanta, he would give lectures there in which he would fight against innovation and call to the Sunnah in a good manner while using proofs from the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah. This had a great effect in bringing many people back to the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another of its effects was that the wrath of the enemies of the truth surpassed its limits and so they began to complain about him to the authorities by distorting his methodology. They based their argument on the precipice that he hated the <i>awliyaa</i> (close friends of Allaah). However, the matter fell into the hands of a smart man who quickly saw the truth and realized the objective behind their complaints. So he advised them to refrain from this because the Shaikh was only calling to the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Harraas would deliver sermons to the people in the masjid on Fridays and lectures in the evenings for the organization as well as during any other occasion in which he would get the opportunity. And his call found general acceptance amongst the people. From among his biggest aides and supporters was Dr. &#8216;Abdul-Fattaah Salaamah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Authoring of Books and Support of the Methodology of the Salaf:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Muhammad Khaleel Harraas is considered one of the most prolific writers amongst the scholars of Ansaar-us-Sunnah on the subject of the Creed of the Salaf. This was since he began writing about it ever since he began acquiring knowledge. This is seen clearly in the fact that his doctorate&#8217;s dissertation was titled: &#8216;Ibn Taimiyyah and his Critique of the Methods employed by the Theorists.&#8217; He also based the thesis for achieving his professor&#8217;s certificate on the subject: &#8216;Ibn Taimiyyah, the Salafee.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From amongst Dr. Muhammad Khaleel Harraas&#8217; biggest efforts in spreading the call to the way of the Salaf was his explanation of the book &#8216;<i>al-&#8216;Aqeedat-ul-Waasitiyyah</i>&#8216; of Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah, which is distinguished by its clarity, conciseness, referencing of the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah and statements of the Salaf, past and present, in numerous places, and mention of the opinions of the various sects along with a response to their false ideologies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his introduction to this book, Shaikh &#8216;Abdur-Razzaaq &#8216;Afeefee said: &#8216;The book of Shaikh Muhammad Khaleel Harraas is one of the most valuable, clear and concise explanations (of <i>al-&#8216;Aqeedat-ul-Waasitiyyah</i>).&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This explanation continues to be used in the curriculum of some schools and institutes today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After this, comes his book &#8216;<i>Da&#8217;wat-ut-Tawheed</i>&#8216; [The Call to Monotheism] which is distinguished by its simplicity and ease. This book discusses some of the most important issues of Creed such as the definition of Tawheed, its categories and effects, an explanation of Allaah&#8217;s Attributes, and the call of the prophets from the time of Nooh to the time of Muhammad. It also talks about the appearance of the following sects: the Qadariyyah, the Murji&#8217;ah, the Jahmiyyah, the Mu&#8217;atazilah and so on. The book also discusses the Sufis and their dangers and refutes them. It is from the most widespread books of the Shaikh in which he exerted a great deal of effort in clarifying the call to Tawheed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there is his book &#8216;<i>Sharh al-Qaseedat-un-Nooniyyah</i>&#8216; [An Explanation of the Nooniyyah Poem] of Ibn Al-Qayyim. The explanation of this book is considered a form of spreading the beliefs of the Salaf since it consists of a clarification of the creed of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah on various issues and mentions the opinions of the sects, while refuting them in a smooth and firm poetic manner. The explanation along with the original text was published in two volumes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among his significant works was his book &#8220;<i>Fasl-ul-Maqaal fee Raf&#8217; &#8216;Eesaa Hayyan wa Nuzoolihi Li-Qatl-il-Maseeh-id-Dajjaal</i>&#8221; [The Final Word on Jesus Ascending Alive and Descending to Kill the Antichrist]. This book consists of a refutation against those who follow the intellectual school of thought as well as those who tread their path and were influenced by them, particularly in that which is related to rejecting the descending of Prophet Jesus. No doubt this is considered one of his efforts in stopping that violent wave that opens the floor for those with evil intentions and desires to play around with the issues of Creed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his introduction to this book, Shaikh Muhammad Khaleel Harraas said (pg. 5): &#8216;To proceed: Since the beginning of this century or a little before it, there appeared a group that called to free thinking, leading a religious reformation movement and working to revive the correct understanding of the Religion in the souls of the Muslims. However, in their efforts to achieve this, they began rejecting many aspects of the Unseen that have been mentioned in the clear and well-known texts of the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah, which only further confirms their authenticity and establishment. And they have no support for this rejection of theirs except for the defiance and self-delusion of their intellects&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also the book &#8220;<i>Al-Harakat-ul-Wahhaabiyyah</i>&#8221; [The Wahhabi Movement] in which he refutes an article from Dr. Muhammad Al-Bahee. This book is one of the significant efforts made in order to expel the biased misconceptions and claims concerning the call of Shaikh Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdil-Wahhaab, which is considered one of the Islamic reformation movements that spread the spirit of the methodology of the Salaf throughout the Muslim ummah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this book, Dr. Harraas said (pg. 32): &#8216;The movement only calls to returning back to the way of the Salaf with regard to beliefs, which represent the fundamentals, since the Salaf were united upon it in one single view against the people of desires, such as the Khawaarij, the Shee&#8217;ah, the Qadariyyah, the Murji&#8217;ah, the Jahmiyyah, and their likes.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Verifications and Explanations:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dr. Muhammad Khaleel Harraas took on the task of verifying and explaining some of the books of the Salaf on various subjects, such as Creed, Hadeeth, Prophetic Biography, Jurisprudence, and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Verifying and distributing the books of Creed is considered one of the efforts in serving the methodology of the Salaf since the material found in these books is confined to explaining the correct creed and pure monotheistic beliefs that the pious predecessors (Salaf-us-Saalih) were upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the work and effort he did in books on other subjects, Dr. Harraas&#8217; explanations and comments to these texts would still focus primarily on clarifying the Creed of the Salaf and calling others to adhere to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>List of his Written Works and Verifications:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His written works include:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <i>Da&#8217;wat-ut-Tawheed</i> [The Call to Monotheism]<br />

5. <i>Sharh al-Qaseedat-in-Nooniyyah</i> [An Explanation of the Nooniyyah Poem of Ibn Al-Qayyim]: This is considered one of his greatest works. It was published several times in two volumes. It also goes by the name <i>ath-Thimaar-ush-Shahiyyah fee Sharh-in-Nooniyyah</i> [The Tantalizing Fruits: An Explanation of an-Nooniyyah]<br />
6. <i>Fasl-ul-Maqaal fee Raf&#8217; &#8216;Eesaa Hayyan wa Nuzoolihi Li-Qatl-il-Maseeh-id-Dajjaal</i> [The Final Word on Jesus Ascending Alive and Descending to kill the Antichrist].<br />
7. <i>Sharh at-Targheeb wat-Tarheeb</i> [An Explanation of at-Targheeb wat-Tarheeb of At-Tabreezee]<br />
8. <i>Sharh as-Seerat-un-Nabawiyyah Libn-Hishaam</i> [An Explanation of the Prophet&#8217;s Biography of Ibn Hishaam]<br />
9. <i>Al-Harakat-ul-Wahaabiyyah</i> [The Wahhabi Movement]<br />
10. <i>As-Sifaat-ul-Ilaahiyyah &#8216;inda Ibn Taimiyyah</i> [The Divine Attributes according to Ibn Taimiyyah]: This was a lecture he delivered in Al-Azhar University, which was published amongst a collection of Al-Azhar&#8217;s lectures courtesy of Muhammad Al-Bahee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Amongst the classical books that he verified were:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <i>Al-Khasaa&#8217;is-ul-Kubraa</i> also known as <i>Kifaayat-ut-Taalib-il-Labeeb fee Khasaa&#8217;is-il-Habeeb</i> of As-Suyootee<br />
2. <i>Al-Amwaal</i> of Abu &#8216;Ubaid Al-Qaasim bin Salaam<br />
3. <i>At-Tawheed</i> of Ibn Khuzaimah<br />
4. <i>Al-Mughnee</i> of Ibn Qudaamah<br />
5. <i>Subul-us-Salaam</i> of As-San&#8217;aanee</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Students:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to the Shaikh&#8217;s active role in teaching and especially due to his position in Umm-Qurraa in Makkah, many students were produced under his supervision, particularly those with professional and specialized degrees. From amongst those who learned at his hands were:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Dr. Mahmood Muhammad Mazroo&#8217;ah: Professor of Creed at the Umm-ul-Qurraa University of Makkah.<br />
2. Dr. Ahmad &#8216;Atiyyah Az-Zahraanee: Former head of the Creed department at the Umm-ul-Qurraa University of Makkah.<br />
3. Dr. Ahmad &#8216;Atiyyah Al-Ghaamidee: Professor of Creed at the Islamic University of Madeenah.<br />
4. Dr. &#8216;Alee Naasir Al-Faqeehee: Former professor of Creed at the Islamic University of Madeenah; now retired from teaching.<br />
5. Dr. Muhammad Amaan Al-Jaamee [D. 1416H]: Former head of the Creed department at the Islamic University of Madeenah.<br />
6. &#8216;Abdul-Fattaah Salaamah: Head of the Tafseer Department in the Advanced Studies section of the Islamic University of Madeenah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Death:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh was particularly very active in the last year of his life as he delivered many lectures that year in Tanta, Mahalla and the Ansaar-us-Sunnah&#8217;s main center. Shaikh Muhammad Khaleel Harraas passed away in 1395H (Sept. 1975) when he was close to sixty after having lived a life full of calling to Allaah, teaching and writing. May Allaah have mercy on him and grant him a lofty abode in Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Recently, a student named Moosaa bin Waasil As-Sulamee based his thesis for obtaining his master&#8217;s degree from the College of Da&#8217;wah and Usool-ud-Deen at the Umm-ul-Qurraa University in Makkah on the subject: &#8216;Shaikh Khaleel Harraas and his Efforts in Establishing the Creed of the Salaf.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The researcher chose Shaikh Harraas as the subject for his thesis, in his own words: &#8216;Due to the fact that the writings of the Shaikh are characterized with profuse knowledge, a clear technique, and a deep understanding of the beliefs of those who oppose the Creed of the Salaf, which makes the attempt to divulge on these efforts of his a source of great benefit and good.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In summary, the study shows that Shaikh Muhammad Khaleel Harraas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Was distinguished by his strong ability to use texts from the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah as evidence for his points, which indicate his firm and well-grounded knowledge.<br />
2. Adhered strictly to the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah and would refer to them and judge by them in all affairs.<br />
3. Showed great concern for the principles upon which the theorists and philosophers based their beliefs on with regard to matters of Creed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Sources used for his Biography:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sources used for this particular biography were the biographical accounts of the Shaikh found in the Dar-ul-Minhaaj 2003 edition of <i>Sharh al-Qaseedat-un-Nooniyyah</i>, the Dar-ul-Imaam Ahmad 2008 edition of the same book and &#8216;Abdul-Fattaah Salamaah&#8217;s biography of him found in the Dar-ush-Sharee&#8217;ah 2004 edition of <i>Fasl-ul-Maqaal</i>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Compiled &amp; Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya hafidhahullaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1- The ‘<em>Allamaa</em> The <em>Muhadith </em>Muhammad Nasr ud-Deen al-Albaani</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani says;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;&#8230;.As for the people who know about this science then they do not have any doubt in the weakness of this type of hadeeth.  Here we have Shaykh Muqbil bin Haadee al-Yemani who mentions in his checking of &#8216;Ibn Katheer&#8217; (v1 p.513) after briefly speaking about the narrators of the <em>isnaad</em> one by one;&#8217; the hadeeth is weak due to a break in the <em>isnaad</em> and because of the weakness of UbaydAllaah bin Waleed ar-Rasaafee&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from &#8216;Silsilah ad-Da&#8217;eefah  V5 p.95&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani was asked about Muqbil bin Haadee al-Waadi&#8217;ee and Rabee bin Haadee al-Madkhalee he answered with;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;We, by no doubt praise Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em> that He has subjected/provided for this righteous <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>, which stands upon the Book, the Sunnah and the methodology of the <em>Salaf as-Saalih</em>, many callers to Islaam in the different Islaamic countries who establish the duty which is established by very few of the people in the Islaamic world today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore these two shaykhs are a blessing, the two callers to the Book, the Sunnah and what the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em> were upon, who battle against those who oppose this correct <em>Manhaj.</em>  As everyone knows (regarding those who oppose these two shaykhs) &#8211; that this certainlyemanates from two types of people; &#8216;either from an ignorant person or a person who follows his desires&#8217;.  As for the ignorant person then it is easy to guide him, since he thinks that he has some knowledge-so when correct knowledge is explained to him he is guided.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why I have said on many occasions that many of the organisations which are prevalent today, even though they have deviated away from our <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>, we find amongst them those who have sincerity &#8211; which is more beloved to me than some of those in our <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>.  Although it becomes clear that they are not with us in the sincerity which is a condition for the acceptance of all good actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who follows his desires, then we have no other way for him except that Allaah <em>Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala</em> guides him.  So those who criticise the two Shaykhs, are as we mentioned either ignorant, so they are educated, or he who follows his desires, then Allaah&#8217;s refuge is sought from this person&#8217;s evil, and we request from Allaah that He either guides him or He breaks his back.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Shaykh Muqbil, I have not read much of his works, unlike the case of our brother Rabee.  What seems apparent is that Rabee is more active in writing than Shaykh Muqbil and vice versa in <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>, (Shaykh Muqbil is more involved in) mixing with the people and inviting them to the Book and the Sunnah, admonishing them and directing them more so than Shaykh doctor Rabee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Shaykh Muqbil then the people of Makkah know their pastures better &#8211; the news that reaches us from you is the best testimony that Allaah has blessed him with ability which is probably unparalleled when compared to some of the other callers to Islaam on the face of the earth today. So we ask Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal </em>that He grants the Muslims the capability to acknowledge firstly their (i.e. the two shaykhs’) religion and that they are far from following their desires.&#8217;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2) The <em>Allaama</em> The <em>Faqeeh</em> Ash-Shaykh AbdulAzeez bin Baz</strong></p>
<p>A questioner from Yemen asked the Shaykh where he should go to study knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh answered: &#8216;Go to Shaykh Muqbil.&#8217;</p>
<p>When Shakyh Bin Baz spoke about the history of the Dawa&#8217; in Yemen he mentioned: &#8216;this is the result of the fruits of honesty and sincerity.&#8217;</p>
<p>Shaykh Bin Baz would accept references -from Shaykh  Muqbil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muqbil mentioned: At that time a person escaped to Riyadh and he said to Shaykh Bin Baz: O Shaykh I&#8217;m from <em>Ahlus-Sunnah</em> but I don&#8217;t have any documents.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Bin Baz said to him: &#8216;Prove to me that you&#8217;re from <em>Ahl-us-Sunnah</em>.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man took out a piece of paper with a reference from me, upon that the Shaykh wrote a letter for him with which he could travel to wherever he wanted.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from &#8216;Rathaa shaykhina libin Baz p. 16&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3) Shaykh the <em>Faqeeh</em> Uthaymeen.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Uthaymeen said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Tell him that I regard him as a reviver of Islaam.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from &#8216;Nubtha Mukhtasira&#8217; (p.9) by Umm Abdullaah the daughter of Shaykh Muqbil</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4) Shaykh Muhaddith Rabee bin Haadee al-Madkhalee</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Rabee also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;He is a reviver of Islaam in the country of Yemen. There has not been, since the time of AbdurRazaq as-Sanaani until our time, anyone who has established the <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> and revived it like al-Waadi&#8217;ee.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from &#8216;Nubtha Mukhtasira&#8217; (p.9) by Umm Abdullaah the daughter of Shaykh Muqbil</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said in his advice to the <em>Salafis</em> of Yemen and in poetry he recited when mourning for the Shaykh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;This is what we express as condolence about the flag bearer of the Sunnah and <em>Tawheed</em>, that caller to Allaah, the reviver in truth in the land of Yemen. The effects of his <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> reached to many regions of the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say to you what I believe, that your country, after the best generations, came to know the Sunnah and the <em>Manhaj</em> of the <em>Salaf as-Saalih</em>.  The Sunnah appeared at different periods of time with strength, yet still I do not know of any period like this, with which Allaah has blessed you and the people of Yemen at the hands of this righteous man, the<em>Muhadith</em>, the <em>Zahid</em>, the <em>Wara&#8217;</em> who stamped the world and its adornment under his feet.&#8217;   Dated: 1422/5/1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from &#8216;al-Abhaaj bitarjamat al-Allama al-Muhadith Abee Abu AbdurRahmaan Muqbil bin Hadi al-Waadi&#8217;ee wa Dar al-hadeeth bi-Damaj&#8217; p.163</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Rabee also said: On the death of our Shaykh the Imam Muqbil bin Haadee al-Waadi&#8217;ee may Allaah have mercy on him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;May Allaah make your reward great and give good condolences, may He forgive your dead.  Allaah gives and takes what is His and everything has an appointed time.  This is the Sunnah of Allaah<em>Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala</em> and all praise belongs to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah that He covers this man with His mercy and is pleased with him. This man <em>Zahid</em>, the pious, whom I regard InshAllaah as a reviver in our time from the revivers of Islaam.  May Allaah have mercy on him.  He was burdened with carrying the <em>Dawa&#8217; </em>and he handled its responsibility, its difficulties and toiling with patience,<em>Zuhud</em> and piety.  All these means helped in spreading his <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> and raising his status InshAllaah with his Lord and with the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory on his students that they continue on the path of the noble Messenger <em>-alayhi as-sallat wa sallam &#8211;</em> in the light of the Book and the Sunnah and upon the <em>Manhaj </em>of the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em> &#8211; upon the actions of the <em>Manhaj </em>of this man who you saw with your eyes, witnessed with your sight and came to know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I hope that his example was a living example for you to follow in the<em>Deen</em> and to hold onto in piety and <em>Zuhud</em> and with patience at theharm faced in making the word of Allaah <em>Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala</em> high and spreading the <em>Deen</em> of Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from &#8216;al-Abhaaj bitarjamat al-Allama al-Muhadith Abee Abu AbdurRahmaan Muqbil bin Hadi al-Waadi&#8217;ee wa Dar al-hadeeth bi-Damaj&#8217; p.164</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>5) Shaykh Ahmad bin Yahya an-Najmee</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Mufti</em> of the south said when he came to visit Dar al-hadeeth in Dammaj after the shaykh passed away. His visit was on 3rd Jumad al-Akhir 1422 A.H.:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Praise belongs to Allaah on His <em>Qada</em> and His <em>Qadr</em>.  It is necessary to have patience since all people will die.  However whoever leaves behind the likes of this then he is not regarded as one who has died, since he has established something, he has reformed, he has invited and he has exerted himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We love that he is regarded (as being) of the virtuous people and of the pious from the highest of the <em>Awliyah</em>.  This is how we regard him and Allaah will take all of us to account.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However we see all this, we see it with our own eyes, and feel it with our senses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we know <em>&#8211; alhamdulillah &#8211;</em> that he did a lot of good, very few people can reach what he did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All these centres of learning which emanated from Yemen are goodness from his good deeds, rather from some of his good deeds. Every person who is in charge of a centre is from his students and all of them are examples to be followed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that anyone who establishes good or does a good action and whoever follows that good action, then the person who initiated that good deed will have a reward as well as the reward of the one who acts upon that deed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Like the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> said, &#8220;whoever calls to goodness then he will be rewarded and he will have the reward of the one who acts upon what he calls to from goodness.  Whoever originates misguidance or calls to it then upon him is the sin and the sin of the one who acts upon that evil.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah for forgiveness and goodness. This gathering, which we see, is nothing except from the good deeds of this great Shaykh who called to Allaah and was patient and steadfast.  He sacrificed all that was dear and every precious thing in gathering these faces, encouraging them to study knowledge and placing them on the correct path-the path that Allaah <em>Subhanahu Ta&#8217;ala</em> ordered to follow since He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((And verily, this is My Straight Path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">for they will separate you away from His Path. This He has ordained for you that you may become <em>Al-Muttaqoon</em> (God fearing)))</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The last of our call is that we ask Allaah <em>Azza wa  Jal </em>that He forgives our dead and our afflicted Ummah altogether. That Allaah forgives him and pardon his mistakes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em> to forgive him his mistakes.  We are completely convinced <em>InshAllaah</em> that the like of these deeds are a reason for Allaah forgiving His slave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah that He forgives Shaykh Muqbil and that He gives usthe ability to take him as an example in these good deeds and that we follow the path he followed in giving the correct <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> to the Book of Allaah, to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> and to the actions of the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em>.  We ask for the ability to follow this <em>Salafi Manhaj</em>, which is the methodology of the<em>Salaf</em> -may Allaah be pleased with them.  May Allaah send prayers upon our Prophet Muhammad and his Family and his Companions.&#8217;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>6) Shaykh Salih ibn Fawzan al-Fawzan</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was asked about the <em>Aqeedah</em> of Shaykh Muqbil, and he replied with:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Yes, Shaykh Muqbil &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him- studied here in this country, in the Islamic University.  He learnt <em>Tawheed</em> and went to Yemen.  He called to Allaah and to <em>Tawheed</em>.  His <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> is good, as far as I have heard and as far as the fruits from that <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>go.  Allaah caused him to benefit.  May Allaah have mercy on him.&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Died 1422H: Imaam Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi’ee</strong><b></b></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">AUTHOR: Shaikh Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi’ee (<strong>Autobiography</strong>)</span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"> SOURCE: Tarjamah Abee ‘Abdir-Rahmaan (pg. 16-29, with minor abridgement) [2nd Edition; 1999] </span><span style="color:#008000;">PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-align:justify;">I come from Waadi’ah, which is a place to the east of the city of Sa’adah from the valley of Dammaaj. My name is Muqbil bin Haadee bin Muqbil bin Qaa’idah al-Hamdaanee al-Waadi’ee al-Khallaalee, from the tribe of Aali Raashid. [1] </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise due to Allaah, most of the people of Waadi’ah, who neighbor Sa’adah defend me and the Da’wah. Some of them wish to defend the Religion while others defend their tribal devotion. If it were not for Allaah first, then them, the enemies of the (Salafi) Da&#8217;wah, particularly the Shee’ah of Sa’adah, would not have left behind any signs or traces of us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I will mention some examples of them for which I ask Allaah to reward them, one of which was when I faced severe opposition in the Haadee Mosque because I turned people away from the (Shiite) Da’wah there. So some men from Waadi’ah and others stood by me to the point that Allaah saved me through their hands. The Shiites desired to rule against me. This was at the time of Ibraaheem Al-Hamdee. And evil people amongst the Communists and Shiites raised their heads and imprisoned me for a period of eleven days during Ramadaan. About fifty of the youth from Waad’iah would come to visit me in prison during some of the nights, while another hundred and fifty of their men would also go to the prison caretakers during these nights, so much so that the caretakers got fed up and released me from jail, all praise be to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example is that the enemies of the Da’wah would sometimes come to Dammaaj with their weapons, so the people of Dammaaj would drive them away and they would be forced to leave in humiliation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example is during our journeys. When I would say: “We wish to travel”, they would compete with one other, may Allaah preserve them, to see who would accompany and guard me. So sometimes we would go out on some of our travels in about 15 cars!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During these days, the Da’wah was progressing in a superb manner because, all praise be to Allaah, I had grown older. Perhaps at this point I have reached about 62 years of age. So it was the calamities and the advice from those who love the Da’wah that drove me to have kindness and to not keep up with the enemies, who don’t have anything but insults and abuses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, due to my teaching, writing and giving Da’wah, I was not able to find time to keep up with those enemies. So let them say what they want for my sins are many, and perhaps because of their slander, my sins will be lightened for me and instead fall upon their shoulders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>My Studies and Teachers:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I studied at school until I completed the school’s curriculum. Then a long time passed without me seeking knowledge since there was no one who would encourage me or assist me in seeking knowledge. And I used to love seeking knowledge. So I sought knowledge from the Al-Haadee Mosque but I was not assisted in that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After some time, I left my homeland (of Yemen) and went to the sacred lands (Makkah/Madeenah) and Najd. I would listen to the speakers and be fascinated by their sermons. So I sought the advice of some of the speakers on what beneficial books I should buy? They advised me to get Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, Buloogh al-Maraam, Riyaadh as-Saaliheen, and Fath-ul-Majeed, the explanation of Kitaab at-Tawheed. And they gave me copies of the textbooks from the Tawheed courses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At that time, I used to work as a security guard in a building in Makkah, and so I would cling tightly to those books, and the material would stick to my head because what the people in our country did was the opposite of what was in these books, especially Fath-ul-Majeed. After some time had passed, I returned to my country and began to rebuke everything I saw that contradicted what was in those books, such as offering sacrifices to other than Allaah, building shrines over the graves, and calling unto the deceased. So news of this reached the Shiites and they began to censure what I was upon. One of them would say (the hadeeth): <b>“Whoever changes his religion, then kill him.”</b> Another one sent a letter to my relatives saying: “If you don’t prevent him, we will imprison him!” But after that, they agreed to let me enter the Haadee Mosque in order to study with them, so that they may (perhaps) remove the misconceptions that had clung to my heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So after that, I was admitted to study with them in the Haadee Mosque. The head of education there was the Judge Mutahhir Hanash. I studied the book <i>Al-‘Aqd-uth-Thameen</i> and <i>ath-Thalaatheen Mas’alah</i>, along with its explanation by Haabis. From the teachers that taught me there was Muhammad bin Hasan al-Mutamayyiz. One time we were discussing the subject of seeing Allaah in the Hereafter, so he began to mock and ridicule Ibn Khuzaimah and other Imaams of Ahlus-Sunnah, but I used to conceal my creed. Despite that, I was too weak to put my right hand over my left hand during prayer, and I would pray with my hands by my side. We studied the text of al-Azhaar up to the section on Marriage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also studied an explanation of the Laws of Inheritance from a large book that was above the standard level, but I did not benefit from it. So I saw that the assigned books were not beneficial, except for Grammar, since I studied the books <i>al-Aajroomiyyah</i> and <i>Qatar an-Nadaa</i> with them. Then I asked the Judge, Qaasim bin Yahyaa ash-Shuwayl, to teach me Buloogh al-Maraam. So we started it, but then we were disapproved of, so we left it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when I saw that the assigned study books were of a Shiite and Mu’tazlite nature, I agreed to only take from the books of Grammar. So I studied <i>Qatar an-Nadaa</i> several times under Isma’eel al-Hatbah, may Allaah have mercy on him, in the masjid that I would live in and he would pray in. And he would give us a lot of time and attention. One time, Muhammad bin Hooriyyah came to the masjid and I advised him to abandon astrology (<i>tanjeem</i>). So he advised the people there to kick me out of the study program, but they interceded on my behalf and he kept quiet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the Shiites would pass by me while I was studying <i>Qatar an-Nadaa</i> and say something with the meaning that education would not have any effect on me. But I would just remain silent and benefit from the books on Grammar. I did this until the revolution started in Yemen, when we left our country and settled in Najraan. There I studied with Abul-Husayn Majd-ud-Deen al-Mu’eed and benefited from him particularly in the Arabic Language. I stayed in Najraan for the length of two years. Then when I became sure that the war between the Republic party and the King’s party (in Yemen) was all for the sake of worldly reasons, I resolved to travel to the sacred lands (Makkah/Madeenah) and to Najd. I lived in Najd for one and a half months in a school for Qur’aanic memorization, which was run by Shaikh Muhammad bin Sinaan Al-Hadaa’ee. He was very hospitable to me because he saw that I benefited from the knowledge. And he advised me to stay for a while until he could send me to the Islamic University (of Madeenah). But the environment in Riyaadh changed for me and I decided to travel to Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I used to work whenever I found work, and I would seek knowledge at night, attending the lessons of Shaikh Yahyaa bin ‘Uthmaan al-Paakistaanee on Tafseer Ibn Katheer, Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree and Saheeh Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I would go over several books and there I met two noble Shaikhs from the scholars of Yemen:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>First:</b> The Judge, Yahyaa al-Ashwal. I would study <i>Subul-us-Salaam</i> of as-San’aanee with him and he would teach me any subject that I asked him about.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Second:</b> Shaikh ‘Abdur-Razzaaq ash-Shaahidhee al-Muhwaytee. He would also teach me whatever I asked him about.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the educational institute in Makkah opened and I took the entrance exam with a group of students, and I passed, all praise be to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most distinguished of our teachers there was Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez as-Subayyal. I, along with a group of students from the institute, would also study with Shaikh ‘Abdullaah bin Muhammad bin Humayd, may Allaah have mercy on him, the book <i>at-Tuhfah as-Saniyyah</i> after ‘Ishaa at the Haram. He, may Allaah have mercy on him, would bring many points of benefit from Ibn ‘Aqeel and other scholars’ explanation. The lessons were above the level of my colleagues, so they began to slip away until he eventually stopped the class.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also studied along with a group of students with Shaikh Muhammad as-Subayyal, may Allaah preserve him, the subject of the Laws of Inheritance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After staying in the institute for some time, I left to go to my family in Najraan. Then I brought them to live with me in Makkah. We resided there together for the length of my studies in the institute and the Haram itself, which lasted six years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The blessing of studying in the masaajid is well known. Do not ask about the friendly environment and relaxation we felt while in the masaajid. The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) indeed spoke the truth when he said: <b>“A group of people do not gather together in one of the Houses of Allaah, reciting the Book of Allaah and studying it amongst themselves, except that tranquility descends upon them, angels surround them, mercy engulfs them, and Allaah mentions them to those by Him.” </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I would spend the day studying in the institute, and all of the lessons would assist my Creed and Religion. Then from after ‘Asr till after the ‘Ishaa prayer, I would go to the Haram and drink from the Zamzam water, about which the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“Verily, it is a drink that satiates and a cure for diseases.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we would listen to the speakers that came to Makkah from different lands to perform Hajj or ‘Umrah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the teachers that we learned from at the Haram between Maghrib and ‘Ishaa was Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin Raashid an-Najdee, author of the book “<i>Tayseer-ul-Wahyain fil-Iqtisaar ‘alal-Qur’aani was-Saheehain</i>”, in which he has errors that we don’t agree with him on. He, may Allaah have mercy on him, used to say: “The authentic ahaadeeth that are not found in the two Saheeh Collections can be counted on one’s fingers.” This statement of his stuck to my mind since I had objections to it. This was all the way until I decided to write “<i>As-Saheeh-ul-Musnad mimmaa laysa fis-Saheehain</i>” after which I became more certain about the falsehood of his statement, Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, he was a man of Tawheed, who had strong knowledge of the Science of Hadeeth and was able to distinguish the authentic from the weak and the defective from the pure with regard to hadeeth. What amazed me about him was that he would call people away from <i>taqleed</i> (blind-following), to the point that he wrote a treatise called “<i>At-Tawaagheet-ul-Muqanna’</i>” [Masked Deities of Falsehood]. So the government, and likewise some of the senior scholars, thought that he intended them by it. So the committee of senior scholars gathered together to debate with him. They said: “Did you intend us and the government with this book?” So he replied: “If you feel that you possess the characteristics that I mentioned in the book, then it includes you. And if you feel that you do not possess those characteristics that I mentioned in the book, then it doesn’t include you.” Thereafter, the book was banned from entering into the Kingdom. I was informed about this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One night, he was asked to give a class, but it was as if to only test him. So he began his class with Allaah’s statement: <b>“Follow that which has been revealed to you from your Lord and do not follow false gods besides Him. Little do you remember.”</b> [Surah Al-A’raaf: 3] He followed that with numerous ayaat that prove the prohibition of <i>taqleed</i> (blind-following). After this, he was restricted from teaching at the Haram, and we ask Allaah’s aid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from my teachers at the Grand Mosque (Haram) of Makkah who I benefited from was Shaikh Muhammad bin ‘Abdillaah as-Sumaalee, for I attended his lessons for about seven or more months. And he was an <i>ayah</i> (manifest sign) in terms of knowledge of the narrators used by the two Shaikhs (Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim). I benefited immensely from him in the Science of Hadeeth. All praise to my Lord, since I started seeking knowledge, I didn’t love anything except knowledge of the Book and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After I completed the intermediate and secondary levels of the educational institute in Makkah, and after completing all of my religious lessons, I moved to Madeenah to go to the Islamic University there. Most of us transferred to the Faculty of Da’wah and Usool-ud-Deen. The most distinguished of those who taught us there were: Shaikh as-Sayyid Muhammad al-Hakeem and Shaikh Mahmood ‘Abdul-Wahhaab Faa’id, both from Egypt. When vacation time came, I feared that time would go by wasted so I joined the Faculty of Sharee’ah, due to two reasons, the first of which was to acquire knowledge:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was since some of the classes there were successive while others were combined. So it was a like a repetition of what we had studied in the Faculty of Da’wah. I completed both Faculty courses, all praise be to Allaah, and I was given two degrees. However, all praise be to Allaah, I give no regard to certificates; what merits recognition in my opinion is knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the same year that I finished the two College courses, an advanced studies program opened in the Islamic University, which they called the Masters program. So I went for the interview exam and passed, all praise be to Allaah. The advanced studies course was on the Science of Hadeeth. All praise be to Allaah, I studied the subject that I loved the most. The most prominent of those who taught us there was Shaikh Muhammad al-Ameen al-Misree, may Allaah have mercy on him, Shaikh As-Sayyid Muhammad al-Hakeem al-Misree, and during the last part of my studies, Shaikh Hammaad bin Muhammad al-Ansaaree. On some nights, I would attend the classes of Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin Baaz in the Prophet’s Mosque (in Madeenah) on the subject of Saheeh Muslim. I would also attend the gatherings of Shaikh Al-Albaanee, which were specified to only the students of knowledge, in order to learn from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While I was in Makkah, I would teach some of the students of knowledge from the books <i>Qatar-un-Nadaa</i>and <i>at-Tuhfah as-Saniyyah</i>. And while I was in Madeenah, I would teach some of my brothers the book <i>at-Tuhfah as-Saniyyah</i> in the Prophet’s Mosque. Then I promised my Muslim brothers that I would hold classes on the <i>Jaami’</i> (<i>Sunan</i>) of at-Tirmidhee, <i>Qatar-un-Nadaa</i> and <i>Al-Baa’ith-ul-Hatheeth</i> for them in my house after ‘Asr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a great wave of Da’wah spread from Madeenah, which filled the world in the time-span of six years. It was some righteous people who were ones who took on the task of financing it, while Muqbil bin Haadee and his Muslim brothers were the ones who took on the task of teaching their fellow brothers. As for traveling for the purpose of Calling to Allaah throughout all regions of the Kingdom, then this was shared between all of the brothers – the student of knowledge so that he can acquire knowledge and benefit others, and the common person so that he could learn. This was such that many of the common folk benefited and grew to love the (Salafi) Da’wah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of our Muslim brothers from amongst the students of knowledge was an Imam of a masjid in Riyadh. One time some people of knowledge rebuked him for using a sutrah. So he said: “We are unable to in front of you, but by Allaah, no one but a common person will get up to teach you the ahaadeeth of the Sutrah.” So he called a brother from the general folk who loved the Da’wah and had memorized the ahaadeeth of the Sutrah from “<i>Al-Lu’lu wal-Marjaan feemataffaqa ‘alayhi ash-Shaikhaan</i>.” So he got up and narrated these ahaadeeth, after which the opposers felt ashamed and stayed quiet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After this, the blind followers and the scholars of evil began to set in motion, and the reason for this stirring of the blind-followers, who were considered scholars in the eyes of the people, was because whenever they would find a young student of knowledge amongst our students and they would use a hadeeth as proof, the student would say to them: “Who reported the hadeeth?” And this was something they were not accustomed to. Then he would say to them: “What is the status (i.e. grading) of the hadeeth?” This was something that they also weren’t accustomed to. So they would embarrass them in front of the people. And sometimes the student would say to them: “This is a weak hadeeth. There is so and so in its chain of narration and so and so declared him weak.” So upon hearing this, it is as if the earth would become constricted beneath these blind-followers. And they would then go about spreading lies that these students were Khawaarij, when in fact the brothers were not from the Khawaarij who make it lawful to shed a Muslim’s blood and who deem a Muslim a disbeliever on the count of sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, there would occur some errors on the part of some of the new brothers, and this was because the beginner is almost always overwhelmed with excessive zeal. At that time, I was preparing my Master’s dissertation, when all of a sudden one night, before I knew what was happening, they arrested me and arrested almost one hundred and fifty others. Some people were able to escape, but the earth trembled between those who opposed and those who agreed with out arrest. We remained in prison for a month or a month and a half. After that we were set free, all praise be to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shortly after this, the treatises from Juhaymaan were released and a group of us were again arrested. [2] During the interrogation, they asked me: “Where you the one who wrote this?” What, Juhaymaan can’t write? So I denied this, and Allaah knows that I didn’t write it nor did I assist in any part of it. But after staying in jail for three months, an order was made for foreigners to be deported.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I arrived at Yemen, I went back to my village and stayed there for a while teaching the children Qur’aan. Before I knew it, it seemed like the whole world was in an all-out battle against me. It was as if I had come out to destroy the country, the Religion and the rulership. At that time, I didn’t know any leader or tribal chief. So I would say: “Allaah is sufficient for me and the best of Guardians.” When things would get tight, I would go to San’aa or to Haashid or to Dhimmaar, and also to Ta’iz, Ibb and Hudaydah to give Da’wah and to visit the Muslims brothers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After some days, some good-doers sent me my library from Madeenah. They sent the books to Sa’adah where the head of shipments there was malicious of the Sunnah. Some of our companions went to request the books from him, so he said: “Come back after Dhuhr, Allaah willing.” But he didn’t return after Dhuhr. Instead, some Shiites mobilized and requested the caretakers to confiscate the books because they were Wahaabbi books!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not ask about the monetary fees, hardships and injustice that occurred to me as a result of trying to get my books! Many of the brothers from the inhabitants of my country made great efforts to follow that up, including Shaikh ‘Abdullaah bin Husayn al-Ahmar, Shaikh Hazaa’ Dab’aan, the caretakers of the Guidance and Counseling Center, such as the Judge Yahyaa al-Fasayyal, may Allaah have mercy on him, and brother ‘Aa’id bin ‘Alee Mismaar. After a long difficulty, the people of Sa’adah sent a telegraph to the President ‘Alee bin ‘Abdillaah bin Saalih, so he assigned the case to the judge, ‘Alee as-Samaan. The judge sent me a letter and promised that he would turn over the library to me. And he said: “The people of Sa’adah are very strict. They call the scholars of San’aa disbelievers.” So I went to San’aa to get my books. Allaah decreed that my books arrive there while the judge ‘Alee Samaan was out of the country on a mission. So when some of the brothers went to ask for it, the head of the Ministry of Endowments told them: “These books need to be inspected.” So some of our Muslim brothers at the Center for Guidance and Counseling mobilized and went to request the books. So they said: “These books are under our jurisdiction. We must examine them, so whatever is upright, we will hand over to al-Waadi’ee and whatever violates the Religion, we will keep it with us.” So by doing this, they discovered that the books were in fact purely religious and turned the them over to me without inspecting them, so may Allaah reward them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I brought the books into my country, all praise be to Allaah. And my close ones, may Allaah reward them, built a small library and a small masjid. And they said: “We will pray Jumu’ah here to avoid hardships and problems. Sometimes we would pray there with only six people present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One time the governor Haadee al-Hasheeshi asked for me, so I went to Shaikh Qaa’id Majlee, may Allaah have mercy on him, who then called him and said: “What do you want from al-Waadi’ee?” He said: “Nothing, except to get to know him.” So he said: “We will look for him in his institute.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another instance, some other leader asked for me and so Husayn bin Qaa’id Majlee went with me to see him. He (Majlee) began to talk against the Shee’ah and explain to him that we call to the Qur’aan and the Sunnah and that the Shee’ah hate us because of that because they fear that the truth will come out about them, so this leader said: “Indeed, the Shiites have tainted the history of Yemen, so as long as your Da’wah (call) is as you say it is, then call to it and we are with you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After this I spent some time with my library. Only a few days had passed when some Egyptian brothers came and we started classes on some of the books of Hadeeth and the Arabic Language. After this, students continued to come from Egypt, Kuwait, the Sacred Lands (Makkah and Madeenah), Najd, ‘Aden, Hadramaut, Algeria, Libya, Somalia, Belgium, and other Muslim and non-Muslim countries.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The number of students has now reached between six to seven hundred students, amongst which are a hundred and seventy families.[3] And Allaah is the One who provides them with sustenance. And all of this is not because of our might or power, nor due to the amount of knowledge we have or because of our courage or eloquence in speech. Rather, this is something that Allaah willed to be. So He was the One, all praise to Allaah, that granted us this blessing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[End of Translation of Shaikh Muqbil’s Autobiography]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Death:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi’ee passed away on the 2nd of Jumaadal-Oolaa, 1422H (7/21/2001) due to a liver disease that he was suffering from for a long time, and due to which he traveled to America, Germany and Saudi Arabia during the last part of his life to seek treatment for. He was around seventy years of age when he died in Jeddah. His funeral prayer was held in Makkah and he was buried in the Al-‘Adl Cemetery near the graves of Shaikhs Ibn Baaz and Ibn Al-‘Uthaimeen, may Allaah have mercy on all of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Scholars’ Praise for him:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Muhammad bin Saalih Al-‘Uthaimeen said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> “Tell him that I consider him to be a mujaddid.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Al-Albaanee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“So degrading and belittling these two Shaikhs (Rabee&#8217; and Muqbil), who call to the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah and what the Salaf As-Saalih were upon and who wage war against those who oppose this correct methodology. As is quite clear to everyone, it either comes from one of two types of people. Either it comes from someone who is ignorant or someone who follows his desires&#8230; If he is ignorant, then he can be taught. But if he is one who follows his desires, then we seek Allaah&#8217;s refuge from the evil of this person. And we ask Allaah, Mighty and Sublime, to either guide him or break his back.&#8221;</span> [The Audio series <i>Silsilah al-Hudaa wan-Noor</i>: 1/851]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Shaikh Rabee’ Al-Madkhalee said about him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“He is the mujaddid in the lands of Yemen” and that he said: “there can’t be found from the time of ‘Abdur-Razaaq as-San’aanee to this present day someone who established the Da’wah and revived it as the likes of Al-Waadi’ee.”</span> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes</span>:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] <b>Translator’s Note:</b> In her biographical account of her father, Umm ‘Abdillaah Al-Waadi’iyyah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“His father died while he was young and he didn’t know him. So he grew up as an orphan and under the care of his mother for a period of time. She would ask him to work to make money and order him to look at the state of his community so that he could be like them. But he would turn away from this and say: ‘I will go out to study.’ So she would say: ‘May Allaah guide you.’ She would supplicate for him to be guided, as several women who were around at that time informed me. Perhaps her supplication coincided with the time when supplications are accepted since he became one of the guided, guiding others.” </span>[<i>Nubdhah Mukhtasarah</i>: pg. 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] <b>Translator’s Note:</b> This refers to Juhaymaan bin Muhammad al-‘Utaybee, a deviant from Saudi Arabia who took over the Grand Mosque of Makkah with hundreds of followers in 1979, and held it for several days, after which the senior scholars allowed force to be used in the sacred site of the Ka’bah in order to regain it. The Saudi National Guard subdued them about two weeks later after much blood was shed and casualties were lost on the part of the rebels and the Saudi army. The remaining dissidents that were captured were later beheaded. Shaikh Al-Albaanee (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) mentioned this Juhaymaan in his book <i>as-Saheehah</i> (5/872), saying: “…And like the followers of the Saudi Juhaymaan, who caused the fitnah in the Grand Mosque in Makkah at the beginning of the 1400’s (Hijree). He claimed that the awaited Mahdee was with him and sought from those present in the Mosque to give him <i>bay’ah</i> (allegiance). Some of the simple-minded, heedless and evil people followed him. Then Allaah put an end to their fitnah after they had shed much of the Muslims’ blood.”</p>

Written by Haanee bin Saalim Al-Husaynee Al-Haarithee<br />
Producer: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This biography was written by Haanee bin Saalim Al-Husaynee Al-Haarithee in Jeddah and was distributed in the Saudi newspaper “al-Jazeerah”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah were shocked when the news reached them about the death of the noble shaikh, Dr. ‘Abdus-Salaam bin Barjas bin Naasir Aali ‘Abdil- Kareem (born 1387h) who had died on a Saturday night on 3/12/1425H in a terrible car accident while on his way from Ahsaa to Riyadh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh ‘Abdus-Salaam was well known to the scholars and shuyookh of this blessed country (i.e. Saudi Arabia). The proof for this was the large amount of scholars and teachers that attended his funeral prayer. And I indeed heard some of the people of knowledge and virtue say about him: <span style="color:#008000;">“The level of knowledge of Shaikh ‘Abdus-Salaam surpassed his age.”</span> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it was also said about him: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Had he lived long, he would have been an ayah (proof/sign).”</strong></span> And I have seen a large amount of scholars and students of knowledge affected by his loss. This was since he was a defender of the Sunnah, safeguarding it with his life, pen and wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah blessed me by allowing me to be close to the Shaikh for a period of time, which is considered short in comparison to the number of close friends and loved ones he had. During my closeness to him, whenever I would hear anything from him concerning his biography and personal information, I would write it down. So, after a while, I had collected several pieces of information about him. And every time I would gather with him, I would remind him about that, and he would say to me: “I am not one whose biography should be recorded. I am less (significant) than that.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, I now feel that it is the least of my duties to him that I bring out this biography even though it has deficiencies in it. So I say, while seeking assistance from Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>His Name and Lineage:</strong><br />
He was Abu ‘Abdir-Rahmaan ‘Abdus-Salaam bin Barjas bin Naasir Aali ‘Abdil- Kareem. He was born in Riyadh in 1387H as confirmed in his personal identity card. He was raised under the care of his parents and their home was a place of religiousness and righteousness. Ever since his youth, the Shaikh was intelligent, determined, diligent and hard-working.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>His Early Studies:</strong><br />
He memorized the Qur’aan and began seeking knowledge at the age of 13. His teachers observed distinguishing and distinctive signs in him, thus giving him special attention and importance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh studied at the hands of a number of scholars in this blessed country, the likes of:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The Imaam and great scholar, <strong>Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin ‘Abdillaah bin Baaz</strong> (D. 1420H), may Allaah have mercy on him, whom he accompanied for a period of time, attending a number of his lessons, particularly his classes on Buloogh-ul- Maraam of Ibn Hajr, Tafseer Ibn Katheer and other books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. And among them was the scholar of Fiqh and Usool, <strong>Muhammad bin Saalih bin ‘Uthaimeen</strong> (1421H), may Allaah have mercy on him. Shaikh ‘Abdus-Salaam traveled to him between the years 1401H and 1403H during the regular school breaks. He also maintained close contact with him when Shaikh Muhammad began his classes in Al-Masjid-ul-Haraam in Makkah in 1402H. He would also live with him before he accompanied the Shaikh and his family to Makkah. This also includes the other times he spent with him. He studied Kitaab at-Tawheed with him, as well as al-‘Aqeedah al-Waasitiyyah and some statements from Zaad al- Mustaqni’ on Fiqh, al-Ajroomiyyah on Grammar, Shaikh Muhammad’s abridgement of al-Qawaa’id of Ibn Rajab and almost half of Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree. Shaikh Muhammad would have great respect and esteem for Shaikh ‘Abdus- Salaam. I even saw this for myself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. He also kept close company with Shaikh ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Ibn Jibreen, whom he accompanied for a period of four years in which he read and studied the book at-Tawheed of Ibn Khuzaimah under him, as well as an- Nooniyyah of Ibn Al-Qayyim along with its explanation by Ibn ‘Eesaa. Shaikh ‘Abdus-Salaam memorized almost one thousand lines from it. He also studied Zaad al-Mustaqni’ along with (its explanation) Ar-Rawd al-Murabbi’ and Ma’aarijul- Qabool of Shaikh Haafidh Al-Hakamee. Shaikh ‘Abdus-Salaam benefited immensely from Shaikh Ibn Jibreen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Also amongst his teachers was the great scholar and Muhaddith, ‘Abdullaah bin Muhammad Ad-Duwaish (D. 1409H). He studied the Alfiyyah of Al-‘Iraaqee and a portion of Sunan Abee Dawood under him during his scheduled school breaks in Buraidah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. He also studied under Shaikh Saalih bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Atram in the College of Sharee’ah of the Imaam Muhammad bin Sa’ood University. He studied the notes on ar-Rawd by Ibn Qaasim and attended his lessons in the masjid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. His teachers also include Fahd Al-Humain, may Allaah preserve him, under whom he studied Tawheed and Fiqh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. He also studied under Shaikh ‘Abdullaah bin Qu’ood whom he read Fat’h-ul- Majeed with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. Also amongst his teachers was the scholar of Fiqh and Usool, ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan bin Ghudayaan whom he studied under while in the higher institute of judicial education.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. Amongst them was Saalih bin Ibraaheem Al-Baleehee (D. 1410H). He attended his classes on Zaad al-Mustaqni’ along with his notes to it, which is called as-Salsabeel fee Ma’rifat-id-Daleel.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. Amongst them also was the Shaikh, Dr. ‘Abdul-Kareem Al-Khudair under whom he studied Nayl-ul-Awtaar of Ash-Shawkaanee and the Alfiyyah of Al- ‘Iraaqee on Hadeeth Terminology.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. His teachers also include A. D. ‘Abdul-Muhsin bin Muhammad Al-Muneef under whom he studied ar-Rahbiyyah on the Laws of Inheritance while in Makkah in 1405H during Ramadaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>His Positions and Advanced Studies:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are just some of the teachers the Shaikh studied under with the determination of the people of knowledge. As for his organized studies, the Shaikh acquired his education in the city of Riyadh. There, he began his primary level studies. Then he joined an educational institute under the auspices of the Imaam Muhammad bin Su’ood University. After that, he moved on to the College of Sharee’ah at the same university and graduated from it in 1410H. Upon his graduation, he was appointed as a teacher in the educational institute in Qaway’iyyah, which is located about 170 kilometers west of Riyadh on the road to Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then aspired to continue his education with higher studies, so he joined the higher institute for judicial education and completed his Masters there. The title of his Master’s thesis was “at-Tawtheeq bil-‘Uqood fil-Fiqh-il-Islaamee.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was then appointed a judge in the Ministry of Justice, but he asked to be excused from this position. He was finally granted his request after much hard struggle. He was then nominated to work in the bureau of complaints and injustices in the city of Jeddah. However, he only stayed in that position for one week. He then abandoned the bureau out of dislike for it and looking to absolve himself from it. He returned to Riyadh as a lecturer for the higher institute of judicial education. And he obtained his Doctorate’s degree in 1422H due to his verification of the book “al-Fawaa’id-ul-Muntakhabaat Sharh Akhsar-ul- Mukhtasaraat” of ‘Uthmaan bin Jaami’ (D. 1240H) in conjunction with others. The person that supervised him in this project was the current head Muftee of Saudi Arabia, Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez Aali Shaikh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After this, he was appointed an assistant professor, a position he held up until his death, may Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>His Manners:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was profound in his good manners and humbleness, and he was known for his gentleness, amiability and cheerfulness with his parents, teachers, family members and colleagues. Everyone that associated with him knew him to be this way. This is why there were so many people that were affected and griefstricken upon hearing news of his death. We ask Allaah to unite us with him in His honourable abode. [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh ‘Abdus-Salaam was also an excellent poet. His poetic verses were of the highest quality and at the uppermost level of precision. He has recorded poetic talks. His poetry shows his naturalness at this talent and that he had no need for writing it down (i.e. he would make poetry off the top of his head). He would use poetry in his regular conversations and it would be limited to his friends and loved ones. If we were to try to collect all these poems, they would fit into a moderatesized volume – may Allaah assist the one who compiles it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>His Books and Writings:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh ‘Abdus-Salaam possessed a fluent writing style and used elegant expressions. He has authored numerous books which have spread far and wide, going to the east and the west, and producing much benefit. He wrote his first book before reaching eighteen years of age. His books are valuable and of great benefit. I will now mention those books he wrote, which I am aware of, including both those that are printed and those that are not:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Al-Qawl-ul-Mubeen fee Hukm-il-Istihzaa bil-Mu’mineen (The Clear Statement on the Ruling of Mocking the Believers) – printed in a concise treatise.<br />
2. Eeqaaf-un-Nabeel ‘alaa Hukm-it-Tamtheel (Alerting the Noble Person on the Ruling of Plays) – published in an average-sized paperback. [3]<br />
3. At-Tamannee (Hope) – published.<br />

8. Al-Abyaat al-Adabiyyah al-Haasirah (Confined Poetic Verses on Ethics) –published twice.<br />
9. Al-Abyaat-ul-‘Ilmiyyah al-Haasirah – The Shaikh mentioned it in his introduction to his afore-mentioned book, stating that he has yet to finish it. I asked him five months before his death about it, and he told me it was still not complete. If it were to be completed it would indeed be something amazing. The Shaikh let me review two sections from it. If it were to be printed in the manner that the Shaikh left it, it would still be very beneficial.<br />
10. Al-Mu’taqid-us-Saheeh Al-Waajib ‘alaa Kulli Muslim I’tiqaadu (The Correct Creed that Every Muslim must Believe in) – Originally, this treatise was a lecture that the Shaikh gave in the Central Mosque. Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin Baaz commented on this talk and praised Shaikh ‘Abdus-Salaam, may Allaah have mercy on both of them. One of the noble mashaayikh suggested to the Shaikh to print the book, so he did so. It was published several times and much benefit came from it.<br />
11. Ibtaal Nisbat-ud-Deewaan al-Mansoob Li-Shaikh-il-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah (The Falsehood of Ascribing ad-Deewaan to Ibn Taimiyyah) – published in a small paperback.<br />
12. Majmoo’ Shi’r Shaikh-il-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah (A Compilation of Poems from Ibn Taimiyyah) – published as an appendix in the afore-mentioned book.<br />
13. Mu’aamalat-ul-Hukaam fee Daw’-il-Kitaab was-Sunnah (Interacting with the Rulers in Light of the Qur’aan and Sunnah) – This book was printed several times. Much benefit came from it. It is a book that is unique in its subject.<br />
14. Al-Amr bi-Luzoom Jamaa’at-il-Muslimeen wa Imaamihim wat-Tahdheer min Mufaaraqatihim (The Obligation of Sticking to the Unified Body of Muslims and their Imaam and a Warning on Splitting from them) – The source for this book is a chapter in the afore-mentioned book. One of the mashaayikh close to him advised him to publish it separately due to its importance.<br />
15. Bayaan al-Mashroo’ wal-Mamnoo’ min at-Tawassul (A Clarification of the Legislated and Prohibited Forms of Tawassul) – published.<br />
16. At-Tawtheeq bil-‘Uqood fil-Fiqh-il-Islaamee (Authenticating Contracts according to Islamic Jurisprudence) – This was a scholastic research which the Shaikh presented in order to receive his Master’s Degree in the higher institute for judicial education. It has not been published.<br />
17. Qat’-ul-Miraa fee Hukm-id-Dukhool ‘alaal-Umaraa (Removing Arguments on the Ruling of Entering in the Presence of Rulers) – The Shaikh wrote this book at the request of one of the noble mashaayikh. It has been published in a small volume.<br />
18. Al-Ahaadeeth an-Nabawiyyah fee Dhamm-il-‘Unsuriyyah al-Jaahiliyyah (The Prophetic Ahaadeeth on the Censure of the Nationalism of the Days of Ignorance) – This was published in a medium-sized booklet.<br />

20. Mashroo’iyyah Hibbat-ith-Thawaab (The Legality of Presenting Rewards) – It is formatted and ready for print.<br />
21. Al-Muhaadaraat fid-Da’wah wad-Du’aat (Lectures on the Call and the Callers) – The book consists of nearly thirteen lectures the Shaikh delivered, which I took the task of transcribing along with a brother, Mansoor bin Mubaarak As-Safaree. The Shaikh then reviewed it and made corrections to it. It was then formatted and is now ready for publication.<br />
22. Sharh Al-Muharrir fil-Hadeeth li-Ibn ‘Abdil-Haadee (D. 744H) – The Shaikh devoted a lot of time to this book, loved it and had a strong desire to complete its explanation. However, Allaah willed that he not complete it. He was only able to finish the chapter on Purification and most of the chapter on Prayer.<br />
23. Tadween-ul-‘Aqeedah As-Salafiyyah: Juhood A’immat-il-Islaam fee Nashr-il- ‘Aqeedat-il-Islaamiyyah (The Recording of the Salafee Creed: The Efforts of the Muslim Imaams in Spreading the Islamic Creed) – It is a wonderful book containing lots of benefit. It consists of a list of the books of the Salaf on Creed along with brief biographies for each of their authors. The Shaikh originally intended to make the book two volumes, the first one consisting of books from the first century to the end of the seventh century, and the second one from the beginning of the eighth century to modern times. The Shaikh completed the first volume. As for the second volume, he did not begin writing it, according to my limited knowledge. The first volume is formatted and ready for publication. I have a photocopy of it in my library.<br />
24. A book on Fiqh – The Shaikh would mention it often and he said he was revising it and examining it in depth. I don’t know how much he cut off from it.<br />
25. Taraajim Li-Ba’ad-il-‘Ulamaa (Biographies of Some of the Scholars) – I do not have any information on this book other than that the noble Shaikh, ‘Abdul- Kareem bin Muhammad Al-Muneef mentioned it to me and told me that Shaikh ‘Abdus-Salaam told him about it.<br />
26. Bayaan Mashroo’iyyat-id-Du’aa ‘alaal-Kaafireen bil-‘Umoom (A Clarification on the Legality of Supplicating against the Disbelievers in General) – This is a small booklet on this subject printed in eight pages and widespread.<br />
27. Darb-ul-Mar’ah baina Hukm-ish-Shara’ wa Waaqi’-in-Naas (Hitting Women between its Legal Ruling and the Actions of People). There may be other books that I am not aware of. [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh has also written numerous articles which have been distributed in newspapers and magazines.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>His Verifications:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh also gave special importance and time to verifying, spreading and working hard to distribute the books of the scholars of Najd. He deserves credit, after that of Allaah, for reprinting the book: “Majmoo’-ur-Rasaa’il wal-Masaa’il An- Najdiyyah.” This book was originally published in 1346H. He, may Allaah have mercy on him, also took on the task of verifying many of the treatises that were published in two volumes, the first with the title “Silsilat Rasaa’il wa Kutub ‘Ulamaa Najd-il-A’laam”, and the second with the title “Min Rasaa’il ‘Ulamaa Najd Al-Fiqhiyyah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are as follows:<br />
1. Dahd Shubuhaat ‘alaat-Tawheed of Shaikh ‘Abdullaah Abaa Butayn<br />
2. Al-Fawaa’id-ul-‘Udhaab of Shaikh Hamad bin Mu’amar<br />

7. As-Sawaa’iq-ul-Mursalah ash-Shihaabiyyah of Shaikh Sulaymaan bin Sahmaan<br />

11. Shifaa-us-Sudoor fir-Radd ‘alaal-Jawaab-il-Mashkoor of Shaikh Muhammad bin Ibraaheem<br />
12. Ar-Radd ‘alaa Jareedat-il-Qiblah of Shaikh Sulaymaan bin Sahmaan<br />

22. Al-Fawaa’id-ul-Muntakhibaat fee Sharh Akhsar al-Mukhtasaraat of Ibn Jaami’ An-Najdee – The Shaikh verified this book and presented it to the advanced judicial institute to obtain his Doctorate’s Degree in Comparative Fiqh. He verified the book from its beginning to the end of the chapter on gifts. The person in charge of supervising this treatise was the current Muftee, Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez Aali Shaikh, may Allaah prolong his life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are other books that the Shaikh verified but which have not been printed yet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh ‘Abdus-Salaam was eager to spread the books of knowledge in general and the books of the scholars of the Salafee Da’wah in particular. He would at times make photocopies of manuscripts or strive to obtain them for those who would take on the task of verifying them. More than thirty books and treatises were counted in which the verifiers mentioned that they used some of the manuscript copies that were found in the Shaikh’s library for their verifications.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many other stories and reports which are hard to confine here. May Allaah facilitate their compilation and arrangement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s Note: This means he had more knowledge than was typical for his young age.<br />
[2] Translator’s Note: It is important to note that the Shaikh also was diligent and active in the field of Da’wah as he would travel throughout Saudi Arabia to participate in conferences and seminars. This also includes his trips to the United Kingdom in which he delivered several lectures and lessons for the benefit of the Muslims there.<br />
[3] Translator’s Note: In his introduction to this treatise, Shaikh Saalih Al-Fawzaan said: “I have reviewed the valuable book written by Shaikh ‘Abdus-Salaam bin Barjas bin Naasir Aali ‘Abdil-Kareem with the title ‘Eeqaaf-un-Nabeel ‘alaa Hukm-it-Tamtheel’, which consists of evidences for the prohibition of such an act. In it, he mentions the arguments used by those who allow it, so I found it, all praise be to Allaah, to be a valuable treatise, comprehensive in its subject. It will solve a current problem that has affected many scholars and teachers. Shaikh ‘Abdus-Salaam, may Allaah reward him, has clarified the truth in it, leaving no room for doubt concerning the prohibition of plays.” Shaikh Rabee’ Al-Madkhalee said: “I reviewed this valuable knowledge-based research, which was actively put together by the noble youth, the one with enthusiasm for the Religion, Shaikh ‘Abdus-Salaam bin Barjas.”<br />
[4] Translator’s Note: This does not include the many lectures he gave which were later transcribed and published as booklets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="headline" style="text-align:justify;">1349H-1416H: Shaikh Muhammad Amaan bin &#8216;Alee Al-Jaamee</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Source:  Excerpted from Al-Ibaanah.com with slight updates</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>His Name and Birth:</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His name was Muhammad Amaan bin Alee Jaamee Alee; and he went by the nickname Abu Ahmad. He was born and raised in <strong>Ethiopia</strong> in the district of Harer, town of Taga Tab. According to his official documents, he was born in 1349H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>His Early Studies: </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh grew up in the town of Taga Tab (Ethiopia) where he learned the Noble Qur&#8217;aan. After completing the Qur&#8217;aan, he began studying the books of Fiqh according to the madh-hab of Imaam Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee, may Allaah have mercy on him. He also studied Arabic in his hometown with Shaikh Muhammad Ameen Al-Hareree.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then justify his hometown as was the custom of the inhabitants of that area, and moved to another town where he met with a man who would become his colleague in seeking knowledge and migrating to Saudi Arabia, Shaikh Abdul-Kareem. So the ties of Islamic brotherhood were formed between the two of them. After meeting, they would go together to study under a teacher called Shaikh Moosaa under whom they studied <i>Nadham-uz-Zubd</i> of Ibn Raslaan. They then studied the text of <i>al-Minhaaj</i> under Shaikh Abaadir. While in this town, they learned several disciplines of Islamic knowledge.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The pair then had a desire to travel to the holy land of Makkah to seek knowledge and fulfill the obligation of Hajj. So they justify from Ethiopia and headed for Somalia where they boarded a ship and headed for Aden (Yemen). There they experienced many hardships and perils on both land and sea but they continued on to Hudaidah by foot and fasted the month of Ramadaan there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They then departed for Saudi Arabia and passed through Saamitah and Abi &#8216;Areesh until they got permission to enter Makkah, which they walked to on foot. While in Yemen, some teachers warned them against the Salafi Dawah, which they called Wahhaabee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>His Studies while in Saudi Arabia: </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the Shaikh performed Hajj in 1369H, he began to seek knowledge in the study circles held in the precincts of Al-Masjid-ul-Haraam. There, he learned from Shaikh Abdur-Razzaaq Hamzah, may Allaah have mercy on him, Shaikh Abdul-Haqq Al-Haashimee, may Allaah have mercy on him, Shaikh Muhammad bin Abdillaah As-Sumaalee and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While in Makkah, he came to know <strong>Shaikh Abdul-Azeez bin Baaz</strong> and accompanied him in his journey to Riyadh when the Educational Institute was opened. This was in the early seventies (i.e. 1370H).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the colleagues he studied with while undergoing secondary studies at the Educational Institute was <strong>Shaikh Abdul-Muhsin bin Hamad Al-Abbaad</strong> and Shaikh Alee bin Mahnaa, former judge in the Central Courthouse of Madeenah. At the same time, he would attend the many circles of knowledge in Riyadh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also benefited and was influenced by the (former) Muftee, the great scholar of Jurisprudence and Principles, <strong>Shaikh Muhammad bin Ibraaheem Aali Shaikh</strong>, may Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would stick closely to <strong>Shaikh Abdur-Rahmaan Al-Afreeqee</strong>, may Allaah have mercy on him, as well as Shaikh Abdul-Azeez bin Baaz, may Allaah have mercy on him, whose vast knowledge and noble manners he was able to absorb.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Riyadh, he studied under <strong>Shaikh Muhammad Al-Ameen Ash-Shanqeetee</strong>, may Allaah have mercy on him, and the Muhaddith, <strong>Shaikh Hammaad Al-Ansaaree</strong>, may Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was also greatly influenced by <strong>Shaikh Abdur-Razzaaq Al-Afeefee</strong>, even in his manner of teaching. Likewise, he benefited from and was influenced by <strong>Shaikh Abdur-Rahmaan bin Naasir As-Saadee</strong>, may Allaah have mercy on him, since they would write letters to each other. However, it should be known that he did not study under Shaikh As-Saadee. He also learned under <strong>Shaikh Muhammad Khaleel Harraas</strong>, may Allaah have mercy on him, whom he was greatly influenced by, and <strong>Shaikh Abdullaah Al-Qaraawee</strong>, may Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>His Scholastic Accreditation: </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He completed his secondary studies at the Educational Institute in Riyadh, then joined the College of Shareeah and obtained his diploma in 1380H. He then received the equivalent of a Masters Degree in Shareeah from the University of Punjab (Pakistan) in 1974 and thereafter a Doctorates Degree from Daar-ul-Uloom in Cairo.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>His Scholarly Status and the Scholars Praise for him: </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh held a high status amongst the people of knowledge and virtue as they would mention good things about him and rely on him. In fact, reliance upon his knowledge and Creed reached the point that when he was a student in Riyadh, and his teacher Shaikh Abdul-Azeez bin Baaz, saw his superiority and enthusiasm for knowledge, he referred him to Shaikh Muhammad bin Ibraaheem, may Allaah have mercy on him, which resulted in him being appointed a teacher at the Educational Institute in Saamitah in the district of Jaazaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What also proves the trustworthiness of his knowledge and Creed and his high regard amongst the scholars was the fact that when the Islamic University in Madeenah was opened, he was appointed to teach in it after being selected by Shaikh Abdul-Azeez bin Baaz, may Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is well known that the Islamic University of Madeenah was founded in order to disperse the Creed of the Pious Predecessors. And this same University entrusted him to teach this Creed, first in the secondary institute and then in the College of Shareeah, due to their trust in his Creed, knowledge and methodology and so that he could participate in achieving the Universitys goals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Below are some of the statements of the trustworthy scholars that they wrote about Shaikh Muhammad Amaan Al-Jaamee, may Allaah have mercy on him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In a letter written (no. 64) by the former Muftee of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, <strong>Shaikh Abdul-Azeez bin Baaz</strong>, may Allaah have mercy on him, on 1/9/1418H, he said about Shaikh Muhammad Amaan: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">He is known to me for possessing knowledge, virtue, a good Creed, and activeness in Calling to Allaah and warning against innovations and misconceptions. May Allaah forgive him, grant him an abode in Paradise and keep his progeny upright. And may He gather us, you and him in the abode of His honor. Verily, He is All-Hearing and All-Near.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In a letter dated 3/3/1418H, <strong>Shaikh Saalih bin Fawzaan Al-Fawzaan</strong> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Shaikh Muhammad Amaan as I knew him: Indeed, the students and those who hold various type of higher degrees are many, but there are only a few from whose knowledge and personality you could truly benefit from. Shaikh Muhammad Amaan was one of these few rare scholars who employed their knowledge and efforts in order to benefit Muslims and guide them by calling them to Allaah upon knowledge. This was via the classes he would give while at the Islamic University and the Prophets Masjid as well as during the excursions he would undertake inside and outside of the Kingdom in order to give lessons and lectures on various topics. He would call to Tawheed and propagate the correct Creed, and he would direct the Muslim youth towards the methodology of the pious Predecessors (<i>Salaf as-Saalih</i>) while warning them about destructive principles and deviant calls.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Whoever did not know him personally should get to know him by way of his beneficial books and numerous tapes, which consist of a deluge of the great amount of knowledge and immense benefit he possessed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaikh Abdul-Muhsin bin Hamad Al-Abbaad</strong>, a teacher at the Prophets Masjid, may Allaah preserve him, said: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;I came to know Shaikh Muhammad Amaan bin Alee Al-Jaamee when he was a student in the Educational Institute of Riyadh and then when he was a teacher in the Islamic University of Madeenah in the secondary level and then in the university level. I knew him to have a good Creed and following a safe course. He dedicated himself to clarifying the Creed upon the beliefs of the Predecessors and to warning against innovations by way of his classes, lectures and writings. May Allaah forgive him, have mercy on him and grant him an immense reward.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Director of the Islamic University of Madeenah, Dr. Saalih bin Abdillaah Al-Abood, said in a letter written on 4/15/1417H: The brother, Shaikh Mustafaa bin Abdil-Qaadir, asked me to write something about Shaikh Muhammad Amaan Al-Jaamee, may Allaah have mercy on him, that I know personally about him and his good qualities. So I complied with his request by writing these brief words even though I was not one of his students or close companions throughout the times I met him and mixed with him. However, there were some meetings that took place between him and I, may Allaah have mercy on him, from which I benefited and which resulted in us getting to know each other better and love for the sake of Allaah to develop between us, not to mention a firm conformance with the methodology of the <i>Salaf-us-Saalih</i> in matters of Creed and refuting opposition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad bin Alee bin Muhammad Thaanee, a former teacher in the Prophets Masjid, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in a letter dated 1/4/1417H: <span style="color:#008000;">He was a Salafee scholar of first class rate in sacrificing himself for the Islamic Call. He was also very active in giving lectures in mosques and educational seminars both in and out of the country (of Saudi Arabia). He authored many books on Creed and other subjects. May Allaah reward him on behalf of Islaam and the Muslims with the best of rewards</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Muhammad bin Abdil-Wahhaab Marzooq Al-Bannaa</strong>, may Allaah preserve him, said about him: <span style="color:#008000;">He, may Allaah have mercy on him, was upon good, which we love, such as good manners, sound Creed and pleasant companionship. I ask Allaah to shower him with His Mercy, grant him an abode in Paradise, and gather us together there as brothers upon thrones facing one another.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaikh Umar bin Muhammad Fulaata</strong>, a teacher in the Prophets Masjid and Director of the Daar-ul-Hadeeth branch, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in a letter dated 2/8/1417H: In general, he, may Allaah have mercy on him, was honest in speech, immense in his ascription to the beliefs of Ahlus-Sunnah, and strong in his desire to call to Allaah through speech and action. He was reserved in speech, strong in clarifying, and quick to get angry when Allaahs laws were violated. The gatherings he would hold in the Prophets Masjid, the books he would distribute, and the travels he would undergo speak on his behalf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I accompanied him one time on a journey and what a great friend he was! He himself accompanied the great scholar Muhammad Al-Ameen Ash-Shanqeetee, may Allaah have mercy on him, author of <i>Adwaa-ul-Bayaan</i> and other books, on a journey and also served as a good companion for him. A journey is that in which the true nature of a man becomes revealed. He would not flatter others, nor would he be hypocritical. He would not argue or dispute with others. If the proof was with him, he would openly proclaim it. And if the opposite of what he adhered to became apparent to him, he would take on that view and recant from his prior position. This is the common practice of the believers as Allaah says: <b>The only saying of the faithful believers when they are called to Allaah and His Messenger to judge between them is that they say: We hear and we obey! Such are the successful.</b> [Surah An-Noor: 51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I call upon Allaah as a witness to the fact that he, may Allaah have mercy on him, fulfilled many times over his duty of serving the Religion and spreading the Sunnah of the chief of messengers (i.e. Prophet Muhammad). As a result he encountered much harm and was subjected to plots and conspiracies, but he did not give in nor was he dissuaded from his goal until he met Allaah. The last words he uttered were the testimonies of <i>Laa Ilaaha illaaAllaah and Muhammadur-Rasoolullaah.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaikh Umar Fulaata</strong>, may Allaah have mercy on him, also said: I came to know Shaikh Muhammad Amaan bin Alee Al-Jaamee, may Allaah have mercy on him, since a long time ago, after he came to this country (of Saudi Arabia) seeking knowledge, searching for good, and looking to learn the Creed of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I met him in 1372H in the home of our teacher, example, and fatherly figure, Shaikh Abdur-Rahmaan bin Yoosuf Al-Afreeqee, may Allaah have mercy on him and us, in Riyadh, since he would spend a lot of time with him and benefit from him. When I asked about him, I was informed that he had come from Saamitah where he would teach and participate in examinations in the educational institute and faculties under the Aali Shaikh family.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What caused me to notice him at that time was his vigor, zeal, superiority and great concern for speaking the pure Arabic language as well as his ability to explain clearly some of the problematic Fiqh issues, which showed that he was a well-versed student of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Not much time passed since then until it was conveyed to me that our teacher, Shaikh Abdur-Rahmaan Al-Afreeqee, presented him with the opportunity of becoming part of his family by way of him marrying his wifes sister. So based on this, the ties between them became strengthened and the connection and love between them increased.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The professor, Dr. Muhammad Hamood Al-Waailee, teacher in the Prophets Masjid and Islamic University of Madeenah as well as its headmaster for Advanced Studies and Educational Research, said in a letter dated 5/29/1417H: I began my acquaintance of the Shaikh in 1381H when this noble country of Saudi Arabia first opened the Islamic University in Madeenah. He was one of the first to teach there and I was one of his students. He was from a number of teachers that would give their students special attention, which was not restricted to just that of a student-teacher relationship in class.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would devote a great amount of attention in most of his classes to the Creed of the Pious Predecessors, may Allaah be pleased with them, and would not let any opportunity pass in which he would not explain its status and high position. This was the same whether his lessons were on Creed or on other subjects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he would discuss the Creed of the pious Predecessors and attempt to implant it into the souls of his students a majority of who came from all places abroad he would speak with profound experience and knowledge of this Creed, as he had tasted its sweetness and treaded its path, to the point that those listening and watching him would feel as though their hearts would become soft with love and affection for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would undergo journeys in order to spread the Call and teach outside of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. He would not let any occasion or opportunity pass without clearly explaining the loftiness, purity and nobility of this Creed. Anyone who reads the books and treatises that he wrote will come to realize the truth of his Call.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I attended the deliberation of his doctorates dissertation in Dar-ul-Uloom, which falls under the University of Cairo in Egypt. In most of his research, he strove to clarify the purity of the Creed and the soundness of the methodology of the pious Predecessors. His academic persona became apparent throughout the discourse in his ability to expose the falseness of every methodology that deviated from the methodology of the pious Predecessors</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In summary, he may Allaah have mercy on him, had great love for the Creed of the pious Predecessors and he was sincere in calling to it and dedicated to defending it. Nothing prevented him from speaking the truth about it not even people turning away from him and boycotting him. May Allaah have mercy on him and forgive him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dr. Muhammad bin Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Khumayyis, teacher at the Imaam Muhammad bin Suood Islamic University in Riyadh wrote: The noble Shaikh, Muhammad Amaan bin Alee Al-Jaamee, may Allaah have mercy on him, from what I knew about him, was from the strongest at defending and calling to the Creed of the pious Predecessors. He would defend it in books, lectures and seminars. And he was strict in refuting those who opposed the Creed of the pious Predecessors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is as if he sacrificed his entire life for this Creed in terms of learning it, teaching it, instructing it and calling to it. He realized the importance that this Creed has on the life and uprightness of a human being. And he acknowledged the danger that innovations which opposed this Creed have on the livelihood of society and individuals. So may Allaah have mercy on him and forgive him and all of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The afore-mentioned statements of people of knowledge and virtue about Shaikh Muhammad Amaan Al-Jaamee show his academic status and his efforts and struggle in calling to Allaah for close to his last forty years. His strong love and interest for clarifying and teaching the Creed of the Salaf brought him to high levels of distinction to the point that he became known amongst the scholars for his devotion to it. But apart from Creed, he was also very well-versed in the subjects of Tafseer, Jurisprudence, and the Arabic language.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>His Books and Writings: </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh authored several books and delivered many lectures and classes, which were transcribed before and after his death and published. Below is a list of some of his most famous and highly regarded works:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <i>As-Sifaat-ul-Ilaahiyyah fil-Kitaab was-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah fee Daw-il-Ithbaat wat-Tanzeeh</i> [The Divine Attributes in the Quraan and Prophetic Sunnah in light of Affirming and Absolving] This is one of the larger books of the Shaikh, which is highly beneficial in its subject.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. <i>Adwaa alaa Tareeq ad-Dawah ilaal-Islaam</i> [Illuminations upon the Path of Calling to Islaam] This book consists of a number of lectures he gave, which affirm the Creed of the Salaf, present the status of the Call to Islaam in Africa, discuss the problems faced by the Call and the Callers in current times and their solutions, and provide a refutation of the Sufees.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. <i>Al-Muhaadarah ad-Difaaiyyah an-is-Sunnah al-Muhammadiyyah</i> [A Lecture in Defense of the Sunnah of Muhammad] The source of this book was a lecture he delivered in 1383H in Sudan in which he refutes the atheist Mahmood TaHa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. <i>Haqeeqat-ud-Dimuqratiyyah wa annahaa laisat minal-Islaam</i> [The Reality of Democracy and a Clarification that it is not from Islaam] The source of this treatise was a lecture he gave in 1412H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. <i>Haqeeqat-ush-Shooraa fil-Islaam</i> [The Reality of Shooraa in Islaam] This is a small treatise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. <i>Al-Aqeedat-ul-Islaamiyyah wa Taareekhuhaa</i> [The Islamic Creed and its History] An excellent treatise on the progression and evolution of the recording of Creed and the formation of deviant groups throughout the history of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. <i>Nidhaam-ul-Usrah fil-Islaam</i> [The Structure of the Muslim Family] A short treatise which was originally a lecture he gave in Africa. The book was translated and published in English.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many of the lessons and classes the Shaikh would give explaining classical works on Creed and Jurisprudence were also transcribed and published on the Internet and in book format. Amongst these works are his explanations of:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <i>Tajreed-ut-Tawheed</i> of Al-Maqreezee<br />
2. <i>Thalaathat-ul-Usool</i> of Muhammad bin Abdil-Wahhaab<br />
3. <i>Shuroot-us-Salaat</i> of Muhammad bin Abdil-Wahhaab<br />
4. <i>Al-Usool-us-Sittah</i> of Muhammad bin Abdil-Wahhaab<br />
5. <i>Al-Aqeedat-ut-Tadmuriyyah</i> of Ibn Taimiyyah<br />
6. <i>Al-Qawaaid-ul-Muthlaa</i> of Ibn Al-Uthaimeen and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>His Students: </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is hard to imagine that a man of such a high regard amongst the scholars and who expended such great efforts in his call to Allaah and his love for the Creed of the Salaf would be void of any students. Many students studied under him to the point that it is difficult to confine their amount due to their large number. However, from the most outstanding of them are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Dr. Rabee bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee;<br />
2. Shaikh Zayd bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee;<br />
3. Dr. Alee bin Naasir Al-Faqeehee, teacher in the Prophets Masjid;<br />
4. Dr. Muhammad Hamood Al-Waailee, teacher in the Prophets Masjid and headmaster of the Islamic Universitys Advanced Studies department;<br />
5. The Muhaddith, Shaikh Abdul-Qaadir bin Habeebillaah As-Sindee, may Allaah have mercy on him;<br />
6. Dr. Saalih bin Saad As-Suhaymee, teacher in the Prophets Masjid and Islamic University;<br />
7. Dr. Ibraaheem bin Aamir Ar-Ruhaylee, teacher in the Islamic University;<br />
8. Dr. Bakr bin Abdillaah Abu Zaid, member of the Committee of Senior Scholars;<br />
9. Dr. Falaah Ismaeel, teacher in the University of Kuwait.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Some of his Noble Characteristics: </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1. His Sincerity: </b>He, may Allaah have mercy on him, was sincere to Allaah, His Book, His Messenger, the Muslim Imaams and their common-folk. This becomes apparent with just the slightest bit of reflection, since if one looks at his life, he will see that the Shaikh sacrificed his entire life in affirming what our Lord is deserving of in terms of His Lordship, Worship, and Names and Attributes according to the understanding of the pious Predecessors. This can be seen in his lessons, writings, lectures, and refutations against those who opposed the Quraan and Sunnah. Furthermore, he was just and balanced when refuting his opponents steering clear from partisanship and vain desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>2. His Mixing Little with People: </b>He, may Allaah have mercy on him, was known to mix little with people unless it was for good. So as a result most of his time and his days would be reserved. His manner of doing this was well known since he would go out from his home to work in the Islamic University, then return home, then go to the Prophets Masjid to give classes there after Asr, after Maghrib, after Ishaa and after Fajr. He would continue to follow this schedule up until he was bedridden when his illness worsened.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>3. His Reserved Tongue: </b>He, may Allaah have mercy on him, was also reserved in speech, He would not speak ill, throw blame or backbite others. In fact, he would not allow anyone to backbite others while in his presence nor would he permit anyone to convey gossip and people&#8217;s defects to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If any students of knowledge fell into error, he would request the tape or the book (containing the error) and would listen or read it. If it became apparent to him that it was in fact an error, he would fulfill his requirement of advising that person.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>4. His Forgiving Nature and Forbearance: </b>He would react to those who treated him badly by displaying forbearance and forgivingness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many times people would come up to him on the street or while in the Prophets Masjid and ask his forgiveness for speaking bad about him and attacking his honor, and he would say to them: I hope Allaah will not cause anyone to enter the Hellfire because of me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would also pardon those who sought to destroy his reputation, saying: There is no need for anyone to come to me to seek my pardon, for I have already pardoned everyone. And he would request those in his gatherings to convey this from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>5. His Concern and Care for His Students: </b>He, may Allaah have mercy on him, was from those who gave special to his students, which would not stop with the end of his classes. He would attend their special functions, ask about their situations, take care of some of their needs, and help them out with some of their family problems or some of the hardships of life that they encountered. In general, he would make use of his money, reputation, and time in order to assist those students of his that were needy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These actions of his justify a profound effect on his students and as a result, he would earn true love from them. His students felt the great gap in this aspect after he died. The truth is that the Shaikh, may Allaah have mercy on him, possessed many good characteristics, all of which cannot be mentioned here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Some of his Wise Sayings: </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh said: It is upon our youth to take advantage of their free time by spending it on studying books that cure the diseases of the heart. This will cause a person to try to adhere to the ways and practices of the pious Predecessors in being steadfast and upright, and not just practicing it outwardly. Practicing Islaam on the outside is of no use by itself. Wearing a short garment (<i>thawb</i>) and growing a long beard are two things that Allaah has prescribed and encouraged. However, if there cannot be found any Islamic concept and understanding behind that, these outward features are of no use or benefit. [The tape: <i>Sharh Asbaab Inshiraah-us-Sadr</i>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>His Salafee Creed: </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What proves that the Shaikh was upon a sound Salafee Creed was that fact that he would teach from the classical books of Creed from the pious Predecessors, such as: <i>al-Waasitiyyah, al-Fataawaa al-Hamawiyyah al-Kubraa, at-Tadmuriyyah, Sharh al-Aqeedatut-Tahaawiyyah of Ibn Abil-Izz, al-Eemaan, Thalaathat-ul-Usool, Fath-ul-Majeed, Qurratu Uyoon-ul-Muwahhideen, al-Usool-us-Sittah, al-Waajibaat-ul-Mutahattimaat, al-Qawaaid-ul-Muthlaa</i> and <i>Tajreed-ut-Tawheed</i> of Al-Maqreezee. These lessons were recorded and are widely available in cassette form. He would explain some books several times such as <i>Thalaathat-ul-Usool.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would also refute the people of innovation, such as the Sufees, the Sheeah, and the Rawaafid as can be witnessed in his books, the articles he would write for scholastic magazines, and the lectures and classes he would give. As an example, refer to his book: <i>Adwaa alaa Tareeq ad-Dawah ilaal-Islaam</i> [Illuminations upon the Path of Calling to Islaam].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>His Sickness and Death: </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the last part of his life, he was stricken with a terminal illness to the point that he was bedridden for almost a year. But he endured it with patience and forbearance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Umar Fulaata, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: In the last part of his life, he was stricken with chronic illnesses, but endured them. One of his children related to me that before he died, he gathered his family together, advised them and emphasized in counseling them to be conscious and fearful of Allaah (Taqwaa), to maintain family ties, and to strive upon the Salafee Creed up until the time that they meet Allaah. The last thing he said before he died was the testimony that: There is no deity that is worshipped in truth except Allaah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On a Wednesday morning, on the 26th of Shabaan 1416H, his soul returned back to its Creator. His funeral prayer was held on that day after Dhuhr and he was then buried in the Baqee-ul-Gharqad Cemetery in Madeenah. A large group of people were present at his funeral including amongst them many scholars, judges, and students of knowledge. His death put the ummah at a loss, since they were now lacking a great and hard-working scholar, may Allaah grant him a spacious abode in Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Sources for his Biography: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Refer to the biographical account of the Shaikh written by his student, Mustafaa bin Abdil-Qaadir Al-Fulaanee in 3/5/1419H as found in the book: The Islamic Creed and its History (pg. 5-22) with alterations and additions.</p>
