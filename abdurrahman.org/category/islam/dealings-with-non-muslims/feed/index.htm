<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَا إِكْرَاهَ فِي الدِّينِ ۖ قَد تَّبَيَّنَ الرُّشْدُ مِنَ الْغَيِّ ۚ فَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِالطَّاغُوتِ وَيُؤْمِن بِاللَّهِ فَقَدِ اسْتَمْسَكَ بِالْعُرْوَةِ الْوُثْقَىٰ لَا انفِصَامَ لَهَا ۗ وَاللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>No-one is to be compelled to enter the Religion, true guidance has been made clear and distinct from falsehood.  So whoever rejects <em>at Taaghoot</em> and truly believes in Allaah, then he has grasped the firmest handhold that will never break. And Allaah is All Hearing, All Knowing. </strong></span>[2:256]<span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>83</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">83</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Perfect and Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَا إِكْرَاهَ فِي الدِّينِ ۖ قَد تَّبَيَّنَ الرُّشْدُ مِنَ الْغَيِّ ۚ فَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِالطَّاغُوتِ وَيُؤْمِن بِاللَّهِ فَقَدِ اسْتَمْسَكَ بِالْعُرْوَةِ الْوُثْقَىٰ لَا انفِصَامَ لَهَا ۗ وَاللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>No one is to be compelled to enter the Religion, true guidance has been made clear and distinct from falsehood.  So whoever rejects at <em>Taaghoot</em> and truly believes in Allaah, then he has grasped the firmest handhold that will never break. And Allaah is All Hearing, All Seeing.</strong></span>[2:256]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>No one is to be compelled to enter the Religion…</strong><strong> : </strong>Meaning – no one is to be forced to enter into Islaam against his will, because entering into Islaam must occur as a result of being convinced and from believing in the heart. And no one is to be forced into it against his will – this is not possible because no one can act with regards to the hearts except Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. No one may force anyone to enter Islaam because we do not possess and own the hearts. Rather it is just Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, He is the One who owns them and acts with regards to them. However we should call to Islaam and encourage people upon it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We strive and fight in Allaah’s Cause against whoever disbelieves, for the spread of Islaam and to provide an opportunity to whoever wants to accept Islaam, and in order to subdue the enemies of Allaah. But as for guidance, then it is in the Hand of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. No one is to be forced upon eemaan and Islaam. Rather this is something which relates back to the person himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; قَد تَّبَيَّنَ الرُّشْدُ مِنَ الْغَيِّ &#8230;</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>…true guidance has been made clear and distinct from falsehood…</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Islaam, and all praise is for Allaah, does not contain anything which people have to be forced upon against their will. Rather all of it is beloved and desirable. Whereas kufr and shirk, all of it is evil and all of it is something detestable. So this has become clear from that. As <em>rushd</em> (guidance) – and it is the Truth – has become distinguished from <em>al-ghayy</em> – and it is falsehood. And a person has intellect and has the ability to think so that he can weigh and compare truth against falsehood. And his thinking, if it is sound and if it is free from desires and ulterior motives, then his sound thinking will guide him to acceptance of the truth without having to be forced. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>This is one saying</strong></span> with regards to the <em>aayah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the second saying</strong></span> is that this aayah came down with regard to the People of the Book; and that the People of the Book are not to be compelled to enter into Islaam. Rather if they want to remain upon their religion then they are to be left to do so with the condition that they hand over the <em>jizyah</em> to the Muslims and they (the People of the Book) are in a state of being humbled. And as for other than them from the disbelievers, then nothing will be accepted from them except Islaam or being killed because they have no religion; and idol worship is a false and futile religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">And the third saying</span></strong> is that this <em>aayah</em> was abrogated by the <em>aayah</em> commanding <em>jihaad</em>. So this was the case initially before <em>jihaad</em> was legislated, then <em>jihaad</em> was legislated and the <em>aayah</em> was abrogated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However the first (of the three sayings) is what is correct &#8211; that the <em>aayah</em> is not abrogated and that the religion cannot be entered into the hearts by force. Rather it can only enter through choice. However whoever does not accept the Religion, he will be dealt with in a manner that befits him, whether it be being killed or having the <em>jizyah</em> tax taken from him if he be from those regarding whom Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, has legislated that it be taken from.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; فَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِالطَّاغُوتِ وَيُؤْمِن بِاللَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So whoever rejects <em>at-Taaghoot</em> and truly believes in Allaah…</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>At-Taaghoot</em> – what is meant is all of the <em>Taaghoots</em> in worship, in following or in obedience because the word “<em>at-Taaghoot</em>” here is left general.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rejecting the <em>Taaghoot</em> was put before having <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah (in the <em>aayah</em>) because having <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah will not benefit except after rejection of the <em>Taaghoot</em>. So whoever believes in Allaah but does not reject the <em>Taaghoot</em>, then his eemaan will not benefit him. So the person who says that he is a believer and he prays and he fasts and gives the <em>Zakaat</em> and performs the <em>Hajj</em> and he performs the acts of obedience but he does not dissociate himself from <em>shirk</em> nor from the people of <em>shirk</em> and says, “<em>They are not my business</em>” – this person will not be counted as a Muslim because he has not rejected the <em>Taaghoot</em>. So there must be rejection of the <em>Taaghoot</em> and it is to reject the <em>Taaghoot</em> and to believe as creed in its (the <em>Taaghoot’s</em>) falsehood and to distance oneself from it and from its people – this is essential. So his <em>eemaan</em> will not be correct except after rejecting the <em>Taaghoot</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in the other <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِي كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولًا أَنِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُوا الطَّاغُوتَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We sent a messenger to every nation commanding, “Worship Allaah alone and avoid the <em>Taaghoot</em>!” </strong></span>[16:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the worship of Allaah will not be correct except through avoiding the <em>Taaghoot</em>. Two opposites cannot come together; <em>eemaan</em> and <em>kufr</em> cannot come together in the heart. <em>Eemaan</em> and major <em>kufr</em> cannot come together in the heart. As for the lesser <em>kufr</em> then it can come together (with <em>eemaan</em>).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> <em>Al-Walaa’ wal-Baraa’ (</em>Alliance and Dissociation)</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> </strong>الثَّالِثَةُ: أَنَّ مَنْ أَطَاعَ الرَّسُوْلَ وَوَحَّدَ اللهَ لاَ يَجُوزُ لَهُ مُوَالاَةُ مَنْ حَادَّ اللهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَلَوْ كَانَ أَقْرَبَ قَرِيبٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The third: that whoever obeys the Messenger and singles out Allaah, then it is not permissible for him to love and ally himself with those who oppose Allaah and His Messenger, even if they be those most closely related to him</strong></span>.<sup>10</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan’s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible for those who do that to have love and alliance to those who oppose Allaah and his Messenger, even if they be those most closely related to him. This is the matter of <strong><em>Al-Walaa’ wal-Baraa’ </em></strong>(Alliance and Dissociation), and it follows on from <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, from the rights of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> is to have love and alliance for the beloved servants of Allaah and to have dissociation from the enemies of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the words, “<strong><em>Al-Muwaalaat</em></strong>”, and, “<strong><em>Al-Walaa’</em></strong>”, have one and the same meaning, and, “<em><strong>Al-Walaa</strong>’</em>”, means having love in the heart, and it means aiding and assisting, and it means, in the matter of inheriting and payment of blood-monies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Muslim he loves and has alliance for the beloved servants of Allaah, meaning that he restricts his love to those who are beloved and obedient servants of Allaah, and he aids them, so the Muslim is with the Muslims, they are allies to each other. Just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَأُولُو الْأَرْحَامِ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلَىٰ بِبَعْضٍ فِي كِتَابِ اللَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And blood-relations are more entitled to inheritance from each other as decreed by Allaah. </strong></span>[8:75]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So payment of blood-monies for accidental killing occurs between the Muslims, and it is what is called mutual responsibility. All of this enters into alliance, so there is no alliance between a Muslim and an unbeliever, and love and aiding and inheriting and payment of blood-money and guardianship in marriage and guardianship in legal matters and so on, this does not occur between a Muslim and a disbeliever, rather this is between the Muslims, because of his saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَن يَجْعَلَ اللَّهُ لِلْكَافِرِينَ عَلَى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ سَبِيلًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And Allaah will never give a way to the unbelievers over the believers. </strong></span>[4:141]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory that the believers are distinguished from the disbelievers, so it is not permissible for one who singles out Allaah and obeys the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> to have love and alliance with those who oppose Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And, <strong>“<em>Al-Mu<u>h</u>aaddah</em>”</strong>(opposing), means that the person is upon one side, and Allaah and His Messenger and the believers are on the other side, and those who oppose are upon the side of the unbelievers in this opposition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>Even if that person is the most closely related to him</strong>”: meaning in lineage. So if your close relative is one who opposes Allaah and His Messenger, then it is obligatory upon you to oppose him and to cut off from him, and whoever is an obedient servant of Allaah and an ally to His Messenger, then it is obligatory upon you that you should love him and have alliance with him, even if he be far removed from you in lineage, even if he be a non-arab, or a black person, or a white person, or a red person, it is obligatory upon you to have love and alliance for him and that you love him, whether he is from your land, or whether he is from the farthest place in the East, or the farthest place in the West. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَالْمُؤْمِنُونَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَاتُ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلِيَاءُ بَعْضٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the believing men and the believing women are friends and allies to each other. </strong></span>[9:71]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: between them there is love and mutual help and mutual aid, and between them there is to be affection, this is between the believers.</p>
<hr />
<p>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَّا تَجِدُ قَوْمًا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ يُوَادُّونَ مَنْ حَادَّ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَلَوْ كَانُوا آبَاءَهُمْ أَوْ أَبْنَاءَهُمْ أَوْ إِخْوَانَهُمْ أَوْ عَشِيرَتَهُمْ ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ كَتَبَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمُ الْإِيمَانَ وَأَيَّدَهُم بِرُوحٍ مِّنْهُ ۖ وَيُدْخِلُهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا ۚ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُوا عَنْهُ ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ حِزْبُ اللَّهِ ۚ أَلَا إِنَّ حِزْبَ اللَّهِ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You will not find a people who truly believe in Allaah and the Last Day loving those who oppose Allaah and His Messenger even if they are their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kinsfolk. Rather Allaah has ordained true faith for their hearts and has strengthened them with strength from Him and He will enter them into gardens which have rivers flowing beneath their trees they shall remain forever therein. Allaah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. They are the party of Allaah. Indeed the party of Allaah are the ones who will be successful. </strong></span>[58:22]<sup>11</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan’s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>لَّا تَجِدُ</strong> </span>“<strong>You will not find</strong>”: this is an address to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>meaning: this will not happen and will never exist, that one who is a true believer in Allaah and His Messenger will love the disbelievers, so if a person does love them, then he is not a true believer, even if he claims to be.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn-ul-Qayyim <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said in <em>Al-Kaafiyat-ush-Shaafiyah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>Do you love the enemies of the beloved One and still claim,</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>That you love Him? That is not possible</em><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>And likewise you strive hard to oppose those He loves,</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>Where is the love O brother of Satan?</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is not possible ever, that he loves the disbelievers, whilst he says, “I love Allaah and His Messenger”, because of His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تَتَّخِذُوا عَدُوِّي وَعَدُوَّكُمْ أَوْلِيَاءَ تُلْقُونَ إِلَيْهِم بِالْمَوَدَّةِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you who believe do not take My enemies and your enemies as friends and allies, for whom you have affection </strong></span>[60:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Up until His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قَدْ كَانَتْ لَكُمْ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ فِي إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَالَّذِينَ مَعَهُ إِذْ قَالُوا لِقَوْمِهِمْ إِنَّا بُرَآءُ مِنكُمْ وَمِمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ كَفَرْنَا بِكُمْ وَبَدَا بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكُمُ الْعَدَاوَةُ وَالْبَغْضَاءُ أَبَدًا حَتَّىٰ تُؤْمِنُوا بِاللَّهِ وَحْدَهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There is for you a fine example in Ibraaheem and those with him, when they said to their people, “We are free of you and whatever you worship besides Allaah, we have rejected you, and there has appeared between us and you enmity and hatred forever until you truly believe in Allaah and single Him out with all worship. </strong></span>[60:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا كَانَ اسْتِغْفَارُ إِبْرَاهِيمَ لِأَبِيهِ إِلَّا عَن مَّوْعِدَةٍ وَعَدَهَا إِيَّاهُ فَلَمَّا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ أَنَّهُ عَدُوٌّ لِّلَّهِ تَبَرَّأَ مِنْهُ ۚ إِنَّ إِبْرَاهِيمَ لَأَوَّاهٌ حَلِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And Ibraaheem’s seeking forgiveness for his father was only because of a promise which he had made to him. So when it became clear to him that he was an enemy to Allaah, then he dissociated himself from him. Indeed Ibraaheem is one who frequently supplicated to His Lord and who was forbearing. </strong></span>[9:114]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the religious way of Ibraaheem. He dissociated himself from his father, the closest of the people to him, when it became clear to him that he was an enemy to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>aayah</em> shows that <span style="color:#ff0000;">having love for an unbeliever negates true faith in Allaah and in the Last Day, either in its very origin, or with regards to its completion</span>. However, if love of them has with it supporting what they are upon and their unbelief, then this is to exit from the fold of Islaam, but if it is just having love without aiding them, then this is counted as something which causes a person’s <em>eemaan</em> (belief) to be deficient and is <em>fisq</em> (open sin) and something which weakens <em>eemaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is said that this aayah came down with regard to Aboo ‘Ubaidah ibn al-Jarraa<u>h</u> <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhu, </em>when he killed his father on the day of Badr, because his father was upon unbelief, and he wanted to kill his son Aboo ‘Ubaidah, but Aboo ‘Ubaidah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhu </em>killed him, because he was an enemy to Allaah and he was not prevented by that fact that it was his father, that did not prevent him from killing him out of anger for the sake of Allaah the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>Those ones</strong>”: meaning those who keep away from loving and having affection for those oppose Allaah and His Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">كَتَبَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمُ الْإِيمَانَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He</strong> (Allaah)<strong> ordained <em>eemaan</em> for their hearts </strong></span>[58:22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning Allaah confirmed and firmly planted <em>eemaan</em> in their hearts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَيَّدَهُم بِرُوحٍ مِّنْهُ ۖ وَيُدْخِلُهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He strengthened them with a <em>Roo<u>h</u></em> from Him, and He willl enter them into gardens beneath which rivers flow.</strong></span>[58:22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>At-Ta’yeed </em></strong>means strengthening, He strengthened them with a <em>Roo<u>h</u></em> from Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the word <em>Ar-Roo<u>h</u></em> has a number of different usages in the Qur’aan, from them is <em>Ar-Roo<u>h</u></em> which is the <strong>spirit</strong> through which there is life, and from them is <strong>revelation</strong> as occurs in His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَكَذَٰلِكَ أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ رُوحًا مِّنْ أَمْرِنَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And likewise We sent down by revelation to you a <em>Roo<u>h</u></em> </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(revelation)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> by Our command.</span> </strong>[42:52]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them is Jibreel <em>‘alaihissalaam</em>, that he is <em>Roo<u>h</u>-ul-Qudus</em> (the Pure Spirit), and <em>Ar-Roo<u>h</u>-ul-’Ameen </em>(the Trustworthy Spirit).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ نَزَّلَهُ رُوحُ الْقُدُسِ مِن رَّبِّكَ بِالْحَقِّ لِيُثَبِّتَ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَهُدًى وَبُشْرَىٰ لِلْمُسْلِمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: the Pure Spirit </strong>(Jibreel <em>‘alaihissalaam</em>)<strong> brought it</strong> (the Qur’aan)<strong> down from your Lord in truth, to make those who believe firm and as guidance and as good news for the Muslims </strong>(those who submit to Allaah’s commands) </span>[16:102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">نَزَلَ بِهِ الرُّوحُ الْأَمِينُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The Trustworthy Spirit</strong> (Jibreel <em>‘alaihissalaam</em>) <strong>descended with it</strong> (the Qur’aan)<strong>. </strong></span>[26:193]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them is what occurs in this <em>aayah </em>and it is <strong>strength</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, “<em>Ayyadahum</em> <em>bi roo<u>h</u>imminh</em>”, meaning with strength from Him, He the Perfect and Most High, strength of true faith in the world, and in the hereafter:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَيُدْخِلُهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He will enter them into gardens</strong></span> [58:22]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The plural of <em>jannaah, </em>and the <em>jannah</em> in the language, it means a garden. It is called a <em>jannaah </em>because it is <em>mujtannun bil-ashjaar</em> (hidden or concealed by trees), meaning hidden and covered by intertwined trees, because paradise contains shade and trees and rivers and palaces, and its highest part and its ceiling is the Throne of the Most Merciful, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">With rivers flowing beneath it they will remain therein forever</span> </strong>[58:22]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, they will remain in it and will not move away from it. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> لَا يَبْغُونَ عَنْهَا حِوَلًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They will not want to move away from it </strong></span>[18:108]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They will not fear death and they will not have to fear anyone forcing them out or evicting them, as occurs in this world. A person in this world may live in palaces, however he is not secure from death so that he has to depart from them, nor is he secure from enemies overcoming him and expelling him. A person in this world is always fearful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُوا عَنْهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him </strong></span>[58:22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since they angered their close relatives who were unbelievers and had enmity towards them, so they will receive in replacement the pleasure of Allaah the Perfect and Most  High, Allaah will be pleased with them and they are pleased with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> أُولَٰئِكَ حِزْبُ اللَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They are the party of Allaah</strong></span> [58:22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: the group of people for Allaah, and as for the disbelievers, then they are the party of Satan, just as Allaah the Most High said about them:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> أُولَٰئِكَ حِزْبُ الشَّيْطَانِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They are the party of Satan</span> </strong>[58:19]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning the group of people for Satan and the helpers of Satan. As for those people (i.e. the believers) then they are the supporters of the Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this matter relates to having enmity towards the disbelievers and not having love and alliance for them. And it does not necessitate that we cut off from the disbelievers in social matters and matters of worldly benefit. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Rather a number of affairs are an exception to that:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The first one is: </strong></span>that along with our hatred of them and our enmity to them, then it is obligatory that we call them to Allaah the Perfect and Most High. It is obligatory that we call them to Allaah and we do not leave them and just say, “They are enemies of Allaah and our enemies.” It is obligatory upon us that we call them to Allaah so perhaps Allaah may guide them. And if they do not respond, then we fight them along with the ability.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> So either then they will enter into Islaam, or they will pay the <em>jizyah</em> (an amount of money that is given over to the Muslims), if they are from the Jews and Christians or the Magians, whilst they are humbled and submitting to the rule of Islaam, and they are then left upon what they are upon. However, with the condition that they <em>jizyah</em> is handed over and that they submit to the rule of Islaam. However, if they are not people of the Two Books and they are not Magians, then there is disagreement between the scholars about taking <em>jizyah</em> from them.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> [Meaning the Muslims united under a Muslim ruler, i.e. the army of Muslims, with the ability to do so.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Secondly</span>: </strong>there is nothing to prevent having a truce with the unbelievers when there is a need, if the Muslims have need of it, because of the fact that the Muslims are not able to fight against them, and there is fear for the Muslims from their evil, then there is no harm in having a truce until the Muslims become strong enough to fight them, or if they request a truce:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِن جَنَحُوا لِلسَّلْمِ فَاجْنَحْ لَهَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if they incline towards peace, then you incline to it </strong></span>[8:61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then a truce is made with them. However it will not be a perpetual truce, rather a temporary peace with a time-limit in accordance with the view of the ruler of the Muslims regarding what is beneficial.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Thirdly</span>: </strong>there is nothing to prevent returning their fine treatment, if they treat the Muslims well, there is nothing to prevent returning their fine treatment. Allaah the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَّا يَنْهَاكُمُ اللَّهُ عَنِ الَّذِينَ لَمْ يُقَاتِلُوكُمْ فِي الدِّينِ وَلَمْ يُخْرِجُوكُم مِّن دِيَارِكُمْ أَن تَبَرُّوهُمْ وَتُقْسِطُوا إِلَيْهِمْ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ الْمُقْسِطِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah does not forbid you from those who do not fight against you with regard to the religion and who do not expel you from your homes from treating them well and treating them with justice. Allaah loves those who treat the people justly. </strong></span>[60:8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Fourthly</span>: </strong>the father who is a disbeliever, it is obligatory upon his son who is Muslim to treat him well. However he should not obey him with regard to unbelief, because of His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَوَصَّيْنَا الْإِنسَانَ بِوَالِدَيْهِ حَمَلَتْهُ أُمُّهُ وَهْنًا عَلَىٰ وَهْنٍ وَفِصَالُهُ فِي عَامَيْنِ أَنِ اشْكُرْ لِي وَلِوَالِدَيْكَ إِلَيَّ الْمَصِيرُ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِن جَاهَدَاكَ عَلَىٰ أَن تُشْرِكَ بِي مَا لَيْسَ لَكَ بِهِ عِلْمٌ فَلَا تُطِعْهُمَا ۖ وَصَاحِبْهُمَا فِي الدُّنْيَا مَعْرُوفًا ۖ وَاتَّبِعْ سَبِيلَ مَنْ أَنَابَ إِلَيَّ ۚ ثُمَّ إِلَيَّ مَرْجِعُكُمْ فَأُنَبِّئُكُم بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We commanded man to treat his parents well, his mother bore him upon a state of weakness and hardship upon weakness and hardship, and his weaning was in two years. We enjoin him to give thanks to Me and to your parents, to Me is your return. And if they strive to make you associate something along with Me, that which you have no knowledge of, then do not obey them, but live along with them in this world in a good manner and follow the path of those who turn to Me</span>. </strong>[31:14-15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The parent has a right, even if he is an unbeliever. However, you should not love him with love of the heart, rather you recompense him for having brought you up and for the fact that he is a father and he has a right,so you recompense him for that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Fifthly</span>: </strong>having mutual business dealings with them, and buying needs from them, and importing goods and weapons from them by paying their price, there is no harm in that. And the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>used to have dealings with the disbelievers. Likewise he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> dealt with the people of Khaibar and they were Jews upon the basis that they would farm the land in exchange for a part of its produce. This is not from alliance and love, rather it is affairs of mutual benefit. It is obligatory that we are aware of these matters, and that they do not enter into love and alliance and are not something prohibited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise taking a loan from them, the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>took some food from a Jew as a debt and he left his coat of armour as a surety with him and he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>died and his coat of armour was left as a surety with the Jew, for some food which he bought for his family. There is nothing to prevent this because these are worldly matters and matters of welfare and it does not indicate love and affection in the hearts. So we must differentiate between this and this, because there are some people, who when he hears the texts of enmity towards the unbelievers and not loving them, then he may understand that he cannot have any dealings with them and cannot have any connection with them whatsoever, and that there is to be a total cut-off from them. No, this is something limited by rulings and limits and conditions which are well known with the people of knowledge, which are taken from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Sixthly</span>: </strong>Allaah has permitted marriage to the women of the people of the Book with the condition that they are chaste with regard to their honour and dignity. And Allaah has made permissible for us to eat the meat slaughtered by them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Seventhly</span>:</strong> that there is no harm in responding to their invitations and eating their food which is permissible, just as the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Eighthly</span>: </strong>is treating neighbours who are disbelievers well, because they have the right of being neighbours.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Ninthly</span>:</strong> it is not permissible to wrong or oppress them. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَا يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شَنَآنُ قَوْمٍ عَلَىٰ أَلَّا تَعْدِلُوا ۚ اعْدِلُوا هُوَ أَقْرَبُ لِلتَّقْوَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And let not hatred of a people prevent you from treating them justly. Do justice, it is closer to <em>taqwaa</em> </strong>(dutifulness to Allaah)<strong>. </strong></span>[5:8]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Giving the Kaffir the glad-tidings of the Hellfire and Passing by the Places where the Mushrikeen Where Destroyed</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>18- &#8216;When ever you pass by the grave of a kaffir then give him the glad tidings of the Hellfire.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Origin Of the hadeeth</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;A Bedouin came to the Prophet and said: ‘My father used to keep good relations with his relatives and he used to do such and such good deeds so where is he?” He -sall&#8217;Allaahu alayhi wa sallam- said &#8216;in the fire&#8217;: It was as if the Bedouin was upset due to this, so he said, “O Messenger of Allaah, then where is your father?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8216;Whenever you pass by the grave of a kaffir then give him the glad tidings of the Hellfire.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Bedouin accepted Islaam and he said; the Messenger of Allaah -sall&#8217;Allaahu alayhi wa sallam- gave me the responsibility of a task; I did not pass by a grave of a kaffir except that I gave him the glad tidings of the Hellfire.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>From the understanding of the hadeeth</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a great benefit in this hadeeth which many of the general books of fiqh have neglected which is none other than the legislation of giving the kaffir the glad tidings of the Hellfire if you pass by his grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is in this legislation is not hidden, since it contains that which awakens the believer and reminds him of the danger of the sin of the kaffir, who has committed a great sin which would make all of the sins of the world facing him seem like nothing if they were all gathered together. The sin is disbelief in Allaah Azza wa Jal and committing shirk with him, which Allaah Ta&#8217;ala explained His severe hatred of such that He excludes shirk from His forgiveness. He says</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong>Verily, Allaah forgives not that partners should be set up with him in worship, but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He pleases</strong> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; said; &#8216;That the biggest of the major sins is that you associate a partner to Allaah while He is the One who created you.&#8217; [Agreed upon.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Without doubt ignorance about this benefit is what leads some Muslims to fall into that which is contrary to what Allaah, the Most Wise, intends by this benefit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>With certainty we know that many of the Muslims come to the lands of the kuffar to take care of some of their general or specific interests. However, they do not suffice themselves with just this, rather they intend to visit some of the graves of those who are called great men from amongst the kuffar. They place flowers and wreaths and they stand in front of those graves with humility and sadness which indicates being pleased with those in the graves and not having a detest for them. </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They do this even though the best example i.e. that of the Prophets &#8211; alayhim assalam &#8211; dictates the opposite of what they do, as is mentioned in this authentic hadeeth. Listen to the statement of Allaah Azza wa Jal:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong>Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibraheem and those with him, when they said to their people: Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allaah, we have rejected you, and there has started between us and you, hostility and hatred for ever &gt;&gt;</strong> the Ayaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is their stance against those who were alive, so what about those are dead!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhaaree (2/120) and Muslim (8/221) narrate on the authority of Ibn Umar that the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam said to them when he passed by Hijr (a place where the people had been destroyed):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8216;Do not enter upon these people who were punished, except that you cry, and if you do not cry then do not enter upon them, so what afflicted them does not afflict you.&#8217; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah 19</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[He veiled his face with is garment while he was on his mount]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad narrated this and the extra wording is from his book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sadeeq Hasan Khan mentioned a heading for this hadeeth in his book &#8216;Nazl alAbraar&#8217; p.293, which is; &#8216;Chapter : crying and fear while passing by the graves of the oppressors and the place where they were destroyed, and showing the need of going back to Allaah Ta&#8217;ala and warning against being neglectful about this.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah Ta&#8217;ala to give us the understanding of our Deen and inspire us to perform actions according to it. Indeed He is the One who hears and answers.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: There are those who say that the Kuffâr (disbelievers) are our brothers in humanity and not in the religion. Is this true?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân</strong>: It is not sufficient with the humanity. One does not speak like that in order to please them or to gain their sympathies. One does not speak like that. One says that they are our enemies and not that they are our brothers in humanity. One says that they are our enemies. What is the benefit of a human fraternity if they are our enemies in the religion? What does it benefit? Pharaoh was also a human. Right? Was he also our brother? We do not say that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> Shar<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>-ul-U<span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>ool-ith-Thalaathah by Shaikh Saalih al-Fawzaan<br />
Translated by Dawud Burbank rahimahullaah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">الثَّالِثَةُ: أَنَّ مَنْ أَطَاعَ الرَّسُوْلَ وَوَحَّدَ اللهَ لاَ يَجُوزُ لَهُ مُوَالاَةُ مَنْ حَادَّ اللهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَلَوْ كَانَ أَقْرَبَ قَرِيبٍ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third:</strong> <span style="color:#008000;">that whoever obeys the Messenger and singles out Allaah, then it is not permissible for him to love and ally himself with those who oppose Allaah and His Messenger, even if they be those most closely related to him</span>.<sup>10</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible for those who do that to have love and alliance to those who oppose Allaah and his Messenger, even if they be those most closely related to him. This is the matter of <em>Al-Walaa’ wal-Baraa’ </em>(Alliance and Dissociation), and it follows on from <em>taw<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>eed</em>, from the rights of <em>taw<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>eed</em> is to have love and alliance for the beloved servants of Allaah and to have dissociation from the enemies of Allaah. And the words, “<em>Al-Muwaalaat</em>”, and, “<em>Al-Walaa’</em>”, have one and the same meaning, and, “<em>Al-Walaa’</em>”, means having love in the heart, and it means aiding and assisting, and it means, in the matter of inheriting and payment of blood-monies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Muslim he loves and has alliance for the beloved servants of Allaah, meaning that he restricts his love to those who are beloved and obedient servants of Allaah, and he aids them, so the Muslim is with the Muslims, they are allies to each other. Just as He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And blood-relations are more entitled to inheritance from each other as decreed by Allaah. [8:75]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So payment of blood-monies for accidental killing occurs between the Muslims, and it is what is called mutual responsibility. All of this enters into alliance, so there is no alliance between a Muslim and an unbeliever, and love and aiding and inheriting and payment of blood-money and guardianship in marriage and guardianship in legal matters and so on, this does not occur between a Muslim and a disbeliver, rather this is between the Muslims, because of his saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And Allaah will never give a way to the unbelievers over the believers. [4:141]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory that the believers are distinguished from the disbelievers, so it is not permissible for one who singles out Allaah and obeys the Messenger <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span></em><em>allallaahu‘alaihiwasallam</em> to have love and alliance with those who oppose Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And, “<em>Al-Mu<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>aaddah</em>”, (opposing), means that the person is upon one side, and Allaah and His Messenger and the believers are on the other side, and those who oppose are upon the side of the unbelievers in this opposition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “Even if that person is the most closely related to him”: meaning in lineage. So if your close relative is one who opposes Allaah and His Messenger, then it is obligatory upon you to oppose him and to cut off from him, and whoever is an obedient servant of Allaah and an ally to His Messenger, then it is obligatory upon you that you should love him and have alliance with him, even if he be far removed from you in lineage, even if he be a non-arab, or a black person, or a white person, or a red person, it is obligatory upon you to have love and alliance for him and that you love him, whether he is from your land, or whether he is from the farthest place in the East, or the farthest place in the West. He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And the believing men and the believing women are friends and allies to each other. [9:71]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: between them there is love and mutual help and mutual aid, and between them there is to be affection, this is between the believers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You will not find a people who truly believe in Allaah and the Last Day loving those who oppose Allaah and His Messenger even if they are their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kinsfolk. Rather Allaah has ordained true faith for their hearts and has strengthened them with strength from Him and He will enter them into gardens which have rivers flowing beneath their trees they shall remain forever therein. Allaah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. They are the party of Allaah. Indeed the party of Allaah are the ones who will be successful. [58:22]</strong></span><sup>11</sup></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High, “You will not find”: this is an address to the Prophet <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu‘alaihiwasallam </em>meaning: this will not happen and will never exist, that one who is a true believer in Allaah and His Messenger will love the disbelievers, so if a person does love them, then he is not a true believer, even if he claims to be.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn-ul-Qayyim <em>ra<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>imahullaah</em> said in <em>Al-Kaafiyat-ush-Shaafiyah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Do you love the enemies of the beloved One and still claim,<br />
</em><em> That you love Him? That is not possible</em><em><br />
</em><em>And likewise you strive hard to oppose those He loves,<br />
</em><em>Where is the love O brother of Satan?</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is not possible ever, that he loves the disbelievers, whilst he says, “I love Allaah and His Messenger”, because of His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>O you who believe do not take My enemies and your enemies as friends and allies, for whom you have affection [60:1]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Up until His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>There is for you a fine example in Ibraaheem and those with him, when they said to their people, “We are free of you and whatever you worship besides Allaah, we have rejected you, and there has appeared between us and you enmity and hatred forever until you truly believe in Allaah and single Him out with all worship. [60:4]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And Ibraaheem’s seeking forgiveness for his father was only because of a promise which he had made to him. So when it became clear to him that he was an enemy to Allaah, then he dissociated himself from him. Indeed Ibraaheem is one who frequently supplicated to His Lord and who was forbearing. [9:114]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the religious way of Ibraaheem. He dissociated himself from his father, the closest of the people to him, when it became clear to him that he was an enemy to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>aayah</em> shows that having love for an unbeliever negates true faith in Allaah and in the Last Day, either in its very origin, or with regards to its completion. However, if love of them has with it supporting what they are upon and their unbelief, then this is to exit from the fold of Islaam, but if it is just having love without aiding them, then this is counted as something which casues a person’s <em>eemaan</em> (belief) to be deficient and is <em>fisq</em> (open sin) and something which weakens <em>eemaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is said that this aayah came down with regard to Aboo ‘Ubaidah ibn al-Jarraa<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span> <em>ra<span style="text-decoration:underline;">d</span>iyallaahu‘anhu, </em>when he killed his father on the day of Badr, because his father was upon unbelief, and he wanted to kill his son Aboo ‘Ubaidah, but Aboo ‘Ubaidah <em>ra<span style="text-decoration:underline;">d</span>iyallaahu‘anhu </em>killed him, because he was an enemy to Allaah and he was not prevented by that fact that it was his father, that did not prevent him from killing him out of anger for the sake of Allaah the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “Those ones”: meaning those who keep away from loving and having affection for those oppose Allaah and His Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>He (Allaah) ordained <em>eemaan</em> for their hearts [58:22]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning Allaah confirmed and firmly planted <em>eemaan</em> in their hearts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And He strengthened them with a <em>Roo<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span></em> from Him, and He willl enter them into gardens beneath which rivers flow.[58:22]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>At-Ta’yeed </em>means strengthening, He strengthened them with a <em>Roo<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span></em> from Him. And the word <em>Ar-Roo<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span></em> has a number of different usages in the Qur’aan, from them is <em>Ar-Roo<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span></em> which is the spirit through which there is life, and from them is revelation as occurs in His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And likewise We sent down by revelation to you a <em>Roo<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span></em> (revelation) by Our command. [42:52]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them is Jibreel <em>‘alaihissalaam</em>, that he is <em>Roo<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>-ul-Qudus</em> (the Pure Spirit), and <em>Ar-Roo<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>-ul-’Ameen </em>(the Trustworthy Spirit).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Say: the Pure Spirit (Jibreel <em>‘alaihissalaam</em>) brought it (the Qur’aan) down from your Lord in truth, to make those who believe firm and as guidance and as good news for the Muslims (those who submit to Allaah’s commands) [16:102]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Trustworthy Spirit (Jibreel <em>‘alaihissalaam</em>) descended with it (the Qur’aan). [26:193]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them is what occurs in this <em>aayah </em>and it is strength.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, “<em>Ayyadahum</em> <em>bi roo<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>imminh</em>”, meaning with strength from Him, He the Perfect and Most High, strength of true faith in the world, and in the hereafter:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And He will enter them into gardens [58:22]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The plural of <em>jannaah, </em>and the <em>jannah</em> in the language, it means a garden. It is called a <em>jannaah </em>because it is <em>mujtannun bil-ashjaar</em> (hidden or concealed by trees), meaning hidden and covered by intertwined trees, because paradise contains shade and trees and rivers and palaces, and its highest part and its ceiling is the Throne of the Most Merciful, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>With rivers flowing beneath it they will remain therein forever [58:22]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, they will remain in it and will not move away from it. He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>They will not want to move away from it [18:108]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They will not fear death and they will not have to fear anyone forcing them out or evicting them, as occurs in this world. A person in this world may live in palaces, however he is not secure from death so that he has to depart from them, nor is he secure from enemies overcoming him and expelling him. A person in this world is always fearful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allaah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him [58:22]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since they angered their close relatives who were unbelievers and had enmity towards them, so they will receive in replacement the pleasure of Allaah the Perfect and Most  High, Allaah will be pleased with them and they are pleased with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>They are the party of Allaah [58:22]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: the group of people for Allaah, and as for the disbelievers, then they are the party of Satan, just as Allaah the Most High said about them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>They are the party of Satan [58:19]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning the group of people for Satan and the helpers of Satan. As for those people (i.e. the believers) then they are the supporters of the Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this matter relates to having enmity towards the disbelievers and not having love and alliance for them. And it does not necessitate that we cut off from the disbelievers in social matters and matters of wordly benefit. Rather a number of affairs are an exception to that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The first one is:</span> </strong>that along with our hatred of them and our enmity to them, then it is obligatory that we call them to Allaah the Perfect and Most High. It is obligatory that we call them to Allaah and we do not leave them and just say, “They are enemies of Allaah and our enemies.” It is obligatory upon us that we call them to Allaah so perhaps Allaah may guide them. And if they do not respond, then we fight them along with the ability.[1] So either then they will enter into Islaam, or they will pay the <em>jizyah</em> (an amount of money that is given over to the Muslims), if they are from the Jews and Christians or the Magians, whilst they are humbled and submitting to the rule of Islaam, and they are then left upon what they are upon. However, with the condition that they <em>jizyah</em> is handed over and that they submit to the rule of Islaam. However, if they are not people of the Two Books and they are not Magians, then there is disagreement between the scholars about taking <em>jizyah</em> from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Secondly</span>: </strong>there is nothing to prevent having a truce with the unbelievers when there is a need, if the Muslims have need of it, because of the fact that the Muslims are not able to fight against them, and there is fear for the Muslims from their evil, then there is no harm in having a truce until the Muslms become strong enough to fight them, or if they request a truce:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And if they incline towards peace, then you incline to it [8:61]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then a truce is made with them. However it will not be a perpetual truce, rather a temporary peace with a time-limit in accordance with the view of the ruler of the Muslims regarding what is beneficial.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Thirdly</span>: </strong>there is nothing to prevent returning their fine treatment, if they treat the Muslims well, there is nothing to prevent returning their fine treatment. Allaah the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allaah does not forbid you from those who do not fight against you with regard to the religion and who do not expel you from your homes from treating them well and treating them with justice. Allaah loves those who treat the people justly. [60:8]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Fourthly</span>: </strong>the father who is a disbeliever, it is obligatory upon his son who is Muslim to treat him well. However he should not obey him with regard to unbelief, because of His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And We commanded man to treat his parents well, his mother bore him upon a state of weakness and hardship upon weakness and hardship, and his weaning was in two years. We enjoin him to give thanks to Me and to your parents, to Me is your return. And if they strive to make you associate something along with Me, that which you have no knowledge of, then do not obey them, but live along with them in this world in a good manner and follow the path of those who turn to Me. [31:14-15]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The parent has a right, even if he is an unbeliever. However, you should not love him with love of the heart, rather you recompense him for having brought you up and for the fact that he is a father and he has a right,so you recompense him for that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Fifthly</span>: </strong>having mutual business dealings with them, and buying needs from them, and importing goods and weapons from them by paying their price, there is no harm in that. And the Prophet <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu‘alaihiwasallam </em>used to have dealings with the disbelievers. Likewise he <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu‘alaihiwasallam</em> dealt with the people of Khaibar and they were Jews upon the basis that they would farm the land in exchange for a part of its produce. This is not from alliance and love, rather it is affairs of mutual benefit. It is obligatory that we are aware of these matters, and that they do not enter into love and alliance and are not something prohibited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise taking a loan from them, the Prophet <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu‘alaihiwasallam </em>took some food from a Jew as a debt and he left his coat of armour as a surety with him and he <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu‘alaihiwasallam </em>died and his coat of armour was left as a surety with the Jew, for some food which he bought for his family. There is nothing to prevent this because these are wordly matters and matters of welfare and it does not indicate love and affection in the hearts. So we must differentiate between this and this, because there are some people, who when he hears the texts of enmity towards the unbelievers and not loving them, then he may understand that he cannot have any dealings with them and cannot have any connection with them whatsoever, and that there is to be a total cut-off from them. No, this is something limited by rulings and limits and conditions which are well known with the people of knowledge, which are taken from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu‘alaihiwasallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Sixthly</span>: </strong>Allaah has permitted marriage to the women of the people of the Book with the condition that they are chaste with regard to their honour and dignity. And Allaah has made permissible for us to eat the meat slaughtered by them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Seventhly</span>:</strong> that there is no harm in responding to their invitations and eating their food which is permissible, just as the Prophet <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu‘alaihiwasallam </em>did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Eighthly</span>: </strong>is treating neighbours who are disbelievers well, because they have the right of being neighbours.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Ninthly</span>:</strong> it is not permissible to wrong or oppress them. He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And let not hatred of a people prevent you from treating them justly. Do justice, it is closer to <em>taqwaa</em> (dutifulness to Allaah). [5:8]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] [Meaning the Muslims united under a Muslim ruler, i.e. the army of Muslims, with the ability to do so.]</p>

Translator : Abu az-Zubayr Harrison – <a href="http://www.authentic-translations.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">authentic-translations.com</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Some young people today think that showing enmity towards disbelievers, those who reside in Islamic lands or those visiting here, is sanctioned by the Islamic legislation. For this reason, some of them even think it is permissible to kill them or kidnap them if they see from them something they detest.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It’s <strong>forbidden</strong> to kill a non-Muslim resident or anyone who legitimately and legally entered the country with the permission of the government under a contract of safety (indicated by the issuance of a visa). Showing any type of aggression towards them is also <strong>impermissible</strong>. Any criminal actions that occur from them must be reported to the legitimate Islamic authorities.[1]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b></b><b></b><b>Q 6: I have some non-Muslim and Muslim neighbors about whom I have some reservations. What is the ruling on exchanging visits with them?</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody"><b>A: </b>Visits exchanged in such circumstance are a good thing enjoined by Islam when they are <strong>for the purpose of guidance, advice, and cooperation in righteousness and piety</strong>. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;<a style="color:#008000;" name="Allah(GlorifiedandExaltedbe"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="11401" class="tip"></span>“Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says, ‘My Love is due to those who love one another for My Sake, who sit with one another for My Sake, who visit one another for My Sake, and who are generous to one another for My Sake.’”</span>&#8220;</span> (Related by Imam<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Malik </span>[may Allah be merciful to him] with a Sahih (authentic) Sanad (chain of narrators)][1]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Also, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;<a name="TherearesevenwhomAllahwill"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="11402" class="tip"></span>“<span style="color:#008000;">There are seven whom Allah will shade with His Shade on the Day when there will be no shade but His Shade&#8230;”</span></span><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;</span> among them he (peace be upon him) mentioned: &#8220;<a name="Twomenwholoveeachotherfor"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="11402" class="tip"></span>“<span style="color:#008000;">Two men who love each other for the sake of Allah, meeting for that and parting upon that.</span>”</span>&#8221; [2]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">The example given is that of two men, but the ruling is general and applies to two men or two women. Thus, if a Muslim visits another Muslim or non-Muslim for the purpose of calling them to Allah, teaching them and guiding them to goodness without seeking worldly gain or taking the Commands of Allah lightly, this is a good act.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">It is good for a Muslim woman to visit her sister in Islam and advise her to avoid Tabarruj (woman’s public display of her adornment or charms), unveiling the face or taking lightly what Allah prohibits. Similarly, it is good to visit her Christian or non-Christian female neighbor, such as a Buddhist woman or the like, to advise, teach, or instruct her. Actually, this comes under the heading of the Prophet’s words: &#8220;<a name="Religionissincerity(well-wishing)."></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="23000688" class="tip"></span>“<span style="color:#008000;">Religion is sincerity (well-wishing). Religion is sincerity. Religion is sincerity.</span>”</span>&#8220;[3]  <strong>If she responds positively, all praise is to Allah; if she does not then you should give up the visits which do not serve any useful purpose.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Visiting for the purpose of gaining worldly benefits, playing, exchanging idle talks, eating or the like is not permissible to be made to non-Muslims, whether they are<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> the Christians </span>or others. Such visits may corrupt one’s religious commitment or morals, because the Kafirs (disbelievers) are enemies to us and we do not feel love towards them [as a reaction for their Shirk, disbelief, rejection of truth, enmity, sinning, transgression against Allah, etc. Ed]. Thus, we should not take them as protectors or confidants. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">However, visits are required when they are made for the purpose of calling to Allah, urging to do goodness, and warning against evil. In Surah (Qur’anic chapter) Al-Mumtahinah, Allah (Glorified be He) says: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibrâhîm (Abraham) and those with him, when they said to their people: &#8220;Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allâh: we have rejected you, and there has started between us and you hostility and hatred for ever until you believe in Allâh Alone&#8221;&#8221; </span></span><span id="ContentParagraph">[</span><span id="ContentParagraph">Surah Al-Mumtahanah, 60: 4]</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: Some people these days call others to boycott American products and companies like Pizza Hut, McDonald’s, etc. So, should we comply with such requests? Are transactions like buying and selling with non-Muslims in countries at war against us permissible, or are they only allowed with those with whom we have peace?</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: These days, we find written in some newspapers people calling others to boycott American products, not to buy or sell them. It was even written today in a newspaper that Muslim scholars themselves call for such boycotts and that doing this is an obligation upon every single Muslim. It is said that to purchase even one item from these products is forbidden and that anyone who does so commits a major sin and is assisting them and the Jews in killing Muslims. We hope you will clarify this matter since there’s a dire need for such clarification. Also, would a person ever be rewarded for doing this (boycotting)?</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Purchasing products from non-Muslims is of course permissible. The prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) used to buy things from Jews. Even when he (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) died, his shield was in the possession of a Jewish man, pawned for food to feed his (the prophet’s) family. He used to clarify to people their (the non-Muslims) beliefs so that people would not take  them as their closest and most intimate friends. But as for buying things from them for  which there is a need, then this is a simple matter. [1]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center">By Shaykh, Allaama, al-Faqeeh Muhammed bin Salih al-Uthaymeen<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh mentions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If a questioner asks: is the wealth of the non-Muslim who lives in the land of the Muslims permissible for us to take?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer is: that the wealth and blood of the non-Muslim who lives in the Muslim lands under contract, are not permissible for us to take, so much so that the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> – said: ‘Whoever kills a non-Muslim who lives in the Muslim lands under contract will not smell the fragrance of Paradise.’ [Collected by Bukhari in Kitab al-Jizeeyah]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah for goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By this we come to know the enmity, oppression and misguidance of those deceived ones, who transgress upon the wealth of the non-Muslims who have a contract with the Muslims. This is whether that non-Muslim is in your (Muslim country) or he has a contract with the Muslims, or that you are in his country.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed we hear from some of those who live in the non-Muslims lands, who say: there is no problem with spoiling the wealth of these non-Muslims, so you find them destroying street lights, shops and cars, and this is impermissible for them – SubhanAllaah – these people have embraced you, you have a contract with them, they have not agreed to a contract with your laws, and with that you deceive them.  This is the worst type of defamation of Islaam and criticism of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In reality the criticism here and defamation is not for Islaam rather it is these people who attribute themselves to Islaam. This is why it is obligatory for us to know that the wealth of those who have contracts with the Muslims is forbidden. Whether they are those who have a contract with you or you have a contract with them, it is not permissible to transgress upon them because that is oppression.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Sharh al-Arbaeen an-Nawawi’ – Shaykh Muhammad bin Salih al-Uthaymeen p.269-270 Hadeeth No.24]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 1: Some people understood from your answer to the first question in the interview about concluding treaties with the Jews that signing a peace treaty or truce with the Jews who captured the lands and committed transgressions is unconditionally permissible. They also understood that they have to support and befriend the Jews. Making peace with them requires the Muslims not to stir hatred and disavowal of the Jews in the educational curriculum or mass media in the Muslim countries. The world is now witnessing a phase of international reconciliation and peaceful coexistence. It is not allowed to arouse feelings of religious hatred among people. Would you please explain this issue.</span></p>
<p>A 1: <strong>Making peace with the Jews or other disbelievers does not necessitate support and friendship</strong>. It ensures that both sides enjoy safety and peace and may engage in other dealings such as sale, purchase, and exchange of ambassadors. These actions do not require the Muslims to support or befriend the disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) concluded <strong>peace treaties with the people of Makkah</strong>. This act did not force the Muslims to befriend or support the pagans, but the feelings of hatred remain until the Opening of Makkah and people entered into the religion of Allah (Exalted be He) in multitudes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, he (peace be upon him) <strong>made peace with the Jews of Al-Madinah</strong> for an unlimited period when he emigrated to Al-Madinah. He (peace be upon him) used to buy things from them, talk to them and call them to Islam but it was not necessary to befriend or support them. Furthermore, the Prophet (peace be upon him) died while his armor was in pawn with a Jew in return for food.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Banu Al-Nadir, a Jewish tribe, committed high treason, they were expelled from Al-Madinah. When Qurayzhah breached the covenant and joined a besieging army of the enemy that came from Makkah to fight the Prophet (peace be upon him) on the Day of Ahzab, the Prophet (peace be upon him) fought them killing their leaders and taking their women and offspring captives. When Sa`d Ibn Mu`adh (may Allah be pleased with him) judged them, he judged that the men must be killed and the women and children taken captives. So, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said that he judged according to the judgment of Allah (Exalted be He) from above the seven heavens.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslims among the Sahabh and their followers often declared a <strong>truce with the Christians and other non-Muslims</strong> without having to support or befriend them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) says, <span style="color:#008000;">Verily, you will find the strongest among men in enmity to the believers (Muslims) the Jews and those who are Al-Mushrikûn</span>. <span style="color:#525253;"> [Sooratul-Maa‘idah 5:82]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) also says: <span style="color:#008000;">Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibrâhîm (Abraham) and those with him, when they said to their people: &#8220;Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allâh: we have rejected you, and there has started between us and you hostility and hatred for ever until you believe in Allâh Alone&#8221; <span style="color:#525253;">[Sooratul-Mumtahinah 60:4]</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) also says, <span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Auliyâ’ (friends, protectors, helpers), they are but Auliyâ’ of each other. And if any amongst you takes them (as Auliyâ’), then surely he is one of them. Verily, Allâh guides not those people who are the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers and unjust)</span>.<span style="color:#525253;">[Sooratul-Maa‘idah 5:51]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) also says: <span style="color:#008000;">You (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will not find any people who believe in Allâh and the Last Day, making friendship with those who oppose Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), even though they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred (people)</span>.<span style="color:#525253;">[Sooratul-Mujaadilah 58:22]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Ayahs that convey the same meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here is another situation showing that making peace with the Jews or other disbelievers, when necessary, does not necessitate supporting and befriending them. When the Prophet (peace be upon him) conquered <strong>Khaybar</strong>, <strong>he made peace with the Jews</strong> and agreed that they take care of the palms and fields and the harvest was to be halved between them and the Muslims. This agreement was unlimited and they stayed in Khaybar under this agreement as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, We will let you stay on this (condition), as long as we will.<strong>[1]</strong> According to another narration, “We will let you stay, as long as Allah will let you stay.” <strong>[2]</strong> They stayed there until `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) evacuated them. It is narrated that when `Abdullah ibn Rawahah (may Allah be pleased with him) estimated the value due on the fruits of the palm trees one year, they alleged that the value was unjust. He (may Allah be pleased with them) told them, &#8220;By Allah! My hatred for you and my love for the Muslims will never make me treat you unjustly. If you will, accept my bulk assessment of the outcome that I made for you; otherwise we accept it all.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, these situations indicate that making peace treaties and truce with the enemies of Allah does not require us to support or befriend them, as some of those who are not aware of the rulings of the purified Shari`ah believe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>It should be clear that making peace treaties with the Jews or other disbelievers does not require us to change the educational curriculum or other dealings based on support and befriending</strong>. May Allah grant us success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: Is it permissible to perform ruqyah on a disbeliever?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer by Shaykh Rabee (hafidhahullaah):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible. Abu Sa&#8217;eed (radhi Allaahu anhu), performed ruqyah on a disbeliever when he went out with a military detachment and passed by a group of people by a well whom they asked permission to be hosted but this group refused to do so. Then when their leader was stung by a scorpion, they came and said: &#8220;Our leader has been stung. Do you have anyone that can treat him with ruqyah?&#8221;  The Companions replied: &#8220;By Allaah, we will not treat him with ruqyah until you give us compensation. We sought your permission but you refused to host us!&#8221; The group gave them a flock of sheep and the leader was treated with Surah Al-Faatihah and cured as if he was freed from shackles!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This shows you that the person who performed ruqyah was sincere. The Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) concurred with him and with his using Surah Al-Faatihah as a ruqyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Today, those who perform ruqyah take gifts and money from people even if they do not heal the people they treat!! A condition for the permissibility of taking compensation for ruqyah is that the sick person must be healed, as was the case in the afore-mentioned hadeeth where, upon receiving the ruqyah, the man was cured as if he had just been released from shackles. And as a result of this, the Companions took the flock of sheep as payment. But had the man not been cured, they would not have taken the flock.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, today, the one who performs ruqyah is eager to take money. The sick and unfortunate go to him with their illnesses and misfortunes and they do not receive any help from him yet their money is seized. This money that they take is unlawful, may Allaah bless you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Posted from <span style="color:#666699;">the excellent book (published by al-ibaanah) </span><strong style="color:#666699;"><em>The Rules and Etiquettes of Ruqya</em></strong><span style="color:#666699;">, by Shaikh Saalih Aalush-Shaikh , Q&amp;A Session on Ruqya with Shaykh Rabee</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">161- The Messenger of Allaah said to Ali bin Abu Ta lib: &#8216;Go and bury your father.&#8217; He said; &#8216;No, I won&#8217;t bury him, because he died as a Mushrik.&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Messenger said to him: &#8216;Go and bury him, and do n&#8217;t speak to anyone until you come to me. &#8216;I came to him and I had signs of dirt and dust upon me. He ordered me to wash, so I washed and he supplicated for me with supplications which would not please me to exchange anything for them on the face of this earth.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>From the benefits of the hadeeth</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <span style="color:#0000ff;">That it is permissible for a Muslim to take the responsibilities of burying his close Mushrik relative</span>. This does not negate his hate for his relative&#8217;s shirk. Do you not see that &#8216;Alee refused to bury his father for the first time. Whereby, he said: &#8216;he died as a mushrik &#8216; thinking that if he buried him then this would enter into being in alliance with his father which is pro hibited. Like the saying of Allaah Ta’ala: &lt;&lt;<em>Take not as friends the people who incurred the Wrath of Allaah</em> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Messenger ordered him again to bury his father he hastened to fulfill the Messenger&#8217;s order. And he left that which seemed to be correct to him the first time. It is also from obedience, that a person leaves his own opinion for the command of his Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It appears to me that the son burying his mushrik father or his mother is the last of what the son possesses of good companionship wit h his mushrik father in this world. As for after the burial then it is not allowed for him to pray for him, nor seek forgiveness for him, this is due to the clear statement of Allaah Ta&#8217;ala: &lt;&lt; <em>It is not proper for the Prophet and those who believe to ask Allaah&#8217;s Forgiveness for the Mushrikeen even though they be of kin</em> &gt;&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">So, if this is the case, what is the situation of t he one who supplicates for mercy and forgiveness on the pages of newspapers and magazines for some of the kuffar , announcing their deaths, for a small amount of dirhams !</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who is concerned for his hereafter should fear Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- <span style="color:#0000ff;">It is not legislated for him to wash the unbeliever, nor should he shroud him. And nor should he pray upon him</span> even if he is a close relative, since, the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam did not order Alee to do so. If this had been permissible, the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam would have mentioned it, since delaying the explanation of an order when there is a need for it, is not permissible. This is the Madhab of the Hambalees and other than them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- <span style="color:#0000ff;">It is not legislated for the relatives of that Mushrik to follow the funeral procession</span>. Because the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam did not do this for his uncle. His uncle was the kindest and the most compassionate of the people to him. Even to the extent that the Prophet supplicated to Allaah for him, whereby his uncle&#8217;s punishment will be the least in the Hellfire, as has been previously explained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in all of this there is a lesson for those peop le who have been deceived by their ancestry, but they do not do any thing for their hereafter with their Lord, and Allaah the Great spoke the truth when He said: &lt;&lt; <em>There will be no kinship among them that Day, nor will they ask of one another.</em> &gt;&gt;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">161- The Messenger of Allaah said to ‘Alee bin Abu Talib: ‘Go and bury your father.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">Q 10: What is the ruling on shaking hands with non-Muslim women? In the country where I live, it is the custom to treat men and women equally in everything.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is not permissible for a man to shake hands with a woman, unless he is her Mahram (spouse or unmarriageable relative). The basis of this ruling is the fact that The hand of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) never touched the hand of a (non-Mahram) woman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was authentically narrated in &#8220;Sahih Al-Bukhari&#8221;, &#8220;Musnad Ahmad&#8221;, and the &#8220;Sunan&#8221; of Al-Tirmidhy and Al-Nisa’y, that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “<strong><span style="color:#666699;">I do not shake hands with women</span></strong>.” This is the guidance of the Prophet (peace be upon him) who sets the best example for his Ummah (nation based on one creed). Allah (Exalted be He) says: <span style="color:#666699;">Indeed in the Messenger of Allâh (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allâh and the Last Day</span> (Surah Al-‘Ahzab, 33:21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslims should act upon the teachings that the Prophet (peace be upon him) brought and Allah has enjoined following, saying: <span style="color:#666699;">And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) gives you, take it; and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it)</span>. One of the things that the Prophet (peace be upon him) taught was not to shake hands with women, and the basic principle regarding his sayings, deeds, and approvals is that they constitute the code of laws for the Muslim Ummah (nation based on one creed) unless there is an evidence for ruling out of this principle. We know of no such evidence in this case. May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings of Allah be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 3: a person embraced Islam and the members of his family are still non-Muslims. Then his parents died leaving behind a legacy for him and his brothers. It is well-known that this Muslim person does not deserve inheritance from his father&#8217;s legacy. If his brothers offered him what they think is his share of inheritance, should he accept it? It is said that it is permissible for him to take it as a gift. If this is true, must he tell them that he will accept it as a gift or is his intention enough?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ans:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible for this Muslim person to take the money offered for him by his father or brothers whether they are dead or alive as long as it does not draw him back to their religion and as long as they are rational people and know that he does not deserve inheritance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: A family is composed of a father, a mother, four sons, and four daughters. They were all Christians. Three sons and one daughter converted to Islam. Their father died and left them a huge fortune which is around 18,000,000 Saudi Riyals. do the children who embraced Islam have the right to inherit from their non-Muslim father?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: If the matter is as mentioned, the Muslim children whose father died as non-Muslim will not inherit. The origin of this ruling is what is related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim on the authority of Usamah ibn Zayd (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: Neither a Muslim inherits from a disbeliever, nor does a disbeliever inherit from a Muslim.</p>
<p>May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">~~~~~~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 1: This letter is sent by some Dutch women who have embraced Islam, praise be to Allah, and who have many inquiries concerning the issue of inheritance, as our parents are non-Muslims, and a Muslim must not inherit a Kafir (disbeliever). Our parents asked us to tell them how to share their property after their death, which falls into many categories: First, a house, as the money will only be available when the house is sold after their parents&#8217; death;we cannot take part of this money during their lifetime. Is it permissible for the parents to make a grant contract with their children during their lifetime, by paying an annual sum of money that can only be reclaimed after they die and the children sell the house? Is it permissible for the parents to make a grant contract with their children, so that the latter are the real owners of the house during the lifetime of the parents, and after their death each one takes their right? If a Kafir mother has two daughters, one of whom is a Muslim and the other is a Kafir, is it permissible for the mother to make a will for her Kafir daughter to grant half of her inheritance to her Muslim sister? It is said that no bequest must be made to an heir. If we are not entitled to inherit, is it permissible to make a will for us with one third of the money? Second, jewels and valuable objects. Is it permissible for the Kafir parents to distribute such items among their children during their lifetime as a grant, provided that the children use them during their fathers&#8217; lifetime, and after their death these things are returned to the children as agreed upon in the grant? Third, trivial objects and things of low value, such as clothes, mugs and furniture. Is it permissible for us to take them and use them after their death? Is it permissible for us to give them to some Muslims or Kafirs, or simply get rid of them? If the mother dies, and the father is still alive, is it permissible for their daughter to accept her father&#8217;s offer and take her mother&#8217;s things such as clothes?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: A Muslim does not inherit a Kafir, neither does a Kafir inherit a Muslim, according to the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him), Neither a Muslim inherits a Kafir, nor does a Kafir inherit a Muslim. Agreed upon by Al-Bukhari and Muslim in the Hadith reported from Usamah (may Allah be pleased with him). <strong>However, it is permissible for the Muslim children to accept the grants, gifts and wills from their Kafir parents. They can also make contracts with them according to the Shar`y (Islamically lawful) regulations.</strong> However, it is impermissible for them to inherit their parents. If the Kafir parents deprive their Muslim children from their inheritance and dedicate all of it to their Kafir children, the Muslim children have no right to claim any of their parents&#8217; property, as this claim only takes the form of inheritance, which is a compulsory right. It is known that a Muslim does not inherit a Kafir. May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Question</strong>: An Indonesian Christian woman who had come to Berlin, in West Germany, for a special task she is entrusted with by the government of Indonesia, converted to Islam. The woman belongs to an influential family which has good connections with President Suharto. Moreover, her husband is an official in the Indonesian Ministry of Defense and Security. In Sha&#8217;a Allah (If Allah wills), through her conversion to Islam, being an intellectual and influential woman, she will prove to be useful to Islam and Muslims. However, the dilemma is that her husband is a Christian bigot and thus she cannot declare her conversion to Islam. Until now, no one knows about her conversion except us (7 people only). Nevertheless, she intends to tell her husband and children about her conversion to Islam in her own way so that she can call them to Islam. Your Eminence Shaykh, I do not know what to do in this regard knowing that Allah prohibited that a Muslim woman be married to a non-Muslim man and that such a woman has to leave her husband immediately after her conversion to Islam. On account of her being a new convert to Islam, I do not think she can enforce such an Islamic ruling and I fear that she may go back to disbelief. Furthermore, she does not belong to an ordinary family. Had she belonged to an ordinary family, leaving the husband would have been easy. Therefore, I ask you about the issue and want, if possible, a fatwa from Shaykh Ibn Baz. May I postpone ordering her to leave her non-Muslim husband until her belief gets stronger? Or, what should I tell her?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">She has to tell her husband about her conversion to Islam and that she is now prohibited to be his wife until he embraces Islam</span>.</p>
<p>If he embraces Islam while she is in her `Iddah (waiting period), she will remain his wife without the need to contract marriage anew.</p>
<p>However, if he converts to Islam after the `Iddah is over, he may marry her anew through a new marriage contract provided that she shows her consent and all Shar`y (Islamic legal) conditions are met.</p>
<p>May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">Q: One of my Non-Muslim workers has converted to Islam. A few hours later, he asked for a Mus-haf and a translation to read. After a few days, he asked to go and perform `Umrah (lesser pilgrimage). My question is: Should I let him touch the Mus-haf and travel to Allah&#8217;s Sacred Land, or wait a year or more until he becomes a true Muslim, and I am sure that has sincerely embraced Islam?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: If you are sure concerning his Islam, it is permissible for you to give him a Mus-haf to read and accompany him to perform Hajj or `Umrah. You will be rewarded for this Insha&#8217;a Allah, for the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated: &#8220;Whoever calls others to follow guidance, their reward will be equivalent to those who shall follow them (in righteousness)&#8221; And Allah helps His servant as long as the servant helps their fellow brothers .</p>

<p><strong>Shaykh Al-Albânî</strong> grades its chain of narration hasan in <strong><em>Sahîh Al-Adab Al-Mufrad</em></strong> p444, and notes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“In this narration this illustrious Companion indicates that it is permissible to supplicate for someone to have a long life, even if he is an unbeliever, and so [this can be done for] a Muslim <em>a fortiori</em>…However, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">the supplicant should make sure that the unbeliever is not an enemy of the Muslims</span>. It is also taken from this [narration] that such an unbeliever can be commiserated with what has been mentioned therein [i.e. the believers are the ones who will receive the mercy of Allâh and His blessings].”</p>
