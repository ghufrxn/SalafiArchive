<p><strong>Imam Al-Nawawi’s Riyad-us-Saliheen<br />Chapter 191 &#8211; The Excellence of Performing Salat (Prayers) in Congregation</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">1066. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A blind man came to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and said: “O Messenger of Allah! I have no one to guide me to the mosque.” He, therefore, sought his permission to perform Salat (prayer) in his house. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) granted him permission. When the man turned away, he called him back, and said, “<strong>Do you hear the Adhan (call to prayer)?</strong>” He replied in the affirmative. The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) then directed him to respond to it. [Muslim].</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">1067. Abdullah bin Umm Maktum, the Mu’adhdhin (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I said to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam): “<strong>There are many poisonous insects and wild beasts in Al-Madinah, and I am blind. Please grant me permission to perform Salat at home</strong>.” He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) enquired whether he could hear the call: Hayyaalas-Salah; Hayya `alal-Falah (Come to the prayer, come to the salvation). When he replied in affirmative, the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) directed him to come (to mosque) for prayer.” [Abu Dawud].</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">1068. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, “<strong>By Him in Whose Hand my life is, I sometimes thought of giving orders for firewood to be collected, then for proclaiming the Adhan for Salat. Then I would appoint an Imam to lead Salat, and then go to the houses of those who do not come to perform Salat in congregation, and set fire to their houses on them</strong>.” [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">1069. Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: &#8220;<strong>He who likes to meet Allah tomorrow (i.e., on the Day of Requital) as a Muslim, should take care and observe the Salat when the Adhan is announced for them. Allah has expounded to your Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) the ways of right guidance, and these (the prayers) are part of the right guidance. If you have to perform Salat in your houses, as this man who stays away (from the mosque) and performs Salat in his house, you will abandon the Sunnah (practice) of your Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), and the departure from the Sunnah of your Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) will lead you astray. I have seen the time when no one stayed behind except a well-known hypocrite. I also saw that a man was brought swaying (on account of weakness) between two men till he was set up in a row (in the mosque)</strong>.&#8221; [Muslim].</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 76 : Point 128</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Whoever abandons the <em>Jumu’ah</em> Prayer and the congregational prayers in the mosque, without a valid excuse, then he is an innovator </strong></span>[1]<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>. The valid excuse is such as an illness, because of which he is unable to go out to the mosque, or fear of an oppressive ruler and whatever is besides that then there is no excuse for you.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Congregational payer in the mosque is an obligation upon the sane, adult males who are able to attend. This is the most correct saying of the scholars.</p>
<p>&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A blind man came to the Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) and said: “O Messenger of Allah! I have no one to guide me to the mosque.” He, therefore, sought his permission to perform <em>Salat</em> (prayer) in his house. He (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) granted him permission. When the man turned away, he called him back, and said, “Do you hear the <em>Adhan</em> (call to prayer)?” He replied in the affirmative. The Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) then directed him to respond to it.</span></p>
<p>[Muslim]. <a title="[Riyad-us-Saliheen] The Excellence of Performing Salat (Prayers) in Congregation" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/09/04/riyad-us-saliheen-imaam-nawawi-chapter-191/">[The Excellence of Performing Salat (Prayers) in Congregation</a> – Riyadh ul saaliheen]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas’ood (<em>radiAllaahu anhu</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Whoever would be happy to meet Allaah tomorrow as a Muslim, then let him preserve (in establishing) these five prayers from the place where they are called from (i.e. masjids), for verily, Allaah has legislated for your Prophet the ways of guidance. And indeed these (five prayers in the masjid) are from the ways of guidance. And if you were to pray in your homes as this man who refrains (to pray in the masjid) prays in his home, then you would have abandoned the Sunnah of your Prophet. And if you were to abandon the Sunnah of your Prophet (s<em>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>) you would go astray. There is not a man that performs the ablution and does it well, then sets out to go to one of these masjids except that Allaah records a good deed for him for every step he takes and raises him up one level and erases one evil deed due to it. You have certainly seen us, and no one would refrain from the prayer (in the masjid) except the hypocrite whose hypocrisy was well known. And indeed a man would be brought supported by two men until he was made to stand in the row (for prayer).”</span></p>

<p><strong>Read the article:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions, and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Position of the Ma’muum With Respect to Following the Imaam</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The position of the ma’muum with respect to following the imaam falls into four categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>1) Getting ahead (musabaqaah)</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#333300;"><strong> 2) Conformity (muwafaqaah)</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#333300;"><strong> 3) Staying behind (takhalluf)</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#333300;"><strong> 4) Following (mutaaba’)</strong></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>(1) al-Musabaqaah (Going Ahead)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Musabaqaah entails getting ahead of the imaam in either sayings or actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Concerning sayings</strong></span>,</span> it is acceptable to get ahead of the imaam, except in two matters; they are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1) Takbeerat al-Ihraam</strong> – If the follower precedes the imaam in it, then his salaah is invalid, even if he forgot.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2) Tasleem</strong> – If the follower deliberately precedes the imaam in it, then his salaah is nullified. However, if it was unintentional, then he simply repeats it after the imaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, if someone recites al-Faatiha, the remembrances of sujuud and rukuu, or the tashahhud before the imaam, then there is nothing upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#0000ff;">Regarding preceding the imaam <span style="text-decoration:underline;">in actions</span>,</span></strong> it is divided into two situations:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1) Going ahead of the imaam to a rukn (pillar)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Example: Someone made rukuu before the imaam. Later, the imaam caught up with him. At this point, the follower should stand up and make rukuu with the imaam, so as to follow him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2) Going ahead of the imaam by a rukn (pillar)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Example</strong>: Someone made rukuu and then lifts himself up before his imaam bows.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Going ahead of the imaam in actions is forbidden in all of its forms and is from the major sins, as evident in the sunnah. If someone knowingly goes ahead of the imaam, then his salaah is invalid. Correspondingly, the salaah of the person who did it ignorantly or due to forgetfulness is valid. However, if the legal excuse (e.g. forgetfulness or ignorance) is lifted before the imaam catches up, then it is incumbent upon the ma’muum to follow the imaam in those acts which he did prematurely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Example</strong>: Someone made sujuud and lifted up from it before his imaam prostrated. Therefore, he must return to position of the imaam and follow him. If his action was done deliberately, then his salaah is invalid; if it was due to ignorance or forgetfulness, then his salaah is valid.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>(2) al-Muwafaqaah (Conforming)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Conformity with the imaam can also be through sayings or actions. If it is in sayings, then it is not harmful except in two situations:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1) Takbeerat al-Ihraam</strong> – If the follower conforms with the imaam in it, then his salaah is invalid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2) Tasleem</strong> &#8211; If the follower deliberately conforms with the imaam in it, then his salaah is nullified. Correspondingly, if it was done due to forgetfulness and he returns later to follow his imaam in tasleem, then there is nothing upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also disliked (makrooh) to have conformity with the imaam in actions because the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“If he makes rukuu, then make rukuu, and do not make rukuu till he makes rukuu.”</span> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth makes it clear that we should follow the actions of the imaam, not conform with them. As such, if someone conforms with the imaam in sujuud by reaching the ground at the same time as him, then this is disliked; the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said in the same hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Do not make sujuud until he makes sujuud.”</span>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also reported from al-Baraa ibn ‘Aazib (radiyallaahu ‘anhu):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“When Allaah&#8217;s Messenger said, ‘Sami’a Allaahu liman hamidah’ none of us bent his back (for prostration) till the Prophet prostrated, and then we would prostrate after him.”</span> [3]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">(3) at-Takhalluf (Staying Behind)</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">at-Takhalloof is of two types.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) Staying behind due to a valid excuse – In this situation, the person brings what he failed to perform and follows the imaam. There is nothing upon him, even if he fell behind by a pillar or more.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a) A person did not hear his imaam until the imaam moved ahead of him by a rukn or two. In such a situation, he does that which he failed to perform and then follows his imaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b) While a person was praying in congregation, he did not hear the imaam make rukuu. However, he later heard the imaam say, “Sami’a Allaahu liman hamidah.” In this case, the ma’muum makes rukuu and then follows his imaam, without losing the rakaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if someone lagged behind the imaam to the point that the imaam caught up with him in the next rakaah, then the person does not bring that which he failed to perform at this stage. Instead, he follows his imaam, and this will be the beginning of a new rakaah for him. After the imaam makes tasleem, the ma’muum must make up the rakaah he missed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a) While a person is praying in congregation, the imaam makes a complete rakaah, but the maamum could not hear the speakers until the imaam began his second rakaah. As such, the ma’muum must follow the imaam, and the imaam’s second rakaah will be his first. Therefore, when the imaam completes his salaah by making tasleem, the ma’muum must stand up and pray an additional rakaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b) During salaat al-jumu’ah, a person heard the imaam reciting al-Fatiha.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At this point, there was a power outage. During the time the electricity was cut, the imaam completed a full rakaah. When the power returned, the ma’muum heard the imaam reciting Surah al-Ghaashiyah (Chapter 88), at which point he realized he missed the first rakaah since this surah is recited during the second rakaah of salaat al-jumu’ah. As such, the ma’muum should remain in his position and follow the imaam, and the imaam’s second’s rakaah will be his first. When the imaam makes tasleem, the ma’muum should then stand for a second rakaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, if the person recognizes his failure to follow the imaam before the imaam reaches the same position as him, then he makes up what he failed to perform and follows the imaam. Otherwise, he follows the imaam and makes up the missing rakaah after the imaam makes tasleem.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2) Staying behind without a valid excuse</strong> – This can either be through staying behind the imaam within a pillar or staying behind him by a pillar. Both are hraam (unlawful) if done deliberately. Staying behind within a pillar entails following the imaam and catching up with him in the pillar he has moved to perform.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Example</strong>: The imaam makes rukuu while the ma’muum is lagging behind having yet to complete one or two verses for a surah he recited after al-Fatiha. Then, the follower completes the surah and catches up with the imaam in rukuu. His action is haraam, and his rukuu is valid but in opposition to the sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Staying behind by a pillar involves the imaam going past the ma’muum by an entire pillar. In this case, the ma’muum’s salaah is nullified if there was not a valid excuse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a) The imaam makes rukuu and rises from it before the ma’muum has bowed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b) The imaam lifts up from the first sajdah while the ma’muum remains in sujood making du’aa. The imaam then does the second sajdah, preceding the ma’muum by one rukn (pillar). This is common in many mosques, but it nullifies the ma’muum’s salaah.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">(3) al-Mutaaba’ (Following)</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Following the imaam entails the ma’muum performing an action of salaah immediately after the imaam; this is the sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a) The ma’muum follows the imaam into rukuu even if he has yet to finish a second surah after al-Fatiha.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b) When the imaam lifts his head from sujuud, the ma’muum follows him; this is better than continuing to make du’aa as the ma’muum’s salaah is linked to his imaam, and they are commanded to follow him.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Summary</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The position of the ma’muum with respect to following the imaam falls into four<br />
categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1) Getting ahead (musabaqaah)</strong> – This is forbidden in all of its forms. Anyone who knowingly or intentionally does it invalidates his salaah. However, if it is done out of ignorance or forgetfulness, then the salaah is valid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2) Conformity (muwafiqaah)</strong> – This is makrooh (disliked).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3) Staying behind (takhalloof)</strong> – This can be either due to an invalid or valid excuse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4) Following (mutabbaa’)</strong> – This is the sunnah and correct.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions, and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">An Explanation By Muhammad bin Umar Bazmool</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> of the book  ‘<em>Sifat</em> <em>as-Salah</em>’ By <em>Shaykh Muhadith Nasir as-Sunnah </em>Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;"> Translated by Umm Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani Wrote:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">The Imam Saying <em>Ameen</em> Aloud After Reciting <em>Fatiha</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Messenger of Allaah  had completed his recitation of <em>Surah</em> Fatiha he would say: ‘<em>Ameen</em>’ raising his voice and he would elongate it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would command those praying behind him to say <em>Ameen</em> loudly just after the Imam said it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet  would say: ‘If the Imam recites: <strong>&lt;&lt;</strong> not of those who have evoked [Your] anger or of those who are astray. <strong>&gt;&gt; </strong> then say: ‘<em>Ameen</em>, for verily the Angels say<em>Ameen</em> and verily the Imam says <em>Ameen</em>,’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in other wording: ‘If the Imam says <em>Ameen</em> then say <em>Ameen</em>, whoever says it and it coincides with the <em>Ameen</em> of the Angels, (and in other wording if one of you says<em>Ameen</em> in his prayer and it coincides with the other) all his previous sins will be forgiven.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another Hadeeth: ‘Say <em>Ameen</em> and Allah will love you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Messenger of Allaah  also said: ‘The Jews do not envy you about anything more than they envy you of saying <em>Salaamu</em> <em>alaykum</em> (salutations) to each other and saying <em>Ameen</em> behind the Imam’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">______________________</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad bin Umar Bazmool explained:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This chapter of saying <em>Ameen</em> has a few issues, which will be discussed below.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The linguistic meaning of ‘<em>Ameen’</em> is ‘O Allaah respond / answer.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has also been said it means ‘<em>Subhanaka</em> <em>Ya</em> <em>Allaah’</em> (How far you are from imperfection) and it has been said it means ‘O Allaah’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when one who prays behind the Imam hears the Imam recite <em>Surah</em> Fatiha and reaches the part that says: <strong>&lt;&lt;</strong> not of those who have evoked [Your] anger or of those who are astray. <strong>&gt;&gt;</strong>  Then it is the Sunnah for him to say <em>Ameen</em> after this, as the Messenger of Allaah would say. This is due to the general statement of the saying of the Prophet : ‘Pray as you have seen me praying.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The saying of <em>Ameen</em> is Sunnah for the Imam and those following him. It is the Sunnah for the Imam in those prayers that are audible and he says <em>Ameen</em> audibly/ with a raised voice after he recites Surah Fatiha. It is also the Sunnah for those praying behind him to say <em>Ameen</em> after he finishes reciting <strong>&lt;&lt;</strong> not of those who have evoked [Your] anger or of those who are astray. <strong>&gt;&gt;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars -may Allaah have mercy upon them- have mentioned that this is the point at which the saying of the word ‘<em>Ameen’</em> of both the Imam and those following him coincide.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Shaykh Al-Albaani -may Allaah have mercy on him- during his visit to the Kingdom in the year 1410 A.H. regarding the matter of the Imam saying <em>Ameen</em> and those who follow him, and the Shaykh -may Allaah have mercy on him- said that it is upon those who are following the prayer to say <em>Ameen</em> just after the Imam, to the count of one or two letters, as the saying of <em>Ameen</em> will then be after the Imam and they will join in saying some of the letters of the word. Therefore, if the Imam says<em>Ameen</em> then those following say it in order for some of the letters of the word to coincide with one another, and at the same time the Imam will precede in one or two letters of the word. Thus in this manner the Imam saying <em>Ameen</em> and the followers will coincide in some of the letters and the end result will be that the saying of <em>Ameen</em> by the follower will be just after the <em>Ameen</em> of the Imam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The virtue of saying ‘<em>Ameen’</em>. The author -may Allaah have mercy on him- mentions from the Messenger , that if the Imam says <em>Ameen</em> and the Angels say <em>Ameen</em> and those following say <em>Ameen</em>, and they coincide with one another Allaah will forgive them all their previous sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another virtue is that Allaah &#8211;<em>Subhanahu</em> <em>wa</em> <em>Ta’ala</em>&#8211; answers your saying of the word ‘<em>Ameen’</em> because it means ‘O Allaah answer \ respond.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third virtue is what the Messenger  mentioned in his saying: ‘The Jews do not envy you about anything more than they envy you of saying <em>Salaamu</em> <em>alaykum</em> (salutations) to each other and saying <em>Ameen</em> behind the Imam.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why it is incumbent upon us, to ensure we say <em>Ameen</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourthly</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to what is mentioned with regard to the coinciding of saying <em>Ameen</em> of the Imam and those following him in prayer necessitates that those following are attentive in their prayer whilst following the Imam and the Imam’s recitation to ensure that he does not miss saying <em>Ameen</em> in the correct place. If he misses saying <em>Ameen</em> he loses great reward and recompense, which is mentioned in this hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this summons the presence of the heart and humility of the soul and the body whilst in prayer behind the Imam, and Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifthly</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I would like to bring to attention that which is relevant to this discussion of saying ‘<em>Ameen’</em>, which is, once one is aware of the meaning of the word ‘<em>Ameen’</em>, (O Allaah answer or O Allaah). Some people, whilst the Imam reads <em>Qunoot</em> and Exalts Allaah, Praises Him –<em>Subhanahu</em> <em>wa</em> <em>Ta’ala</em>&#8211; and glorifies Him, stop saying ‘<em>Ameen’</em>, replacing it by saying ‘<em>Subhanak’</em> (Glory be to You) or similar words. This clearly opposes the Sunnah as the word ‘<em>Ameen’</em> is sufficient for all supplication regardless of whether it is<em>Dua’</em> praising Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> or <em>Dua’</em> of asking from Him or declaring Allaah’s Majesty and Greatness.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Shaikh Muhammad Amaan Al-Jaamee [D. 1416H]<br />
SOURCE: Sharh Shuroot as-Salaat (pg. 8-9)<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his explanation of Imaam Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdil-Wahhaab&#8217;s classical treatise <i>Shuroot-us-Salaat</i>, Shaikh Muhammad Amaan Al-Jaamee, may Allaah have mercy on him, said:</p>
<p><i>Istijmaar</i> is not to be done only in cases of emergency as some people think. Rather, a person can perform <i>Istijmaar </i>(using stones) even if there is water present and he doesn’t perform <i>Istinjaa </i>(i.e. use water). This is what the Companions would do during their lifetimes since water was not as abundant and available as it is today. But in spite of this, they would not burden themselves by searching for water. If a person (at their time) would relieve himself, he would clean himself with stones (<i>Istijmaar</i>) and suffice with that even if water was available. If he fulfills the conditions (of ablution), by removing the source of the impurity from his body, it is valid for him to go and pray. As for the traces and marks of the impurity, then this is pardonable.</p>
<p>The same goes for a person who steps on impurities with his shoes or socks and then rubs them on the floor until the source of the impurity is removed even though the traces of the impurity may remain. He may pray in his shoes and socks even though traces remain after having removed the source of the impurity, just like the one who does <i>Istijmaar</i>.</p>
<p>The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“If one of you comes to the masjid, he should look at the bottom of his shoes. If he sees an impurity on them, he should rub them on the ground. Then he may enter with them (i.e. the shoes) and pray with them on.”</b></p>
<p>This is one of the acts of the Sunnah that has been abandoned today. In fact, it is one of the acts of the Sunnah that is fought against by many people. It is even considered a crime in some regions – Entering the masjid with sandals and shoes. If I were to go today and buy a pair of shoes from a store and then put them on and enter the masjid with them – this would be regarded as a crime and considered disrespect for the mosques and houses of Allaah. The Sunnah has become innovation and innovation has become Sunnah! Praying in shoes was something well established at the time of the Salaf – they would not differ over it.</p>
<p>In fact, everything that is found in the command (of the Prophet) should be observed by an individual. Thus, he should check if his shoes are clean upon entering the masjid, acting upon the hadeeth which we just mentioned: <b>“Then he may enter with them (i.e. the shoes) and pray with them on.”</b></p>
<p>If he takes his shoes off, he should place them between his legs, not in front of him or behind him nor to his right or left, so as to disturb the people around him. Rather he should place them between his legs, in between his feet. This is what has been reported in the Sunnah and this is what the Salaf of this ummah have followed. This aspect of the Sunnah continues to be practiced in some areas of this country (i.e. Saudi Arabia). However, in some of the other areas of the country as well as some regions abroad, the reaction towards this Sunnah is bad.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we must emphasize here that praying in shoes is Sunnah, i.e. recommended. It is neither obligatory nor is it a condition or requirement for the validity of one’s prayer. So if this aspect of the Sunnah conflicts with another good that is found in some masaajid, or if opening the door to entering the masaajid with shoes on leads to squandering money, then this aspect of the Sunnah should be left off temporarily and restrictedly – to this confined place – until it is revived in other places that are similar to these masaajid.</p>
<p>The youth should not hasten to enter the masaajid with their shoes on for they will open the door for everyone to do so, and this will lead some people who are in a rush to enter the masjid before checking under their shoes. This will then lead to a squandering of the masjid’s carpet and we have been prohibited from squandering money.</p>
<p>Squandering money is forbidden while entering the masjid and praying with shoes on is recommended. So when there exists a conflict such as this, we should work to revive the Sunnah of praying in shoes in masaajid other than these – i.e. in masaajid that have remained in their pure original state with floors that are covered by dirt and sand – or in our homes, or in some open land when we go out on a journey or camping. There are many places.</p>
<p>This means that we should not wage war against the act of praying in shoes, nor should we go to the extremes of entering these carpeted masaajid with shoes on thus causing the money spent on them to be squandered. Rather, we should combine between these advantages and those ahaadeeth, and that is by reviving the Sunnah of praying in shoes in other than these types of masaajid.</p>
<p>There are many masaajid and many places (to pray with shoes on). So we must have a good and proper understanding of the Religion and bring together all of the texts. A person should not take one portion or one text or one hadeeth and leave off all of the other texts. Rather, he must always try to reconcile and bring together all of the texts, as much as he is able to.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/reciting-surah-al-faatihah-in-every-prayer-shaikh-muhammad-amaan-al-jaamee.pdf">Reciting Surah Al-Faatihah in Every Prayer &#8211; Shaikh Muhammad Amaan Al-Jaamee</a></strong> [PDF]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his classical treatise, Shaikh Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdil-Wahhaab, may Allaah have mercy on him, says: &#8220;The pillars of the prayer are fourteen: (1) Standing, if one has the ability to do so; (2) The opening Takbeer; (3) Reciting Surah Al-Faatihah&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his explanation of this last pillar, Shaikh Muhammad Amaan Al-Jaamee, may Allaah have mercy on him, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This applies to everyone – the one leading the prayer (<strong>Imaam</strong>), the one being led in prayer (<strong>ma’moom</strong>) and the one praying alone (<strong>munfarid</strong>) in the same manner – and according to the most correct opinion even in the audible prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ma’moom listening to the recitation of the Imaam and remaining attentive to it does not remove the obligation of reciting Surah Al-Faatihah from him according to the most correct opinion of the scholars. This issue is one of differing since the Prophet’s (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) statement: “There is no prayer for he who does not recite the opening chapter of the Book” includes the one leading the prayer, the one being led in prayer and the one praying alone. He (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: “There is no prayer for he who does not recite…” Listening is not reciting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It’s true that the one being led in prayer should remain attentive to the recitation of the one leading the prayer. However, the extent in which it takes him to recite Surah Al-Faatihah is exempted from this, whether he recites Al-Faatihah along with the Imaam in succession or he is able to recite it during one of the moments in which the Imaam pauses or he recites it while the Imaam is reciting the (next) surah in any of the opportunities he gets. This is since there is no mention (in the texts) of a specific time for the one being led in prayer to recite Surah AlFaatihah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Irregardless, he must recite it since the prayer of the one who does not recite Surah Al-Faatihah is invalid whether he is leading the prayer, praying alone or – according to the most correct view as stated before – even if he is being led in prayer and standing behind an Imaam that is reciting out loud. The strongest proof for this is the qudsee hadeeth in which Allaah said: “I have divided the prayer between Myself and My servant into two halves.” What is meant by “prayer” here is Surah Al-Faatihah. Allaah referred to Al-Faatihah as the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I have divided the prayer between Myself and My servant into two halves, and My servant will have what he asks for. When the servant says: ‘Al-Hamdulillaahi Rabb-il-‘Alameen’, Allaah says: ‘My servant has praised Me.’ And when he says: ‘Ar-Rahmaan-ir-Raheem’, Allaah says: ‘My servant has extolled Me.’ And when he says: ‘Maaliki-yawm-id-Deen’, Allaah says: ‘My servant has honored Me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when he says: ‘Iyyaaka Na’bdu wa Iyyaaka Nasta’een’, Allaah says: ‘This is between My servant and I and My servant will have what he asks for.’ And when he says: ‘Ihdinaas-Siraat-al-Mustaqeem. Siraat-aladheena an’amta ‘alaihim. Ghairil-Maghdoobi ‘alaihim wa lad-Daalleen’, Allaah says: ‘This is for My servant and for My servant will be what he asks for.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has referred to Surah Al-Faatihah as the “Prayer” in this qudsee hadeeth. This includes everyone who prays, meaning: Whoever does not recite Al-Faatihah has no prayer. So the hadeeth explains itself and supports itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, a person who prays behind someone – even an Imaam that is reciting out loud – should not leave off reciting Surah Al-Faatihah just because of what he has read in the books of one of the madh-habs. If he considers this type of hadeeth to be authentic as well as the second hadeeth “There is no prayer for he who does not recite the opening chapter of the Book” and other narrations concerning Surah Al-Faatihah that bear a similar meaning, it is not permissible for him to turn away from these ahaadeeth by claiming that he is following the madh-hab of so and so and that this madh-hab says it is not obligatory upon the one being led in prayer to recite Al-Faatihah particularly when the Imaam is reciting out loud. This is not a correct stance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Maalik, may Allaah have mercy on him, the Imaam of Madeenah and one of the great ones to have taught at the Prophet’s Masjid during the time of the Taabi’-ut-Taabi’een who would teach in the proximity of the garden would advise his students saying to them: “Every person’s statements can either be accepted or rejected except for the inhabitant of this grave” and he pointed to the Prophet’s (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) grave, which was close to where he was teaching.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what it means: It is not befitting for a Muslim – especially a student of knowledge – that comes upon a hadeeth of Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) to claim that this hadeeth opposes our madh-hab, and then abandons it claiming that he is doing so out of following his madh-hab. Following one of the madh-habs is not obligatory. There does not exist at all any creature whom we are obligated to follow and for whom we will be questioned about following – if we fall short in doing that – except for the Messenger of Allaah, Muhammad, (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam). Such a person does not exist.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who says: “And it is an obligation to blindly follow a scholar from amongst them” as the saying goes, using such wording that implies the same understanding of this statement made by the author of Jawharat-ut-Tawheed, then such a statement is baseless.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are not obligated to follow any one of the four madh-habs. It is not an obligation. In fact, the most correct view is that it is not even permissible. The term “obligation” is a legal ruling and a legal ruling does not become established except by a proof from the Qur’aan or the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever claims that something is obligatory is required to bring forward the proof for his claim. What is meant by the saying that we are obligated to follow the madh-hab of Imaam Maalik?? How could this be when at his time there were three other Muslim Imaams of his caliber? And altogether, these four Imaams were considered the Imaams of the world during the time of the Taabi’-ut-Taabi’een as Ibn Taimiyyah said: “These four are the Imaams of the world during the time of the Taabi’-ut-Taabi’een. Amongst them is Imaam Maalik in the Hijaaz, Al-Laith bin Sa’ad in Egypt, Ath-Thawree in ‘Iraaq, and Al-Awzaa’ee in Shaam.” So it is not permissible to blindly follow three of them but as for the fourth, we can?!?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Where did they get this from? What is the proof for it? For three of them it is not permissible, ok, it is not obligatory. It is not permissible for us to blindly follow Laith or Thawree or AlAwzaa’ee, but as for Imaam Maalik, we must blindly follow him? Where did such a division come from? Who is the one who made such a thing an obligation? Did some revelation come down saying: “If an Imaam reaches the level of Imamship, the ummah is obligated to follow him?” There must be some text similar to this reported. And because there is none, the claim that blind-following one of the four Imaams is a false claim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I am only using Imaam Maalik as an example here because I used his statement previously. Afterward, I remembered the three other Imaams that were of his caliber. Imaam Abu Haneefah, Ash-Shaafi’ee, Maalik and Ahmad were all Muslim Imaams, but there were others along with them who were just like them. Weren’t they more knowledgeable than them? It was said that Laith bin Sa’ad was more knowledgeable than Maalik. The point I’m trying to make is: The only one whom we are obligated to follow and for whom we will be questioned about following is Muhammad (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every Muslim knows and memorizes the three questions that he will be asked in the grave. When a person dies and is buried, he will definitely be asked these three questions: “Who is your Lord?” “What is your Religion?” And “who is your Prophet?” In some wordings of the narration, it states: “What do you say about the man who was sent to you?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is in reference to Muhammad (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam). One of the questions will not be: “Who is your Imaam? What is your madh-hab? What is your way?” No such report has been mentioned. Our Imaam, our example, our prophet and our leader to Allaah is Muhammad (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam). We have no other Imaam. The four Imaams as well as those who were of their caliber and standing would call the people to follow this same Imaam. They did not come with the purpose of calling people to follow them. This is why Imaam Abu Haneefah would say: “It is Haraam (unlawful) for anyone to blindly-follow us until they know from where we took (i.e. the sources).” Several scholars have reported this statement on him, such as Ibn ‘Abdil-Barr and Ibn ‘Aabideen in his Hanafee notes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I would like to reiterate to the students of knowledge that the act of following the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) does not fall second to the act of worshipping Allaah. This is since worshipping Allaah is what is meant by “Laa Ilaaha Illaa Allaah” whereas following the Messenger of Allaah is what is meant when you say: “Ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasoolullaah.” These two statements are like one statement – the first part of it is not complete without the second part or the second part without the first. We must understand this point well. So the opening chapter of this Qur’aan is one of the important pillars of the prayer.</p>

<p><span style="color:#808080;">AUTHOR: Shaikh ‘Abdus-Salaam bin Barjiss</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"> SOURCE: Al-I’laam ‘an ba’adi Ahkaam-is-Salaam (pg. 36-37)</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"> PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many people ask on the ruling of what some people do nowadays, such as the shaking of hands between those next to each other – on the right and justify – after finishing from performing the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah, may Allaah have mercy on him, answered this type of question when he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Shaking hands after prayer is not prescribed in the Sunnah. Rather, it is an innovation, and Allaah knows best.”</strong></span> [Majmoo’-ul-Fataawaa: 23/339]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And how beautiful is what Ibn-ul-Haaj, may Allaah have mercy on him, said, whilst advising the student of knowledge:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And he should refrain from what they have introduced from shaking hands after the Morning Prayer, the ‘Asr Prayer and the Jumu’ah Prayer. In fact, some of them in these times have even gone so far as to do this after all of the five daily prayers! And all of this is from innovations. The proper place for shaking hands, according to the Religion, is only at the time when a Muslim encounters his brother, not after the five daily prayers. All of this is from innovations. Wherever the Religion has placed it (i.e. the act of shaking hands), we too should place it. Therefore, this act (of shaking hands after prayer) should be avoided and the one who does it should be reprimanded for what he has brought forth from opposition to the Sunnah.”</strong></span> [Al-Madkhal: 2/223]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great scholar, Ibn Hajr Al-Haytamee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“What people do from shaking hands directly after the five daily prayers is detested (makrooh). It has no basis in the Religion.”</strong></span></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Some scholars have also indicated that shaking hands after prayer is from the ways of the Rawaafid, may Allaah debase them</strong></span>. [See As-Si’aayah (pg. 264) of the great scholar AlLuknawee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Muslim, after having heard the words of the scholars on this aspect of shaking hands (after every prayer), you have no choice except but to abandon it, detest it and instruct the people to forsake it, out of caution from falling into innovations, which violate an individual’s religion and detract from his deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And you must know that these scholars’ ruling this act of shaking hands (after prayer) to be an innovation is based on the premise that it is an act of worship that was introduced after the time of the Prophet (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and the first three generations (of Muslims, i.e. the Salaf). The Prophet (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: “<strong>Whoever does a deed that is not in conformity with our affair (i.e. Sunnah), he is rejected</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And you will surely be amazed at how innovations cling tightly onto the hearts of those who were raised upon it to the point that they become like armor for these innovations, protecting it from harm and destruction, whereas Ahlus-Sunnah suffer weakness and humiliation for the sake of defending and reviving the acts of the Sunnah and refuting and showing sternness against those who oppose it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Don’t you see this innovation and how the people guard it, believing it to be an act of nearness to Allaah? This is such that if a person were to give the slightest hint that he dislikes such an act, the people will call out to him from every direction accusing him of having brought a new religion!! And all of this came about due to the scholars’ laxity in waging war against innovations – even though they be small – and due to their leniency in implementing the Sunnah – even though it may cause divisions. So verily, to Allaah we belong and to Him we will return. And Allaah is sufficient for us and the best of guardians.</p>

Undesirability of Entering the Mosque after Eating raw Onion or Garlic</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1701.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who has eaten garlic should not come to our mosque</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narration in Muslim is: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who has eaten garlic should not come to our mosques</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1702.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who has eaten from this plant (i.e., garlic) should not approach us and should not offer Salat (prayer) along with us</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1703.</b> Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who has eaten garlic or onion should keep away from us or our mosques</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narration in Muslim is: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who has eaten onion or garlic or leek should not approach our mosque, because the angels are also offended by the strong smells) that offend the children of Adam</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1704.</b> It  has  been  narrated  that `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) said in the sermon of Friday prayer: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">O you people! You eat garlic and onion. I think the odour of these to be very offensive. I saw that if the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) happened to find a man with such offensive odour in the mosque, he would order him to be taken out of the mosque and sent to Al-Baqi`. He who wants to eat any of these, should cook them till their odour dies out</span>.<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1062.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The angels supplicate in favour of one of you so long as he remains in the place where he has performed Salat (prayer) in a state of Wudu&#8217;. They (the angels) say: `O Allah! Forgive him, O Allah! Have mercy on him</span>.&#8221;&#8217;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1063.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Once the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) delayed the night prayer (`Isha&#8217;) till midnight. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) turned to us after Salat (prayer) and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The people slept after performing their Salat, but you who waited, will be accounted as engaged in Salat throughout the period of your waiting</span>.&#8221;<br />

Chapter 194<br />
The Excellence of Standing in the First Row (In Salat)</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1082.</b> Jabir bin Samurah (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) came out to us (once) and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Why do you not stand in rows as the angels do before their Rubb?</span>&#8221; We asked: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! how do the angels stand in rows before their Rubb?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">They complete each row beginning with the first and filling all the gaps</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1083.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">If people came to know the blessing of calling Adhan and the standing in the first row, they could do nothing but would draw lots to secure these privileges</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1084.</b>Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The best of the men&#8217;s rows (in Salat) is the first row and the worst is the last; but the best of the woman&#8217;s row is the last and the worst of their rows is the first</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1085.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: When the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) perceived a tendency among his Companions to stand in the back rows, he said to them, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Come forward and be close to me and let those who come after you, follow your lead. If people continue to fall behind (i.e., in acquiring virtues), Allah puts them behind</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1086.</b> Abu Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to gently pat our shoulders when we were standing in rows at the time of Salat and say, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Keep (the rows) straight; do not differ from each other lest your hearts should suffer from discord. Let those of you who are mature and prudent be nearer to me, and then those who are next to them</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1087.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Keep your rows straight (during Salat in congregation), for keeping the rows straight is part of the perfection of Salat</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1088.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: When the Iqamah had been announced, the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) turned his face towards us and said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Make your rows straight and stand close together, for I can see you from behind my back</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1089.</b> An-Nu`man bin Bashir (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Straighten your rows; otherwise, Allah will create dissension among you</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narration in Muslim is: An-Nu`man bin Bashir (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) directed us to keep our rows as straight as arrows. He continued stressing this until he realized that we had learnt it from him (<span style="color:#800000;">recognized its significance</span>). One day he came into the mosque and stood up. He was just about to say Takbir (Allah is  Greater) when he noticed a man whose chest was projected from the row, so he said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">O slaves of Allah, you must straighten your rows or Allah will certainly put your faces in opposite directions</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1090.</b> Al-Bara&#8217; bin `Azib (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to pass between the rows from one end to the other, touching our chest and shoulders (i.e., arranging the rows) in line and saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do not be out of line; otherwise your hearts will be in disagreement&#8221;. He would add, &#8220;Allah and His angels invoke blessings upon the first rows</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1091.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Arrange the rows in order, stand shoulder to shoulder, close the gaps, be accommodating to your brothers, and do not leave gaps for Satan. Whoever joins up a row, he will be joined to Allah (i.e., to the Mercy of Allah); and whoever cuts off a row, he will be cut off from Allah (i.e., from His Mercy)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1092.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Stand close together in your rows, keep nearer to one another, and put your necks in line, for by Him in Whose Hands my soul is, I see the Satan entering through the opening in the row like Al-hadhaf (i.e., a type of small black sheep found in Yemen)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1093.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Fill (complete) the first row, then the one next to it; and if there is any deficiency (incompleteness), it should be in the last row</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1094.</b>`Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allah and His angels invoke blessings upon those who are on the right side of the rows</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1095</b>. Al-Bara&#8217; (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Whenever we performed Salat behind the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), we liked to be on his right side so that his face might turn towards us (at the end of the Salat). One day, I heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) supplicating, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">O my Rubb! Shield me from Your Torment on the Day when You will gather (or said, `resurrect&#8217;) Your slaves</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1096.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him)reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Let the Imam stand in the middle (so that those praying behind him should be standing both on his right and his left) and close the gaps</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>

Chapter 189<br />
The Excellence of Proceeding towards the Mosque Walking</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1053.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who goes to the mosque in the morning or in the evening, Allah prepares for him a place in Jannah whenever he goes to the mosque in the morning and returns from it in the evening</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1054.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who purifies (performs Wudu&#8217;) himself in his house and then walks to one of the houses of Allah (mosque) for performing an obligatory Salat, one step of his will wipe out his sins and another step will elevate his rank (in Jannah)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1055.</b> Ubayy bin Ka`b (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: There was a man of the Ansar whose house was the farthest from the mosque. As far as I know, he never missed Salat (in congregation). It was said to him: &#8220;If you buy a donkey, you may ride upon it in the dark nights and in the hot days.&#8221; He said: &#8220;I do not like that my house should be situated close to the mosque. I desire that my walking towards the mosque and returning home be recorded to my credit.&#8221; Upon this the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allah has gathered all (rewards) for you</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1056.</b> Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: There were some plots of land lying vacant around the mosque. The people of Banu Salamah decided to move to this land and come nearer to the mosque. The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) heard about it and said to them, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">I have heard that you intend to move near the mosque</span>.&#8221; They said: &#8220;Yes, O Messenger of Allah! We have decided to do that.&#8221; Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">O Banu Salamah! Stay in your houses, because your footprints (when you come to the mosque) will be recorded</span>.&#8221; He said this twice. They said: &#8220;We would not have liked it, had we moved near the mosque.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1057.</b> Abu Musa (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The person who will receive the highest reward for Salat (prayer) is the one who comes to perform it in the mosque from the farthest distance. And he who waits for Salat to perform it with the Imam (in congregation) will have a greater reward than the one who observes it alone and then goes to sleep</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1058.</b> Buraidah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Convey glad tidings to those who walk to the mosque in the darkness. For they will be given full light on the Day of Resurrection</span>.&#8221;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi and Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1059.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Shall I not tell you something by which Allah effaces the sins and elevates the ranks (in Jannah).</span>&#8221; The Companions said: &#8220;Yes (please tell us), O Messenger of Allah.&#8221; He said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Performing the Wudu&#8217; properly in spite of difficult circumstances, walking with more paces to the mosque, and waiting for the next Salat (prayer) after a observing Salat; and that is Ar-Ribat, and that is Ar-Ribat</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1060.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">When you see a man frequenting the mosque, testify that he is a believer because Allah says: `Allah&#8217;s mosques are visited only by those who believe in Allah and the Last Day</span>.&#8221;&#8217;<br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>

Those who have spent the night with you, ascend to the heaven and their Rubb, Who knows better about them, asks: `In what condition did you leave My slaves?&#8217; They reply: `We left them while they were performing Salat and we went to them while they were performing Salat</span>.&#8221;&#8217;<br />

Urging to Observe &#8216;Isha&#8217; and Fajr Prayers in Congregation</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1071.</b> `Uthman bin `Affan (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">One who performs `Isha&#8217; prayer in congregation, is as if he has performed Salat for half of the night. And one who performs the Fajr prayer in congregation, is as if he has performed Salat the whole night</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narration of At-Tirmidhi says: `Uthman bin Affan (May Allah be pleased with him) narrated that he had heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who attends `Isha&#8217; in congregation, is as if he has performed Salat for half of the night; and he who attends `Isha&#8217; and Fajr prayers in congregation, is as if he has performed Salat for the whole night</span>.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 align="Center"><a href="#">Imam Al-Nawawi&#8217;s Riyad-us-Saliheen</a><br />
Chapter 191<br />
The Excellence of Performing Salat (Prayers) in Congregation</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1064.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Salat in congregation is twenty-seven times more meritorious than a Salat performed individually</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1065.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">A man&#8217;s Salat in congregation is twenty-five times more rewarding than his Salat at home or in his shop, and that is because when he performs his Wudu&#8217; properly and proceeds towards the mosque with the purpose of performing Salat in congregation, he does not take a step without being raised a degree (in rank) for it and having a sin remitted for it, till he enters the mosque. When he is performing Salat, the angels continue to invoke Blessings of Allah on him as long as he is in his place of worship in a state of Wudu&#8217;. They say: `O Allah! Have mercy on him! O Allah! Forgive him.&#8217; He is deemed to be engaged in Salat as long as he waits for it.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1066.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A blind man came to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">O Messenger of Allah! I have no one to guide me to the mosque</span>.&#8221; He, therefore, sought his permission to perform Salat (prayer) in his house. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) granted him permission. When the man turned away, he called him back, and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do you hear the Adhan (call to prayer)?</span>&#8221; He replied in the affirmative. The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) then directed him to respond to it.<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1067.</b> `Abdullah bin Umm Maktum, the Mu&#8217;adhdhin (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I said to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam): &#8220;There are many poisonous insects and wild beasts in Al-Madinah, and I am blind. Please grant me permission to perform Salat at home<span style="color:#008000;">.</span>&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) enquired whether he could hear the call: Hayya `alas-Salah; Hayya `alal-Falah (Come to the prayer, come to the salvation). When he replied in affirmative, the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) directed him to come (to mosque) for prayer.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1068.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my life is, I sometimes thought of giving orders for firewood to be collected, then for proclaiming the Adhan for Salat. Then I would appoint an Imam to lead Salat, and then go to the houses of those who do not come to perform Salat in congregation, and set fire to their houses on them</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1069.</b>Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: He who likes to meet Allah tomorrow (<span style="color:#800000;">i.e., on the Day of  Requital</span>) as a Muslim, should take care and observe the Salat when the Adhan is announced for them. Allah has expounded to your Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) the ways of right guidance, and these (<span style="color:#800000;">the prayer</span>s) are part of the right guidance. If you have to perform Salat in your houses, as this man who stays away (<span style="color:#800000;">from the mosque</span>) and performs Salat in his house, you will abandon the Sunnah (practice) of your Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), and the departure from the Sunnah of your Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) will lead you astray. I have seen the time when no one stayed behind except a well-known hypocrite. I also saw that a man was brought swaying (<span style="color:#800000;">on account of weakness</span>) between two men till he was set up in a row (<span style="color:#800000;">in the mosque</span>).<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1070.</b> Abud-Darda&#8217; (May Allah be pleased with him)reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">If three men in a village or in the desert, make no arrangement for Salat in congregation, Satan must have certainly overcome them. So observe Salat in congregation, for the wolf eats up a solitary sheep that stays far from the flock</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>

Chapter 93<br />
Excellence of Walking Solemnly (Towards the Mosque) to perform As-Salat (The<br />
Prayer) and other Religious Duties</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And whosoever honours the Symbols of Allah, then it is truly from the piety of the heart.&#8221;</b></span><b> (22:32)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>704.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;When the Iqamah are pronounced, do not come to it running, you should walk calmly with tranquillity to join the congregation. Then join in what you catch for and complete what you miss.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">  In Muslim it is added: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;For when one of you is walking for Salat, he is, in fact, engaged in Salat.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>705.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: I accompanied the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) while we were returning from `Arafat. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) heard behind him a loud noise of beating and of driving the camels forcibly. He pointed towards it with his whip and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O people! Proceed calmly. No virtue lies in rushing.&#8221;</span><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">The following is an article written by <em>Shaykh Badr al-Badr al-&#8216;Anazy (hafidhahullah)</em> which analyzes the permissibility of the second congregation, based on the <em>ahaadeeth</em> of the Prophet (<em>sallAllahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>) and explanation of our <em>&#8216;Ulamaa`.</em> The This article was translated by our noble brother <em>Abu Afnaan Muhammad &#8216;Abdullah</em> (<em>hafidhahullah</em>), who has explicit written permission from the <em>Shaykh</em> to translate his articles<br />
<a style="font-weight:inherit;color:#0068cf;" href="http://www.mpubs.org/files/20140510_Abu_Afnaan_Permission_From_Shaykh_Badr.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">click here to read</a>.</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"><strong>An excerpt taken from the article ~</strong></p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Imaam Ibn al-Qudaamah</em> mentioned in <em>al-Mughnee</em> (2/117): “It is not disliked to repeat the congregational prayer in the <em>masjid</em>. And this means that if the local<em>imaam</em> prays (with a group) and then another group comes, it is recommended for them to pray as a group and this is the position of <em>Ibn Mas’ood, ‘Ataa, al-Hasan, an-Nakha&#8217;ee </em>and others. However, <em>Saalim, Maalik, Abu Haneefah, ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee</em> and others stated that the congregational prayer is not repeated in a <em>masjid </em>which has an appointed <em>imaam</em> and is not on a passageway, etc. Thus, if he misses the congregation, he is to pray by himself.</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">There is no proof prohibiting the second congregation and that they are to pray by themselves and the <em>hadeeth</em>, “who will give charity to that one” is clear textual proof of its permissibility.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Who has more right to be the imam for the prayer? Is it the young boy who has not reached puberty but he has (memorized) half of the Quran or is it the adult who has (memorize) five juz (of Quran) but he also has (knowledge) from the sunnah just as Aqeedah (belief), hadeeth and fiqh? May Allaah keep you firm.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The oldest is more preferable as long as he has from the Quran what suffices for the prayer. He is preferred over the young. Only if the young is the most proficient in Quran amongst the others present then he is put forth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Author:Imaam Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee<br />
Source:Al-Asaalah Magazine: Issue 13-14 (Contained in the E-Book: Fataawaa of Shaikh Al-Albaanee)<br />
Translator:isma&#8217;eel alarcon</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Question:</b> What is the religious ruling concerning holding a second congregational prayer in the masjid?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer:</b> The scholars of Fiqh have differed with regard to the ruling on holding the second congregational prayer. However, before we mention the difference of opinion and clarify which is the most correct of them, we must first identify the type of congregation that they differ on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The subject of disagreement is with regard to the congregation that is established in a masjid that has a regular employed Imaam and mu’adhin. As for the congregations that are established in any other place, be it in ones home, a masjid built on the road (i.e. musalla) or a store, then there is nothing that prevents one from having repeated congregations in those places.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars who hold the opinion that it is disliked to have numerous congregations in the above type of masjid, the one that has a regular Imaam and a regular mu’adhin, derive their ruling from two evidences. The first is textual and comes from the Divine Legislator, while the other is theoretical and it is a contemplation of the narrations and the wisdom behind the prescription of the prayer in congregation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the textual evidence, then they have investigated and found that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) went throughout his life leading the people in congregational prayer in his masjid. Nevertheless, whenever any individual from his Companions entered the masjid and found that the congregational prayer had finished, he would pray alone and he would not wait (for others to come). Nor would he turn towards his left or right, as the people do today, looking for one or more people so that one of them can pray with them as an Imaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Salaf never used to do any of this. So when one of them would enter the masjid and find that the people had prayed, he would pray by himself. This is what Imaam Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee concluded in his book <i>Al-Umm</i>, and his discussion on this topic is from the moist comprehensive of talks that I have seen from the discussions of the Imaams on this issue, such that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If a group of people enter a masjid and find that the Imaam has already prayed, then they should pray individually. But if they pray in a congregation, then their prayer is acceptable and correct, however, I hate that they do this for it was not from the customs of the Salaf.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said: &#8220;As for the masjid that is on the highway, which doesn&#8217;t have a regular employed Imaam and mu&#8217;adhin, then there is no harm in holding numerous congregational prayers in it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said: &#8220;And we have memorized that a group from the Prophet&#8217;s Companions missed the congregational prayer, so they prayed individually. Even though they had the ability to congregate and pray together a second time, they did not do this because they hated to hold the (same) congregational prayer in the masjid twice.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the saying of Imaam Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee. And what he mentioned that the Companions used to pray individually when they would miss the congregational prayer, has been mentioned as a ta&#8217;leeq narration in shortened form. And Al-Haafidh Abu Bakr Ibn Abee Shaybah transferred that to his famous book <i>Al-Musannaf</i>. He reported it with a strong chain of narration on the authority of Al-Hasan Al-Basree that when the Companions would miss prayer in congregation, they would pray individually.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Al-Qaasim related this understanding in his <i>Mudawwanat-ul-Imaam Maalik</i> on a group of the Salaf, such as Naafi&#8217; the servant of Ibn &#8216;Umar, Saalim Ibn &#8216;Abdillaah and others, that when they would miss the prayer, they would pray individually and they would not establish the congregation a second time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Imaam At-Tabaraanee reported in his <i>Mu&#8217;jam Al-Kabeer</i> with a good chain of narration from Ibn Mas&#8217;ood that he went out one day with two of his companions from his house to the masjid in order to pray in the congregation. But when they got there, they found the people leaving the masjid for they had finished the prayer. So he returned to his home and led them in prayer. So this returning of Ibn Mas&#8217;ood &#8211; being who he was due to his accompaniment of the Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) and his knowledge and understanding of Islaam &#8211; if he knew the prescription of praying numerous congregations in one masjid, he would have entered with his two companions and prayed in congregation with them. This is since he knew the saying of the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam): <b>&#8220;The best prayer of a man is the one he performs in his house, except for the obligatory prayer.&#8221;</b> So what was it that prevented Ibn Mas&#8217;ood (raa) from praying this obligatory prayer in the masjid? &#8211; his knowledge that if he prayed it in the masjid, he would have to pray it alone. So he held that if he congregated in his home that would be better than if he and those with him prayed individually by themselves in the masjid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a collection of the quotes that support the point of view of the majority of the scholars that have disliked numerous congregations held in the described masjid in the manner mentioned previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereafter, people will not miss finding other evidences, while doing some deduction and precise investigation. Thus, the two Imaams, Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim, have reported from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah (raa) that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said, <b>&#8220;I felt a strong desire to command a man to lead the people in prayer. Then command some men to fetch firewood, then go to the people who have left off praying in congregation and set their houses on fire. By the One in whose hand the soul of Muhammad is, if one of them knew that he would find two good hunted game in the masjid, he would surely come to witness the two.&#8221;</b> In this hadeeth, the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) threatened those who refrained from attending the congregational prayer in the masjid with burning them with fire. I believe that this hadeeth alone informs us of the previously mentioned ruling or it informs us of what Imaam Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee has stated and what Ibn Abee Shaybah has related. And that was that the Companions would not repeat the prayer in congregation in the masjid. This is since, if we were to assume that the second and third congregations were legislated in the masjid, then there came this severe threat from Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) to those who refrained from the congregational prayer, which congregation is it that they are refraining from? And for which congregation that they refrained from attending was this severe threat intended?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it is said: &#8220;For the first congregation&#8221;, then it must said: These other congregations are not legislated. And if it is said: &#8220;This severe threat only applies to the one who refrains from every congregation, however many even if their number is continuous. So then in this case, the argument of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) against anyone of those people who refrained from any of the congregations would not be established at all. This is since if he were to surprise one of them, after having put someone in charge to lead the prayer, by going to his house and finding him spending leisure time with his wife and children. And so he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) would reprimand him for this, saying: &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you go pray in congregation?&#8221; He would simply reply to him: &#8220;I will pray with the second or third congregation.&#8221; So will the Messenger&#8217;s (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) argument be established against him? Due to this, the Messenger&#8217;s strong desire to authorize someone to take his place and for him (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) to surprise those who refrained from attending the congregational prayer and burn their houses down, is the greatest proof that there is no second congregation at all. This is with respect to the textual reports that the scholars have relied on for support.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the investigation, then it is from the following angle: There are many ahaadeeth reported that state the virtue of the prayer in congregation. From them is the Prophet&#8217;s (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) saying: <b>&#8220;Prayer in congregation is better than praying alone by twenty-five &#8211; and in one report &#8211; by twenty-seven degrees.&#8221;</b> So this great virtue was only stated for the prayer in congregation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is stated in other ahaadeeth that: <b>&#8220;The prayer of a man along with another man is more purer in the sight of Allaah, than his praying alone. And the prayer of a man along with two other men is purer in the sight of Allaah than his praying with one man.&#8221;</b> This is because every time the congregation increases in its number of individuals, its reward multiplies with Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if we keep this understanding in mind and then look at the consequences of the opinion that allows the holding of numerous congregations in the masjid that has a regular Imaam, then it has the worst consequences. This is because the opinion for holding repetitive congregations will lead to the minimizing of the amount of people who attend the first congregation. And this contradicts the incitement that we find in the hadeeth: <b>&#8220;The prayer of one man along with another man is purer that his praying alone&#8221;</b> since this hadeeth encourages that there be many people in the congregation. And holding the opinion that the congregations can be repeated in the masjid, by necessity, leads towards a minimization of the amount of people in the prescribed first congregation and a division of the Muslims&#8217; unity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is something else that requires careful examination. And it is that we must remember that the hadeeth of Ibn Mas&#8217;ood (raa) in Saheeh Muslim, similar to the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah (raa): <b>&#8220;I strongly desired to command a man and so he would lead the people in prayer.&#8221;</b> It was stated with respect to those who refrained from performing the Jumu&#8217;ah prayer. So when we know that Ibn Mas’ood (raa) placed a threat, of a specific type, on every person that refrains from attending the Jumu’ah and the congregational prayer, then we realize that these two prayers are with regard to their link to the congregation. For indeed, this threat means that there is to be no second congregation after any of these two prayers. Thus, the Jumu’ah prayer &#8211; until now &#8211; is preserved in its singularity and there is no opinion held stating that it is prescribed to have numerous (Jumu’ah) prayers in one masjid. All of the scholars, in spite of their differences agree on this. Due to this, we can see the masjids crowded with people on the day of Jumu’ah. And if it doesn’t escape out minds, we must remember that from the causes of the masjids being filled on the day of Jumu’ah is that there are those who attend Jumu’ah yet do not attend any of the other (regular) prayers. However, there is no doubt that the cause for the masjids being filled with people on the day of Jumu’ah is that the Muslims do not practice &#8211; and all praise is for Allaah &#8211; the act of repeating the Jumu’ah prayer (continuously) in the same masjid. So if the Muslims were to treat the congregational prayer like they treat the Jumu’ah prayer and like the way the matter was during the time of Allaah’s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam), the masjids would be filled with people. This is since every person that constantly prays in congregation will always have in his mind that if he misses the first congregation, he will not be able to attain it after that. So this belief will serve as an incentive for him to closely guard his attending of the congregational prayer. And the opposite is true also. If a Muslim holds inside that if he misses this first congregation, then he can always find a second one or a third one or sometimes even a tenth one, then this is from the things that weaken his enthusiasm and aspiration in attending the first congregation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are two things that remain before us:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First we must clarify that those who held the view that the second congregation, according to the particularization mentioned previously, was not legislated, and who said that doing it was disliked, they are the majority of the Imaams of the Salaf. Amongst them are the three Imaams &#8211; Abu Haneefah, Maalik and Ash-Shaafi’ee. Imaam Ahmad is also amongst them according to one report. However, this report is not well known amongst his followers today, even though one of his most specialized students, Abu Dawood As-Sijistaanee mentioned it. Thus, he reported from him in his book <i>Masaa’il Al-Imaam Ahmad</i> that he (Ahmad) said: &#8220;Repeating the congregational prayer in the two sacred masjids (i.e. of Makkah and Madinah) bears the highest level of disapproval (<i>kiraaha</i>).&#8221; So this, from the aspect of preference, indicates to us that there also exists the disapproval of repeating the congregations in other masjids as well. However, it (the level of disapproval) is more severe in the two (sacred) masjids. So in this report, Imaam Ahmad is in conformity with the other three Imaams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Secondly, the other report on Imaam Ahmad &#8211; the one which is more known to his students &#8211; he (rahimahullaah) and those interpreters who followed him, base their support for it on a hadeeth reported by At-Tirmidhee, Imaam Ahmad and others. It is the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudree, in which he said: <b>&#8220;A man entered the masjid when the Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) had already prayed and his Companions were gathered around him (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). This man wanted to pray, so the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: ‘Is there not a man who can give charity to this person by praying with him?’ So a man stood up and prayed with him.&#8221;</b> And in the report of Abu Bakr Al-Baihaqee, which is found in his Sunan Al-Kubraa, it is stated that this man was Abu Bakr As-Siddeeq. However, this report has weakness in its chain. The report that is authentic doesn’t name the man in it. So these (scholars) have used this hadeeth as evidence and say: &#8220;The Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) has approved of the second congregation!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The response to the use of this evidence is that we must consider that the congregation, which the hadeeth talks about, is not the same congregation that is being indicated in the question. This is since the congregation that the hadeeth refers to the congregation of a man who enters the masjid after the first congregation has finished and wants to pray alone. But the Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) incited those of his Companions who had prayed with him already to let one of them get up and volunteer and pray a voluntary prayer. So someone did it and that is the way it occurred. So this congregation consists of two people: The one leading the prayer (imaam) and the one being led (ma’moom). The Imaam is praying his obligatory prayer, while the ma’moom is praying a voluntary prayer. So who is the one who put this congregation together? If it were not for the one praying voluntarily, there would be no congregation. So therefore, this is a supererogatory and voluntary congregation, and not an obligatory congregation. And the differing (mentioned in the question) is only with regard to the second obligatory congregation. So due to this, using the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudree as evidence for this area of dispute is not correct. And what further confirms this is the fact that the hadeeth states: <b>&#8220;Is there not a man who can give charity to this person by praying with him?&#8221;</b> In this incident that occurred, there was someone who gave charity and there was someone who received charity. So if we were to ask a person with the least amount of knowledge and understanding: &#8220;Who is the one giving the charity and who is the one receiving the charity in this situation, which the Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) has approved of?&#8221; The answer would be: &#8220;The one giving the charity is the person praying the voluntary prayer, who had already prayed the obligatory prayer behind Allaah’s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam), while the one who is receiving the charity is the person who arrived late.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now if we were to throw this same question on the congregation that is in dispute right now: for example six or seven people enter the masjid, and find that the Imaam has already prayed. So one of them leads the prayer and the rest follow him in a second congregation. So who is the one giving the charity amongst these people? And who is the one receiving the charity? No one can give the same answer as in the first example. So this congregation (of people) that has entered after the Imaam finished praying, all of them are praying their obligatory prayer. There is no one giving charity, nor is there anyone receiving charity. On the contrary, this obscurity is quite obvious and clear in the first example. The one giving charity is the person who is praying the voluntary prayer, who already prayed behind Allaah’s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam). His prayer was recorded as twenty-seven levels (of reward). So because of that, he is rich and therefore able to give away in charity to others. And the one who leads the prayer &#8211; and if it were not for that person giving charity, he would have prayed alone &#8211; he is poor and in need for someone to give him charity. This is since he did not earn what the person who is giving him charity earned (from reward).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the reason for this person being the one giving the charity and that person being the one receiving the charity is clear. As for the scenario that is in dispute now, then the scenario is not clear, for all of the people (praying) are poor, since they have all missed out on the virtue of the first congregation. So the saying of Allaah’s Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) <b>&#8220;Is there not a man who can give charity to this person by praying with him&#8221;</b> doesn’t apply here. Therefore, in a situation like this, it is not valid to use this incident (mentioned in the hadeeth) as evidence. Nor can it be used in reference to this issue, which is the area of our discussion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We will link this to another evidence they use as proof, which is the Prophet’s (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) saying: <b>&#8220;Praying in the congregation is more virtuous than praying alone by twenty-seven degrees.&#8221;</b> So they use the generality (in the hadeeth) as evidence, meaning they understand that the word &#8220;the&#8221; before the word congregation is for a general inclusion (of all congregations). This means that (according to them) every congregational prayer is more virtuous than praying alone. We respond by saying, basing it on the previously mentioned evidences that &#8220;the&#8221; is not for a general inclusion, but rather it is for a specific designation. This means that the congregational prayer &#8211; which the Messenger (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) prescribed, incited towards, ordered the people to attend, threatened those who abandoned it with burning their houses and which those who abandoned it were described as being hypocrites &#8211; is the prayer in congregation that is more virtuous than praying alone. And it is the first congregational prayer. And Allaah, the Most High, knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Pulling someone back from the complete row to avoid praying alone</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">If you enter the masjid and the first row of prayer is complete, can you pull someone from it behind so that he can pray with you (in the second row) or should you just pray by yourself?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the hadeeth about pulling someone back from the first row so that one would not pray alone in the second row were authentic, it would be obligatory to base the opinion on it. However, its chain of narration is not authentic, as I have explained in <em>Irwaa-ul-Ghaleel</em> and <em>As-Silsilah Ad- Da&#8217;eefah</em> (second volume).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore so long as this hadeeth is not authentic, then the person who enters the masjid and the row of prayer in front of him is complete, he must try to squeeze into the row that is before him. This is possible in most cases, during this era in which a majority of Muslims have abandoned the act of joining tightly (by squeezing together) in the lines of prayer, for many of them do not stand close together in the lines of prayer. So if he finds that the row is complete, he should try his best to find an empty space in it, even if he has to gesture to the one he wants to pray next to, to make some space for him to enter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if he is not able to do this, either because the people in the row are closely packed together or because some of the people praying do not make room for him, then he could stand in the second row by himself, and his prayer will be valid. This is because the Prophet&#8217;s saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">There is no prayer for the one who prays in the row by himself</span>&#8221; is only in reference to the extent of one’s ability and adequacy to perform all the rest of the acts of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We know, for example, that standing for the obligatory prayer is a pillar (of the prayer). Therefore, if one prays sitting while he has the ability to stand, his prayer is not valid. However, if he is not able to stand, then he could pray sitting, as the Prophet, <em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, said: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">Pray standing. But if you are not able to, then sitting. But if you are not able to, then on your bed.</span>&#8221; This goes the same for the case of the individual who prays behind the row by himself, in that his condition is that he is not able to join into the row that is before him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the hadeeth, &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">There is no prayer for the one who prays alone behind the row</span>&#8220;, is most likely applicable to the person that takes this issue lightly or to the one who turns away from this legal ruling. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As has been done by many people, especially those <em>mu&#8217;addhins</em> who do not join into the rows, but rather pray by themselves in places near to the door (of the masjid). So these individuals are the ones whom the hadeeth is directed to</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the man who enters the masjid and tries to join into the row but is not able to, nor does anyone come that will join him (in the second row), then he can pray by himself. And Allaah does not burden a soul with a responsibility, except that He has given it the ability to fulfill the responsibility. And this is the view of Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The talk, Manners &amp; Ettiquetes that Every Muslim Should Display in the Masaajid (plural of masjid), was taken from a lecture given by our noble Sheikh, Abdur-Razaaq ibn Abdul-Muhsin al-Abbaad al-Badr, may Allah preserve both of them.</p>
</header>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger, sallallahu alaihi wasallam, informed us that,<br />
<em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The most beloved places to Allah on earth are the masaajid, and the most hated places to Allah on earth are the markets.</span></em>&#8221; (Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the benefits our sheikh has given is from this hadith is that the masaajid are distinguished for the acts of worship performed in them and the goodness they contain; the dhikr of Allah, salah, recitation of the Quran, spreading of the knowledge of the religion&#8230; just to name a few.  And the masaajid are places of sakeenah (tranquility).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, the market places are totally different.  There people deal with each other in bad ways, often you may find evil transactions taking place, and more than that.  Also the markets are a place of noise, rushing and running.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this talk, we cover the <strong>14 points of ettiquete regarding attending the masjid</strong>.<br />
Did you know that some of them take place even before you leave your home?<br />
So what are the manners and ettiquetes that are upon us to display in these beloved places?  Listen to find out more.</p>

<p>Q: Please inform us about the ruling on interlacing the hands in the Masjid (mosque).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">It is Makruh (reprehensible) for the Muslims to interlace their <strong>fingers</strong> when they <strong>go and wait for Salah (Prayer)</strong> and <strong>during Salah</strong> itself</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported about the Prophet (peace be upon him) that this act is Makruh. When people go to Salah, it means that they are regarded as if they are in Prayer. Thus, they should not interlace their fingers. Also, they should not do that in the Masjid waiting for Salah or during Salah itself, as this act is Makruh. After offering the Salah, there is nothing wrong with doing that even if they are still in the Masjid. It is authentically reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) that when he offered Taslim (salutation of peace ending the Prayer), he regarded Salah as completed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, he sat in the front of the Masjid and interlaced his fingers (peace be upon him). Thus, there is nothing wrong with interlacing the fingers after offering the Salah even if in the Masjid.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#003300;"><strong>When a person enters the Masjid (mosque) and finds people reciting Tashahhud, should he wait until they finish or should he join them in congregational Salah?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwa no. 4397<br />
<span style="color:#800000;">Q: Once I went to the Masjid (mosque) to offer `Asr (Afternoon) Prayer, and I found that they had finished three Rak`ahs (units of Prayer) and were in the Sujud (prostration) position of the fourth Rak`ah. In this case, should I join them or wait until they finish Salah?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: In this case, you should join them then complete Salah from the point where you joined them and make up for what you missed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>If you find that they have risen from the Ruku` (bowing) position of the last Rak`ah, then join them and make up for the parts you missed after the Imam recites Taslim (salutation of peace ending the Prayer)</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is due to what is related by Abu Dawud (may Allah be merciful with him) on the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) said, <span style="color:#008000;">&lt;&lt;When you come to prayer while we are prostrating ourselves, prostrate yourself and do not count it as one Rak`ah. Whoever catches a Rak`ah of the Prayer, in fact catches the Prayer&gt;&gt;</span>[1].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also because of the general meaning of what has been narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim (may Allah be merciful to them) on the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with them) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, <span style="color:#008000;">&lt;&lt;When the words of Iqamah are pronounced, do not come to (prayer) running, but go with tranquility, and pray what you are in time for, and complete what you have missed&#8230;&gt;&gt;<span style="color:#000000;">[2]</span></span></p>
<p>May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>
