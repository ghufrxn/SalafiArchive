<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">Allaah (The Most High) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِذَا نُودِيَ لِلصَّلَاةِ مِنْ يَوْمِ الْجُمُعَةِ فَاسْعَوْا إِلَىٰ ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ وَذَرُوا الْبَيْعَ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ خَيْرٌ لَكُمْ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center">فَإِذَا قُضِيَتِ الصَّلَاةُ فَانْتَشِرُوا فِي الْأَرْضِ وَابْتَغُوا مِنْ فَضْلِ اللَّهِ وَاذْكُرُوا اللَّهَ كَثِيرًا لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>”O you who believe (Muslims)! When the call is proclaimed for the <i>Salat</i> (prayer) on the day of Friday (<i>Jumu’ah</i> prayer), come to the remembrance of Allah [<i>Jumu’ah</i> religious talk (<i>Khutbah</i>) and <i>Salat</i> (prayer)] and leave off business (and every other thing), that is better for you if you did but know! Then when the (<i>Jumu’ah</i>) <i>Salat</i> (prayer) is finished, you may disperse through the land, and seek the Bounty of Allah (by working, etc.), and remember Allah much, that you may be successful.”</strong> </span>[Soorah Al-Jum’ah.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">And also from the business transactions that are forbidden is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Deceptive Sale, which is when you deceive your Muslim brother by selling him a product that has defects and you know about these defects yet you do not inform him about them</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this kind of sale is not permissible and it is from deception, swindling and fraud. It is obligatory on the seller to make these defects clear to the seller and to let him know about them. But if he fails to inform him about them, then this is from deception and swindling, which Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) forbade in his saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">The two persons conducting a business transaction are in a state of goodness for as long as they do not separate from one another. So if they are both honest and open with one another, they are blessed in their transaction. But if they lie and conceal (the truth) from one another, the blessing of their transaction is wiped out.</span>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory upon us, O servants of Allaah, to be sincere.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “The Religion is sincerity, the religion is sincerity, the religion is sincerity.” They (the Companions) said: “To who O Messenger of Allaah?” He said: “To Allaah, to His Book, to His Messenger, to the Muslim leaders and the Muslim general masses.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Muslim must be sincere. What is meant when one is sincere towards something is that he is free or absolved from certain things. So being sincere means being free from cheating (for example).</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">One time the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) passed by a person selling some food in the marketplace who had his food in a pile. So the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) put his noble hand inside the pile of food and found some wet portions in the bottom of the pile. So he said: “What is this O owner of the food?” He said: “The sky has affected it” – meaning the rain has damaged some of it. So Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Then won’t you make it visible so that the people can see it? Whoever cheats us (i.e. swindles Muslims) is not from us.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth is considered one of the fundamental principles in conducting business transactions between the Muslims. <strong>So it is not permissible for a Muslim to conceal the defects</strong>. If his merchandise has a defect then he must make it visible so that the buyer sees it and is aware of it, and so that he could acquire the item for a price that is appropriate for this defect. He must not acquire the item for the price it would be if it were flawless, for then the seller would be deceiving, cheating, fooling and swindling, based on the saying of Allaah’s Messenger: “Then won’t you make it visible so that the people can see it? Whoever cheats us is not from us.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So O servants of Allaah! How much of swindling do you see in these days? How many times do you see people placing the defective items in the bottom of the containers and cases while placing the good items on the top – whether vegetables or food items? They purposely put the defective item in the bottom while putting the flawless item on the top. This is trickery, which is done intentionally. We ask Allaah to pardon and forgive us and you, and that He make our rizq (sustenance) Halaal and that He make our earnings Halaal. And we ask Him to provide us from His vast Bounty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah suffice us with what You have made Halaal over that which You made Haraam, and (suffice us) with Your Bounty over that of others besides You. And forgive us, have mercy on us and accept our repentance. Verily, You are the One who accepts Repentance, the Bestower of Mercy. And may the peace and blessings of Allaah be on Allaah’s Messenger.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part A</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 – 1189 – From Abul-Darda who said: the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> came out to us while we were talking about poverty and we feared it. So the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Is it poverty that you fear?! I swear by Him in whose Hand is my life; the world will be excessively poured upon you, to the extent that one of your hearts will not excessively deviate except due to the <em>Dunyaa</em>. Verily I swear by Allaah that I indeed left you upon clarity, its night and day are equal.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul- Darda said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I swear by Allaah – that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> left us, – I swear by Allaah – upon clarity. Its night and day are equal.’</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 773</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – 1192 – From Mahmood bin Labeed from the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There are two things, which the son of Adam dislikes: he dislikes death, and death is better for a believer than <em>Fitna</em> (trials and tribulations).  He dislikes having a little wealth, however, having a little wealth is lesser in taking into account.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 813</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 – 1193 – From a man from the al-Ansaar who said: ‘we went with the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> for a funeral for a man from the Ansaar. When we had finished from it, we met a person who was inviting people for a woman of the Quraish, who said: ‘Indeed such and such woman invites you and those with you to have some food. So the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> went and sat down and we also sat down with him and the food was brought, the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>placed his hand in the food and the people placed their hands in the food.  They looked at the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>and the food was in his mouth but he did not swallow the food, so they moved their hands away so they could see what the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> was going to do. Then the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> took that morsel of food and spat it out and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I find that the meat of this sheep was taken without permission of its owner, feed it to the prisoners.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 754</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 – 1194 – From Abu Humaid as-Sa’idee who said: the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Be comprehensive in your search / seeking for the <em>Dunyaa</em>; since everyone is created for what is easy for him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 898</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 – 1196 – From Mus’ab bin Sa’ad who said: the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 910</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7 – 1197 – From Zeyaad bin al-Hussain, from his father Hussain bin Qayys that he carried some food to Madinah, and he met the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘What are you carrying O Bedouin?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘Wheat.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘What do you intend to do with this?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied: ‘I intend to sell it; and the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> stroked my head and said:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Go out and cut fruit from your date tree, perhaps you will give <em>Sadaqah</em> from it or you will do some good.’</p>

SOURCE: His book &#8220;Al-Buyoo&#8217; al-Munhee &#8216;anhaa&#8221; (pg. 21-24) (<a title="Forbidden Business Transactions :  Shaikh Saalih Al-Fawzaan" href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2014/01/27/forbiddenbusiness/"><strong>Read the full eBook here</strong></a>)<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. And from the forbidden types of business transactions is: <b>The ‘Aynah Transaction.</b> What is the ‘Aynah Transaction? It is when a product is sold to a person for a deferred price (i.e. a raised price to be paid later), then that same product is bought back from him at current value less than the deferred price for which it was given to him. So when the time comes in which the deferred payment is due, he pays his creditor in full. This is what is known as an Al-‘Aynah Transaction. It is called<i>‘aynah</i> (i.e. derivate of <i>‘ayn</i> = same) because the same product that was sold is returned back to its owner. This is Haraam because it is deceiving someone into interest (Ribaa).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In reality, it is as if you are selling dollars at the current price for deferred dollars (i.e. to be given later), which are more than the original amount. And you have are just using the product as a device or means to gaining this interest. [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is an obligation on you if you are owed money by someone, because you sold him some product for a deferred price that you let him sell it to someone else, or that you let him act freely in the matter – if he wishes he can keep it or if he wishes he can sell it to someone else, if he is need of the money. The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“When you deal with al-‘aynah transactions and you hold onto the tails of cows and you are pleased with the agriculture, Allaah will send humiliation down upon you. He will not remove it from you until you return back to your Religion.”</b> Reported by Abu Dawood and it has supporting evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. And from the forbidden types of business transactions is: <b>An-Najash.</b> What is meant by an-Najash is when you display a product for sale in a public auction. Then a person comes and bids up the price of the item, but he doesn’t intend to purchase the item, rather he only wants to raise the price for the customers intending to deceive the buyers. This is the same whether he agreed with the seller to do this or he did it on his own. So whoever bids for a product and he doesn’t want to buy it, rather he only wants to raise its price for the customers, then this person is a Naajish, who has opposed the prohibition of Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>). Doing this is Haraam, as the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“And do not perform Najash on each other.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a person who has no desire or need for the item, he should not participate in the auction and not bid for it. Instead, he should leave the customers, who really desire the item, to outbid each other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps a person may want to help the seller, and sympathy for the seller overcomes him. So he bids up the price of the item for the purpose of helping the seller – according to his perception. Or perhaps, the seller may agree with a group of his associates to create a crowd around the item for sale in order to draw the people’s attention. This is considered Najash and it is Haraam because it is a means of deceiving the Muslims and a way of taking their money unjustly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, the scholars of Fiqh have stated that what falls under Najash is when a seller tells his customer: “I bought this item for such and such price”, lying about the price, so that the buyer may be fooled and buy the item at an increased value.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or it is when the seller says: “I was given this product at this price” or he says: “I received it for this much”, lying about the price. He only wants to fool the customers into bidding the price up to reach this alleged and false price, which he claims he spent for the item. This is from the Najash, which Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) forbade. It is a treachery and deception of the Muslims, and it is liying and disloyalty, for which he will be accountable for before Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is obligatory on the seller is that he reveals the truth if the buyer asks him how much he got it for. He must tell him the truth and not say that he attained it for this much money, lying about the price. What also falls into the definition of An-Najash is if the people of the marketplace or the storeowners agree to not outbid one another when an item is presented for sale, for the purpose of forcing the owner to sell it for a (discounted) cheaper price. Sp therefore, they are all participating in this act, which is Haraam. And this is from An-Najash. It is also a form of taking the people’s money unjustly.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b class="Marker">Footnotes:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="Footnotes">[1] <b>Translator’s Note:</b> Another example is if you sell an item that is worth $25 to someone for $50 because he will pay you next month and not now. But for some reason, the buyer is short of money and wants to sell the book back to you, so he comes to you the next day and you make him sell it to you for the current market price, which is still $25. So when the date, next month, on which you agreed he would pay you the $50 comes, he pays you the money. So altogether you make $25 apart from the book, which is considered interest, and Allaah knows best.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Shaikh Saalih Al-Fawzaan<br />
SOURCE: His book &#8220;Al-Buyoo&#8217; al-Munhee &#8216;anhaa&#8221; (pg. 12-15)<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. And from the forbidden types of business is: Selling a forbidden commodity. This is because when Allaah makes something forbidden, He also makes taking money for it forbidden, such as when someone sells something that is forbidden to be sold. Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) forbade that dead animals, khamr (i.e. wine), swine and statues be sold So whoever sells dead animals, i.e. meat for which no prescribed Zakaat was given, then he has sold a dead animal and earned unlawful money.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This goes the same for selling khamr. What is meant by the word khamr is everything that intoxicates, based on the Prophet’s saying: <b>“Every intoxicant is khamr and every kind of khamr is Haraam (unlawful).”</b> And he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) cursed ten people with regard to khamr, as is recorded in the authentic hadeeth: <b>“Verily Allaah cursed khamr – the one who produces it and the one for whom it is produced, the one who sells it and the one who buys it, the one who drinks it and the one who earns from the sale of it, the one who carries it and the one who it is carried to, and the one who serves it.”</b> Reported by At-Tirmidhee and Ibn Maajah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Khamr is every type of intoxicant regardless of whether it is called khamr or alcoholic beverages or liquor or wine or whiskey. It doesn’t matter if it is called by any of these or other names – changing the name does not change the fact that it is khamr. It has been reported in a hadeeth that <b>”There will come a people during the Last Days that will call khamr by another name and drink it.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, what is worse than this is selling narcotics, such as <b>hasheesh and opium</b>, as well as other types of drugs, which are being dealt out to the people in these days. So the one who sells it and deals it is a criminal in the eyes of the Muslims and in the eyes of the whole world. This is because drugs kill people, so it is like a destructive weapon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, anyone who sells drugs or distributes it or assists in its distribution – all of them fall under the curse of Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>). And taking money from it is from the wickedest of acts and the most detestable of gains. Furthermore, the one who deals drugs deserves to be executed because he is one of those who cause mischief in the land.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same goes for selling <b>cigarettes and qaat</b> (leaves that are chewed in Arabian lands). Cigarettes are harmful and they cause diseases to occur. In fact, all of the characteristics of <i>khubth</i>(wickedness) are gathered together in cigarettes. There is no benefit in smoking in any way whatsoever. Its harms are many. The one with the worst kind of breath, the most despicable appearance and the most burdensome to accompany out of all people is the one who smokes cigarettes. If he sits next to you or he rides next to you in a car or on a plane, you feel constricted by the smoke he makes and its foul stench. The odor coming from his mouth is bad enough when he breathes in your face, so how much more so if he were to smoke in your presence and the cigarette smoke were to float in your face! The matter would be worse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So smoking is wicked from all perspectives and there isn’t any benefit found in it. Therefore, it is forbidden without any hesitation or doubt. It is unlawful to smoke based on several perspectives, not just one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When one smokes, he throws money away and he wastes time. Cigarettes disfigure the face, blacken the lips and stain the teeth. As for the diseases that are caused by it, then they are many.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many people have been afflicted by it and yet they take it lightly and as something trivial. This is even to the point that some are suffering from its effects even though they never smoked and they hate smoking. However, they sold it to people because they loved to make money any way they could. But these people don’t know that this type of business spoils all of their earnings, because some of them mix the money they make from it with their business and so they spoil it, since (doing this) is forbidden and disobedience (to Allaah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sustenance is not to be sought from Allaah through disobeying Him. Rather, sustenance and provision are to be sought from Allaah by way of obeying Him. Whatever Allaah has ordained for you from <i>rizq</i> (sustenance) will surely come to you. If you seek after it while being obedient to Allaah (in all that He commands and prohibits), He will facilitate it for you and bless your wealth.</p>

Chapter 355<br />
Prohibition of Malpractices in Commerce</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1775.</b> Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) forbade that a person in the city should make a deal on behalf of a villager on commission even if he is his real brother</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1776.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do not meet the merchandise till they arrive in the market</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1777.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The caravans carrying merchandise should not be met on the way to purchase from them; a man in the city should not sell for a man of the desert.</span>&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tawus asked him (Ibn `Abbas): &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">What do these words really imply?</span>&#8221; He said<span style="color:#008000;">: &#8220;He should not work as an agent on his behalf.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1778.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) forbade that a man in the city should be the commission agent of a man from the desert and prohibited the practice of Najsh (i.e., offering a high price for something in order to allure another customer who is interested in the thing); and that a man should make an offer while the offer of his brother is pending; or that he should make a proposal of marriage while that of his brother is pending; or that a woman should try that a sister of hers might be divorced so that she might take her place</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">     Another narration is: <span style="color:#008000;">The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) forbade the people from meeting the caravan on the way for entering into business transaction with them; and the selling of the goods by a dweller of the city on behalf of a man of the desert; and the seeking by a woman the divorce of her sister (from her husband); and the practice of Najsh and leaving the animals unmilked (for sometime for the purpose of accumulation of milk to deceive the buyer)</span>.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1779.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">A person should not enter into a transaction when his (Muslim) brother has already negotiated, nor should he make a proposal of marriage when that of his brother is pending, except with the permission of the latter</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1780.</b> `Uqbah bin `Amir (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">A Mu&#8217;min is the brother of another Mu&#8217;min; and thus it is not permissible for a Mu&#8217;min to make an offer while the offer of his brother is pending, nor should he make a proposal of marriage while that of his brother is pending till he withdraws his proposal</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>

&#8220;<span style="color:#ff0000;">Verily, those who purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah&#8217;s Covenant and their oaths, they shall have no portion in the Hereafter.

[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1713.</b> Abu Umamah Iyas bin Tha`labah Al-Harithi (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who misappropriates the right of a Muslim by taking a false oath, Allah will condemn him to the fire of Hell and will forbid Jannah for him.</span>&#8221; A person asked: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, even if it is something insignificant?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Yes, even if it is the twig of the Arak tree</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1714.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-As (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Of the major sins are: Associating anything in worship with Allah, disobedience to the parents, killing without justification and taking a false oath (intentionally).</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>

Excellence of Fair Bargaining and Matters Relation to it</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And whatever you do of good deeds, truly, Allah knows it well.&#8221;</b></span><b> (2:215)</b></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Woe to Al-Mutaffifun (those who give less in measure and weight). Those who, when they have to receive by measure from men, demand full measure. And when they have to give by measure or weight to (other) men, give less than due. Do they not think that they will be resurrected (for reckoning). On a Great Day? The Day when (all) mankind will stand before the Rubb of the `Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists)?&#8221;</b></span><b> (83:1-6)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1367.</b>  Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A man demanded of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) for repayment of a loan and was harsh to him. His Companions were about to attack him, but he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Leave him, as the creditor is entitled to make a demand. Give him a camel of the same age as the camel that is due to him.</span>&#8221; They said: &#8220;We find a better camel senior to it in age.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Then buy it and give it to him; verily the best of you is the one who is the best in discharging his obligations (repayment of loans</span>).&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1368.</b>   Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">May Allah show mercy to a man who adopts a kind attitude when he sells, buys and demands for the repayment of loans</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>

[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1370.</b>  Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">There was a person who used to loan money to the people and he used to say to his servant: `When an insolvent person comes to you, show him leniency so that Allah may forbear our faults.&#8217; So when he met Allah (i.e., when he died), Allah forgave him</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1371.</b>  Abu Mas`ud Al-Badri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">A person from amongst the people who lived before you was called to account by Allah on the Day of Resurrection. No good deeds were found in his credit except that he being a rich man had (financial) dealings with people and had commanded his servants to show leniency to those who were in straitened circumstances. Upon this Allah, the Exalted, and Majestic said: `I am more entitled to this attribute, so waive (his faults)</span>.&#8221;&#8217;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1372.</b>  Hudhaifah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">A slave of Allah whom He had endowed with wealth, will be brought before Him. Allah will ask him: `What did you do in the world?&#8217; (They cannot conceal anything from Allah.) He will say: `O my Rubb, You endowed me with Your wealth; I used to enter into transactions with people and it was my nature to be lenient to the insolvent ones. I used to give respite to those who were in straitened circumstances.&#8217; Whereupon Allah will say: `I am more entitled than you to do this. So forgive my slave</span>&#8216;.&#8221; `Uqbah bin `Amir and Abu Mas`ud Al-Ansari (May Allah be pleased with them) said, &#8220;Thus we heard it from the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam).&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1373.</b>   Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who gives respite to someone who is in straitened circumstances, or grants him remission, Allah will shelter him in the shade of His Throne, on the Day of Resurrection, when there will be no shade except its shade</span>.&#8221;<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 10: </font></p>
<p></a></em>    </p>
<h3 align="center"><font><em>The Book of Transactions (Kitab  Al-Buyu`) </em></font>    </h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><br /></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Honesty in commercial dealings is more strictly enjoined by  Islam than by any other religion. It is because Islam is a religion which regulates and  directs life in all its departments. It is not to be regarded, like the modern man&#8217;s  religion. as a personal, private affair, which has nothing to do with his economic and  political life. It is not merely a body of dogmas or a bundle of rites and rituals; it is  a practical code which governs life in all its spheres. Its laws are as effectively  operative in our commerce and politics as in our domestic life and social relations. Islam  censures political chicanery and economic exploitation as strongly as social excesses and  individual dishonesty. Indeed, a true Islamic society is based upon honesty, justice and  fraternity, and is absolutely intolerant of dishonesty in all its various forms. That is  the reason why perfect honesty in business and truthfulness in trade are much emphasised  by the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him). It will not be an exaggeration to say that  absolute honesty in business and commerce is really an Islamic concept. The Hindus and  Jews were (and still, are) worshippers of the Mammon. Both of them have been mercenary  nations, notorious for their greed. The pre-Islamic Christians. too, did not possess any  high standard of business morality. It was Prophet Muhammad (may peace be upon him) who,  on the one hand, urged his followers to adopt trade as their profession, and, on the other  band, exhorted them to observe truthfulness and honesty in their business transactions. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Islam lays the greatest emphasis on Qat Haldl (food earned  through lawful means). The pious among us believe that just as nasty food spolis our  physical health, similarly. food earned through unlawful means spoils our spiritual and  moral health. A man who liver on income derived through illicit means and fraudulent  practices cannot be morally advanced and spiritually elevated. If we try to comprehend the  exact, implications of the term Haram (unlawful) we can form an idea of the high standard  of morality on which Islam wants us to conduct our business. And, if business is conducted  strictly in accordance with the Islamic principles of commerce, there can be absolutely no  scope for any kind of commercial dishonesty varying from the simplest and most glaring  type of business fraud to the most cunning and subtle type of profiteering which is often  masked under a semblance of honesty. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Islam is most vehement in its condemnation of commercial  dishonesty. It denounced, in the strongest possible terms, all sorts of deceitful dealings  and illegal profits. It has disallowed all transactions not based upon justice and  fairplay The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him), while reprimanding the dishonest  dealer, said:&#8221; Laisa minna man gashshdna&#8221; (Whosoever deceives us is not one of  us). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>According to Imam Ghazali, a Muslim who makes up his mind  to adopt trade as a profession or to set up his own business should first acquire a  thorough understanding of the rules of business transactions codified in the Islamic  Shari&#8217;ah. Without such understanding he will go astray and fail into serious lapses making  his earning unlawful. No people in the world have ever attached so much importance to  lawful trading as did the early Muslims, nor has any other nation evinced such a dread of  unlawful trading as they did. That is why al-Ghazali said stress on a clear understanding  of the rules and laws governing business transactions as a necessary prerequisite to  adopting trade or business as a profession. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Holy Qur&#8217;an has stressed the importance of fairness in  business:&#8221; And, O my people, give full measure and weight justly, and defraud not men  of their things, and act not corruptly in the land making mischief. What remains with  Allah is better for you, if you are believers&#8221; (xi. 85-86). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In these words addressed by Hadrat Shu&#8217;aib to his people,  the Holy Qur&#8217;an enunciates the fundamental principles of commerce as follows </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>To give just measure and weight. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Not to withhold from the people the things that are their  due. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Not to commit evil on the earth with the intent of doing  mischief. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>To be contented with the profit that is left with us by God  after we have paid other people their due. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We are told in these verses that commerce can flourish  under conditions of peace and security. The people are, therefore, warned not to disturb  the peace of the land so that there is a free and untrammelled trade between different  parts of the world. In commercial relations we are expected to be absolutely just and  honest, liberally giving other people their due. We are not to be guilty of selfish greed  and not to indulge in profiteering; and we are told that the lawful profit which has God&#8217;s  blessings is the one that we are able to make through perfectly honest dealings with  others. The injunctions contained in these Qur&#8217;anic verses and found elsewhere in the Holy  Book close the door of all dishonest and unjust transactions. We should not forget that  justice is a master virtue. If we give others just measure and just weight that  tantamounts to saying that we should be fair and just in our dealings. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A careful study of&#8221; Kitab al-Buyu`&#8221; (the book  pertaining to business transactions) will reveal the fact that the Holy Prophet (may peace  be upon him) based business dealings strictly on truth and justice. He has strongly  disapproved all transactions which involve any kind of injustice or hardship to the buyer  or the seller. He wanted that both, the buyer and the seller, should be truly sympathetic  and considerate towards each other. One should not take undue advantage of the simplicity  or ignorance of the other. The seller should not think that he has unrestricted liberty to  extort as much as possible from the buyer. He has to be just; he should take his own due  and give the buyer what is his. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Islam, which condemns every kind of injustice and  exploitation in human relations, wants its followers to conduct business in a sublime  spirit of justice tempered with human kindness. The conduct of the seller in a transaction  should be characterised not only by Insaf (justice), but also by Ihsan  (magnanimity).&#8221; God will forgive the sins of a Muslim who absolves a fellow-Muslim  from a sale-contract not liked by the latter,&#8221; says the Holy Prophet (may peace be  upon him). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>All transactions should be based on the fundamental  principle of&#8221; Ta&#8217;auanu ala birri wa&#8217;t-taqwa&#8221; (mutual co-operation for the cause  of goodness or piety). A transaction not based upon this sound principle is not lawful.  Unlawful transactions are motivated by lust for money and an ignoble desire to build up  prestige. Islam strikes at the root of the passion for money and suggests a different  yardstick to measure the prestige of a person. The Holy Qur&#8217;an, on the one hand, condemns  hoarding and the excessive love for wealth, and, on the other, declares virtue and piety  to be the criterion for determining a person&#8217;s worth.&#8221; Inna akramakum `ind-Allahi  atqakum&#8221; (The noblest in the eyes of God is the most pious among you). Thus does  Islam minimise in every possible way the temptation to illegal trade and traffic. Let us  now take note of the forms of business transactions which have been prohibited in Islam.  The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) has not only disapproved of certain forms of  business transactions, but has also laid down some basic conditions that should be  fulfilled in every transaction if it is to be lawful. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The following are some of these basic conditions: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Things sold and money offered as their price to be lawfully  acquired. The things sold and the money to be offered as their price should both be  lawfully acquired and clearly specified. This condition demands that the goods sold should  have been lawfully obtained. One has no business to sell goods which one has stolen or  which one has acquired in a fraudulent manner. nor should one purchase anything with the  money which one has accepted as illegal gratification or has aceuired in some other  deceitful way. This condition holds the buyer and the seller responsible for lawful  possession of the goods on the partof one and of the money on the part of other. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Goods not to be sold before obtaining their possession. The  Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) has warned the Muslims against indulging in forward  transactions which means selling goods before obtaining their possession.&#8221; Whoever  buys cereals shall not tell them until he has obtained their possession,&#8221; says the  Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him). According to Ibn &#8216;Abbas, what applies to cereals  also applies to other categories of goods. On another occasion the Holy Prophet (may peace  be upon him) has said:&#8221; Bargain not about that which is not with you.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Goods to be bought in the open market. Goods and  commodities for sale should go into the open market, and the seller or his agents must be  aware of the state of the market before proposals are made for the purchase by the buyers.  The seller should not be taken unawares lest the buyers should take undue advantage of his  ignorance of the conditions and prices prevailing in the market. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>No trade and traffic in things, the use of which is  prohibited by Islam. A Muslim can trade in those goods and commodities only the use of  which has been declared to be Halal (lawful). There can be no trade and traffic in things  the use of which is proliibited by Islam. For example, there can be no trade in wine,  swine, dead bodies of animals and idols. A devout Muslim merchant would not even traffic  in thin and transparent stuff for ladies because the use of such stuff by ladies is  unlawful. One cannot sell the carcass of an animal. He can, however, flay its skin which  can be used for making shoes and which can therefore, be sold, but not the flesh of the  dead animal. What is true of the usable skin of animals is also true of the tusks of an  elephant. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Prohibited forms of Business </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Monopoly business. As monopoly means concentration of  supply in one hand, it leads to exploitation of the consumers and the workers, it has,  therefore, been declared unlawful by the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him). Gigantic  trusts. cartels and monopolies should not exist in the Islamic society. The  monopoly-dominated economic order betrays lack of harmony between private and social good  and is, thus, a negation of the principle of maximum social advantage which the Islamic  society sets out to achieve. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Speculative business basd on selfish interest. Speculation  means buying something cheap in bulk at a time and selling it dear at another and, thus,  controlling the whole market to achieve personal gains. A close observation will reveal  that speculators are primarily interested in private gains regardless of the larger  interest of the society. These speculators try to create artificial scarcity of goods and  commodities and thereby create an inflationary pressure on the economy. As the poor masses  have to pay for this. Islam has condemned such speculative business. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Interest transactions. All transactions involving interest  are forbidden in Islam. Some people find it hard to submit to the injunction prohibiting  interest, because they think interest and profit earned in trade are similar. Capital  invested in trade brings an excess called profit; invested in banking it brings interest.  Why should one excess be considered lawful and the other unlawful? They fail to take note  of the basic difference between the two. Trade involves risk of loss. Also in its case, it  is not only the capital invested that brings profit which is equally the result of  initiative, enterprise and efficiency of the entrepreneur. Hence its rate cannot be  predetermined and fixed. Moreover, trade is productive. A person reaps a benefit after  undergoing labour and hardship. It creates conditions of full employment and economic  growth. It will also be noted that trade acts as one of the dominant factors in the  process of building up civilisation through co-operation and mutual exchange of ideas. The  spread of Islam and Islamic civilisation In the Far East has been mostly due to the  efforts of Muslim traders. Interest has no redeeming feature at all. The fixed rate of  profit which a person gets from a financial investment without any risk of loss and  without augmenting it with human labour creates in man the undesirable weakness of  miserliness and Shylockian selfishness and lack of sympathy. In the economic sphere it  initiates and aggravates crisis. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Rightly, therefore, has Islam strictly prohibited all  transactions based on it or involving it in some form or other. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Advancing money on interest, keeping deposits in a bank for  the sake of earning interest, or getting concessions in rates of goods or commodities  against advance payments of price, mortgaging and utilising an income-yielding property  against a certain sum, to be returned in full when the property is redeemed and investing  money in a trade against a predetermined and fixed rate of profit-are all unlawfnl  business transactions because they involve Riba (interest) in some form or the other. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Transactions similar (in nature) to gambling. The Arabic  equivalent to gambling is Maisir which literarily means&#8221; getting something too  easily&#8221;,&#8221; getting a profit without working for it&#8221;. The literal meaning of  the term explains the principle on account of which gambling is prohibited in Islam. Any  monetary gain which cornes too easily, so much so that one does not have to work for it,  is unlawful. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The most familiar form of gambling amang the Arabs in the  days of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) was gambling by casting of lots by means  of arrows drawn from a bag. Some were blank and those who drew them got nothing. Others  indicated prizes-big or small ones. Whether one got anything or nothing depended on pure  luck. unless there was fraud on the part of someone concerned. The principle on which  objection to gambling is based is that you gain what you have not earned, or lose on a  mere chance. Dice, lottery, prize bonds and betting on horse races are to be held within  the definition of gambling. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Munabadha and Mulamasa. Islam recognises barter trade  subject to the injunctions of the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah. In fact, Islam has closed all  doors of dishonesty and deceit in business dealings. It has prohibited all forms of  transactions which admit of fraud in the least degree. It has impressed on the traders  that defective and worthless goods should not be given in exchange for good ones, and if  there is a defect in the goods sold it must be pointed out and made manifest to the  purchaser. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said:&#8221; The buyer and the  seller have the option of cancelling the contract as long as they have not separated;  then. if they both speak the truth and make manifest, their transaction shall be blessed,  and it they conceal and tell lies, the blessing of their transaction shall be  obliterated&#8221;. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Besides issuing the instructions which govern all forms of  trade, particularly barter trade, Islam has banned two forms of sale contract that were  prevalent before Islam. These were Munabadha and Mulamasa. In neither of these was the  purchaser offered an opportunity to examine the thing purchased. Munabadha means that the  seller should throw the cloth to the buyer before he has carefully examined it. The very  act of throwing the cloth will mean that the bargain has been struck. Mulamasa means  touching the cloth without examining it, ie. the buyer was just supposed to touch the  cloth to strike the bargain. Both these forms of transaction were prohibited because in  either case the purchaser got no opportunity to examine the things sold to him, and the  bargain was likely to prove unduly disadvantageous to one side. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In fact, Islam demanlds that goods and commodities for we  should go to the open market and the seller or his agents must be aware of the state of  the market before proposals are made for the purchase of goods or communities in bulk. He  should not be taken unawares lest advantage be taken of his ignorance of the state of the  market, and the prevailing prices. All this is ver clearly laid down by the Prophet (may  peace he upon him). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>As mentioned above, Islam tries to be fair to both parties  to a transaction. Any step on the part of one, that is advantageous to him and  disadvantageous to the other, is not permissible. The seller is expected to make the  defects (if any) in the goods manifest to the buyer, nor is the buyer expected to take  undue advantage of the ignorance of the seller. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Mozabana. It is the exchange of fresh fruits for dry ones  in a way that the quantity of the dry fruit is actually measured and fixed, but the  quantity of the fresh fruit to be given in exchange is guessed while it is still on the  trees (Mishkat, 2710). The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) has forbidden this  exchange because the quantity of the fruit on the trees cannot be definitely Determined  and the transaction is just a leap into the dark. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Mu&#8217;awama. It consists in selling the fruit on the trees for  a period of one, two or three years even before it has made its appearance. It is  prohibited because like Muzabana it is also a leap into the dark. Such transactions may  result in bitterness and frustration. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Bai&#8217; al-Gharar. It is to sell a thing which one doesn&#8217;t  have in one&#8217;s possession, nor expects to bring it under one&#8217;s control, e g. fish in the  river, or birds in the air. Possession is one of the basic conditions of a sale. One  cannot sell a thing which is not in one&#8217;s possession. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Bai&#8217; al-&#8216;Uryan. It is getting a thing against a nominal  advance on the condition that if the bargain is struck, the advance will be adjusted and  if the bargain is cancelled, the seller will riot return the advance. The advance being  nominal, the buyer has practically no liability. He will abide by the contract if he finds  it advantageous to him and will withdraw himself from it otherwise. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Bai&#8217; al-Mudtar. It is to buy a thing forcibly or to  purchase a thing when its owner is compelled under stress of want to dispose it of.  Instead of purchasing the thing, and taking undue advantage of the seller&#8217;s helplessness,  one should help him. Bai&#8217; alal-Bai&#8217; (sale over and above the sale of another). When one  person has sold goods to another, a third Person should not upset the bargain trying to  sell his own goods to the latter, offering them at lower rates or pointing out the defect  in the goods already sold to him by the former.&#8221; A Muslim should not purchase in  opposition to his brother, nor should he send a marriage proposal over and above the  proposal of another.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Bai&#8217; al-Hast (i. e. sale by means of pebbles). The  purchaser will tell the seller that when he will throw a pebble on his goods, the sale  contract will be confirmed or the seller tell the purchaser that on whatever thing a  pebble thrown by him falls will be sold to him. Sale contract is a serious matter and it  should not be accomplished by such hit-and-miss methods like throwing the pebbles on the  goods. A sale completed in this way may lead to injustice and hardship to one side and is  consequently prohibited. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Sale of unripe fruit and unripe corn. The Holy Prophet (may  peace be upon him), according to Hadrat Anas (Allah be pleased with him), has prohibited  the sale of grapes before they become dark and that of the corn before it ripens.  Similarly, he has forbidden the sale of raw dates. The fruit of the date palms should not  be sold until it becomes red or yellow. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Here is a brief account of the sale transactions prohibited  by Islam. If one ponders over these forms of transaction described above and described in  greater detail in&#8221; Kitab al-Buyu,&#8221; one can arrive at the following conclusions: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Islam insists upon absolute justice and fairplay in  business dealings. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>According to Islam, a person who sacrifices his faith, and  loses the good pleasure of his Lord to make a monetary gain has not made a good bargain. A  Muslim will not go in for such a bad bargain. A Muslim merchant is not a worshipper of the  Mammon with an inordinate love for money. He prizes faith, piety and righteousness above  all. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Islam does not believe in the view that all is fair in  business and that every kind of cleverness and deceit is justifiable in business  transactions. Islam regards business or commerce as an economic activity to be carried on  in a spirit of humanity. tarianism and justice. It does not approve of the cut-throat  competition. Indeed, the very concept is un-Islamic. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Islam expects the buyer and the seller to look upon each  other as Muslim brethren or fellow human beings, each trying to go all his way to help and  serve the other. It the seller happens to overcharge the buyer, he, instead of feeling  proud of his cleverness in doing so, should somehow compensate him for the excessive  payment received. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>All bargains that are clenched without giving the purchaser  a fair chance of examining the things are prohibited because this amounts to denying him a  right that was his due. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Forcible transactions or transactions in which the buyer  takes undue. advantage of the helplessness or misery of the seller are also discouraged. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Islam has prohibited traffic in wine, swine, dead bodies of  animals and other goods the use of which has been declared to be Haram (unlawful). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>It has also forbidden trading in things that have a  debasing or vitiating influence on the Muslim society. </font></p>

He said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be    upon him) got himself cupped. His cupper was Abu Taiba and he (the Holy Prophet) commanded    to give him two sa&#8217;s of corn. He (the Holy Prophet) talked with the members of his family    and they lightened the burden of Kharaj (tax) from him (i. e. they made remis- sion in the    charges of their own accord). He (Allah&#8217;s Apostle) said: The best (treat- ment) which you    take is cupping, or it is the best of your treatments.</font></p>

He (my partner) came to me and informed me,    and I said to him: Such transaction is not desirable. He said: I sold it in the market (on    loan) but nobody objected to this. I went to al-Bara&#8217; b. &#8216;Azib and asked him, and he said:    Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) came to Medina and we made such transaction,    whereupon he said: In case the payment is made on the spot, there is no harm in it, and in    case (it is &#8216;sold) on loan, it is usury. You better go to Zaid b. Arqam, for he is a    greater trader than I; so I went to him and asked him, and he said like it.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Jabir b. &#8216;Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported    that he was travelling on his camel which had grown jaded, and he decided to let it off.    When Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) met him and prayed for him and struck it, so    it trotted as it had never trotted before. He said: Sell it to me for an &#8216;uqaya. I said:    No. He again said: Sell it to me. So I sold it to him for an &#8216;uqaya, but made the    stipulation that I should be allowed to ride back to my family. Then when I came to (my    place) I took the camel to him and he paid me its price in ready money. I then went back    and he sent: (someone) behind me (and as I came) he said: Do you see that I asked you to    reduce price for buying your camel. Take your camel and your coins; these are yours.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Jabir b. &#8216;Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported: I    went on an expedition with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). He overtook me and I    was on a water-carrying camel who had grown tired and did not walk (trot). He (the Holy    Prophet) said to me: What is the matter with your camel? I said: It is sick. He (the Holy    Prophet) stepped behind and drove it and prayed for it, and then it always moved ahead of    other camels. He (then) said: How do you find your camel? I said: It is, by the grace of    your prayer, all right. He said: Would you sell this (camel) to me? I felt shy (to say    him,&#8221; No&#8221; ) as we had no other camel for carrying water, but (later on) I said:    Yes, and to I sold it to him on the condition that (I would be permitted) to ride it until    I reached Madina. I said to him: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, I am newly married, so I asked his    permission (to go ahead of the caravan). He permitted me, and I reached Medina well in    advance of other people, until I reached my destination. There my maternal uncle met me    and asked me about the camel, and I told him what I had done with regard to it. He    reproved me in this connection. He (Jabir) said: When I asked his permission (to go ahead    of the caravan) Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) inquired of me whether I had    married a virgin or a non-virgin. I said to him: I have married a non-virgin. He said: Why    did you not marry a virgin who would have played with you and you would have played with    her? I said to him: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, my father died (or he fell as a martyr), and I have    small sisters to (look after), so I did not like the idea that I should marry a woman who    is like them and thus be not able to teach them manners and look after them properly. So I    have married a non-virgin so that she should be able to look after them and teach them    manners, When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to Medina, I went to him in    the morning with the camel. He paid me its price and returned that (the camel) to me.</font></p>

I said: Then give me an &#8216;uqaya of gold for I owe that to a person and then it would be    yours. He (the Holy Prophet) said: I take it (for an &#8216;uqiya of gold) and you reach Medina    on it. As I reached Medina, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to Bilal: Give    him an &#8216;uqiya of gold and make some extra payment too.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave a verdict regarding Shuf&#8217;a in every  undivided joint thing (property). But if the limits are defined (or demarcated) or the  ways and streets are fixed, then there is no pre-emption. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>You people say that Abu Huraira tells many narrations from  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and you also wonder why the emigrants and Ansar do not narrate from  Allah&#8217;s Apostle as Abu Huraira does. My emigrant brothers were busy in the market while I  used to stick to Allah&#8217;s Apostle content with what fills my stomach; so I used to be  present when they were absent and I used to remember when they used to forget, and my  Ansari brothers used to be busy with their properties and I was one of the poor men of  Suffa. I used to remember the narrations when they used to forget. No doubt, Allah&#8217;s  Apostle once said, &#8220;Whoever spreads his garment till I have finished my present  speech and then gathers it to himself, will remember whatever I will say.&#8221; So, I  spread my colored garment which I was wearing till Allah&#8217;s Apostle had finished his  saying, and then I gathered it to my chest. So, I did not forget any of that narrations. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibrahim bin Sad from his father from his  grand-father: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abdur Rahman bin Auf said, &#8220;When we came to Medina as  emigrants, Allah&#8217;s Apostle established a bond of brotherhood between me and Sad bin  Ar-Rabi&#8217;. Sad bin Ar-Rabi&#8217; said (to me), &#8216;I am the richest among the Ansar, so I will give  you half of my wealth and you may look at my two wives and whichever of the two you may  choose I will divorce her, and when she has completed the prescribed period (before  marriage) you may marry her.&#8217; Abdur-Rahman replied, &#8220;I am not in need of all that. Is  there any market-place where trade is practiced?&#8217; He replied, &#8220;The market of  Qainuqa.&#8221; Abdur-Rahman went to that market the following day and brought some dried  butter-milk (yogurt) and butter, and then he continued going there regularly. Few days  later, &#8216;AbdurRahman came having traces of yellow (scent) on his body. Allah&#8217;s Apostle  asked him whether he had got married. He replied in the affirmative. The Prophet said,  &#8216;Whom have you married?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;A woman from the Ansar.&#8217; Then the Prophet asked,  &#8216;How much did you pay her?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;(I gave her) a gold piece equal in weigh to a  date stone (or a date stone of gold)! The Prophet said, &#8216;Give a Walima (wedding banquet)  even if with one sheep .&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 34, Number 265: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Abdur-Rahman bin Auf came to Medina, the Prophet  established a bond of brotherhood between him and Sad bin Ar-Rabi al-Ansari. Sad was a  rich man, so he said to &#8216;Abdur-Rahman, &#8220;I will give you half of my property and will  help you marry.&#8221; &#8216;Abdur-Rahman said (to him), &#8220;May Allah bless you in your  family and property. Show me the market.&#8221; So &#8216;Abdur-Rahman did not return from the  market) till he gained some dried buttermilk (yoghurt) and butter (through trading). He  brought that to his house-hold. We stayed for some-time (or as long as Allah wished), and  then Abdur-Rahman came, scented with yellowish perfume. The Prophet said (to him)  &#8220;What is this?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I got married to an Ansari woman.&#8221; The  Prophet asked, &#8220;What did you pay her?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;A gold stone or gold  equal to the weight of a date stone.&#8221; The Prophet said (to him), &#8220;Give a wedding  banquet even if with one sheep.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 34, Number 266: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Ukaz, Majanna and Dhul-Majaz were market-places in the  Pre-lslamic period of ignorance. When Islam came, Muslims felt that marketing there might  be a sin. So, the Divine Inspiration came: &#8220;There is no harm for you to seek the  bounty of your Lord (in the seasons of Hajj).&#8221; (2.198) Ibn &#8216;Abbas recited the Verse  in this way. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 34, Number 267: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated An-Nu&#8217;man bin Bashir: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said &#8220;Both legal and illegal things are  obvious, and in between them are (suspicious) doubtful matters. So who-ever forsakes those  doubtful things lest he may commit a sin, will definitely avoid what is clearly illegal;  and who-ever indulges in these (suspicious) doubtful things bravely, is likely to commit  what is clearly illegal. Sins are Allah&#8217;s Hima (i.e. private pasture) and whoever pastures  (his sheep) near it, is likely to get in it at any moment.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 34, Number 269: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Utba bin Abu Waqqas took a firm promise from his brother  Sad bin Abu Waqqas to take the son of the slave-girl of Zam&#8217;a into his custody as he was  his (i.e. &#8216;Utba&#8217;s) son. In the year of the Conquest (of Mecca) Sad bin Abu Waqqas took  him, and said that he was his brother&#8217;s son, and his brother took a promise from him to  that effect. &#8216;Abu bin Zam&#8217;a got up and said, &#8220;He is my brother and the son of the  slave-girl of my father and was born on my father&#8217;s bed.&#8221; Then they both went to the  Prophet Sad said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He is the son of my brother and he has taken a  promise from me that I will take him.&#8221; &#8216;Abu bin Zam&#8217;a said, &#8220;(He is) my brother  and the son of my father&#8217;s slave-girl and was born on my father&#8217;s bed.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said, &#8220;The boy is for you. O &#8216;Abu bin Zam&#8217;a.&#8221; Then the Prophet said,  &#8220;The son is for the bed (i.e the man on whose bed he was born) and stones  (disappointment and deprivation) for the one who has done illegal sexual  intercourse.&#8221; The Prophet told his wife Sauda bint Zam&#8217;a to screen herself from that  boy as he noticed a similarity between the boy and &#8216;Utba. So, the boy did not see her till  he died. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Adi bin Hatim: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about Al Mirad (i.e. a sharp-edged  piece of wood or a piece of wood provided with a piece of iron used for hunting). He  replied, &#8220;If the game is hit by its sharp edge, eat it, and if it is hit by its broad  side, do not eat it, for it has been beaten to death.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! I release my dog by the name of Allah and find with it at the game, another dog  on which I have not mentioned the name of Allah, and I do not know which one of them  caught the game.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said (to him), &#8216;Don&#8217;t eat it as you have mentioned  the name of Allah on your dog and not on the other dog.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that his uncle said: &#8220;The Prophet was asked: If a  person feels something during his prayer; should one interrupt his prayer?&#8221; The  Prophet said: No! You should not give it up unless you hear a sound or smell  something.&#8221; Narrated Ibn Abi Hafsa: Az-Zuhri said, &#8220;There is no need of  repeating ablution unless you detect a smell or hear a sound.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Some people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Meat is brought  to us by some people and we are not sure whether the name of Allah has been mentioned on  it or not (at the time of slaughtering the animals).&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said (to them),  &#8220;Mention the name of Allah and eat it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While we were offering the prayer with the Prophet a  caravan carrying food came from Sham. The people looked towards the caravan (and went to  it) and only twelve persons remained with the Prophet.

They replied, &#8216;We were traders in the time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle  about money exchange. He replied, &#8216;If it is from hand to hand, there is no harm in it;  otherwise it is not permissible.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Musa asked Umar to admit him but he was not admitted as  &#8216;Umar was busy, so Abu Musa went back. When &#8216;Umar finished his job he said, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I  hear the voice of &#8216;Abdullah bin Qais? Let him come in.&#8221; &#8216;Umar was told that he had  left. So, he sent for him and on his arrival, he (Abu Musa) said, &#8220;We were ordered to  do so (i.e. to leave if not admitted after asking permission thrice). &#8216;Umar told him,  &#8220;Bring witness in proof of your statement.&#8221; Abu Musa went to the Ansar&#8217;s meeting  places and asked them. They said, &#8220;None amongst us will give this witness except the  youngest of us, Abu Said Al-Khudri. Abu Musa then took Abu Said Al-Khudri (to &#8216;Umar) and  &#8216;Umar said, surprisingly, &#8220;Has this order of Allah&#8217;s Apostle been hidden from  me?&#8221; (Then he added), &#8220;I used to be busy trading in markets.&#8221; </font></p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle reached before me and I reached in the morning,  and when I went to the mosque, I found him at the door of the mosque. He asked me,  &#8220;Have you arrived just now?&#8221; I replied in the affirmative. He said, &#8220;Leave  your camel and come into (the mosque) and pray two Rakat.&#8221; I entered and offered the  prayer. He told Bilal to weigh and give me one Uqiya of gold. So Bilal weighed for me  fairly and I went away. The Prophet sent for me and I thought that he would return to me  my camel which I hated more than anything else.

A big rock rolled over and  blocked the mouth of the cave. They said to each other, &#8216;Invoke Allah with the best deed  you have performed (so Allah might remove the rock)&#8217;. One of them said, &#8216;O Allah! My  parents were old and I used to go out for grazing (my animals). On my return I would milk  (the animals) and take the milk in a vessel to my parents to drink. After they had drunk  from it, I would give it to my children, family and wife. One day I was delayed and on my  return I found my parents sleeping, and I disliked to wake them up. The children were  crying at my feet (because of hunger). That state of affairs continued till it was dawn. O  Allah! If You regard that I did it for Your sake, then please remove this rock so that we  may see the sky.&#8217; So, the rock was moved a bit. The second said, &#8216;O Allah! You know that I  was in love with a cousin of mine, like the deepest love a man may have for a woman, and  she told me that I would not get my desire fulfilled unless I paid her one-hundred Dinars  (gold pieces). So, I struggled for it till I gathered the desired amount, and when I sat  in between her legs, she told me to be afraid of Allah, and asked me not to deflower her  except rightfully (by marriage). So, I got up and left her. O Allah! If You regard that I  did if for Your sake, kindly remove this rock.&#8217; So, two-thirds of the rock was removed.  Then the third man said, &#8216;O Allah! No doubt You know that once I employed a worker for one  Faraq (three Sa&#8217;s) of millet, and when I wanted to pay him, he refused to take it, so I  sowed it and from its yield I bought cows and a shepherd. After a time that man came and  demanded his money. I said to him: Go to those cows and the shepherd and take them for  they are for you. He asked me whether I was joking with him. I told him that I was not  joking with him, and all that belonged to him. O Allah! If You regard that I did it  sincerely for Your sake, then please remove the rock.&#8217; So, the rock was removed completely  from the mouth of the cave.&#8221; </font></p>

Who is this lady accompanying  you?&#8217; Abraham replied, &#8216;She is my sister (i.e. in religion).&#8217; Then Abraham returned to her  and said, &#8216;Do not contradict my statement, for I have informed them that you are my  sister. By Allah, there are no true believers on this land except you and 1.&#8217; Then Abraham  sent her to the king. When the king got to her, she got up and performed ablution, prayed  and said, &#8216;O Allah! If I have believed in You and Your Apostle, and have saved my private  parts from everybody except my husband, then please do not let this pagan overpower me.&#8217;  On that the king fell in a mood of agitation and started moving his legs. Seeing the  condition of the king, Sarah said, &#8216;O Allah! If he should die, the people will say that I  have killed him.&#8217; The king regained his power, and proceeded towards her but she got up  again and performed ablution, prayed and said, &#8216;O Allah! If I have believed in You and  Your Apostle and have kept my private parts safe from all except my husband, then please  do not let this pagan overpower me.&#8217; The king again fell in a mood of agitation and  started moving his legs. On seeing that state of the king, Sarah said, &#8216;O Allah! If he  should die, the people will say that I have killed him.&#8217; The king got either two or three  attacks, and after recovering from the last attack he said, &#8216;By Allah! You have sent a  satan to me. Take her to Abraham and give her Ajar.&#8217; So she came back to Abraham and said,  &#8216;Allah humiliated the pagan and gave us a slavegirl for service.&#8221; </font></p>

The child goes to the owner of the bed and the adulterer  gets nothing but the stones (despair, i.e. to be stoned to death). Then the Prophet said,  &#8220;O Sauda bint Zama!

It is shameful for us. But we  will mortgage our arms to you.&#8221; So, Muhammad bin Maslama promised him that he would  come to him next time. They (Muhammad bin Maslama and his companions came to him as  promised and murdered him. Then they went to the Prophet and told him about it. </font></p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">I borrowed 20,000 Pakistani Rupees, which were worth 7,000 Saudi Riyals at that time, from my brother. I now want to settle my debt, but the debt of 20,000 Pakistani Rupees is now worth 2,000 Saudi Riyals. Is it permissible for me to repay him with 2,000 Riyals or do I have to give him 7,000 Riyals according to the value when I borrowed it, or is it obligatory on me to give it to him in Pakistani Rupees, the same currency that I borrowed from him?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory on you to return the money that you borrowed from your brother in the same currency you took it from him, regardless of whether its value has risen or fallen against other currencies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You therefore have to give him 20,000 Pakistani Rupees, no more or less, for the 20,000 Pakistani Rupees you borrowed. You have to give him what equals its value at the time of the repayment in another currency, such as in Saudi Riyals or another currency, on the condition that it is done in one session. This is based on the answer which the Prophet (peace be upon him) gave to the inquirer who asked him whether it was permissible to sell Dirhams (a dirham of silver equals 2.975 grams of silver) for Dinars (old Arab coin that equals 2.975 grams of gold) or Dinars for Dirhams. He (peace be upon him) said, <span style="color:#008000;">“There is nothing wrong with taking them at the current rate so long as you do not separate leaving something to be settled.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions. The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the forbidden types of business transactions is: <strong>When a man sells something that he doesn’t own</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, a man goes to a businessman looking for a specific product, but this businessman doesn’t have this specific product. Yet they both agree to a contract (for the sale of the product) and agree on the extent of the price (on the item) presently or in the future. And all the while, the product is not found in the possession of the businessman or the buyer. Then the businessman goes and buys this product and hands it over to the buyer after they already agreed to a price and they made a contract and determined the value as it relates to present terms or in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this kind of business transaction is haraam. Why? Because he sold something he didn’t own and he sold something before gaining possession of it, if the product was specified. As for if the product was not specified and its price was delayed, he actually sold a debt on credit. The Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) forbade us from doing that, as was the case when Hakeem bin Hazaam (<em>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</em>) came to him, saying: “O Messenger of Allaah, what if a man comes to me wanting to buy something from me, but I don’t have it. Then I go to the marketplace and buy it for him?” The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: <strong>“Do not sell what you don’t have.” </strong>This is a clear cut forbiddance, therefore it is not permissible for a person to sell some specified commodity unless he is in possession of it before making a contract on it, whether he will sell it right there or in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible to take this matter lightly. So whoever wants to sell something to the people, then he should store the products in his store or in his shop or in a warehouse or in the trunk of his car or in his office, so that he can have the products ready with him. Then if some people who want to buy the products come to him, he can sell it to them directly or at a later time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">A Transcribed Lecture of Shaikh Saalih bin Fawzaan Al-Fawzaan<br />
Translated by abu maryam isma’eel</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/forbidden-business-transactions-in-islaam-shaykh-fawzan-al-ibaanah-com.pdf" target="_blank">Dowload PDF of Forbidden Business Transactions in Islaam- Shaykh Fawzan- Al-Ibaanah.com</a>]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Introduction to the Book</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah and may the peace and blessings of Allaah be on His Final Messenger, his family and those who follow him in goodness until the Day of Recompense. To Proceed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a small booklet entitled <strong>“<em>Al-Buyoo’ al-Munhee ‘anhaa fil-Islaam” </em></strong>[Forbidden Business Transactions in Islaam] by the noble scholar of Saudi Arabia, Shaikh Saalih bin Fawzaan Al-Fawzaan, may Allaah preserve him. The original source for this book was a recording of a lecture he gave in 1411H in a masjid in Saudi Arabia . The book was chosen due to the importance of this topic amongst Muslims in the West. This is because as the number of Muslims in the lands of the West increase and the communities grow, the need for instituting Muslim-owned businesses that will support and benefit these Muslim communities also grows.And since it is not befitting for the Muslims to engage in matters without knowledge, we felt a need to present this small but informative book to our readers for the purpose of providing knowledge on those matters, which Allaah and His Messenger have warned us against and forbidden with regard to everyday business transactions. You will find that this treatise is not only intended for the businessman who buys merchandise and sells to his customers, but also for the purchasers who buy the products. The Shaikh spends much of the time focusing on several products that are forbidden to buy, sell and promote, but yet which have found their way into Muslim communities in large quantities, such as music, alcohol and cigarettes. We hope that every Muslim benefits from this book, by avoiding buying or selling those products that have been forbidden and abstaining from conducting business schemes that are against Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Written by: isma’eel alarcon on April 26, 2002</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In the Name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>From the Lecture: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allaah, Lord of the Worlds, and may the peace and blessings be upon the chief of all Messengers and upon his family and all of his Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a short treatise on the subject of Prohibited types of business transactions, which has been compiled so that the Muslim can avoid them in his daily affairs – so that his earnings can be from the lawful, which Allaah will benefit him with in this life and the next. Originally, the source for this treatise was a lecture I gave at Masjid Sumoo Walee al-‘Ahd Al-Ameer ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Abdil-‘Azeez Aali Su’ood in Riyadh in the month of Jumaadal-Oolaa 1411H. The following is the transcription of that lecture:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Brothers! There is no doubt that commerce and business are two things that are required and necessary. This is because Allaah has commanded us to seek after gaining provision and sustenance for ourselves according to the proper channels generally. And specifically, He said concerning commerce (i.e. buying and selling): <em> </em><strong><em>“But Allaah has permitted trading and forbidden interest (Ribaa).”</em></strong> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 275]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says: <strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em> “O you who believe, when the prayer is called for on the Day of Jumu’ah, then rush to the Remembrance of Allaah and leave off the trading (commerce). That is better for you if you did but know. And when the prayer is finished then spread throughout the land and seek from Allaah’s Bounty and remember Allaah much in order that you may be successful.”</em></strong> [Surah Al-Jumu’ah: 9-10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says, praising those who combine between their seeking of sustenance (<em>rizq</em>) and their performing of worship:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“In houses (masaajid), which Allaah has ordered to be raised, and in which His name is mentioned. He is glorified therein during the mornings and the evenings. Men whom neither business nor commerce diverts them away from the Remembrance of Allaah, nor from performing the Prayer or giving the Zakaat.”</em></strong> [Surah An-Noor: 36-37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this ayah, Allaah states that from the attributes of the Muslims is that they buy and sell (i.e. they trade). But when the time for prayer comes, they leave off the buying and selling and head for the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“Neither trading nor business diverts them away from the Remembrance of Allaah.”</em></strong> [Surah An-Noor: 37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has commanded us to seek after the means of sustenance (<em>rizq</em>) along with the command to worship Him, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“So seek your provision from Allaah and worship Him (alone). And be grateful to Him, to Him you will return.”</em></strong> [Surah Al-‘Ankaboot: 17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So conducting business by buying and selling or any of the other types of permissible ways of earning provision is something that is required according to the Religion since tremendous benefits will result from that for both the individual and the society.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Buying and Selling, in itself, are both praiseworthy and necessary, so long as they do not cause harm to one’s worship or cause him to delay performing the prayer in congregation in the masaajid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<em>The honest and trustworthy businessman will be with the prophets, martyrs and righteous people</em>.” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means: The businessman who buys and sells while being honest will be with these groups of people on the Day of Judgement. This is a great position, which indicates the nobility of holding such an occupation. And the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) was once asked as to which kind of earning was the most purest? So he responded:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<em>A blessed trading (accepted by Allaah) and the labor a man does with his hand.</em>” </strong> [Reported by At-Tabaraanee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“The two persons conducting a business are in a state of goodness so long as they do not separate from one another. So if they are both honest and open with one another, they are blessed in their transaction. But if they lie and conceal (the truth), the blessing of their transaction is wiped out.” </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So doing business while being honest and righteous is from the best ways of earning sustenance. As for conducting business with lies, fraud, swindling and deception, then this is from the worst forms of earning sustenance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) once passed by a group of Muslims who were buying and selling in the marketplace of Madeenah. So the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em> ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O you gathering of traders!” So they raised their heads waiting to hear what he would say. He said: “Indeed the traders will be resurrected as sinful evil-doers (<em>fujaar</em>) except for those who fear (are dutiful to) Allaah, are righteous and honest.” </strong> [Reported by At-Tirmidhee who said it was hasan saheeh]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet himself (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) engaged in business transactions during the first part of his life, when he used to manage the money of Khadeejah. This was before the advent of his prophethood. And he would buy and sell and gain profit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the same for the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger – they would buy and sell and trade. And there were found wealthy people amongst them who used their wealth to support the Jihaad in Allaah’s Cause, such as ‘Uthmaan bin ‘Affaan (<em>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</em>) who supplied the poor in the army with equipment. And such was ‘Abdur-Rahmaan bin ‘Awf (<em>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</em>) who would donate money to the Muslims at the time of need and at the time of Jihaad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And such was Abu Bakr as-Sideeq (<em>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</em>) for he would buy and sell and sacrifice his wealth to support Islaam and the Muslims, from the time he was in Makkah before migrating, as well as after migrating. He would give away much and much of his wealth for the Cause of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, seeking the means of sustenance according to the permissible channels the greatest of which are buying and selling – has much good in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, this buying and selling must be set with religious guidelines, so that the Muslim can avoid falling into forbidden transactions and unlawful forms of earning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) has forbidden us from certain types of business transactions due to what they contain from sinful means of earning and what is found in them from dangers to mankind and the taking of wealth unjustly. From these types of prohibited transactions are:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong> When the buying and selling keeps one preoccupied from performing worship</strong> , i.e. they take away from the time of the worship, such as when a person is busy buying and selling and holds back from praying in congregation in the masjid, to the point that he misses it or misses part of it. This is forbidden. Allaah says:</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em> “O you who believe, when the prayer is called for on the Day of Jumu’ah, then rush to the Remembrance of Allaah and leave off the trading (commerce). That is better for you if you did but know. So when the prayer is finished then spread throughout the land and seek from Allaah’s Bounty and remember Allaah much in order that you may be successful.” </em></strong> [Surah Al-Jumu’ah: 9-10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says in another ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“O you who believe! Do not let you wealth or your children divert you from the Remembrance of Allaah. And whoever does that, then such are the losers.” </em></strong>[Surah Al-Munaafiqoon: 9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Take note of Allaah’s saying: <strong>“…then such are the losers.” </strong>He rules upon them that they are losers even though they may be wealthy, having amassed hoards of money even if they may have many children.This is because their wealth and their children cannot replace what they missed out on from the Remembrance of Allaah. So even if they gain a profit or earn income in this world, they will still be losers in every sense of the word. They can only be profiting in reality if they combine between these two good things. If they were to combine between the seeking of sustenance and the worship of Allaah, by buying and selling when it is time for buying and selling and attending the prayer when it is time for prayer, then they would have combined between the good of this life and the good of the Hereafter. And they would have acted on Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>  </em><strong><em>“So seek your provision from Allaah and worship Him (alone)”</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>  <em>“So when the prayer is finished then spread throughout the land and seek from Allaah’s Bounty.”</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>  </strong>Therefore, commerce is of two types – the commerce of the worldly life and the commerce of the next life (Hereafter). The commerce of this life is with wealth and with earnings while the commerce of the next life is with righteous actions. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em> “O you who believe, shall I not direct you to a trade (i.e. commerce) that will save you from a painful punishment? Believe in Allaah and His Messenger and strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allaah with your wealth and your lives. That will be better for you, if you but knew! (If you do so), He will forgive you your sins and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow and pleasant dwellings in the gardens of ‘Adan (i.e. Paradise). That is indeed the great success. And He will also give you another (blessing), which you will love – help from Allaah and a near victory. So give glad tidings to the believers.” </em></strong> [Surah As-Saff: 10-13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the immense commerce, which is profitable. So if the permissible commerce of this worldly life is attached to it, it becomes good upon good. But if a person limits his commerce to solely that of this worldly life while abandoning the commerce of the Hereafter, he becomes a loser, as Allaah says: <strong>“…then such are the losers.” </strong>[Surah Al-Munaafiqoon: 9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, if a person were to turn his attention to performing worship and establishing</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">the prayer, and if were to remember Allaah much, by doing what Allaah commanded him to do, Allaah would surely open the doors of sustenance for him. As a matter of fact, the prayer is a means for attaining sustenance (<em>rizq</em>), as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“And command your family with prayer and be patient in offering them. We are not asking you to provide Us with sustenance (rizq). (Rather), We will provide for you and the good end is for those who have Taqwaa.” </em></strong> [Surah TaHa: 132]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the prayer, which some people claim takes time away from them seeking after the <em>rizq </em>(sustenance) and from buying and selling, is in fact the opposite of what they claim. It opens for them the door of provision, comfort and blessing. This is because the sustenance (<em>rizq</em>) is in the Hand of Allaah. So if you were to turn your attention towards remembering Him and worshipping Him, He would facilitate and open the door of sustenance for you. <strong>“And Allaah is the best of Providers.” </strong>[Surah Al-Jumu’ah: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says, describing the worship of the believers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>  </strong>“In houses (masaajid), which Allaah has ordered to be raised, and in which His name is mentioned. He is glorified therein during the mornings and the evenings. (They are) Men whom neither business nor commerce diverts them away from the Remembrance of Allaah, nor from performing the Prayer or giving the Zakaat. They fear a day when the hearts and the eyes will be overturned out of fear (of the horrors of the Day of Judgement).” [Surah An-Noor: 36-37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In explanation of this ayah, some of the Salaf said: “They (the Sahaabah) would buy and sell, but when one of them heard the mua’dhin calling to prayer, and the scale was still in his hand, he would drop the scale and head out for the prayer.” So as stated before, the point is that if the buying and selling preoccupies you from performing your prayer, then this commerce is forbidden and futile. And the money earned from it is Haraam (unlawful) and filthy.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>And from the forbidden types of business is: <strong>Selling a forbidden commodity</strong>. This is because when Allaah makes something forbidden, He also makes taking money for it forbidden, such as when someone sells something that is forbidden to be sold.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) forbade that dead animals, khamr (i.e. wine), swine and statues be sold .So whoever sells dead animals, i.e. meat for which no prescribed Zakaat was given, then he has sold a dead animal and earned unlawful money. This goes the same for selling khamr. What is meant by the word khamr is everything that intoxicates, based on the Prophet’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>  </em><strong><em>“Every intoxicant is khamr and every kind of khamr is Haraam (unlawful).”</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>  </strong>And he (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) cursed ten people with regard to khamr, as is recorded in the authentic hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“Verily Allaah cursed khamr – the one who produces it and the one for whom it is produced, the one who sells it and the one who buys it, the one who drinks it and the one who earns from the sale of it, the one who carries it and the one who it is carried to, and the one who serves it.” </em></strong> [Reported by At-Tirmidhee and Ibn Maajah]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Khamr is every type of intoxicant regardless of whether it is called khamr or alcoholic beverages or liquor or wine or whiskey. It doesn’t matter if it is called by any of these or other names – changing the name does not change the fact that it is khamr. It has been reported in a hadeeth that: <strong>“There will come a people during the Last days that will call khamr by another name and drink it.” </strong>Also, what is worse than this is selling narcotics, such as <strong>hasheesh and opium</strong>, as well as other types of drugs, which are being dealt out to the people in these days. So the one who sells it and deals it is a criminal – in the eyes of the Muslims <strong><em>and </em></strong>in the eyes of the whole world. This is because drugs kill people, so it is like a destructive weapon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, anyone who sells drugs or distributes it or assists in its distribution all of them fall under the curse of Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>). And taking money from it is from the wickedest of acts and the most detestable of gains. Furthermore, the one who deals drugs deserves to be executed because he is one of those who cause mischief in the land.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same goes for selling <strong>cigarettes and qaat </strong>(leaves that are chewed in Arabian lands). Cigarettes are harmful and they cause diseases to occur. In fact, all of the characteristics of <em>khubth </em>(wickedness) are gathered together in cigarettes. There is no benefit in smoking in any way whatsoever. Its harms are many. The one with the worst kind of breath, the most despicable appearance and the most burdensome to accompany out of all people is the one who smokes cigarettes. If he sits next to you or he rides next to you in a car or on a plane, you feel constricted by the smoke he makes and its foul stench. The odor coming from his mouth is bad enough when he breathes in your face, so how much more so if he were to smoke in your presence and the cigarette smoke were to float in your face! The matter would be worse. So smoking is wicked from all perspectives and there isn’t any benefit found in it. Therefore, it is forbidden without any hesitation or doubt. It is unlawful to smoke based on several perspectives, not just one.When one smokes, he throws away money and wastes time. Cigarettes disfigure the face, blacken the lips and stain the teeth. As for the diseases that are caused by it, then they are many. Many people have been afflicted by it and yet they take it lightly and as something trivial. This is even to the point that some are suffering from its effects even though they never smoked and they hate smoking. However, they sold it to the people because they loved to make money any way they could. But these people don’t know that this type of business spoils all of their earnings, because some of them mix the money they make from it with their business and so they spoil it, since (doing this) is forbidden and disobedience (to Allaah). Sustenance is not to be sought from Allaah through disobeying Him. Rather, sustenance and provision are to be sought from Allaah by way of obeying Him. Whatever Allaah has ordained for you from <em>rizq </em>(sustenance) will surely come to you. If you seek after it while being obedient to Allaah (in all that He commands and prohibits), He will facilitate and bless your wealth.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Another type of forbidden business is: <strong>Selling musical and entertainment instruments </strong>in all of their various forms, such as stringed instruments and wind instruments or musical appliances and all of the instruments that are used for that purpose, even if they are called by other names such as “technical apparatuses.”</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is Haraam (unlawful) for the Muslim to sell these instruments and appliances because it is an obligation to destroy them and not have any of them remain in the lands of the Muslims. So if this is the case, how can they be sold? And how can one take money for them? This is from the forbidden acts!</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>And from the forbidden types of business transactions is: <strong>Selling images (i.e.pictures, statues)</strong>. The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) forbade us from selling statues, and what was intended by statues was (all life) images. This is because originally statues are based on image representations, regardless of whether it is representing horses, birds, animals or human beings. Everything that has a spirit (<em>rooh</em>), then selling an image of it is Haraam, and the money made from it is Haraam.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) cursed the image-makers and he informed us that they will be the ones with the worst and most severe punishment on the Day of Judgement. Likewise, it is not permissible to sell <strong>magazines that are filled with pictures</strong>, especially if these magazines contain immoral pictures (i.e. of naked women). This is because along with the fact that they contains pictures, which are forbidden, they also serve as <em>fitnah </em>(temptation) and an incitement towards doing evil acts. This is since when a man looks at a picture of a beautiful girl who is exposing some of her features or she is uncovering some of her body (i.e. naked), then most of the time this will rouse the man’s desires. And these desires will lead this individual to commit lewd and criminal acts. This is exactly what the devils amongst mankind and the jinn hope for by the distribution and sale of these pictures.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, from a higher perspective, is <strong>selling immoral movies </strong>(i.e. pornographic films), especially videotapes, which the Muslim communities have poured into the arena of their homes. These movies display images of naked women in them as well as images of lewd and immoral sexual acts! These movies tempt and incite the young men and women and cause them to be raised upon loving this kind of immorality.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is not permissible to sell these kinds of lewd films. Rather, it is binding upon you to prevent, destroy and distance these films away from the Muslim environments.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So anyone who opens a store to sell (or rent) these immoral videotapes, he has in fact opened a place for the disobedience of Allaah to be conducted and he has earned unlawful and illegal money, if he uses it or spends it on his family. Rather, he has opened up a place of <em>fitnah </em>(mischief) and a fortress for the Devil.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>And also from the forbidden types of business transactions is: <strong>Selling Tapes in which are recorded immoral songs, </strong>with the voices of male and female singers accompanied by music. And these songs consist of words that talk about lust, infatuation and craze for women. So it is forbidden (Haraam) to listen to, record and sell these songs. And taking money for it is considered unlawful earnings and illegal gains, which Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) forbade severely since they spread evil and immorality. And they corrupt one’s manners and transport evil into the homes of the Muslims.</li>
<li>And from the forbidden types of business transactions is: Selling something which the buyer will use towards committing Haraam. So if the seller knows that the buyer will use the product he is buying to commit some forbidden act, then selling it to him is forbidden and void. This is because you will be assisting him upon sinfulness and transgression, and Allaah says:</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“And help one another towards piety and fearing of Allaah, and do not help one another towards sinfulness and transgression.”</em></strong> [Surah Al-Maa’idah: 2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So for example, if someone buys grapes or dates for the purpose of making wine from them, or he buys a sword for the purpose of killing Muslims with it or for the purpose of committing highway robbery or to be tyrannical or a troublemaker and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everyone that will use a product against what Allaah has forbidden or will use it in a way Allaah has forbidden, then selling that product to him is not permissible. This is if one knows for sure that the buyer will do that or he suspects for the most part that he will do that.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>And from the forbidden types of business transactions is: <strong>When a man sells something that he doesn’t own</strong>. For example, a man goes to a businessman looking for a specific product, but this businessman doesn’t have this specific product. Yet they both agree to a contract (for the sale of the product) and agree on the extent of the price (on the item) presently or in the future. And all the while, the product is not found in the possession of the businessman or the buyer. Then the businessman goes and buys this product and hands it over to the buyer after they already agreed to a price and they made a contract and determined the value as it relates to present terms or in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this kind of business transaction is haraam. Why? Because he sold something he didn’t own and he sold something before gaining possession of it, if the product was specified. As for if the product was not specified and its price was delayed, he actually sold a debt on credit. The Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) forbade us from doing that, as was the case when Hakeem bin Hazaam (<em>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</em>) came to him, saying: “O Messenger of Allaah, what if a man comes to me wanting to buy something from me, but I don’t have it. Then I go to the marketplace and buy it for him?” The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: <strong>“Do not sell what you don’t have.” </strong>This is a clear cut forbiddance, therefore it is not permissible for a person to sell some specified commodity unless he is in possession of it before making a contract on it, whether he will sell it right there or in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible to take this matter lightly. So whoever wants to sell something to the people, then he should store the products in his store or in his shop or in a warehouse or in the trunk of his car or in his office, so that he can have the products ready with him. Then if some people who want to buy the products come to him, he can sell it to them directly or at a later time.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>And from the forbidden types of business transactions is: <strong>The ‘Aynah Transaction</strong>.What is the ‘Aynah Transaction? It is when a product is sold to a person for a deferred price (i.e. a raised price to be paid later), then that same product is bought back from him at current value less than the deferred price for which it was given to him. So when the time comes in which the deferred payment is due, he pays his creditor in full. This is what is known as an Al-‘Aynah Transaction. It is called ‘aynah (i.e. derivate of ‘ayn = same) because the same product that was sold is returned back to its owner. This is Haraam because it is deceiving someone into interest (Ribaa). In reality, it is as if you are selling dollars at the current price for deferred dollars (i.e. to be given later), which are more than the original amount. And you are just using the product as a device or means to gaining this interest.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is an obligation on you if you are owed money by someone, because you sold him some product for a deferred price that you let him sell it to someone else, or that you let him act freely in the matter – if he wishes he can keep it or if he wishes he can sell it to someone else, if he is in need of the money. The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: <strong>“When you deal with <em>al-‘aynah </em>transactions and you hold onto the tails of cows and you are pleased with the agriculture, Allaah will send humiliation down upon you. He will not remove it from you until you return back to your Religion.” </strong>[Reported by Abu Dawood and it has supporting evidences]</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>And from the forbidden types of business transactions is: <strong>An-Najash</strong>. What is meant by an-Najash is when you display a product for sale in a public auction. Then a person comes and bids up the price of the item, but he doesn’t intend to purchase the item, rather he only wants to raise the price for the customers intending to deceive the buyers. This is the same whether he agreed with the seller to do this or he did it on his own. So whoever bids for a product and he doesn’t want to buy it, rather he only wants to raise its price for the customers, then this person is a Naajish, who has opposed the prohibition of Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>). Doing this is Haraam, as the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: <strong>“And do not perform Najash on each other.”</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 [<strong>Translator’s Note: </strong>Another example is if you sell an item that is worth $25 to someone for $50 because he will pay you next month and not now. This may be agreed because perhaps you feel the value of the item will go up by then. But for some reason, the buyer is short of money and wants to sell the item back to you, so he comes to you the next day and you make him sell it to you for the current market price, which is still $25. So when the date, next month, on which you agreed he would pay you the $50 comes, he pays you the money. So altogether you make $25 apart from the item, which is considered interest.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a person who has no desire or need for the item, he should not participate in the auction and not bid for it. Instead, he should leave the customers, who really desire the item, to outbid each other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps a person may want to help the seller, and sympathy for the seller overcomes him. So he bids up the price of the item for the purpose of helping the seller according to his perception. Or perhaps, the seller may agree with a group of his associates to create a crowd around the item for sale in order to draw the people’s attention. These acts are considered from Najash and are Haraam because they are a means of deceiving the Muslims and a way of taking their money unjustly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, the scholars of Fiqh have stated that what falls under Najash is when a seller tells his customer: “I bought this item for such and such price”, lying about the price, so that the buyer may be fooled and buy the item at an increased value. Or it is when the seller says: “I was given this product at this price” or he says: “I received it for this much”, lying about the price. He only wants to fool the customers into bidding the price up to reach this alleged and false price, which he claims he spent for the item. This is from the Najash, which Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) forbade. It is a treachery and deception of the Muslims, and it is lying and disloyalty, for which he will be accountable for before Allaah. So what is obligatory on the seller is that he reveals the truth if the buyer asks him how much he got it for. He must tell him the truth and not say that he attained it for this much money, lying about the price. What also falls into the definition of An-Najash is if the people of the marketplace or the storeowners agree to not outbid one another when an item is presented for sale, for the purpose of forcing the owner to sell it for a (discounted) cheaper price. So therefore, they are all participating in this act, which is Haraam. And this is from An-Najash. It is also a form of taking the people’s money unjustly.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>And from the forbidden types of business transactions is: <strong>When a Muslim conducts a sale on top of the sale of his brother.</strong> The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “And none of you should conduct a sale on top of the sale of his (Muslim) brother.” How is this done? It is done, for example, when a person who wants to buy a certain product comes and buys it from one of the businessmen, who gives him the option to finalize the deal in two or three days or more. So in this case, it is not permissible for another businessman to come and interpose, saying to the buyer: “Leave this product. I will give you the same item, even better than it, for a cheaper price.” This is Haraam because he is conducting a sale on top of the sale of his brother.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, so long as he sells him the item and gives him the option (to finalize the deal later), let him obtain it and do not interfere in the deal. If he wishes, he will take the product, and if he wishes, he will cancel the deal. So if he calls off the deal due to his own choice (i.e. not being coerced or influenced), then there is nothing preventing you from selling it to him (now). (On the opposite end) conducting a purchase over his purchase is also Haraam. So if a Muslim comes and buys a product from one of the businessmen for a fixed price and is then given the option for a period of time (to finalize the deal), it is not permissible for another buyer to interfere by going to the businessman or the seller, saying: “I will buy that product from you for a higher price than that person bought it from you.” This is Haraam because these kinds of transactions cause harm to the Muslims and violate their rights and puts hatred into their hearts (for one another). This is since if a Muslim comes to know that you interfered in his transaction and you were the cause for ruining the deal that was between the two of them, he will be filled with hatred, spite and abhorrence for you. Or perhaps he may even supplicate against you, because you have oppressed him. And Allaah says: <strong>“And work with one another upon piety and fear of Allaah. And do not work with one another upon sin and transgression.” </strong>[Surah Al-Maa’idah: 2]</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>And also from the business transactions that are forbidden is: <strong>The Deceptive Sale</strong>, which is when you deceive your Muslim brother by selling him a product that has defects and you know about these defects yet you do not inform him about them. So this kind of sale is not permissible and it is from deception, swindling and fraud. It is obligatory on the seller to make these defects clear to the seller and to let him know about them. But if he fails to inform him about them, then this is from deception and swindling, which Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) forbade in his saying: <strong>“The two persons conducting a business transaction are in a state of goodness for as long as they do not separate from one another. So if they are both honest and open with one another, they are blessed in their transaction. </strong>But if they lie and conceal (the truth) from one another, the blessing of their <strong> transaction is wiped out.” </strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory upon us, O servants of Allaah, to be sincere. Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The Religion is sincerity, the religion is sincerity, the religion is sincerity.” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They (the Companions) said: “To who O Messenger of Allaah?” He said: <strong>“To Allaah, to His Book, to His Messenger, to the Muslim leaders and the Muslim general masses.” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Muslim must be sincere. What is meant when one is sincere towards something is that he is free or absolved from certain things. So being sincere means being free from cheating (for example).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One time the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) passed by a person selling some food in the marketplace who had his food in a pile. So the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) put his noble hand inside the pile of food and found some wet portions in the bottom of the pile. So he said: <strong>“What is this O owner of the food?” </strong>He said: “The sky has affected it” – meaning the rain has affected some of it. So Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: <strong>“Then won’t you make it visible so that the people can see it? Whoever cheats us (i.e. swindles Muslims) is not from us.” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth is considered one of the fundamental principles in conducting business transactions between the Muslims. So it is not permissible for a Muslim to conceal the defects. If his merchandise has a defect then he must make it visible so that the buyer sees it and is aware of it, and so that he could acquire the item for a price that is appropriate for this defect. He must not acquire the item for the price it would be if it were flawless, for then the seller would be deceiving, cheating, fooling and swindling, based on the saying of Allaah’s Messenger: <strong>“Then won’t you make it visible so that the people can see it? Whoever cheats us is not from us.” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So O servants of Allaah! How much of swindling do you see in these days? How many times do you see people placing the defective items in the bottom of the containers and cases while placing the good items on the top – whether vegetables or food items? They purposely put the defective item in the bottom while putting the flawless item on the top. This is trickery, which is done intentionally.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah to pardon and forgive us and you, and that He make our <em>rizq </em>(sustenance) Halaal and that He make our earnings Halaal. And we ask Him to provide us from His vast Bounty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah suffice us with what You have made Halaal over that which You made Haraam, and (suffice us) with Your Bounty over that of others besides You. And forgive us, have mercy on us and accept our repentance. Verily, You are the One who accepts Repentance, the Bestower of Mercy. And may the peace and blessings of Allaah be on Allaah’s Messenger.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Author:Imaam Muhammad </span><strong style="line-height:1.5em;">Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee<br />
</strong>Source:Al-Asaalah (Issue #6) [E-Book: Fataawaa of Shaikh Al-Albaanee]<br />
Translator:isma&#8217;eel alarcon</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question:</strong> What is the religious ruling concerning buying in installments?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Answer:</strong> First of all, buying in installments is an innovation of the actions that was not known to the Muslims in every preceding generation. Rather it is from the aspects that have been passed onto them from the disbelievers, those who, in the past, took over their lands, colonized them and governed over them with their rules of disbelief. Then when they departed from the lands&#8217; major districts, they left behind their evil and misguided traditions. And, today, the Muslims live upon those practices and acts that the disbelievers imposed on them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is another concern – which is the most important – and it is as the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <strong>&#8220;I have not left anything that would bring you closer to Allaah, except that I have commanded you to do it. And I have not left anything that would distance you from Allaah, while bringing you closer to the Hellfire, except that I have forbidden you from doing it.&#8221;</strong> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this, we see that he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) forbade from that which today is called <strong>&#8220;buying in installments.&#8221;</strong> Therefore, this kind of business transaction is an innovation, which the Muslims of the past did not know of. I also want to say that this name is an innovation (in itself) for there is nothing found in the books of Fiqh with the name &#8220;buying in installments.&#8221; Rather, there is found in the Muslim books, that which is called <em>Ad-Dain</em> (debt) and that which is called <em>Al-Qard-ul-Hasan</em> (a goodly loan). This (latter) has become, in the daily affairs of Muslims, just a name without any form and reality to it. This is in spite of the Prophet&#8217;s (peace be upon him) incitement towards giving goodly loans and his going to great extents in that, to the extent that he regarded the lending of two dollars to be as if you gave one dollar away in charity. This means: If you lend your Muslim brother two dollars, it is as if you have taken a dollar out of your pocket and given it for charity. Just as he (peace be upon him) encouraged these goodly loans, he forbade from taking extra money in exchange for delaying your brother&#8217;s payment of his end of the deal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <strong>&#8220;Whoever makes two business transactions out of one, then he gets either the lowest of the two or the interest.&#8221;</strong> And in another hadeeth, he <strong>&#8220;forbade that two business transactions be made for one (transaction).&#8221;</strong> The reporter of this hadeeth was asked about the meaning of this forbiddance, so he responded: &#8220;It is that you say: &#8216;I will sell you this thing for such and such amount of money in cash, and for such and such (more) money in delayed payment.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I will sell you this appliance for 100 dollars in cash directly, and for 105 dollars in installments, meaning as a debt. He (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <strong>&#8220;Whoever makes two business transactions out of one, then he gets either the lowest of the two or the interest.&#8221;</strong> This means that if he takes the exra money, then it is interest, as is seen in the example of the appliance that was sold for 105 dollars, five dollars more in exchange for the delay.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If there were an Islaamic rule for individuals and rulers, this buyer who was deceived and had five extra dollars taken from him in exchange for the businessman&#8217;s waiting on the delay, he would have the right to take hold of him and complain about him to the people of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the understanding of this hadeeth. The thing being sold is one, however the offer is in two transactions: In cash directly for this amount and in delayed payment for that amount. So the increase of money for the delay in paying at once was labeled as interest by Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="ContentParagraph" dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Source : <a href="http://alifta.com/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Page&amp;PageID=335&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=17" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">alifta.com</a> &#8211; Issued by the Permanent Committee</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Some private companies and businesses offer medical insurance to their employees and their families. To provide this service, they make an agreement with some private hospitals. This agreement is as follows:</span></p>
<div id="ContentParagraph" dir="ltr">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">1- The company pays the hospital a fixed monthly amount of 100 Riyals for each employee, regardless of the number of times they visit the hospital to have treatment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">2- The hospital is responsible to treat the employees, giving them the necessary medications and performing surgery for them when necessary. It is important to mention that the hospital spends more than 100 Riyals some months on treating an employee, especially when the person has an operation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">At other times, an employee may not visit the hospital at all and thus, does not benefit from the 100 Riyals or he may benefit only from a small amount. The question now is: First, is this type of medical insurance permissible or does it involve uncertainty and deception?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Second, does this kind of insurance fall under the permissible Ji&#8217;alah (payment for a permanent job, not a fief) as some researchers have said (i.e., Majallat Al-Buhuth Al-Fiqhiyyah Al-Mu`asirah, &#8220;Contemporary Jurisprudence Research Journal&#8221;, issue no. 31)? Third, what are the characteristics of a lawful cooperative medical insurance?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> A: </strong>The transaction mentioned in the question falls under the category of prohibited commercial insurance, which involves uncertainty, deception and devouring people&#8217;s money falsely. The permissible cooperative medical insurance is to establish a charity fund that is paid to help the needy and sick people without the donor expecting any financial benefit from it. Giving the money to the fund should only aim at helping the needy, and hoping for the Reward of Allah (Exalted be He). May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="que"><strong>Question</strong> : </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling regarding some of the owners of the gold shops stipulates a condition on the person selling them used gold that he must buy new gold from them?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="ans"><strong>Answer</strong> : </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is not permissible, because it is conniving to sell gold for gold with some difference between the qualities, and conniving is prohibited in the Islamic Law, because it is deception and playing with the Laws of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ash-Shaykh Ibn &#8216;Uthaimin</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Source</strong>: Fatwa Islamiyyah &#8211; Dar-us-salam publications</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The ruling on exchanging used Gold for new Gold, like for like, while taking a Fee for Craftsmanship</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="que"><strong>Question</strong> : </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling concerning many of the people who have gold shops who deal with buying used gold (called Al-Kasr), and they take it to a gold merchant and exchange it for new gold that is specially crafted and that matches the weight of the old gold exactly? Then they take a fee for the craftsmanship of the new gold.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="ans"><strong>Answer</strong> : </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is confirmed from the Prophet Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Gold for gold, silver for silver, wheat for wheat, dates for dates, barley for barley, salt for salt like for like, equal for equal, hand to hand (i.e., paid on the spot) .&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Muslim no. 1587.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also confirmed from him that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Whoever increase or seek an increase, then indeed he has committed a Riba transaction.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Muslim no. 82/1584,1588.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also confirmed from him that he was given some good dates, so he asked about them. The people said, &#8220;We would take a Sa&#8217; of this for two Sa&#8217;s (of bad dates) and two Sa&#8217;s for three Sa&#8217;s. So, the Prophet  Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam commanded that the sale be canceled and he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;This is Riba, exactly.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he directed them to sell the power quality dates for cash, and then to use that cash to buy good dates.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From these Hadiths you can tell that what the questioner mentioned of exchanging gold for gold while adding a fee for the craftsmanship done to one of them is a forbidden matter. It is not permissible and it is included in the Riba transactions that the Prophet  Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam prohibited. The safe method in this is that the used gold be sold for a price without any secret understanding or agreement. Then, after its owner takes money, he buys the new thing. It is better that he search for the new thing in another place and if he does not find it he may return to the person to whom he sold the gold and buy with the cash. If the person increase the price, there is no harm in that. The important thing is that there is no trading of gold for gold while paying some difference, even if the is due to some special craftsmanship work. This is if the merchant is a merchant, then the buyer can say, &#8220;Take this gold and make if for me how I want it to be fashioned, and I will give you the cost for the work when the work is finished,&#8221; there is no harm in that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah radhiallahu `anhu has said that the Messenger of Allah sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam mentioned a man of the Bani Israel saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He asked another to lend him a thousand dinars. The lender asked him to bring witnesses but the borrower said, &#8220;Allah is sufficient as a witness.&#8221; The lender asked him to furnish a surety but the borrower again asserted, &#8220;Allah is sufficient as a surety.&#8221; The lender agreed, &#8220;You are correct,&#8221; and lent him money for a specified period.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The debtor went across the sea. When he had finished his work, he looked for a conveyance to take him back for the punctual repayment of his debt, but he did not find any conveyance. So he took a piece of wood and made a hole in it. He inserted in it the one thousand dinars and a letter to the lender and closed the hole tightly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He took the piece of wood to the sea and said, &#8220;O Allah! You know well that I took a loan of one thousand dinars from so-and-so. He demanded a surety from me but I told him that Allah&#8217;s surety was enough and he accepted Your Guarantee. He then demanded a witness and I told him that Allah was sufficient as a witness. No doubt I have tried much to find a conveyance so that I might pay back his money but could not find one, so I hand this money over to you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saying that, he threw the piece of wood into the sea till it went far out into it, and then he went away. Meanwhile he kept looking for a conveyance to take him to the lender&#8217;s place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One day, the lender came out of his house to see whether a ship had arrived bringing his money, and all of a sudden, he saw a piece of wood in which was the money. He took it home to use as firewood. When he sawed it, he found his money and the letter inside it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shortly after that, the debtor came with a thousand dinars and said, &#8220;By Allah! I had been trying to get a boat so I could bring you your money but failed to get one before the one I have come by.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The lender said, &#8220;Allah has delivered on your behalf the money you sent in the piece of wood. So you may keep your thousand dinars and go, guided on the right path.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~ <strong>Sahih Bukhari</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about the ruling on buying shares in companies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Buying shares in companies is subject to further discussion, because we have heard that <strong><span style="color:#993300;">they put their money in foreign banks, or quasi-foreign banks, and take interest on it, which is a kind of riba</span></strong>. If this is true then buying shares in them is haraam and is a major sin, because riba is one of the worst of major sins. But if it is free of this then buying shares is halaal, so long as there is nothing else involved that is haraam according to sharee’ah. End quote.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (18/question no. 119).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Don&#8217;t miss to read the below interesting analysis :</strong> (excerpted from the net)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Take the top 500 corporate giants of India</strong> which are basically engaged in <em>Halal</em> business and their end products and services too are <em>Halal.</em> One shall be astonished to look at the capital structure of these companies as more than half of the capital of these companies comes from debt instruments such as interest carrying debentures, secured loans and other borrowing from commercial banks and financial institutions. In fact a company is said to be based upon strong fundamentals whose debt-equity ratio is in the range of 60:40 to 70:30. And nearly all these 500 companies conform to this criterion mostly. The moot point here is can a company be bracketed under <em>Halal</em> business concerns just because its finished goods and services are <em>Halal</em> even though the majority of its capital and finance comes from debt and interest-carrying loans. Take these top 500 <em>Halal</em> companies again. It is a bare fact that these companies park their reserves and surplus capital in high-yield and fixed income debt instruments and government securities. And sometimes the returns from these investments far exceed the income from their declared business. Corporate giant, Tata Iron and Steel Company which is ranked second in terms of market capitalization and weightage on the Sensex of the Bombay Stock Exchange is a classic case whose main income in the early 90’s came from such investments under the sub-head “Other Income”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Viewed from yet another angle, a good company’s capital, as stated earlier, mainly consists of nearly 40 per cent equity and 60 per cent debt. At times of boom in the economy, companies usually earn more than 100 per cent on their investments. But they pay back their debtors only the pre-determined interest of say 20 per cent and pass the benefit of the remaining 80 per cent to their equity share holders besides their own 100 per cent entitlement. Under this scenario the profit-sharing of the debtors and the equity share holders would be 20 per cent and 220 per cent respectively. Conversely, at times of economic recession, companies could hardly earn anything, and even the debt servicing has to be met with from the share of the equity share-holders such as company reserves and further borrowing. In the former case if the equity share holders get abundantly benefited from the <em>Haram</em> investment of the debtors, in the latter case, it is the turn of their <em>Halal</em> investment to get the raw deal at the hands of the <em>Haram</em> one. The fundamental question here is does Islam permit the intermingling of <em>Halal</em> and <em>Haram</em> investments with such dire consequences, and that too of the present magnitude? The plain and unambiguous answer is a simple “no”. How can the stock-market trading be termed <em>Halal</em> then?</p>
