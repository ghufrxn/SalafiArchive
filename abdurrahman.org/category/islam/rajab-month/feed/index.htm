										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(36. Verily, the number of months with Allah is twelve months (in a year), so was it ordained by Allah on the Day when He created the heavens and the earth; <strong>of them four are sacred</strong>. That is the right religion, so <strong>wrong not yourselves therein</strong>, and fight against the Mushrikin idolaters collectively as they fight against you collectively. But know that Allah is with those who have Taqwa.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Soorat at-Tawbah 9:36</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Year consists of Twelve Months</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Bakrah said that the Prophet said in a speech during his Hajj,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The division of time has turned to its original form which was current when Allah created the heavens and the earth. The year is of twelve months, out of which four months are sacred: Three are in succession Dhul-Qa`dah, Dhul-Hijjah and Muharram, and (the fourth is) Rajab of (the tribe of) Mudar which comes between Jumada (Ath-Thaniyah) and Sha`ban.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet then asked, (What is the day today&#8217;) We said, &#8220;Allah and His Messenger know better. He kept quiet until we thought that he might give that day another name. He said (Isn&#8217;t it the day of Nahr) We replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He further asked, (Which month is this) We again said, &#8220;Allah and His Messenger know better,&#8221; and he kept quiet and made us think that he might give it another name. Then he said,(Isn&#8217;t it the month of Dhul-Hijjah) We replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He asked, (What town is this) We said, &#8220;Allah and His Messenger know better,&#8221; and he kept quiet until we thought that he might change its name. He asked, (Isn&#8217;t this the (Sacred) Town) We said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Verily! Your blood, property and honor are sacred to one another like the sanctity of this day of yours, in this month of yours and in this city of yours. Verily, you will meet your Lord and He will question you about your actions. Behold! Do not revert to misguidance after me by striking the necks of one another. Have I conveyed It is incumbent upon those who are present to inform those who are absent, because those who are absent might comprehend (what I have said) better than some who are present.)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari and Muslim collected this Hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In a small book collected by Shaykh `Alam ad-Din As-Sakhawi, entitled, Al-Mashhur fi Asma&#8217; Al-Ayam wash-Shuhur, he mentioned that <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Muharram is so named because it is a sacred month. To me, it was so named to emphasize its sacredness.</strong></span> This is because the Arabs would switch it around. One year they would say it was a sacred month, the following year they would say that it was not. The author said, &#8220;&#8230;and <strong>Safar</strong> is so named because they used to leave their homes during that month for fighting and traveling. When saying `Safir&#8217; a place, it means to leave it&#8230; <strong>Rabi` Al-Awwal</strong> is called that because they used to do Irtiba` in it, that is to maintain one&#8217;s property&#8230; and <strong>Rabi` Al-Akhir</strong>, was so named for the same reasons. <strong>Jumada</strong> is called that because the water would dry up (Jamud) then&#8230;.They say <strong>Jumada Al-Uwla</strong> and <strong>Al-Awwal</strong>, or Jumada Al-Akhar or Al-Akhirah. <strong>Rajab</strong> comes from Tarjib, meaning to honor. <strong>Sha`ban</strong> because the tribes would separate and return to their homes. <strong>Ramadan</strong> was so named because of the severity of the Ramda&#8217; &#8211; that is &#8211; the heat, and they say that the branch Ramadat when it is thirsty&#8230;And the saying that it is a Name of Allah is a mistake, for there is no proof or support for that&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">The Sacred Months</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(of them four are sacred).</strong></span> The Arabs used to consider these months sacred during the time of Jahiliyyah, except for a group of them called Al-Basl, who held eight months of the year to be sacred as way of exaggeration in religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(Three are in succession; Dhul-Qa`dah, Dhul-Hijjah and Muharram, and (the fourth is) Rajab of (the tribe of) Mudar which comes between Jumada (Ath-Thani) and Sha`ban).</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said &#8220;Rajab of Mudar&#8221; to attest to the custom of Mudar, in saying that Rajab is the month that is between Jumada and Sha`ban, not as the tribe of Rabi`ah thought, that it is between Sha`ban and Shawwal, which is Ramadan in the present calendar. The four Sacred Months were made four, three in succession and one alone, so that the Hajj and `Umrah are performed with ease. Dhul-Qa`dah, the month before the Hajj month, was made sacred because they refrained from fighting during that month. Dhul-Hijjah, the next month, was made sacred because it is the month of Hajj, during which they performed Hajj rituals. <strong>Muharram, which comes next, was made sacred so that they are able to go back to their areas in safety after performing Hajj</strong>. Rajab, in the middle of the lunar year, was made sacred so that those coming from the farthest areas of Arabia are able to perform `Umrah and visit the House and then go back to their areas safely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(That is the right religion),</span> that is the Straight Law, requiring implementing Allah&#8217;s order concerning the months that He made sacred and their true count as it was originally written by Allah. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(so wrong not yourselves therein)</span> during these Sacred Months, for sin in them is worse than sin in other months. Likewise, sins in the Sacred City are written multiplied,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;and whoever inclines to evil actions therein (in Makkah) or to do wrong, him We shall cause to taste from a painful torment) 22:25. <strong>Similarly, sin in general is worse during the Sacred Months</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Ali bin Abi Talhah narrated that Ibn `Abbas said, Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Verily, the number of months with Allah&#8230;),</span> is connected to</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(so wrong not yourselves therein),</span> &#8220;In all (twelve) months. Allah then chose four out of these months and made them sacred, emphasizing their sanctity, making sinning in them greater, in addition to, multiplying rewards of righteous deeds during them.&#8221; Qatadah said about Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(so wrong not yourselves therein)</span>, <strong>&#8220;Injustice during the Sacred Months is worse and graver than injustice in other months. Verily, injustice is always wrong, but Allah makes things graver than others as He will.&#8221;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Allah has chosen some of His creation above others. He chose Messengers from angels and from men. He also chose His Speech above all speech, the Masajid above other areas of the earth, Ramadan and the Sacred Months above all months, Friday above the other days and Laylatul-Qadr (The Night of Decree) above all nights. Therefore, sanctify what Allah has sanctified, for doing so is the practice of people of understanding and comprehension.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Fighting in the Sacred Months</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(and fight against the idolators collectively),</span> all of you,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(as they fight against you collectively.)</span>, all of them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(But know that Allah is with those who have Taqwa)</span>, and know that initiating battle during the Sacred Months is forbidden. Allah said in other Ayat,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(O you who believe! Violate not the sanctity of the symbols of Allah, nor of the sacred month.)</span> 5:2,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(The Sacred Month is for the Sacred Month, and for the prohibited things, there is the law of equality (Qisas). Then whoever transgresses the prohibition against you, you transgress likewise against him)</span> 2:194, and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Then when the Sacred Months have passed, kill the idolators&#8230;)</span> 9:5. As for Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(And fight against the idolators collectively as they fight against you collectively)</span>, it includes permission for the believers to fight the idolators in the Sacred Month, if the idolators initiate hostilities therein. Allah said in other Ayat,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(The Sacred Month is for the Sacred Month, and for the prohibited things, there is the law of equality (Qisas))</span> 2:194, and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(And fight not with them at Al-Masjid Al-Haram, unless they (first) fight you there. But if they attack you, then kill them.)</span> 2:191.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Messenger of Allah laying siege to At-Ta&#8217;if until the Sacred Month started, it was a continuation of the battle against Hawazin and their allies from Thaqif. They started the fighting and gathered their men for the purpose of conducting war. The Messenger of Allah marched to meet them and when they took refuge in At-Ta&#8217;if, the Prophet laid siege to them so that they descend from their forts, but they inflicted casualties on Muslims. The siege continued for about forty days, during which a Sacred Month began, and the siege continued for several days in that month. The Messenger broke the siege and went back (to Makkah). So fighting that carries over into it the Sacred Month is not the same as initiating warfare during it, Allah knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 align="Center"><a href="#">Imam Al-Nawawi&#8217;s Riyad-us-Saliheen</a><br />
Chapter 225<br />
The Excellence of Observing Saum (Fasting) in the months of Muharram and Sha&#8217;ban<br />
and the Sacred Months</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1246.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The best month for observing Saum (fasting) next after Ramadan is the month of Allah, the Muharram; and the best Salat (prayer) next after the prescribed Salat is Salat at night (Tahajjud prayers)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1247.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) did not observe voluntary Saum (fasting) so frequently during any other month as he did during Sha`ban. He observed Saum throughout the month of Sha`ban</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">    Another narration is:<span style="color:#008000;"> He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) observed Saum during the whole month of Sha`ban except a few days</span>.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1248.</b>  Reported Mujibah Al-Bahiliyah on the authority of her father or uncle that he visited the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) once and then went to see him again after a year. His appearance had totally changed. He asked the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) if he had recognized him. The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) asked, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Who are you?</span>&#8221; He replied: &#8220;I am Al-Bahili who visited you last year.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;You were quite handsome, what has changed your appearance so much?</span>&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Since my departure from here, I have not eaten anything except at night.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) remarked, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">You have put yourself to torture. Observe Saum (fasting) during the Month of Patience (i.e., Ramadan) and fast one day from each month.</span>&#8221; He submitted, &#8220;Permit me to observe more voluntary fasts because I have capacity to do so.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Then observe fasts for two days in every month</span>.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Permit me to observe more.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Observe fasts on three days in every month</span>.&#8221; He requested that he should be allowed to observe more fasts. The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Fast three days during the sacred months and omit fasting for three days alternately</span>.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) joined his three fingers together and left them apart while repeating this sentence thrice.<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> The First Point: </strong></span></p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">No authentic proof has been related affirming the specific date of al-Israa&#8217; wal-Mi&#8217;raaj.</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Al-Imaam Ibn Taymiyyah stated, as in &#8220;Zaad al Ma&#8217;ad,&#8221; 58/1: &#8220;No known proof has been established. Neither concerning its month, which part of the month it was in nor its specific date. Rather, what has been narrated related to all of this has been narrated with conflicting narrations and with discontinuous chains of narrations and thus none of them can be affirmed with surety.</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">● Ash-Shareef Ibn al-Ameer as-San&#8217;aanee said in &#8220;At-Tanweer&#8221;, 7710: &#8220;It is a specific night yet nothing from the authentic Sunnah has been narrated specifying when exactly it is.&#8221;</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> The Second Point: </strong></span></p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">The scholars have differed concerning the time of its occurance and there are numerous opinions regarding this.</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">It is said that it is in Rajab. It is said that it is in Rabee al-Awwal, just as it is said it is in Rabee ath-Thaani.</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">It is also said that it is in Ramadhaan and it is said that it is in Shawwal. Also, it is said that it is in Dhil Qa&#8217;dah.</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Some of them say it was in the begining of the month, others say the middle and others say the later part of the month.</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Many of the scholars have pointed out these conflicting views:</p>
<ul>
<li style="color:#444444;"><span style="color:#444444;">From the Hanafis: al-Mulla &#8216;Ali Qaaree and Abu al-Fadhl al-Aloosee</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#444444;">From the Maalikis: Ibn &#8216;Abdil Barr and Abu &#8216;Abdillah al-Qurtubee</span></li>
<li>From the Shaafi&#8217;ees: an-Nawawee, Ibn Katheer and Ibn Hajr al-Asqalaanee</li>
<li>From the Hanbalis: Ibn al-Jawzee and al-&#8216;Uthaymeen.</li>
</ul>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Third Point: </strong></span></p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">The weakest position with regards to specifying (when it took place) is the position which posits that it was in the month of Rajab.</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Abu al-Khattaab Ibn Dahiyah al-Maaliki stated in &#8220;Adaa mal Wajab min Bayyan Wadh&#8217;i al Waadh&#8217;iyoon fi Rajab,&#8221; pg. 110: &#8220;Some of the storytellers mention that al-Israa&#8217; was in Rajab and according to the people of Praise and Criticism (Scholars of Hadeeth) this is without a doubt a lie.&#8221;</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Also, Ibn al-&#8216;Attar ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee mentioned in &#8220;Hukm Sawm Rajab wa Sha&#8217;baan wa Maa Ahdatha Feehima&#8221;, pg.34: &#8220;From those who considered the hadeeth of al-Israa&#8217; and al-Mi&#8217;raaj happening on the 27th to be weak include:</p>
<ul>
<li style="color:#444444;"><span style="color:#444444;">From the Maalikis: Abu al-Khattaab al-Kalbee</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#444444;">From the Shaafi&#8217;ees: Ibn al-&#8216;Attar, Ibn Katheer and Ibn Hajr al-Asqalaanee</span></li>
<li>From the Hanbalis: Ibn Taymiyyah, Ibn Rajab, Ibn Baaz and al-&#8216;Uthaymeen.</li>
</ul>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fourth Point:</strong></span></p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Celebrating the rememberance of al-Israa&#8217; and al-Mi&#8217;raaj has not been narrated from the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم, nor his Companions, nor the Taabi&#8217;een, nor the Taabi&#8217; at-Taabi&#8217;een, nor was it an action of the Imaams of the well known madhaahib: Abu Haneefah, Maalik, ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee or Ahmad.</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">The previously mentioned individuals are the example for the individual who does not celebrate al-Israa&#8217; wal-Mi&#8217;raaj.</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">However, concerning the one who celebrates it, who is his example in doing such?</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Without a doubt, his example is the Raafidhah Shi&#8217;a and those who follow them from the extremist Sufis!</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifth Point: </strong></span></p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Whoever has the zeal and vigor to do good deeds and to increase in doing such, then let him ask himself:</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">&#8220;How many actions of obedience have clearly come in the Qur&#8217;aan and authentic Sunnah and I do not do them, nor do I exert myself in trying to do so?</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Verily, it is shameful that I fall short and am lazy in those acts of worship which have come in the Qur&#8217;aan and authentic Sunnah, yet I exert myself in that which has neither come in the Qur&#8217;aan or authentic Sunnah, nor did the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم or his Companions who came after him do so!&#8221;</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"><em>Summarized from the book &#8220;At-Tadhkeer al-Baahith bi Annhu Laa Yasihu fi Tahdeed Taareekh Haaditha al-Israa&#8217; wal-Mi&#8217;raaj Athar wa Laa Hadeeth&#8221; by Shaykh &#8216;Abdul Qaadir al-Junayd.  </em><em>Translated by Abu Afnaan Muhammad &#8216;Abdullah</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AsSalam Alaikum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakaatuhu</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><strong>Source</strong>: The Islamic View Point on Celebrations Mawlid, The Night of Isra and Miraj , Mid Shaban Night &#8211; by <strong>Shaykh Ibn Baaz</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The night wherein the event of Isra’ and Mi’raj occurred had not been particularized in the authentic Hadith. All that was in this concern, according to the scholars of Hadith, has not been asserted as valid by the Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Such is the extensive judiciousness of the Almighty Allaah that He made people forget it. Even if its particularization had been asserted, Muslims should have not favoured it with any devotional services whatsoever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are not permitted to celebrate its anniversary, since the Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and his companions –May Allaah be pleased with them- never did it. Neither did they favour it with certain acts of devotion. Should such celebration of the Night be a licit matter, the Apostle (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), would have expounded it to the nation, either by word or by deed. And if such a thing had occurred, it would have been known and become common, and the companions-may Allaah be pleased with them- would have transmitted it to us. They, in fact, passed on from their Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), everything Muslims are in need of. Never were they remiss with regard to religion, nay, they were outstrippers to every good. Should celebration of this anniversary Night were licit, they would have been the first to do it. The Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), is most sincere in guiding people. He most truly fulfilled his mission, and performed his noble duty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the glorification and celebration of that Night had something to do with Islam, the Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), would have never neglected it. Neither would he have concealed it. And since nothing of such a matter have ever occurred, it has become known that glorification and celebration of that Night has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with Islam, because the Almighty Allaah has perfected for this nation its religion, completed His favour upon it, and rebuked the innovators who introduce in religion that which Allaah had not allowed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Almighty-glory be to Him- says in the Quranic Chapter Al-Ma’ida: (This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed my favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion).[5:3]. Allaah –may He be exalted- also says in Chapter Al-Shura: (What! Have they partners [godhead], who have established for them some religion without the permission of Allaah? Had it not been for the Decree of Judgement, the matter would have been decided between them [at once]. But verily the wrongdoers will have a grievous Penalty). Warning against heresies, and declaring that they are errors by way of reminding the nation of their gruesome peril, and estranging people from committing them, have been established as valid in the authentic Hadith of the Apostle (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It has been asserted as valid, among other traditions, in both Sahih Muslim and Sahih Al-Bukhari, on the authority of A’isha –may Allah be pleased with her- that the Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), said: (If anyone introduces into this affair of ours anything which does not belong to it, it is rejected). In another version by Muslim, the Prophet said: (Whoever performs a deed inconsistent with our principles, it will be rejected). Muslim transmitted in his Sahih, on the authority of Jabir-may Allaah be pleased with him- that the Apostle (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), was always used to saying in his speech on Fridays: (and now to our topic; the best speech is that of the Quran, and the best guidance is that of Muhammad (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and the most wicked matter is that of heretic innovations and each heresy is an error). It is reported in the Sunan (precepts) on the authority of Al-‘irbad ibn Sariah-may Allaah be pleased with him-who said: the Apostle (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), gave us an eloquent exhortation that scared the hearts, and shed tears from the eyes. We said: O Apostle of Allah, it looks as if it were a farewell exhortation. Admonish us. He then said: “I enjoin you to fear Allah, and to hear and obey your commander even if he were a slave; for those of you who live after me will see great disagreement. You must therefore follow my Sunnah and that of the rightly guided Caliphs. Hold to it, and stick fast to it. Avoid novelties; for every novelty is an innovation, and every innovation is an error). The traditions to that effect are numerous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Caution and intimidation against heresies have been established as a matter of fact, on the authority of the companions of the Apostle (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and the pious ancestors thereafter. Such was the case only for its being an unnecessary addition to religion, a prescription of something novel without the permission of Allaah, and an imitation of the adversaries of Allaah, as did the Jews and the Christians with regard to making additions to their religion, and inventing what was beyond the permission of Allaah, since that act of theirs was attended by their being prejudicial to Islamic religion, and accusing it of lack of perfection. This matter is quite known to be rife with a great deal of gross corruption, ignominious file actions, contradiction with the saying of the Almighty Allaah: (<strong>This day I have perfected your religion for you…</strong>.), and an obvious contrast to the traditions of the Apostle (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), that caution against, and estrange from heresies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I hope that the aforementioned evidences are quite enough for the truth-seeker to reject this heresy, namely, that of celebrating the anniversary Night of ‘Isra’ and Mi’raj, and to caution against it, considering that it has absolutely nothing to do with Islam. In view of the fact that Allaah has enjoined the duty to give Muslims sincere advice, to elucidate the divine prescription for them, and to proscribe concealing of knowledge to them, I decided to call the attention of my Muslim brethren to this heresy which became so rife in a lot of countries that some people deemed it pertaining to religion</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>About Shaykh Ibn Baaz</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He held the position of Grand Muftee of Saudi Arabia, the Presidency of many Islaamic Committees and Councils, the prominent among these being: Senior Scholars Committee of the Kingdom, Permanent Committee for Islaamic Research and Fataawa, the Founding Committee of Muslim World League, World Supreme Council for Mosques, Islaamic Jurisprudence Assembly Makkah; and the member of the Supreme Council of the Islaamic University at al-Madeenah, and the Supreme Committee for Islaamic Propagation, until he passed away on Thursday 27 Muharram 1420 A.H./May 13 1999 C.E. May Allaah (Subhaanahu wa Ta&#8217;aala) have Mercy upon his soul, aameen.</p>
