<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Introduction to the English Edition</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise and thanks are due to Allaah, Lord of the worlds. May His peace and prayers be upon Muhammad and upon those who follow his Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">More than likely this book shall attract much attention. Perhaps it shall be a gift from a husband to his wife or perhaps those of us awaiting marriage will eagerly study these few pages to better understand what is expected of us and how we can strive towards it. Nevertheless there will be some who shall huff and utter annoyances under their breath claiming that yet again this is targeted at women (not men), censuring and restricting them. Unfortunately such people will rarely study the text but on flicking through these pages shall come to the conclusion that this has been written by a fanatical male Muslim to tyrannise and discredit the role of women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In six short, concise chapters Muhammad Shūmān has brought together a collection of authentic ahaadeeth and many <em>Aayaat</em> to aid the Muslimah towards righteousness and advise and encourage her with regards to her husbands rights upon her and how she can attain the pleasure of her Creator by doing so. You may find some of the wording harsh, or even strange, but the fault isn&#8217;t in the text, rather in ourselves due to this society where the &#8216;choices&#8217; are only the western liberal choices and hence we have become accustomed to moulding ourselves in a particular way &#8211; sometimes quite alien from Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our duty above all is to worship Allaah, obedience to Him taking precedence over the rest of creation. If He asks us to do something then that should become an aim we try our hardest to fulfill. With this in mind, when we now approach the issue of marriage then it should be made clear that obedience to one&#8217;s husband is an Islamic duty and hence earns the pleasure of our Lord. It must be pointed out that the author has kept his own words to a minimum and instead has based this book on the Sayings of Allaah and His Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) (with the explanation of some prominent scholars) &#8211; thus the Believer has no choice but to submit to it wholeheartedly. Allaah, the Most High says,</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا كَانَ لِمُؤْمِنٍ وَلَا مُؤْمِنَةٍ إِذَا قَضَى اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ أَمْرًا أَن يَكُونَ لَهُمُ الْخِيَرَةُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِمْ ۗ وَمَن يَعْصِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلَالًا مُّبِينًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;It is not fitting for any believing man or woman, when Allaah and His Messenger have decreed any matter that they should have any option in their affair, and whoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger has strayed in plain error.&#8221;</span> (Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we read this and digest it with a sincere heart and recognise that there isn&#8217;t hardship imposed on the woman and ease for the man, rather that which is mentioned shall only lead to greater comfort, ease and satisfaction for both parties. A marriage which starts on the right footing where the husband and wife identify their own roles and compliment each other according to what is contained in the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah then theirs shall be the marriage in which there is happiness and joy &#8211; success in both worlds, for they have put their entire trust in Allaah, He who knows what benefits and rectifies the servants and what harms and corrupts them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Although the pages are few, the lessons are many and even if we were to act on half of them we would feel an immediate change in ourselves and our homes. It is about time that a book of this nature and dealing with such an important topic has become available to the Muslim women in the west where we are in much need of instruction from the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah so that we can easily reject western models and replace them with the best of examples.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We hope that this book will not be misused by husbands but rather that it will serve as a reminder to them also and a warning that they are not left to their customary conduct in this affair. There is advise and encouragement for the husband to live with his wife in a good and honourable manner, taking care of her &#8211; highlighting that the success and tranquility of the marriage does not just fall upon his wife, rather it is a shared responsibility.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah to reward the author for this service and his efforts, and may all the Muslim women who read this try to mould their characteristics upon this noble way and may all the Muslim men help and encourage us towards attaining the rewards and excellence for being a righteous wife.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Author&#8217;s Foreword</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah. We praise Him, we seek His aid and we ask for His forgiveness. We seek Allaah&#8217;s refuge from the evils of ourselves and from our evil actions. Whosoever Allaah guides, there is no one who can misguide him; and whosoever Allaah misguides, there is no one who can guide him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, alone, who has no partner; and I testify that Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) is His slave and Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This treatise, &#8220;<strong>The Righteous Wife</strong>&#8221; is concise in its wording, important in its subject and valuable for the points of benefit it contains. We ask Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, to make this treatise of benefit to our Muslim sisters, and to all those who read it, and that He makes it a work done purely and sincerely to seek His Face. Indeed He is the one who gives bounteously and generously.</p>

1st Dhul-Qa&#8217;dah 1410H.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Seriousness of the Rights of the Husband</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">الرِّجَالُ قَوَّامُونَ عَلَى النِّسَاءِ بِمَا فَضَّلَ اللَّهُ بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ وَبِمَا أَنفَقُوا مِنْ أَمْوَالِهِمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The men have authority over the women due to the excellence which Allaah has given to the man over the woman, and due to the wealth that they spend upon them.&#8221;</span> [01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ibn Katheer </strong></span>says, &#8220;The man is in charge (<em>qayyim</em>) of the woman, i.e. he is the one in-charge of her, her chief, the one having authority over her and the one who corrects her if she inclines away from what is correct.&#8221; [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Abdur-Rahmaan as-Sa&#8217; dee </span></strong>said (regarding the above mentioned <em>Aayah</em>),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;That is due to the excellence of men over women, and the eminence which they have been given over them. So the pre-eminence of the men over the women is from many aspects: holding positions of leadership and authority is particular to men, likewise Prophethood and Messengership. They are also particularised by many acts of worship such as <em>jihaad</em> , the <em>eids</em> and the <em>Jum&#8217;ah</em> prayers. Also due to the characteristics given to them by Allaah, the like of which are not possessed by women such as sound intellect, composure, patience and endurance. Likewise they are particularised with having to spend upon their wives, and indeed spending in many ways which are particular to the men &#8211; which distinguish them from the women. So perhaps this is the reason for His saying:<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> </strong><strong>وَبِمَا أَنفَقُوا</strong> </span> &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;due to the wealth that they spend&#8230;</span>&#8221; &#8211; and exactly what they spend is not stated to indicate that the spending referred to is general. So from all this it is known that the man is like a governor and master for his wife, and she is with him like a captive. So his role is to take care of that which Allaah has placed him in-charge of, and her role is to be obedient to her Lord and to obey her husband.&#8221; [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Al-Qaasimee</span></strong> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">&#8221; <strong>الرِّجَالُ قَوَّامُونَ عَلَى النِّسَاءِ &#8221; </strong></span>&#8216;The men have authority (<em>qawwaamoon</em>) over the women&#8217; [04] &#8211; <em>qawwaamoon</em> is the plural of <em>qawwaam</em>. <em>Qawwaam</em> is the one who is responsible for taking care of their welfare, managing their affairs and disciplining them. That is, they are in-charge of and are to take care of the manners and behaviour of the women; ordering them and forbidding them, just as the ruler is responsible for his subjects. This is due to two reasons: (i) Due to the nature which Allaah gave them, and (ii) due to the role which they carry out.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first is indicated by the Saying of Allaah:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"> بِمَا فَضَّلَ اللَّهُ بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Due to the excellence which Allaah has given to the man over the woman.&#8221;</span> [05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This refers to the relation between the men and women, and means that the men have a position of dominance over them due to the superiority which Allaah has given to the men over the women.&#8221; [06]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَلِلرِّجَالِ عَلَيْهِنَّ دَرَجَةٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Men have a degree over the women.&#8221;</span> [07]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ibn Katheer</strong> </span>said, &#8220;Meaning: in excellence; in the nature given to them; in manners; in status; in the obedience due to them; in their spending and taking care of the (women&#8217;s) welfare; and in excellence in this life and the Hereafter.&#8221; [08]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#808000;"><em>Every soul from the children of Aadam is a master; so the man is the master of his family, and the woman is the mistress of her household</em>.</span> &#8221; [09]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>&#8220;If I were to order anyone to prostrate to other than Allaah, I would have ordered the woman to prostrate to her husband. By Him in whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad, the woman will not fulfill the rights of her Lord until she fulfills the rights of her husband; and even if he were to request her for herself (i.e. to have intercourse with her) whilst she was sitting upon a camel&#8217;s saddle </em></span>[10]<span style="color:#808000;"><em>, she should not refuse him.&#8221; </em></span>[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;It is not right that any human being should prostrate to another human being, and if it were right for a human being to prostrate to another human being I would have ordered the woman to prostrate to her husband due to the greatness of his right upon her. By Him in whose Hand is my soul, if from his foot to the crown of his head there was a wound pouring forth pus, and she (the wife) came and licked that, then she would (still) not have fulfilled his right. &#8220;</span></em> [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>&#8220;The right of the husband over the wife is such that if he had a wound, or his nostrils were pouring forth pus or blood, then she were to swallow that down &#8211; then she would (still) not have fulfilled his right.&#8221;</em></span> [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Hurayrah, <em>radiyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, reports that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>&#8220;It is not right for a woman to fast </em></span>[14]<span style="color:#808000;"><em> whilst the husband is present except with his permission; </em></span>[15]<span style="color:#808000;"><em> and whatever wealth she spends in charity without his order, then half of the reward is for him. &#8221; </em></span>[16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Shaykh al-Albaanee </span></strong>said<strong><span style="color:#000000;">,</span></strong> &#8220;Since it is an obligation upon the woman to obey her husband with regard to fulfillment of his desire with her, then it is even more fitting that it is obligatory upon her to obey him with regard to that which is even more important than that &#8211; such as what pertains to bringing up the children, correcting her family and the like &#8211; all such rights and obligations.&#8221; [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr </strong></span>said, &#8220;The hadeeth shows that the right of the husband upon the wife has priority over her performing optional good deeds, since his right is an obligation, and fulfillment of an obligation takes precedence over carrying out something optional.&#8221; [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah</span></strong>, <em>rahimahullaah</em>, was asked about a man who has a wife who fasts during the day and stands in prayer throughout the nights. Whenever he calls her to his bed she refuses and gives precedence to praying in the night and fasting during the day over obedience to the husband. So is this permissible? Shaykhul-Islaam replied, &#8220;That is not permissible for her by agreement of the Muslims. Rather it is obligatory upon her to obey when he calls her to the bed, this is a binding obligation upon her. However standing the night in prayer and fasting during the day is optional, so how can a believing woman give precedence to something optional over an obligation&#8230; and there is no right, after the rights of Allaah and His Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) more binding upon the woman than the rights of the husband.&#8221; [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mu&#8217;aadh ibn Jabal, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, said that the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;If the woman knew the right of the husband, she would not sit when his morning and evening meals were presented until he finished. &#8220;</span></em> [20]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Encouragement of Obedience to the Husband and Seeking to Please Him</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Hurayrah, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, said that the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;If a woman prays her five (daily prayers), fast her month (i.e. Ramadaan), guards her private parts, and obeys her husband, it will be said to her, &#8216;Enter Paradise through whichever of the gates of Paradise you wish.'&#8221;</span></em> [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>&#8220;Your women from the people of Paradise are the beloved and fertile, the one who is an asset to her husband, who if her husband becomes angry- comes and places her hand in the hand of her husband and says, &#8216;I will not taste sleep until you are pleased (with me). &#8220;&#8216;</em></span> [22]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Warning Against Causing the Husband to Become Angry, Disobeying His Orders and Neglecting His Rights</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fadaalah ibn &#8216;Ubayd, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, said that the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>&#8220;There are three who are not to be asked about: </em></span>[23]<span style="color:#808000;"><em> A man who abandon s the Jamaa&#8217;ah </em></span>[24] <span style="color:#808000;"><em>and disobeys his ruler </em></span>[25]<span style="color:#808000;"><em> and dies in a state of disobedience &#8211; so do not ask about him; a female slave or a male slave who flees from his master; and a woman whose husband is away, and he has provided for her worldly needs, yet she adorns and displays herself </em></span>[26] <span style="color:#808000;"><em>and roams around freely</em></span> [27] <span style="color:#808000;"><em>without him &#8211; so do not ask about them. &#8221; </em></span>[28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;"> &#8220;There are three whose prayers will not be raised above their ears: the runaway slave until he returns; a woman who spends the night whilst her husband is angry with her; </span></em>[29]<em><span style="color:#808000;"> and one who leads a people in prayer and they dislike him.</span></em>[30] [31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;Allaah will not Look at a woman who does not give thanks to her husband and she cannot do without him. &#8220;</span></em> [32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Hurayrah, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, reports that the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;By Him in whose Hand is my soul, there is no man who calls his wife to his bed and she refuses him except that the One who is in the heaven is angry with her until he (her husband) is pleased with her. &#8220;</span></em> [33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;"> &#8220;When a woman spends the night forsaking the bed of her husband, then the angels curse her until she returns. &#8220;</span></em> [34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>&#8220;If a man calls his wife to his bed and she refuses, and he spends the night angry with her, then the angels curse her until morning. &#8220;</em></span> [35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said to a woman, <em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;Indeed he is your Paradise and your Fire.&#8221; </span></em>[36] Meaning her husband.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whichever woman obeys Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, with regard to her husband and fulfills his rights, then he will be her Paradise &#8211; meaning he will be a cause for her entering Paradise; and if she is disobedient to her husband &#8211; then the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mu&#8217;aadh ibn Jabal, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, said that the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;A woman does not harm her husband in this world except that his wife from the large eyed hooris (al-Hoorul &#8216;Een) </span></em>[37]<em><span style="color:#808000;"> says, &#8216;Do not harm him, may Allaah kill you,for he is just a passing guest with you and is about to leave you and come to us.&#8217; &#8220;</span></em>[38]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Excellence of a Righteous Wife</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullaah ibn &#8216;Amr, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, said that the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;All of this world is a utility and the best utility is a righteous wife. &#8220;</span></em> [39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa&#8217;d ibn Abee Waqqaas, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, said that the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;Four things are from prosperity: a righteous woman, a spacious dwelling, a righteous neighbour and an agreeable riding beast; and four things are from adversity: an evil neighbour, an evil woman, a bad riding beast and a cramped dwelling. &#8220;</span> </em>[40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thawbaan, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, nararted, &#8220;When revelation was sent down concerning silver and gold, [41] they said, &#8216;So which wealth shall we possess?&#8217; &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;I shall find this out for you.&#8217; So he hastened upon his camel and went to the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) and I followed him. So he said, &#8216;O Messenger of Allaah, which wealth shall we possess?&#8217; So he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8216;<em>Let one of you possess a heart which is thankful, a tongue which makes mention of(Allaah), and a believing wife who helps one of you upon the affairs of the Hereafter.</em>&#8216;&#8221;</span> [42]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The righteous wife is the one whom the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) advised should be obtained right from the beginning. As Aboo Hurayrah, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, narrated from the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;A woman is married for four reasons: for her wealth; for her lineage; for her beauty; and for her religion (Deen). So marry the one who is good in her religion (Deen) &#8211; may your hands be covered in dust.&#8221;</span></em> [43]  [44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr said</span></strong>, &#8220;The meaning is that what is fitting for a person upon the religion and of good manners is that the religion should be the aim which he gives importance to in all of his affairs &#8211; particularly those affairs which he will be involved in for a long period of time. So the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) commanded him to obtain a woman who is good in her practice of the religion &#8211; which is the goal that is desired.&#8221; [45]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Attributes of the Righteous Wife</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">1. Devotion and obedience to Allaah, the Most High</span></strong>, such that she fulfills His rights, such as the prayer, fasting, chastity, covering herself, withholding her gaze and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">2. Obedience to her husband</span></strong> in that which does not involve disobedience to Allaah, the Most High, such that she fulfills his rights completely, and fro m them are what has proceeded in the first chapter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">3. That she guards and preserves herself and her honour, in the absence of her husband</span></strong>, from the hand of anyone wishing to touch her, the eye of anyone wishing to look upon her, and the ear of anyone wishing to listen to her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise that she preserves her husband&#8217;s children, home and wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">فَالصَّالِحَاتُ قَانِتَاتٌ حَافِظَاتٌ لِّلْغَيْبِ بِمَا حَفِظَ اللَّهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Therefore the righteous women are obedient to Allaah and their husbands, and guard that which Allaah has ordered them to guard (their chastity and their husbands property) in the absence of their husbands.&#8221;</span> [46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Sa&#8217;dee said, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>فَالصَّالِحَاتُ قَانِتَاتٌ</strong></span> meaning they are obedient to Allaah, the Most High; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>حَافِظَاتٌ لِّلْغَيْبِ</strong></span> meaning they are obedient to their husbands even when the husbands are absent, she guards herself and her husband&#8217;s property.&#8221; [47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;If a woman prays her five (daily prayers), fasts her month (i.e. Ramadaan), guards her private parts, and obeys her husband, it will be said to her, &#8216;Enter Paradise through whichever of the gates of Paradise you wish. &#8216;&#8221;</span></em> [48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">4. Serving her husband.</span> </strong>First of all by carrying out what is required in his house, such as bringing up and educating the children, preparing the meals and the beds and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Husayn ibn Mihsan who said that my paternal aunt said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;I came to Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) for some need, so he asked, &#8216;You there! Are you married?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; He then asked, <span style="color:#808000;">&#8216;How are you towards your husband?&#8217;</span> She responded, &#8216;I do not fall short in his service except with regard to what I am unable to do. &#8216; He said, <span style="color:#808000;">&#8216;Then look to your standing with him, for indeed he is your Paradise and your Fire .&#8221;&#8216;</span> </em>[49]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here is an example of how Asmaa&#8217; bint Abee Bakr, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhumaa</em>, served her husband. She said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Az-Zubayr married me and he did not have any property or slaves or anything upon the earth except for a camel which drew water from the well and his horse. So I used to feed his horse, draw the water, stitch his water bucket, and prepare the dough, but I was not proficient in baking bread &#8211; so ladies from the Ansaar who were my neighbours and were honourable used to bake the bread for me. I also used to carry the date-stones upon my head, from the land given to az-Zubayr by Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) &#8211; and it was about two miles away. One day when I was coming with the date-stones on my head, I met Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) and a group of the Ansaar were with him. So he called me and said, &#8216;Ikh, ikh.&#8217; [50] in order to carry me behind him upon the camel. But I felt shy to proceed along with the men, and I thought of az-Zubayr and his sense of jealousy, and he was one of the most jealous of the people. So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) saw my shyness and so passed on. So I came to az-Zubayr and said, &#8216;Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) met me while I was carrying the date stones upon my head and with him were a group of his Companions. He caused his riding camel to kneel, but I felt shy and remembered your sense of jealousy.&#8217; So he said, &#8216;By Allaah your having to carry the date-stones is harder upon me than that you should ride along with him.&#8221;&#8216; She said, &#8220;Then later on Aboo Bakr sent me a servant to look after the horse, so it was as if he had set me free.&#8221; [51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars differ with regard to the ruling about a woman serving her husband. Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah said, &#8220;The scholars differed about whether she has to serve her husband with regard to the like of household bedding, preparing food and drinks, baking the bread, grinding the corn, and providing food for his slaves and cattle &#8211; such as providing fodder for his riding beast and so on. &#8220;Some of them say: It is not obligatory for her to serve him &#8211; and this is a weak saying, like the weakness of the saying that it is not obligatory upon her to live together with him and have intercourse with him! However what is correct is that it is obligatory to serve him, since the husband is her master according to the Book of Allaah, and she is a captive with him according to the Sunnah of the Prophet [52] (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم), and the captive and the slave have to serve &#8211; and this is something known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;the Saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">فَالصَّالِحَاتُ قَانِتَاتٌ حَافِظَاتٌ لِّلْغَيْبِ بِمَا حَفِظَ اللَّهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Therefore the righteous women are obedient to Allaah and their husbands, and guard that which Allaah has ordered them to guard (their chastity and their husbands property) in the absence of their husbands.&#8221;</span> [53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This <em>Aayah</em> shows that it is obligatory upon her to serve her husband unrestrictedly, including: serving him, travelling along with him , making herself available to him, and so on &#8211; just as it is obligatory to obey the parents, since the obedience due from her to the parents transfers to the husband.&#8221; [54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">5. Keeping the husbands secrets.</span></strong> Particularly what occurs between him and her in private &#8211; with regard to sexual matters and the private affairs within the marriage. Disclosing the husbands secrets will hurt him and anger him and this contradicts obedience to him and seeking to please him. Furthermore preserving his secrets is one of the duties of the righteous and obedient women, as described in the Saying of Allaah,</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">حَافِظَاتٌ لِّلْغَيْبِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Guarding that which (Allaah has commanded them to guard) in the absence of their husbands.&#8221;</span> [55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Part of their guarding what they are to guard in the absence of their husbands is that they should not broadcast their secrets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Asmaa&#8217; bint Yazeed, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhaa</em>, who said that she was in the company of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) and men and women were sitting, and he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>&#8220;Perhaps a man mentions that which he did with his wife, and perhaps a woman informs of what she does with her husband?!&#8221; So the people were silent, so I said, &#8220;Yes, by Allaah, O Messenger of Allaah! The women certainly do that, and the men certainly do that.&#8221; He (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said, &#8220;Then do not do so, since that is just like a male devil meeting a female devil upon the way, and he has intercourse with her while the people are watching. &#8220;</em></span> [56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">6. She should appear before the husband in the best appearance</span></strong>, such that if he looks at her it pleases him. Aboo Hurayrah, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, narrates the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) was asked,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;Which of the women is the best?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;The one who gives him </span></em>[57]<em><span style="color:#808000;"> pleasure when he looks;</span></em>[58]<em><span style="color:#808000;"> obeys him when he orders; and does not go against his wishes with regard to herself or her wealth by doing that which he dislikes. &#8220;</span></em> [59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">7. She should not spend any of his wealth or her wealth except with his permission.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From &#8216;Abdullaah ibn &#8216;Amr ibn al-&#8216; Aas, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, who said that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8221; It is not permissible for a woman to give a gift except with the permission of her husband. &#8220;</span> </em>[60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Albaanee</strong> said, &#8220;However it is not becoming for the husband &#8211; if he is a sincere Muslim &#8211; that he should use this ruling to play the tyrant with his wife and to prevent her from utilizing her wealth in a manner which will not harm either of them. Indeed this right is very similar to the right of the girls guardian &#8211; who is such that she cannot get herself married except with his permission. But if he unjustly prevents her, then the matter is raised to the Islamic judge for justice to be attained. Likewise is the ruling with regard to a woman&#8217;s wealth if her husband oppresses her and prevents her from spending her wealth in a lawful and prescribed manner &#8211; then the judge will also bring about justice for her. So there is no problem with the ruling itself, rather the problem is in how it is misused.&#8221; [61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">8. She should not permit anyone to enter her husbands house except with his permission.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Aboo Hurayrah, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, who said that the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;It is not permissible for a woman to fast when her husband is present except with his permission; nor may she permit anyone to enter his house except with his permission; and whatever she spends in charity without his order &#8211; then half of the reward is for him. &#8220;</span></em> [62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>9. She should not ask her husband for divorce without a reason necessitating that.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Thawbaan, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, who said that the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;Whichever woman asks her husband for divorce without a strong reason &#8211; then the fragrance of Paradise will be forbidden for her. &#8220;</span></em> [63]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">10. Avoidance of cursing.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Sa&#8217;eed al-Khudree, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, said</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em> &#8220;The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) went out to the prayer-ground for the (prayer of) Adhaa or Fitr, and he passed by the women and said, &#8216;O women! Give in charity,for I have been shown that you shall be the majority of the people of the Fire .&#8217; So they asked, &#8216;Why is that, 0 Messenger of Allaah?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;You curse frequently and are ungrateful to your husbands. &#8216;&#8221;</em> </span>[64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">11. Being thankful to the husband for the good he does and for his good treatment of his wife.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is accomplished by good words, and by her obedience to him in what is good, and by not forgetting his good treatment and avoiding denying this, since that is one of the reasons which brings about entry into the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn &#8216;Abbaas, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, who said that the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;I was shown the Fire and found that the majority of its inhabitants were women, due to ingratitude. It was said: &#8220;Is it that they disbelieve in Allaah?&#8221; He said: They are ungrateful to their husbands and deny the good they do. If you were to treat one of them well always, and she then saw something (displeasing) from you she would say: &#8216;I have never seen any good from you. &#8216;&#8221;</span></em> [65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;Allaah will not look at a woman who is not thankful to her husband and she cannot do without him.&#8221;</span></em> [66]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">12. She should not remove her clothes outside her husbands house.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;Whichever woman removes her clothes in other than her house, then Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, will tear down His cover from her. &#8220;</span> </em>[67]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Manaawee said</strong>, &#8216;&#8221;Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, will tear down His cover from her&#8217; since because she has failed to take care of what she has been commanded with regard to covering herself from strangers, then this is the recompense she receives, the recompense being of the type of the action. What is apparent is that removal of her clothing means uncovering herself to strange males, for the purpose of sexual intercourse or that which leads to it. As opposed to the case if she were to remove her clothes amongst women, whilst covering her private parts, since there is no reason for that to enter into this warning.&#8221; [68]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">13. Striving to please the husband by every possible means.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hadeeth has already preceded containing the saying of the righteous wife, &#8220;<strong>&#8230; I will not taste sleep until you are pleased (with me)</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There also occurs in <em>al-Kabaa&#8217;ir</em> of adh-Dhahabee, &#8220;What is obligatory upon the woman is that she seeks the pleasure of her husband, and avoids angering him, and does not refuse him whenever he wants her. The woman must also know that she is like a slave to her husband, so she should not do anything affecting herself or her husbands wealth except with his permission. She should give precedence to his rights over her rights, and the rights of his relatives over the rights of her relatives, and she should keep herself clean and be ready for him to enjoy her. She should not boast at his expense of her beauty, nor rebuke him for any ugliness found in him. The woman must also be always modest and reserved in the presence of her husband, lower her eyes in front of him, obey his commands, remain silent when he speaks, keep far away from everything which angers him, avoid treachery when he is absent, with regard to his bed, his wealth and his house. She should ensure that her aroma is pleasant, be accustomed to using musk and perfume and cleaning her mouth with siwaak. She should be constant in adorning herself in his presence and not when he is absent. She should treat his family and relatives honourably, and consider something small from him as something great.&#8221; [69]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Means to Help the Wife to Attain These Attributes</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowing the greatness and exaltedness of Allaah, the Most High, and that He is the True God, the One who watches over His creation, and that His Religion is the true and straight way, and the laws He had prescribed are the straight path, and to know the perfectness of His Wisdom in whatever He orders and forbids, and whatever He decrees and chooses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore that His knowledge comprehends everything to be known, what is apparent and what is hidden: so He knows what benefits the servants and what harms them. He knows what will rectify them and what will ruin and corrupt them. He, the One free of all imperfections, is also the Most Merciful of all those who show mercy, so He does not order His servants except with that which is good for them in their Religion and their worldly-life, and brings about felicity for them in this world and the Hereafter; and He does not forbid them except from that which will bring misery for them in this world and the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whatever He, the One free of all imperfections, has prescribed is a mercy and a blessing; and whoever proceeds upon that way and follows it will be one of those who are happy and successful in both worlds, and will live a fine life filled with happiness and joy, they will not be miserable at all except in those things where they contradict the commandments of their Lord, the Mighty and Majestic. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">مَنْ عَمِلَ صَالِحًا مِّن ذَكَرٍ أَوْ أُنثَىٰ وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَلَنُحْيِيَنَّهُ حَيَاةً طَيِّبَةً ۖ وَلَنَجْزِيَنَّهُمْ أَجْرَهُم بِأَحْسَنِ مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Whoever does a righteous deed, whether male or female, and is a true-Believer, we will give him a good life (by granting him contentment) and we will reward them in the Hereafter in accordance with the best of what they used to do.&#8221;</span> [70]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the One free of all imperfections, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَنْ أَعْرَضَ عَن ذِكْرِي فَإِنَّ لَهُ مَعِيشَةً ضَنكًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And whoever turns away from my reminder, then there is for him a life of hardship and wretchedness.&#8221;</span> [71]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if the wife is aware of the greatness of Allaah, the Most High, and His perfect wisdom, and His all-encompassing knowledge, and His extensive mercy, then she will strive to obey Him, the Majestic and Most High, and to be obedient to her husband as He has commanded her. She will hasten to fulfill his rights without hesitation or laziness, and she will not say: &#8216;why is it the case that the man is in authority over me?!&#8217; &#8216;why do I have to obey him?!&#8217; &#8216;why &#8230; why?!&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا كَانَ لِمُؤْمِنٍ وَلَا مُؤْمِنَةٍ إِذَا قَضَى اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ أَمْرًا أَن يَكُونَ لَهُمُ الْخِيَرَةُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِمْ ۗ وَمَن يَعْصِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلَالًا مُّبِينًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;It is not for any believing man or woman, when Allaah and His Messenger have decreed any matter that they should have any option in their affair, and whoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger has strayed in plain error.&#8221;</span> [72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the One free of all imperfections, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">فَلَا وَرَبِّكَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ حَتَّىٰ يُحَكِّمُوكَ فِيمَا شَجَرَ بَيْنَهُمْ ثُمَّ لَا يَجِدُوا فِي أَنفُسِهِمْ حَرَجًا مِّمَّا قَضَيْتَ وَيُسَلِّمُوا تَسْلِيمًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;So no, by your Lord, they cannot be Believers until they make you, 0 Muhammad, judge in all disputes between them, then they do not find any opposition in themselves against your judgements, and they accept them with full submission.&#8221;</span> [73]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the means which will help her to attain the attribute of the righteous women is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">• Desire for that which Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, has prepared for the righteous women in Paradise </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The comprehensive good and the huge reward which is such as has been seen by no eye, heard by no ear, nor imagined by any human heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>• Fear of the retribution and Anger of Allaah, the One free of all imperfections and the Most High </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fear of all that He has prepared for the disobedient in the Hereafter with regard to punishment, disgrace, and severe and painful torment, may Allaah save us from that, by His grace and favour.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have also already brought two chapters: one in encouragement of looking after the rights of the husband, and the other warning against neglecting his rights.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">• Seeking the Aid of Allaah, the Most High</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since the attainment of the smallest good is not possible unless Allaah, the Most High, guides and sets one straight. Concerning this Allaah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">فَالصَّالِحَاتُ قَانِتَاتٌ حَافِظَاتٌ لِّلْغَيْبِ بِمَا حَفِظَ اللَّهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Therefore the righteous women are obedient to Allaah and their husbands, and guard that which Allaah has ordered them to guard (their chastity and their husbands property) in the absence of their husbands.&#8221;</span> [74]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the meaning of  <strong>بِمَا حَفِظَ اللَّهُ </strong> is:&#8217;by Allaah&#8217;s guarding and protecting them when they become like that.&#8217; This is what at-Tabaree [75] and a group of the scholars of tafseer said.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">From the greatest aids to a wife&#8217;s righteousness is:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>• That she keeps company with righteous and pious women, that she listens to them, and seeks to be like them; and that she avoids the company of corrupt women, and avoids sitting with them and listening to them. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed she should beware of observing their making a display of themselves, and showing their nakedness, and their evil manners, whether this is seen by means of television, video or whatever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;The example of the righteous companion and the evil companion is like that of a seller of musk and the blacksmiths bellows. From the musk seller you will either buy some musk or at least enjoy its good smell. But the bellows of the blacksmith will either burn your house or your clothes, or at least you will receive a bad smell from it. &#8220;</span></em> [76]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>An-Nawawee</strong> <strong>said</strong></span>, &#8220;It shows the excellence of sitting with the righteous, and the people of good, and those possessing good character and fine manners and piety, and the people of knowledge and refinement; and the forbiddence of sitting with the people of evil, and the people of innovation, and those who backbite the people, or those who are commonly involved in shamelessness and idleness, and such reprehensible folk.&#8221; [77]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Ar-Raaghib said</span></strong>, &#8220;This hadeeth indicates that it is a duty upon a person to strive to the utmost of his ability to accompany and sit with good people, since this may cause a bad person to become a person of good, just as accompanying evil people may turn a person from good to bad. So just as it is seen that water and air can be corrupted by being next to a rotting corpse, then what do you think will be the effect upon human souls which are such that they accept and take on the good and the evil which they see?!&#8221; [78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from that which will make it easier for a woman to attain the attributes of the righteous women: is that she should choose a righteous husband, and the woman should straight away reject any proposal of marriage unless they come from a person who is good in his practice of the Religion and his manners, who is such that he will assist her upon the affairs of the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;If there comes to you </span></em>[79] <em><span style="color:#808000;">one </span></em>[80]<em><span style="color:#808000;"> whose character and Religion are pleasing to you, then marry (her) to him; if you do not do so it will result in tribulation upon the earth and widespread corruption.&#8221; </span></em>[81]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Epilogue</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As it is the case that the woman is commanded to be obedient to her husband, and to seek to please him, and to take care of his rights, then it is also the case that the husband is commanded to treat her well, and with kindness, and to have patience with any bad characteristics and the like that may be seen from her. He must give her rights of provision and clothing, and that he lives with her in a good and honourable manner, as Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَعَاشِرُوهُنَّ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And live with them in a good manner.&#8221;</span> [82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#808000;"><em>Take care of the women.</em></span>&#8221; [83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said, &#8220;<em><span style="color:#808000;">The most complete of the Believers are the best of them in manners, and the best of them are those who are best to their women</span></em>.&#8221; [84]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Iyaas ibn &#8216; Abdullaah ibn Abee Dhubaab, <em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em> , who said that the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>&#8221;Do not beat the female servants of Allaah. So &#8216;Umar came to the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) and said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah! The women have become emboldened towards their husbands. </em></span>[85]<span style="color:#808000;"><em> So he gave permission to strike them, so they were struck. Then many women came to the wives of Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) (complaining about their husbands), so in the morning he said: Seventy women have this night visited the family of Muhammad, each of them complaining about her husband. So you will not find those </em></span>[86] [87]<span style="color:#808000;"><em> men to be the best amongst you.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This concludes what we wished to draw attention to in this brief treatise, which, if Allaah wills, will be beneficial. &#8220;How free and far removed from all imperfections You are, O Allaah, and all praise is for You. I declare You free of all defects and praise You alone. I testify that none has the right to be worshipped but You. I seek Your forgiveness and turn in repentance to You.&#8221; [88]</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 78 : Points 133</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Whichever woman gives herself away in marriage to a man, then she will not be permissible for him. They are both to be punished if he has violated her, unless the marriage is performed with a guardian (<em>walee</em>), two just witnesses and a dower (<em>sadaaq</em>) </strong></span>[1].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] The Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> “ There is no marriage without a guardian (walee).” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Ahmad, Abu Daawood (Eng. trans. 2/558/no.2080) and at-Tirmidhee.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Abaas (<em>radiallaahu anhu</em>) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“There is no marriage except with a guardian advising and two just witnesses.” </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by al-Baihaqee, ash-Shaafi’ee in his Musnad and al-Baghaawee in Sharhus-Sunnah (9/45).]</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 54: Point 96</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that temporary marriage of convenience (<em>al-Mut`ah)</em> and marrying a woman merely to make her lawful for her previous husband (<em>al-Isti<u>h</u>laal)</em> are forbidden till the Day of Resurrection.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/temporary-marriage-of-convenience-al-mutah-is-forbidden-till-the-day-of-resurrection" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a matter of <em>fiqh</em> (jurisprudence). However, he brought it here because it has a connection to `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief). Because <em>al-Mut`ah</em> (temporary marriage of convenience) is to declare as lawful something which Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, has made forbidden. And what this term <em>al-Mut`ah</em> (temporary marriage of convenience) means; to marry a woman for a certain set period whether it be long or short and after it, then the marriage ends automatically and does not require divorce.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Mut`ah</em>; this temporary marriage, it used to be permissible at the beginning of Islaam and then the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> forbade it at the Battle of Khaybar.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> Then he permitted it on the day of the Conquest of Makkah. Then he forbade it forever.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So to begin with, it was lawful then it was made forbidden. Then it was permitted then it was forbidden forever. And the Muslims are united in consensus (<em>Ijmaa`)</em> that it is forbidden and that it is <em>nikaa<u>h</u>un baa<u>t</u>il</em> (baseless marriage). And there is consensus of this nation that it is forbidden, no-one disagrees with regard to that except for the <strong>Raafi<u>d</u>ah Ja`firee Shee`ah</strong>. They are the ones who contradict with regard to it. And their differing is not counted and has no value. So there is consensus (<em>Ijmaa</em>`) and text to show that temporary marriage of convenience (<em>al-Mut`ah)</em> is forbidden. It is a futile marriage and it has the ruling of <em>zinaa</em> (fornication).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><em>“al-Mut`ah tan-nisaa,”</em> </strong>Why did Imaam al-Barbahaaree say <em>Mut</em>`<em>ah</em>, meaning <em>Mut’ah</em> of the women, excluding by that <em>Mut`ah</em> of Hajj, which is that a person does <em>Tamattu</em>`, performing `Umrah and then performing Hajj. This is not what is meant here, for Hajj <em>Tamattu</em>` is what was supported by the majority of the People of Knowledge and no-one disagrees with regard to it except a small number but as for <em>Mut</em>`<em>ah</em> of the women meaning temporary marriage, then it’s forbidden by consensus, no-one disagrees about it from those whom disagreement is counted. Whereas, Mut’ah in Hajj is a matter of fiqh but as for Mut’ah, which is temporary marriage, then it is a matter, which has a connection to aqeedah (creed and belief) because it is making permissible that which Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, has made forbidden.</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> The Battle of Khaybar, the well-known battle against the Jews of Khaybar in the 7<sup>th</sup> year of <em>Hijrah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhaariyy reported in his <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (4,261) and also reported by Muslim in his <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (1,407) from Aliyy <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> who said Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> forbade temporary marriage to the women on the day of Khaybar and he forbade eating the meat of domestic donkeys.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> <u>H</u>adeeth for that reported by Muslim in his <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (1,406) from Sabrah al-Juhanee that, He was with Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“O people, I have permitted you to take pleasure from the women and Allaah has forbidden that now until the Day of Resurrection. So, whoever has something from them then let that go on its way and do not take from anything that you have given to them.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in one wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> commanded us with <em>al-Mut`ah</em> (temporary marriage) in the year of the conquest when we entered Makkah then we did not depart from it until he had forbidden us from it.”</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And if a man divorces his wife three times then she has become forbidden for him,” </strong>if a man divorces his wife three times (three separate times divorces) then she becomes forbidden for him by consensus (<em>ijmaa`)</em> just as if he were to say “you are divorced” <strong>then</strong> afterwards he says “you are divorced” and <strong>then</strong> he says “you are divorced” or if he says to his wife “you are divorced <strong>then</strong> divorced or and so divorced” because this indicates a sequence and she becomes irrevocably divorced and separated from him if the number of divorces reaches three and she becomes forbidden for him unless and until she has married another husband besides him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:right;">الطَّلَاقُ مَرَّتَانِ ۖ فَإِمْسَاكٌ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ تَسْرِيحٌ بِإِحْسَانٍ ۗ وَلَا يَحِلُّ لَكُمْ أَن تَأْخُذُوا مِمَّا آتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ شَيْئًا إِلَّا أَن يَخَافَا أَلَّا يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ اللَّهِ ۖ فَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلَّا يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ اللَّهِ فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَا فِيمَا افْتَدَتْ بِهِ ۗ تِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللَّهِ فَلَا تَعْتَدُوهَا ۚ وَمَن يَتَعَدَّ حُدُودَ اللَّهِ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الظَّالِمُونَ &#8211; 2:229</p>
<p style="text-align:right;">فَإِن طَلَّقَهَا فَلَا تَحِلُّ لَهُ مِن بَعْدُ حَتَّىٰ تَنكِحَ زَوْجًا غَيْرَهُ ۗ فَإِن طَلَّقَهَا فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِمَا أَن يَتَرَاجَعَا إِن ظَنَّا أَن يُقِيمَا حُدُودَ اللَّهِ ۗ وَتِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللَّهِ يُبَيِّنُهَا لِقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ &#8211; 2:230</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Divorce is twice then you may either retain her upon reasonable terms or release her in a good manner.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Up until His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if then he divorces her for the third time then she is not permissible for him after that unless and until she has married another husband besides him. And if he (second husband) then divorces her, in that case there is no harm if the two of them wish to reunite provided that they think they can establish the limits laid down by Allaah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah</em> 229-230)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is if the divorces are separate even if it is within a single sitting but as for a person who says “you are divorced, you are divorced, you are divorced” without a word of adding in between, in this case we examine if he intended by repeating it just to emphasise it then it will be a single divorce but if he was intending establishing that he wanted to divorce her three times then she will be irrevocably divorced from him if it reaches the third one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if the divorces are said with a single word such as his saying “you are divorced three times over” or “you are divorced three times” then the majority hold that it counts as three divorces and she becomes separate irrevocably from him and forbidden for him unless and until she marries a different husband besides him. And this is the position of the four Imaams but in the saying of some of the verifiers that the three is counted only as one divorce and the matter; there is prolonged disagreement with regards to it. However, what will suffice us is that we know that divorce three times over makes her forbidden for him not forever more but rather it makes her forbidden for him unless and until she marries a different husband besides him and then he divorces her in that case. But as for entering into matters of disagreement then this does not concern us at the moment. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the intent of the author in entering these matters in `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief), and Allaah knows best, is to make clear that the matter of marriage is an important matter, which is obligatory to give care and attention to in accordance with legislated principles for it so that people should not be lax about it and about its legal procedures and because the book is entitled <em>Sharhus-Sunnah</em>; literally ’An Explanation of the Sunnah’ meaning clarification of the Sunnah in every matter and from that is the issues of marriage.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Translator’s side point: People of Knowledge make clear the woman marrying her second husband from the authentic evidences, has to be correct in marrying the second husband, not just as a trick to try and get back to the first one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said in his explanation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his saying, <strong>“So</strong> <strong>if a man divorces his wife three times then she has become forbidden for him and she will not be permissible for him unless she marries another husband besides him,” </strong>this matter, there is a great disagreement about it amongst the scholars. The majority hold that if a man divorces his wife three times at once with a single saying then she becomes forbidden for him; divorced from him. Whereas, from the People of Knowledge, there are some who say that the divorce, which makes her forbidden, is the divorce in accordance with the Sunnah that he divorces her in a period that is free from menses and he has not had sexual relations with her. So, as for divorcing three times with a single word then it is counted as one and a middle and balanced saying is that it’s counted still as three in accordance with his intention and the matter, there is a great deal of speech about it and Allaah is the one who grants success.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lessons 35 : Point 47</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And there is no marriage except with a guardian (<em>walee)</em> and two just witnesses and a dower (<em>sadaaq)</em> whether it be a small amount or a large amount. And whoever does not have a guardian then the ruler is the guardian for one who does not have a guardian (<em>walee</em>)</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/there-is-no-marriage-except-with-a-guardian-two-just-witnesses-a-dower" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a <em>fiqh</em> issue and it is an explanation of the conditions for the correctness of marriage (<em>nikaah)</em> with the <em>jumhoor</em> (majority) of scholars and from them is that it should be along with the permission of the <em>walee </em>(guardian) and that a woman may not marry herself off and from its conditions is <em>al</em> <em>ish</em>&#8211;<em>haad</em> (to have witnesses) to the contracting of the marriage. So, a marriage may not be contracted in secret without witnesses. So, from the position of the Muslims is to openly announce marriage and the matter of the <em>walee</em> (having a guardian) is a point where there is some disagreement. The <em>jumhoor</em> (great majority) hold that having the <em>walee </em>(guardian) is essential whereas with the <em>Hanafees</em>, there is no harm in a woman marrying herself off without the permission of the guardian. However, this is a saying that is not the correct saying, it is contrary to the evidence because of his saying <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“There is no marriage except with a guardian and with two just witnesses.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying in the other <u>h</u>adeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“A woman may not marry off another woman and a woman may not marry off herself, for the fornicatress (the one who commits zina, fornication) is the one who marries herself off.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whichever woman gets married without the permission of her guardian then her marriage is invalid, invalid, invalid.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So even though some of the jurists declare it to be correct (meaning a woman getting married without the permission of her guardian; <em>walee</em>) based upon <em>ijtihaad</em> (personal striving) from that scholar then what is counted is the evidence and therefore the author stated this matter even though it is a matter of <em>fiqh</em> to make clear that this is the correct position and it is the position which the majority of the People of Knowledge were upon that which is proven by the Prophetic Sunnah and in order that the marriages of the Muslims should be correctly regulated and not be entered upon by secrecy and <em>i<u>h</u>tiyaalaat</em> (fraudulent tricks). Rather they should be clear and open for indeed marriages are from the most important of affairs because upon them families are built and from them offspring are produced and upon them lineages are built and something even more severe is built upon them rendering the private parts lawful. So, therefore it is essential that the legislated principles are applied to contract a marriage as occurs in the <em>a<u>h</u>aadeeth</em> and in the <em>aayahs</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, <strong>“And it should be with a <em>sadaaq </em>(dower) and with a dower whether it’s a small amount or a large amount,” </strong>as for the <em>sadaaq</em> (dower) then it is not a condition (<em>shar<u>t)</u></em>. However, it is <em>waajib</em> (obligation). And therefore, if the marriage were to be contracted without a <em>sadaaq</em> (dower) then the contracting of the marriage will be correct. However, a <em>sadaaq</em> (dower) will be appointed for her in accordance with that of women who are like her because this is a right of hers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And whoever does not have a <em>walee</em> (guardian) then the ruler is the guardian for the one who does not have a guardian,” </strong>having a <em>walee</em> (guardian) is essential.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>walee</em> (guardian) is the wife’s close male relatives; the closest and then the next closest from them. Firstly, her father then her grandfather and so on upwards and then her son and the son of her son and so on downwards and then her full brother and then her brother through her father; meaning her brother who shares the same father but the mother is different and then her full paternal uncle and then her uncle who is the brother of her father and then the son of her full uncle (son of the father’s brother) and then the son of her uncle who is the brother of her father. This is the guardian (<em>walee)</em> of the woman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if it occurs that a woman does not have a <em>walee</em> (guardian) from her close male relatives then her guardianship is taken on by the ruler or the one who represents the ruler and he is the judge in the court. So marriage must have regulating principles and it may not be anarchy just in accordance with the desires and lusts of the people. <a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn3">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad and Aboo Daawood and At-Tirmithee and Ad-Daarimee and A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>a<u>h</u>aawiyy in <em>Shar<u>h</u> Ma`aanee al-Aathaar</em> from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Moosaa Al-Ash`aree <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu</em> `<em>anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> This <u>h</u>adeeth was declared <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (authentic) by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy as <u>h</u>adeeth 1,839 in <em>Irwa al Ghaleel </em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Reported by Ibn Maajah and Ad-Daaraqutnee in his <em>Sunan</em> and Al-Bayhaqee in his <em>Sunan al-Kubraa</em> from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah and it was declared <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (authentic) by Ibn al-Mulaqqin in <em>Al-Badr Al-Muneer</em> to the standard of Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaaniyy in his checking of Ibn Maajah declared this <u>h</u>adeeth <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> except for the sentence about <em>az</em>&#8211;<em>zaaniyah</em> (fornicatress), the first part being authentic supported by other narrations; <strong>“A woman may not marry off another woman and a woman may not marry herself off”</strong>, that being authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad in his <em>musnad</em> and by Aboo Daawood, At-Tirmithee and Ad-Daarimee and by A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>a<u>h</u>aawiyy in <em>Sharh Ma`aanee al-Aathaar</em> from a <u>h</u>adeeth of `Aa`ishah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhaa</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Side point:</strong> This <u>h</u>adeeth was declared <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (authentic) also by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn3">[4]</a><strong>Side point:</strong> Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said in his explanation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And there is no marriage except with a guardian and with two just witnesses with a dower whether it be a small amount or a large amount,” </strong>this is the position of the <em>jumhoor</em> (the great majority) and it is what is the truth. So, therefore, those who say that the woman can marry off herself without the permission of her guardian is a saying, which is false, opposite to the evidences and contrary to them. Indeed, it opens up a breach for the people of corruption. So, it is obligatory to believe that this is futile. And likewise, her getting married without a dower. However, if the dower is not stated at the marriage then what is correct is that it does not make it null and void and is still counted as a valid marriage but she should be given a dower the same as women who are like her and her close relatives and women of her age; meaning the dower that is well-known amongst the people, whether it be a small amount or a large amount, at that time and at that place and this woman is called <em>Anwalliyah</em>; one who has given up the affair to someone else with the jurists.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Whoever</strong><strong> does not have a guardian then the ruler is the guardian for one who has no guardian; a <em>walee</em>,” </strong>this is the correct saying. So the woman who does not have a guardian then her guardian will be the ruler because of the <u>h</u>adeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The ruler is the guardian for the one who does not have a guardian.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the evidences with regard to the necessity of having a <em>walee</em> that brings some of the <em>aayahs</em> of the Qur·aan, each of the <em>aayahs</em> that they bring Sooratun-Noor (24) <em>aayah</em> 32, Sooratul-Baqarah (2) <em>aayah</em> 221, Sooratul-Baqarah (2) <em>aayah</em> 232, each of them in an address with regard to marrying the women and the address with regard to marrying off is the addresses to the men; men marrying off the women as opposed to an address to the women looking to get married. With regard to the point where the Shaykh mentioned that a woman getting married without any guardian and saying that it’s permissible for a woman to marry herself off without any guardian, this opens up a door to people who want to cause corruption.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they mention in the footnote, Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee himself he said, “I myself heard that there was one of the jurists from the <em>Hanafee’s</em> in one of the Arab lands and he had a son who was deviant and he used to hear from his father that it is not a condition for marriage that a woman has the permission of her guardian. So, this son when he used to hear that, used to accompany a group of people who were evildoers and they used to do illicit sexual acts with the women. He taught theevil group that what they should do is say to the prostitute woman, when you go to pay her you should say, “marry yourself to me” and she should say “I marry myself to you” and he should say “I accept it” and then when he’s finished his night with her then you say to her “you’re divorced” and on the second night, you can do it with a different woman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh said, “So you can see that this <em>madhab</em> has been used here contrary to the evidence as a means for causing corruption even though the <em>Hanafee</em> <em>madhab</em> itself does not make the like of this permissible. However, it makes permissible only a marriage, which is going to be permanent and it does not make permissible mixing waters of one man with another when divorced. Rather, there must be an `<em>iddah</em> (waiting period) making sure her womb is clear, even a woman who frees herself by <em>khulah</em> or a slave girl who is poor.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Sixth : Menses &amp; Legal Sexual Intercourse</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is prohibited for a husband to have sexual intercourse with his menstruating wife, and it is not allowed for her to make it possible for him. Allah (Azza wa Jal) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{ويسألونك عن المحيض قُل هُوَ أذًى فاعتَزِلُوا النِّساءَ في المَحيض ولا تقربوهُنَّ حتى يطْهُرن }</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Surah Al-Baqarah 2:222]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;They ask you concerning menstruation. Say: that is an Adha (a harmful thing for a husband to have a sexual intercourse with his wife while she is having her menses), therefore keep away from women during menses and go not unto them till they have been purified (from menses and have taken a bath).&#8221;</strong> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 222).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Menses here refers to the period of menstruation and the private part of the woman is the prohibited place. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم) said: &#8220;<strong>Do everything except sexual intercourse</strong>.&#8221; [40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Muslims had Ijmaa&#8217; prohibiting sexual intercourse with a menstruating woman. It is not permissible for anyone who believes in Allah and in the Day of Judgment to practice this act. Anyone who does this then he had disobeyed Allah and His Messenger and followed a path other than the believers path [41].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is related that Imam Ash-Shaafiee&#8217; had said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>Anyone who does such an act then he had committed a Great Sin</strong>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Other scholars of the same school said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>Anyone who sees it permissible to have sexual intercourse with a menstruating woman then a decree of his Kufr (rejection of Faith) should be made</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In order to break the intensity of sexual desire, it is permissible (and praise is due to Allah) to kiss, hug and fondle a menstruating woman in places other than her private parts. It is important, however, that the husband does not approach the area between the knees and the navel without laying a cover sheet as &#8216;Aisha ( رضي الله عنها) explained:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;He (صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم) used to order me to put an Izar (dress worn below the waist) and used to fondle me (during her menses)&#8221;</strong> [42].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[40] Saheeh Muslim (English) V 1. P.175, Hadeeth # 592.<br />
[41] Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) warns saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{ ومن يُشاققِ الرَّسول من بَعدِ ما تبينَ لهُ الهُدى ويتَّبِعُ غيرَ سبيل المؤمنين نُوَلِّهِ ما تَولَّى ونصلِهِ جَهَنَّم وساءتْ مَصيراً }<br />
&#8211; Surah an-Nisa 115</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger (Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم)) after the Right Path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers&#8217; way, We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and burn him in Hell;&#8211;what an evil destination.&#8221;</strong> (Qur&#8217;an 4: 115)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: It is known that many people are pessimistic about the month of Safar regarding many affairs. Such people, for example, do not conclude <strong>marriage contracts</strong> during Safar. Moreover, many people believe that it is not permissible to <strong>break a stick, knot ropes, or entwine fingers</strong> when concluding a marriage contract for this leads to failure of the concerned marriage and disharmony between the spouses. Since all the foregoing are beliefs bearing on ‘Aqidah (creed), could you please advise and clarify the ruling on it? May Allah guide us all to all that He loves and is pleased with.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Pessimism about Safar is not permissible. It is a characteristic of Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic time of ignorance)</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Safar &#8211; just like all other months &#8211; does not bring good or evil, as good is only from Allah (Glorified be He) and evil is predestined by Him. Moreover, it is authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) annulled the concept of pessimism when he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There is no ‘Adwa (contagion, disease transmission naturally by itself not by the Decree of Allah), nor is there any Tiyarah (evil omen), nor is there any Hamah (pre-Islamic superstitious belief that the bones of a dead person turn into an owl), nor is there Safar (the month of Safar was believed to bring bad luck during Jahiliyyah).</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Agreed upon by Imams Al-Bukhari and Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same applies to pessimism about entwining fingers, breaking a stick, etc., when concluding a marriage contract. Such beliefs are false, baseless, and thus they should not be adopted by a Muslim. May Allah grant us all success!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">by Shaykh Allaama Muhammad bin Salih al-Uthaymeen (d.1421 A.H.)<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Getting married with the intention of divorce is <em>Haraam</em> because it is cheating the wife and her family</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Esteemed Shaykh Muhammad bin Salih al-Uthaymeen may Allaah have mercy upon him was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">A person wanted to travel outside this country because he had been delegated to do so, and he wanted to protect himself by getting married from that country for a specific time, then after that he will divorce this wife, he would have married her without informing her that he will divorce her, so what is the verdict regarding his action?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Shaykh answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This marriage with the intention of divorce is of two situations: either he makes it a condition in the contract, that he marries her for a month or a year, or until he completes his studies, then this is a marriage of <em>Muta’</em> (temporary marriage) and this is <em>Haraam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or either, he intends that without making it a condition, so what is well-known from the <em>Madhab</em> of the Hanabila, that this is <em>Haraam</em>, and that the marriage contract is invalid because they say that the one who makes this intention is similar to the one who makes a condition (i.e. specific period of time), due to the saying of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed actions are but by intentions and indeed every person will have what they intended.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a man marries a woman from someone who has pronounced a divorce from her three times, and he marries her to make her <em>Halaal</em> for her previous husband so he can re-marry her, and then he divorces for this reason then this type of  <em>Nikah</em> (Marriage contract) is invalid, even if this <em>Nikah</em> was without the condition of divorcing her, since the one who makes the intention of doing this is like the one who makes it a condition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, if getting married with the intention of making the wife permissible for her previous husband invalidates the marriage contract then the intention of <em>Muta’</em> also invalidates the marriage contract,  this is the opinion of the Hanabila.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second opinion of the people of knowledge regarding this issue is: that it is correct for a man to marry a woman and he has the intention to divorce her, if he leaves that  country, like those foreigners who go abroad for education, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their reasoning is that the man has not made a condition (of a specific period of time), and the difference between this and <em>Muta’</em> is, that in <em>Muta’</em> if the time period finishes then a separation takes place between the husband and wife, whether the husband likes it or not, this is contradictory to the other way, since it is possible for him to want and have interest in the wife and she continues to remain with him, and this is one of the two sayings of Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What I say is, that this is correct, it is not <em>Muta’</em> since the definition of <em>Muta’</em> (temporary marriage) cannot be applied to this, but marriage with the intention of divorce is <em>Haraam</em> from the angle that it is cheating the wife and her family.   Indeed the Prophet has made cheating and deception  <em>Haraam</em>, and if the wife came to know that this man did not want to marry her except for this period of time, she would not have married him, and her family would also not marry her to him since the man would not allow his daughter to marry a person who has the intention of divorcing her when he has finished with his need from her, so how can this man allow for himself to deal with others with that which he does not allow for them to deal with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This contradicts <em>Eemaan</em>, due to the saying of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘None of you truly believe until you love for your brother what you love for yourself.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since I have heard that some people have taken this verdict as a means which leads to a matter that no-one holds permissible which is that some people travel to countries only to get married (temporarily). They go to these countries so they can get married and then they stay with this wife, whom they marry with the intention of a temporary period, then they return however long Allaah wills.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is also seriously forbidden in this issue, so it is better to close this door, due to what is there from cheating, deception and dishonesty and because this opens the door and the people are ignorant, and most people are not prevented due to following their desires, transgressing against what Allaah has made <em>Haraam</em>.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>FIRST</strong>: To Completely Prevent Pregnancy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is not permissible because:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">(a) it will diminish the Islamic population and this is against the objective of Sharee&#8217;aa which aims at increasing the population of Muslims.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">(b) the woman is unable to guarantee against the death of her existing children and thus she may die without having any children.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>SECOND</strong>: To Temporarily Prevent Pregnancy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This applies if the woman had many pregnancies and this is beginning to weaken her. If she wants to regulate her pregnancy so as to have it once every two years, then given the approval of her husband, it is permissible for her to use contraceptives as long as their use does not harm her. The Sahabah used to perform <strong>Coitus Interrupts</strong> [59] and they were not prevented (i.e., by the Prophet-صلى الله عليه و سلم). This method involves regular sexual intercourse with the wife except at the time of ejaculation, the husband pulls out and ejaculates outside the private part of the woman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[59] Narrated Jabir: &#8220;we used to practice Coitus Interrupts during the life of time of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم)&#8221;. Collected by Al-Bukhari in his in Saheeh (Arabic-English) V.7, P.102</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> What is the ruling regarding me saying to my wife that she is divorced jokingly with laughter?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân:</strong> There is no joking or laughing when it comes to the divorce. Its joking is seriousness, as the prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said. If you jokingly tell her that she is divorced, she is divorced.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner:</strong> As soon as a man receives more money, he thinks of polygyny. His purpose is not to build a family. His purpose is enjoyment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Albânî:</strong> That is good. That is good. That is good.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question:</strong> Does he not fall into something?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Albânî</strong>: Do you want to say that he falls into Haram? His purpose is allowed and he does not fall into any prohibition. However, we order him to add a recommended factor to this allowed deed. We order him to increase the Ummah of Muhammad (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) so that he is rewarded more with his Lord when he raises his offspring.</p>

<span style="color:#808080;"> Source: ibnothaimeen.com/all/noor/article_6493.shtml</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"> Video by: aFatwa.com (site is down)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Is it permissible for the virgin woman who has no wali (guardian) or without his presence to marry herself off or not? And is there in this ruling a difference between a virgin or a previously married whether divorced or widowed?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn &#8216;Uthaymin</strong>: It is not permissible for the woman to marry herself off or others whether she is a virgin or previously married.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that is because Allâh, Glorified and Exalted, has made the contract of marriage in the hands of other than the woman as He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{<span style="color:#008000;">And do not marry polytheistic women</span>}<br />
(The Qur&#8217;ân, interpretation of the meaning 2:221)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In men He said</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{<span style="color:#008000;">And do not let marry polytheistic men</span>}<br />
(The Qur&#8217;ân, interpretation of the meaning 2:221)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and He added that the marriage is for the husband himself but with the women He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{<span style="color:#008000;">And do not let marry polytheistic men [to your women] until they believe</span>.}<br />
(The Qur&#8217;ân, interpretation of the meaning 2:221)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He made the marriage in the hands of other than the woman and He, Glorified and Exalted, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{<span style="color:#008000;">Do not prevent them from remarrying their [former] husbands if they agree among themselves on an acceptable basis</span>.}<br />
(The Qur&#8217;ân, interpretation of the meaning 2:232)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the narration of the Prophet, peace &amp; blessings of Allâh be upon him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There&#8217;s no marriage without a wali (guardian).</strong></span>&#8221; (Bukhâri)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So that is the proof of the narration that there&#8217;s no other option for the woman than with a guardian marrying her off.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As from the point of view then the woman is deficient in intellect and religion as she is limited in thinking and she is also weak in religion and I say this from the narration of the Messenger of Allâh, peace &amp; blessings of Allâh be upon him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">I have not seen anyone more deficient in intellect and religion than you. A cautious sensible man can be led astray by some of you</span>.&#8221; (Bukhâri)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the saying of Allâh Almighty:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{<span style="color:#008000;">Men are in charge of women by [right of] what Allâh has given one over the other and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth</span>.}<br />
(The Qur&#8217;ân, interpretation of the meaning 4:34)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if it wasn&#8217;t for the deficiency of the woman then a man would not be in charge of her but rather in the âyah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{<span style="color:#008000;">by [right of] what Allâh has given one over the other</span>}<br />
(The Qur&#8217;ân, interpretation of the meaning 4:34)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if the woman was in such description, as the Qur&#8217;ân and Sunnah indicated, from deficiency of intellect and religion then she is in need of a guiding guardian who knows the appropriate/capable and knows the interests of marriage and knows who the woman is for him until he decides to marry her off or refrain (from such). This is why there should be a guardian for the woman to marry her off within the known requirements to the people of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the woman shall not marry herself off whether she is a virgin or previously married. However, there is an issue that should be noted/addressed which is that a woman must be asked for permission and consent whether she was a virgin or previously married and whether the one who marries her off is her father or anyone else. And the most correct saying is that it is not permissible for the man to marry his daughter off or anyone else until she agrees upon that husband and gives permission.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if she is a virgin then her permission is enough by being silence and if she stated/uttered to agree then that is better/complete however being silent is enough. And if she is previously married then she must state (speak) to agree and says &#8216;Yes&#8217; that she agrees to marry this man.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the guardian whether it is the father or anyone else, he must describe the suitor to the woman with a description that will take her to know him (suitor). So he does not say &#8216;do you want me to marry you to such&#8217; until he clarifies to her the situation of this man and his description because as much as the man wants in a woman in beauty and righteousness, a woman wants this too in a man in beauty and righteousness. Therefore the man must clarify to the woman whose permission is sought (for marriage) in a way which takes her to know him but vagueness will not lead to the goal. Of course if the woman trusts fully her guardian and will suffice with what her guardian sees and she asked for example &#8216;are you happy/convinced with him (the suitor)&#8217; in regards to his religion and to his manners then this would suffice if she trusts him and she is pleased with what he (guardian) is pleased with.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, may He be Blessed and Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-3-38.png" alt="" width="484" height="41" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;This is the time when Zakariya invoked his Lord, saying: <strong>&#8216;O my Lord! Grant me from You, a good offspring. You are indeed the All-Hearer of invocations.</strong>&#8216;&#8221;</span> [Surah Aali &#8216;Imraan: 38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says quoting Zakariya:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-19-5.png" alt="" width="437" height="37" /><br />
<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-19-6.png" alt="" width="484" height="41" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;<strong>And verily, I fear my relatives after me, since my wife is barren. So give me from Yourself a walee (righteous worshipper) who will inherit me and inherit the posterity of Ya&#8217;qoob. And make him, my Lord, one with whom You are well-pleased.</strong>”</span> [Surah Maryam: 5-6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ash-Shanqeetee said in Adwaa-ul-Bayaan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allaah&#8217;s statement in this noble verse: &#8216;So give me from Yourself a walee&#8217; – what is meant by the word walee here is a son specifically and not any other type of walee (righteous person). This is based on proof found in Allaah&#8217;s saying while relating the same story: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;This is the time when Zakariya invoked his Lord, saying: &#8216;O my Lord! Grant me from You, a good offspring. You are indeed the All-Hearer of invocation.</span>&#8221; [Surah Aali &#8216;Imraan: 38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also indicates that what is meant (by the word walee, i.e. righteous person) here is a child by His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-21-89.png" alt="" width="484" height="41" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And remember Zakariya when he cried to his Lord: &#8216;O my Lord, leave me not single! You are the best of the inheritors.&#8221;&#8217;</span> [Surah Al-Anbiyaa: 89] &#8216;Leave me not single&#8217; means: &#8216;Alone and without a child.&#8217;”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[End of Ash-Shanqeetee&#8217;s words] [Adwaa-ul-Bayaan (3/365)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is for this reason that from amongst the supplications of the believers – &#8220;those from whom We shall accept the best of their deeds and overlook their evil deeds, they shall be among the dwellers of Paradise – a promise of truth, which they have been promised” – is that which Allaah has mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-46-15.png" alt="" width="466" height="105" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;My Lord! Grant me the power and ability that I may be grateful for Your Favour which You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents, and that I may do righteous good deeds, such as please You, and make my offspring good. Truly, I have turned to You in repentance, and truly I am one of the Muslims.”</span> [Surah Al-Ahqaaf: 15]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Below is the introduction by the major scholar Ash-Shaykh Muqbil Bin Haadee Al-Waadi&#8217;ee Rahimahullaah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I am familiar with what the author, Umm Salamah bint &#8216;Alee Al-&#8216;Abaasee has written entitled <strong>Al-Intisaaru li Huqooqee al- Mu&#8217;minaat (supporting the rights of the believing women)</strong>. I found it to be a beneficial book, as it contains verses from the Book of Allah and traditions from the Messenger of Allaah, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam. The Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah are beneficial knowledge. Whoever does not seek guidance from then will not find guidance in anything else as our Lord subhaanahu wa ta&#8217;ala says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221;In what other speech except Allah and His proofs will you believe?&#8221; (sooratul-Jaathiyyah 45:6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She performed a great duty in selecting the topic of the believing women&#8217;s rights. Many people are neglectful in this area, or they leave it off altogether. Therefore, she reminded the fathers, close male family members, and husbands about what Allah has made obligatory upon them, as well as what He has strongly suggested for them to do. Allaah subhaanahu wa ta&#8217;ala says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221;Oh you who believe, save yourselves and your family from a fire which is fueled by men and stones.&#8221;  (sooratut-Tahreem 66:6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Verily in the author are gathered some praiseworthy traits: these include abstaining from worldly pleasures, exemplary character, spreading beneficial knowledge, and not wasting her time. She spends her time by herself in the women&#8217;s library, substitute teaching for Umm &#8216;Abdillaah Al-Waadi&#8217;iyyah when she is absent, and effective lecturing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Verily the islamic community is in great need of righteous women who can care for their Muslim sisters so that the corrupted and corrupting callers do not lead them astray. The wives of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam as well as the female companions played a major role in spreading the prophetic traditions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In conclusion, I advise the author and her sisters to make a great effort in spreading beneficial knowledge from the Noble Qur&#8217;aan, the prophetic traditions, and the &#8216;Arabic Language, to become knowledgable in Allaah&#8217;s Religion, to place an importance on spreading that knowledge by writing and inviting to Allaah, and teaching the ignorant women. If Allaah guides one woman by your hand, it is better for you than a red camel.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah firmly establish us all on what He loves and pleases Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo &#8216;Abdir-Rahmaan Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi&#8217;ee.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>CONCERNING MEN WEARING GOLD RINGS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q]: What is the ruling concerning a man wearing a gold ring, or what is known as a wedding-ring?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: Shaykh Ibn Baaz &#8211; <i>hafidhahullaah</i> &#8211; answered:<br />
&#8220;It is not permissible for a man to wear gold rings. neither before or after marriage. This is due to the fact that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> prohibited gold, as occurs in the authentic narrations. So once when the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam </i>saw a man wearing a gold ring, he took it from him, threw it down and said: <i>&#8220;Does a person pick up a burning piece of coal and hold it in his hand.&#8221;</i> This was related by Muslim in his <i>Saheeh</i> (6/149). So in this is a proof that it is absolutely <i>haraam</i> (prohibited) for men to wear gold rings, even if it is a wedding ring.&#8221;2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE RULING CONCERNING WISHING FOR DEATH DUE TO ENCOUNTERING MANY HARDSHIPS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q]: I have faced so many hardships in my life that it has made me hate this life. Every time I turned to Allaah and pleaded to Him to take my life at the earliest possible moment. This continues to be my wish up until now, as I do not see any solutions to my problems except death; it is the only thing that can save me from this torment. Is this behaviour <i>haraam</i> (forbidden) for me?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: Shaykh Ibn al-&#8216;Uthaymeen &#8211; <i>hafidhahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;When a person wishes for death due to the hardships and afflictions that have befallen him, then he is doing something that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> prohibited, when he said: <i>&#8220;None of you should wish for death due to some harm that has come to him, rather, if he has such a wish then let him say: O Allaah! Give me life if You know that life is better for me. And give me death if You know that death is better for me.&#8221;</i>3 Therefore, it is not allowed for anyone to wish for death on account of some harm, hardship or difficulty that has come to him. In fact, he should have <i>sabr</i> (patience) and expect a reward from Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; due to his being patient, and he should wait for relief to come to him; just as the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;And know that victory comes with patience, relief with distress, and ease with hardship.&#8221;</i>4 So the one who is afflicted with any affliction should know that those afflictions are an expiation for some of the sins he has committed. Indeed, no Believer is afflicted with any kind of grief, pain or suffering except that Allaah expiates &#8211; due to that &#8211; some of his sins; even if it be the harm caused by a mere pricking of a thorn. So when a person has patience and hopes in a reward from Allaah, he reaches the level of being amongst the <i>saabiroon</i> (those who truly have patience), and this is a very lofty level. Allaah &#8211; the Most High said about its people:<b> &#8220;And give glad tidings to the apatient ones; those who, when afflicted by a calamity, say: Indeed we belong to Allaah, and to Him shall we truly return.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:155-156].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The woman in the question feels that there is no solution for her problems except death. I believe that this is a mistaken view.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Death does not solve any problems. In fact, sometimes it only increases the difficulties. How many people die whilst being afflicted with calamities, difficulties and suffering, but they had been wronging themselves by sinning, and did not give up their sins or repent to Allaah. So death, in this case, is just a quicker coming of punishment. Perhaps if such a person had remained alive, then Allaah would have guided him him to the doors of repentance, seeking forgiveness, patience, facing up to the problems and expecting relief. All of this would have been good for him. Therefore, it is upon you &#8211; the questioner &#8211; to be patient and expect relief from Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; just as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said in His Book:<b> &#8220;So indeed with hardship here is relief. Indeed with hardship there is relief.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Inshiraah 94:5-6]. And the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said in the authentic narration: <i>&#8220;Victory comes with patience; relief with affliction, and ease with hardship.&#8221;</i>5&#8243;6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>FORCING A YOUNG LADY TO MARRY A MAN THAT SHE DOES NOT WANT TO MARRY</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q]: Is it allowed for a father to force his daughter to marry a particular man that she does not want to marry?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: Shaykh Ibn Baaz &#8211; <i>hafidhahullaah</i> &#8211; responded by saying:<br />
&#8220;Neither the father, or anyone other than the father, may force a woman who is under his guardianship to marry a man that she does not wish to marry. In fact her permission must be sought first. Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;A previously married women (without a husband) must not be married until she is consulted, and a virgin is not married until her permission is sought.&#8221;</i> They said: O Messenger of Allaah, how is her permission sought? So he said: <i>&#8220;By her being silent.&#8221;</i>7 Another narration states: <i>&#8220;Her silence is her permission.&#8221;</i>8 Yet a third narration states: <i>&#8220;A virgin&#8217;s father seeks her permission, and her permission is her remaining silent.&#8221;</i>9 So the father must seek her permission if she is nine years of age or above. Likewise, her other guardians may not marry her off except by her permission. This is obligatory upon them all. If a lady is married without her permission, then the marriage will not be correct. This is because one of the conditions of a marriage contract is that both partners accept the marriage freely. So if she is married without her permission, by threat or coercion, then the marriage is null and void&#8230; If the (apparent) husband knows that she does not want him, then he should not approach the woman, even if the father approves of it. He must fear Allaah and not approach any wife that does not want him, even if the father claims that he did not coerce her. The man must avoid what Allaah has forbidden him. This is because Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> ordered that her permission be sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also advise the woman to fear Allaah and to accept the man if her father finds that he suitable to marry her, as long as the prospective groom is good in his Religion and in his character. This is also the case if the one who is the guardian is not the girl&#8217;s father. We give this advice because there is a lot of good and a lot of benefit in marriage. Likewise, there are a lot of hazards in living as a maiden. So I advise all young ladies to accept those men who come to them for marriage, if they conform to the compatibility factors of marriage (i.e. good in Religion and character), they should not use studying, teaching, or anything else, as an excuse to get married.&#8221;10</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>A RELIGIOUS YOUNG MAN PROPOSED TO ME BUT MY MOTHER REFUSED</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q]: I am seeking a solution to my problem. I am twenty-four years old. A young man proposed to me. He has finished college and is from a religious family. After my father agreed to him, he asked me to come and see him. I saw him and was pleased with him. [we saw each other] because our pure and noble Religion states that I should see him and that he should see me. However, when my mother came to realise that he was from a Religious family, she became harsh against him and my father. She swore that she would not allow such a marriage to take place. My father desperately tried to persuade her, but to no avail. Do I have the right to seek the [Islaamic] Law to intervene in this matter?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: Shaykh Ibn Baaz &#8211; <i>hafidhahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;If the matter is as you have stated in your question, then your mother has no right to object, to this matter Indeed it is actually <i>haraam</i> (forbidden) for her to object in this case. You are not obliged to obey your mother in this particular issue, since the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Indeed obedience is only in ma&#8217;roof (when it is good and right).&#8221;</i>11 And it is not from <i>ma&#8217;roof</i> to reject a suitable marriage proposal. In fact, it has been narrated from the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> that he said: <i>&#8220;lf there comes to you a person whose Religion and character are pleasing to you, then marry him (i.e. give the girl in marriage to him). If you do not do this, there will be Fitnah (trial and discord) and great fasad (corruption) upon the earth.&#8221;12 If you have need to take your case to an [Islaamic] court of law, then you would not be wrong in doing so.&#8221;</i>13</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[45] <strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">If a girl has reached the proper age for getting married, can her guardian force her to get married?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: It is not permissible for the guardian of a girl’s affairs to force her into getting married. So if the girl has not reached the proper age and has been forced into marriage, she can look for a way to dissolve this marriage after having reached the age of comprehension and maturity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because there was a girl that was forced into marriage during the time of the Messenger of Allaah, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam. After the marriage, she went to the Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, and said to him: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah! My father has married me to a man that I dislike, in order to raise his own status.&#8221; So the Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, nullified her marriage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this, it is not permissible for a girl’s guardian to force her into marriage, regardless if she is a girl who has reached the legitimate age (of marriage) or she is divorced or she was married and then lost her husband. Rather it is only required of him to direct her towards what is most beneficial for her in her affairs of this world and the hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216; alayhi wa sallam, said: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;There is no marriage except with (the permission of) a guardian and (the presence of) two trustworthy witnesses.&#8221;</span> And he, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, also said: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Do not force your women (to get married), but rather get their consent.&#8221;</span> And he, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, said: &#8220;Her silence is her consent.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are etiquettes and conditions that must be adhered to. However, at times there occurs something that opposes the Divine Legislation, such as when the father prevents his daughter and delays her marriage because of a materialistic ambition. Or because the man proposing marriage to her is poor, and due to this, his status will not be elevated. And so the girl remains without a husband. In this situation, the Divine Legislation has permitted her to marry herself because the Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, has said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Any woman that marries herself without the permission of her guardian, then her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid. But if they differ, then the authoritative figure (sultaan) is the guardian of one who has no guardian.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, this girl – whose father has prevented her marriage due to an obvious materialistic reason – she can take her case to a legitimate judge. So he will investigate the guardian of the girl&#8217;s affairs and interrogate him as to the reason why he is preventing her (from getting married). So if he hears a legitimate reason from him, such as that the man intending marriage is an innovator or he doesn&#8217;t pray or that he drinks alcohol, then the judge cannot oppose him in this. But if he hears illegitimate reasons from him, then at that point, the judge can assume guardianship of her marriage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Some haters of Islam often say that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) married a &#8220;six-years old child,&#8221; referring to &#8216;Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her. What is the response?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong> &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s covenant of marriage was conducted when she was six years old, but the actual commencement of the marriage took place when she was nine-years of age. She was the only virgin he married. Marrying at such young age was not the exception in Arabia at that time. In fact many were married in the young age period of 9-12 when they were physically mature. Furthermore, had this been something degrading and immoral, the enemies of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) from the Pagans would have loved to use this against the character of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s father (Abu Bakr, may Allah be please with him), the first one to believe the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and support his propagation of Islam. Not to mention this would have been a major block against the spread of Islam amongst the Arabs if the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) would appear as a man of &#8220;uncontrolled sexual drive.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This would have been obvious to resort to, especially when it is known that they accused the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) of many other things like being a magician, a poet, etc. The fact that they did not attempt even to consider this marriage as a tool against the integrity of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) stands as a strong irrefutable evidence that such marriages were of the norm, not the exception. In so many societies, it was even considered that the girl who does not get married before she reaches fifteen years of age as someone being &#8220;late&#8221; on the scale of marriage timing! In fact such marriages were common in Asia, East Europe, Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, it was known that one of the Pagans (Jubair bin Mut&#8217;im bin &#8216;Adiye) was interested to marry &#8216;Aaisha before her engagement to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), but her mother (Umm Romaan, may Allah be please with her), rejected him. This proves that she was physically mature for marriage. Her family sought the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) because of his noble character as her mother asserted when she told her husband (Abu Bakr صلى الله عليه و سلم) of her intent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a great wisdom in her marriage whereby &#8216;Aaisha witnessed the revelation and the rulings of Islam pertaining to the most particular and private matters of women, transmitting that to the men and women of the world. She reported about 2100 narrations from the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) covering rulings, worships, and transactions . She was the greatest woman scholar in Islam and she had many students of knowledge from the companions of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling on organizing celebrations for the birthdays of children or for wedding anniversaries?</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are no celebrations in Islaam except Friday the weekly ‘Eid, the first day of Shawwal – ’Eidal-Adha. The day of ’Arafah might be called an ‘Eid for those who are at’Arafah on that day, and the days of Tashreeq, following ’Eidul-Adha.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As for birthday celebrations for a person or his children, or wedding anniversaries or the like, none of them are legislated and they are closer to being innovations than to being allowed</strong></span>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">So the rulers are to be obeyed as required by the Sharee’ah if they command that which is not contrary to the Command of Allaah and His Messenger. This is because the duty upon the people is to hear and obey <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>when the ruler commands that which is not contrary to the Command of Allaah and His Messenger</strong></span>. In this situation and with this condition, their obedience to those in authority is obedience to Allaah (Azza wa Jal).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For this reason, we should <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>bear in mind that when we carry out what the state authority has ordered from <em>matters in which it must be obeyed</em>, we are, in this respect, worshipping Allaah, The Most High, and drawing closer to Him through this obedience</strong></span>. So, bearing this in mind, our execution of the ruled matter will be something that draws us closer to Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic. It is something that we should be conscious of; because Allaah, The Most High, Says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you who believe, obey Allaah, and obey his Messenger, and those of you in authority.</strong> </span><br />
[Qur’aan, soorat an-Nisaa’ (4): 59].</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from Sahab.net<br />
Summarised and Translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah and Praise and Peace be upon the one who was sent as a mercy for all the worlds and upon his Family and his Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth is one of the rarest authentic Prophetic hadeeth regarding strong exhortation to be good to women, being gentle with them, being patient with them, having a concern for them, encouragement not to divorce them, and to remain with them until death even if you have been her companion for a long time. Even if she has produced all the offspring that is possible for her, you should not divorce her unless you are certain (that it is the best thing to do), or it is impossible to live with her. Now we will look at this rare hadeeth and some of its benefits.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been collected by Ibn ‘Aasakir in ‘Tareekh Dimishq’ from Yahya bin Jabir from al-Miqdam bin Ma’dee Karib al-Kindi that the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> stood amongst the people and praised Allaah and exalted Him and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed Allaah advices you in the strongest possible terms to be good to women, indeed Allaah advices you in the strongest possible terms to be good to women, advices you in the strongest possible terms with regards to women, indeed they are your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, your paternal aunts (father’s sisters) and your maternal aunts(mother’s sisters).  Indeed a man from the people of the two books (Jews &amp; Christians) marries a woman and does not hit her, each one of them continues to desire his companion until he dies in old age.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Salmah said I narrated this hadeeth to al-Ala bin Sufyaan al-Ghassanee who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed it has reached me that from the evil hidden sins which Allaah has made<em>Haraam</em>, which are not clearly mentioned in the Qur’aan, are that a man marries a woman and when his companion becomes old and she has  stayed with him for a long time, and has produced all that her womb can, then he divorces her without any reason to do so.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani mentions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It is collected by Tabarani in ‘al-Mu’jam al-Kabeer’, Ibn ‘Aasakir in ‘Tareekh Dimishq’. And this Isnad is Saheeh.’ [Silsilah Saheehah No.2871]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he quotes al-Harbi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The intent is to encourage the one being advised to have a concern for women, to have patience with them. i.e. and that the people of the Book behaved like this with their women.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This is how they (The Jews &amp; the Christians)  used to behave when they had manners, and were religious, even though they followed a religion that had changed, as for nowadays then they prohibit that which Allaah has made permissible of divorce, and they openly make <em>Zina</em> permissible! !’[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth is a clear refutation against those who do not treat their women in a good way. It is a reminder to everyone who is deceived by the so-called rights of women in the west!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>From the benefits of this hadeeth:</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1-</strong> Advice to be good to women and that the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>repeated this three times to emphasise this point: he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed Allaah advices you in the strongest possible terms to be good to women, indeed Allaah advices you in the strongest possible terms to be good to women, advices you in the strongest possible terms with regards to women . .. .’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The advice of being good to women and living with them in a good way is mentioned in the Book of Allaah Ta’ala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And live with them <strong>in</strong> <strong>kindness</strong>. For if you dislike them – perhaps you dislike a thing and Allah makes therein much good.   &gt;&gt; 4:19</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Bukhari mentioned a chapter in his Saheeh : ‘chapter  Advice with regard to women’ then he mentioned a hadeeth from Abu Hurairah <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>&#8211; from the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever believes in Allaah and the last Day then he should not harm his neighbour, and I advise you strongly to be good to women, indeed women were created from the rib bone, and the most bent of the ribs is the top one, so if you tried to straighten it you would break it and if you left it then it would still continue to be bent, so I advise you strongly to be good to women.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the wording collected by Muslim from Abu Hurairah from the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever believes in Allaah and the last Day and testifies about a matter then he should speak good or remain silent and I advise you strongly to be good to women, indeed the woman was created from . . . .’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2-</strong> Then the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> explained that this advice is not specific for a certain type of woman. He explained her relationship with the Muslim male, thus she is a mother, and what will make you aware of what a mother is? The advice which is given concerning being good to the mother, is what you already know and is not hidden from you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> mentions another chapter heading:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Chapter: Who of the people are most deserving of good companionship?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Abu Zur’ah From Abu Hurairah <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>&#8211; who said: A man came to the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah who from the people is the most deserving of my good companionship?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> replied: ‘Your mother.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man said: ‘then who?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> replied: ‘Your mother.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man said: ‘then who?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> replied: ‘Your mother.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man said: ‘then who?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Your father.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[In another narration the man’s name was mentioned clearly as is in ‘al-Adab al-Mufrad’ by Bukhari from Bahz bin Hakeem from his father from his grandfather [Muwaweeyah bin Haydah]  I said: O Messenger of Allaah who . . . . . . . . the next closest relative then those closest after them.’]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected in ‘Adab al-Mufrad’ no.3, Tirmidhi and ‘Irwaa al-Ghaleel’ 829/2232, declared Hasan by Albaani.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this narration there is an extra benefit which is the wording: ‘the next closest relative then those closest after them.’ Which can be used as an evidence for having good companionship with the wife, the daughter the sister and the aunt, and no one can doubt how closely related they are to you O Muslim slave of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the saying: ‘The most deserving of my good companionship?’ Which means who are the foremost people with whom I should fulfil favours for, be good to and honour.  Good companionship is connected to being gentle and kind, having good speech, having good dealings, implementing good manners all of which Islaam brought forth and has encouraged.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajr said in ‘Fath’ that Ibn Battal said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This warrants that the mother should have three times as much as the father, and that is because of the difficulty of pregnancy, then that of the delivery, then that of suckling, these things are specific to the mother and the hardships upon her, after which the father participates in the upbringing of the child.  This  was also indicated in the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And We have enjoined upon man [care] for his parents. His mother carried him, [increasing her] in weakness upon weakness, and his weaning is in two years.&gt;&gt;[Luqaman:14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah equated the mother and the father in what is bequeathed, however, Allaah singled out the mother with these three things, pregnancy, giving birth and suckling the child.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>• She is a wife</strong>, as has been mentioned in the texts[2], likewise the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘The best of you, is the one who <strong>is best to his wife</strong>and I am the best to my wife and if your companions should die then make Dua’ for them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Albaani said in ‘Silsilah Saheehah’ no. 285, ‘it is collected by Tirmidhi, Daraqutni and Ibn Hibban from ‘Aeysha <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em>. Its <em>Isnaad</em> is authentic upon the conditions of Bukhari and Muslim.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here the wording means ‘wives’ due to the hadeeth in which the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘The most complete of the Believers in their <em>Eemaan</em> are those who have the best manners, and the best of you are those who are best to their women.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said in ‘Silsilah Saheehah’ no. 284, ‘it is from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211; </em>collected by Tirmidhi and Ahmad and the first part of the hadeeth is collected by Abu Dawood, Ibn Abee Shaybah in ‘al-Musannaf’, Abu Na’eem in ‘al-Hileeyah’ and Haakim and he said it is <em>Saheeh</em> upon the conditions of Muslim and Dhahabi agreed with him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>• She is a daughter </strong>and there are <em>Ayaat</em> and Ahadeeth[3] which explain the advice of being good to daughters. As for the <em>Ayaah</em> it is the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Allah instructs you concerning your children: for the male, what is equal to the share of two females. &gt;&gt; [Nisa:11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the advice of Allaah for being good to daughters, so that they are not neglected, as they were in <em>Jahileeyah</em>. So much so that at that time they used to bury their daughters alive. Likewise, it was not as the enemies of Islaam behave today (with their daughters), by only looking after them when they are young, but when they reach maturity they leave them to the streets to deal with themselves, astray, struggling  in depravity and committing vile and shameful deeds in the most disgusting manner and offensive form, the like of which the history of mankind has not known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever has three <strong>daughters</strong> and was patient with them, fed them and gave them drink and clothed them from his wealth then they will be a screen for him from the Hell-Fire on the Day of Judgement.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari mentions in a chapter heading in ‘al-Adab al-Mufrad’: ‘Chapter whoever is responsible for supplying sustenance for two daughters or even one.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the narration of Ahmad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘No one has three daughters, or three sisters, or two daughters, or two sisters, and he fears Allaah regarding them and is good to them, except that he will enter Paradise.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn Abbas from the Prophet  <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is no Muslim who has two daughters, and he has good companionship with them except that they will cause him to enter Paradise.’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She is a sister, a paternal aunt (father’s sister) and a maternal aunt (mother’s sister),  and they have all been mentioned with the advice of being good to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the paternal aunt and the maternal aunt then Islaam has encouraged Muslims greatly to have good relations with them  and to be good to those who are the closest of relatives and then the next and then the next.  No one can doubt that the paternal aunt and maternal aunt are connected to a Muslim from the direction of his mother and his father, therefore the paternal aunt and maternal aunt are of the same status as the mother and the father. Due to this, it becomes obligatory to have good relations with them and to be good to them and to honour them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The maternal aunt is of the status of the mother.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Bukhari, Ahmad and Abu Dawood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tirmidhi mentions in ‘Sunnan Tirmidhi’: ‘Chapter: being good to the maternal aunt, with a chain to al-Bara bin ‘Aazib from the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The aunt is of the status of the mother.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tirmidhi said: ‘And this hadeeth has a long story behind it and it is Saheeh.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn Umar <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>&#8211;  who said: ‘A man came to the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and said: ‘Indeed I have committed a major sin, is there any repentance for me?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Do you have a mother?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘No.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Do you have an aunt (mother’s sister)?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘Yes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Then be good to her.’[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Sunnan Darmi, from Ibn Umar who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘a maternal aunt is of the same status of the mother, and a paternal aunt is of the same status of the father, a niece is of the same status of the uncle, and every relative is of the same status of his relation who is the equivalent thereof, if that person is not an inheritor due to the way they are related.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Sunnan Daraqutni, from Sha’abee who said: Ziyad bin Abu Sufyaan said to a person who would sit with him: ‘Do you know how Umar judged regarding the paternal aunt and the maternal aunt?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘No.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ziyad said: ‘Indeed I am the most knowledgeable of the creation of Allaah about how Umar judged them, he placed the maternal aunt at the same status of the mother, and the paternal aunt at the same status of the father.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3 –</strong> The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> encouraged his Ummah with the advice of being good to women, to honour them, to look after them, and to be patient with them in a general sense and <strong>especially</strong> with the wife. Just as you would like your daughter, or your sister, or your paternal aunt and your maternal aunt to be honoured, and it would make you happy. In the same way you should honour someone else’s daughter (who is your wife) she is like a captive given to you and she has given the flower of her life to you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4 –</strong> The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> mentioned in the above mentioned hadeeth that the people of the two books (Jews and Christians) would honour their wives, and a man would remain with his wife all his life, loving her and being good to her, this is despite the fact that they are the people of sin, disbelief and Shirk. Therefore, O <em>Ummah</em> of Muhammad you are the people of <em>Deen</em>, <em>Taqwa</em> and <em>Istiqamah</em>therefore you should be the foremost in adopting these great manners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken From The <em>Fatawaa </em>of our Shaykh, <em>Allaama</em> Mufti of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Abdul Azeez bin Abdullaah Bin Baaz<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong> : Is the foundation of marriage polygyny or is it having one wife?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer: The foundation in the <em>Sharia</em> is polygyny for he who has the capability to do so, and will not oppress them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is due to the many benefits of polygyny, protecting ones private parts, protection for the one who marries women and is good to them. The increase of offspring by which the <em>Ummah</em> is increased thereby an increase of those who worship Allaah alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The evidence which shows this is the saying of Allaah Ta ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three, or four but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one or (the captives and the slaves) that your right hands possess. That is nearer to prevent you from doing injustice.&gt;&gt;[Soorah an-Nisa:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, because the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em> sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> married more than one wife and Allaah <em>Subhanahu</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Verily in the Messenger of Allaah you have a beautiful example&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Soorah Ahzab:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger<em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> mentioned when some of the companions said: As For me then I will not eat meat, another one said: As for me then I will pray and I will not sleep. Another one said as for me then I will fast and not open my fast. Another one said: as for me then I will not marry women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when this news reached the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> he addressed the people and praised and glorified Allaah then he said: “Indeed such and such news has reached me. However I fast and open my fast, pray and sleep.  I eat meat and marry women.  So whoever turns away from my Sunnah is not from me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a great statement from the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em>which includes having one wife and polygyny.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is The One who gives the capability.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Balaag magazine no.1015, 19 Rabi al-Awal 1410 A.H.]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Taken From The <em>Fatawaa</em> of our <em>Shaykh</em>, <em>Allaama Mufti</em> of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">Abdul Azeez bin Abdullaah Bin Baaz</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: is having more than one wife something permissible in Islaam or is it the Sunnah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer</strong>: Having more than one wife is the Sunnah if you have ability to do so due to the saying of Allaah The most high:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three, or four but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one or (the captives and the slaves) that your right hands possess. That is nearer to prevent you from doing injustice. &gt;&gt;[Soorah an-Nisa:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also due to the action of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em> sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> he had altogether nine women and Allaah made it a means for the<em>Ummah</em> to have benefited from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is from the distinguished characteristics of the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, as for other than him then it is not allowed to combine more than four.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for having more than one wife then there are great benefits for men, women and all the Muslim <em>Ummah</em>. Indeed what is achieved/beneficial for everyone, by having more than one wife is lowering ones gaze, protection for the private parts, increase in offspring, that a man can look after the benefits of a large number of women and can defend them from causes of evil and deviances.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who is incapable of doing this and fears that he will not be just between them, then he should suffice with one due to the saying of Allaah <em>Subhana</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;But if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one&gt;&gt; [Soorah an-Nisa:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah give all the Muslims that which there is benefit for them and success for them in this world and the Hereafter.</p>

<span style="color:#993300;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p>This is a translation of the transcript of a question that was asked to Shaykh al-Albaani &#8211; may Allaah have mercy upon him.</p>
<p>Shaykh: Yes</p>
<p>Questioner: Assalamu alaykum</p>
<p>Shaykh: wa Alaykum Assalamu wa Rahmatullaahi wa Baraktuhu</p>
<p>Questioner: If you don’t mind is the noble Shaykh al-Albaani there?</p>
<p>Shaykh: He’s with you.</p>
<p>Questioner: Good, if you would allow me O Shaykh I have some questions to ask.</p>
<p>Shaykh: Go ahead.</p>
<p>Questioner: Is it permissible to talk to my fiancée over the phone?</p>
<p>Shaykh: have you contracted the marriage yet or not?</p>
<p>Questioner: not yet.</p>
<p>Shaykh: It’s not permissible.</p>
<p>Questioner: Not permissible??</p>
<p>Shaykh: Not allowed.</p>
<p>Questioner: Even if it’s for advice?</p>
<p>Shaykh: it’s not permissible.</p>
<p>Questioner: ok is it permissible for me to visit her and sit with her if the <em>Mahram</em> is present?</p>
<p>Shaykh: with a <em>Mahram </em>being present and she comes in front of you wearing a <em>Jilbaab</em> in <em>Hijab</em>, like when she goes out, then it’s allowed, otherwise no.</p>
<p>Questioner: is it possible for her to uncover her face?</p>
<p>Shaykh: it’s possible, if it’s only the face.</p>
<p>Questioner: only the face?</p>
<p>Shaykh: She shouldn’t wear a beautified dress and a short dress etc.</p>
<p>Questioner: ok regarding sitting with her, what is permissible for me to talk to her about?</p>
<p>Shaykh: Do not talk to her except with what you would talk to with other than her.</p>
<p>Questioner: Ok if she asks me for a picture of me, is it ok to give it to her or not?</p>
<p>Shaykh: just like if you asked her for her picture.</p>
<p>Questioner: yes??</p>
<p>Shaykh: I said just like if you asked her for her picture.</p>
<p>Questioner: yeah.</p>
<p>Shaykh: Is it permissible?</p>
<p>Questioner: No.</p>
<p>Shaykh: and my answer is also no.</p>
<p>Questioner: your answer is no??</p>
<p>Shaykh: no, definitely no.</p>
<p>Questioner: about what??</p>
<p>Shaykh: About what! For the same thing what you said, that you cannot ask her for her picture.</p>
<p>Questioner: yeah.</p>
<p>Shaykh: understand?</p>
<p>Questioner: yeah, yes.</p>
<p>Shaykh: If you understand then stick to it.</p>
<p>Questioner: But O Shaykh sometimes a person is forced to phone her, is this permissible?</p>
<p>Shaykh: I don’t think there is a need, you want to marry her don’t you?</p>
<p>Questioner: For example, is it permissible to phone her for the possibility that I can visit her, at such and such time?</p>
<p>Shaykh: why do want to visit her?! What’s the difference between her and any other woman?</p>
<p>Questioner: Do you mean it’s not allowed to visit her?</p>
<p>Shaykh: O my brother, I say to you what’s the difference between her and any other woman? Why do you want to visit her? You want to marry her; you marry her by requesting it from her guardian.</p>
<p>Questioner: If her guardian is present?</p>
<p>Shaykh: You want to marry her, you marry her by requesting her guardian, if there is an original agreement then you can visit her if the guardian is present, to see her and she sees you, as for visiting her then no!</p>
<p>Questioner: It’s still not allowed to visit even after the engagement?</p>
<p>Shaykh: After the engagement?</p>
<p>Questioner: Yeah.</p>
<p>Shaykh: She remains to be a stranger to you O brother until you perform the marriage contract.</p>
<p>Questioner: Thank you, may Allaah reward you O Shaykh.</p>
<p>Shaykh: And you.</p>
<p>Questioner: May Allaah be generous to you.</p>
<p>Shaykh: May Allaah protect you… Sallamu alayk.</p>
<p>Questioner: Assalamu alaykum</p>
<p>Shaykh: Wa Alaykum Assalamu wa Rahmatullaahi wa Baraktuhu</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Dr. Marwwan Al-Qaisee<br />
SOURCE: Al-Asaalah Magazine<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The family is that brick which forms the foundation of a society. It is composed of individuals that have permanent relations established between them. Most importantly, it possesses almost a majority of the different kinds of personal relations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of this, there must be certain etiquettes placed in order to control and regulate these relations. This is such that it can be maintained in the best possible manner, and so that it can generate and produce its proper fruits. Family relations consist of the relationship between the spouses from one perspective, the relationship between the parents and the children from a second perspective, and the relationship between the children themselves from a third perspective.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Etiquettes of the husband:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. It is not from the deficiencies, but rather from good manners, that the husband shares in the responsibility of specified matters, such as the mending of garments or what is similar to that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. It is appropriate for a man to not restrict himself from serving himself. This is since the wife takes care of the household affairs. So therefore, it is from good manners that the husband extend a helping hand to his wife in the house, during times of necessity, such as when she is sick, pregnant, has given birth or similar to that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The exemplary husband is he who cooperates with his wife by bearing good relations and showing kind manners (to her), according to the full extent of the meaning contained in these (last) two expressions. Truly, the husbands who are best at working alongside their wives are the best of mankind in the view of Islaam. This good way of living between the spouses must be deeply imbedded into the daily marital life, even at the time of divorce.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Beware of characterizing the relationship between the spouses with over-seriousness! For indeed characterizing the family life with a militaristic nature amounts to one of the causes for failure and bad results.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. From the kind and noble manners of the husband is that he complies and assents to the requests of his wife, so long as they are not forbidden in the Religion. And being luxurious in food, drink and clothing is at the entrance of matters forbidden in the Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. The husband should specify a time in which he can play around and pass free time with his wife.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. The relationship between the spouses must contain one singular and specific nature. And it cannot be this way unless the couple begins demolishing all the obstacles and impediments that stand between them. For example, the husband should not feel timid and restrain himself from drinking out of the same cup that his wife drinks out of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. There is no human being that is perfect. So there is no doubt that the husband will see things in his wife that does not comply with his natural disposition and preferences. If these aspects are not in opposition to the fundaments of the Religion or to the obedience of the husband and his rights, then at that point, he should not try to change her personality so that it complies with his natural preference.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. And he must always remember that for each member of the couple, there will be an aspect of ones personality that conflicts with the others personality. And he should also remember that if there are some characteristics that he doesn&#8217;t find pleasing in his wife, then indeed she has other characteristics, which will definitely be pleasing to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. Do not let Ramadaan be a barrier that impedes you from showing affection to your wife, such as by kissing her. But this is so long as you are able to refrain yourself, since what is forbidden during the days of Ramadaan is only sexual intercourse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. Do not chase after the errors of your wife and recount them to her, for too much blaming and reprimanding will worsen the relationship between the two of you, and it will pose a threat to your marital life. So overlook your wife&#8217;s easy ability to make mistakes, and make her falling into them seem like something small.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. If you are able, do not hold back from providing your wife with good clothing and food, and from being generous in spending money on her. This is of course according to the extent of your ability.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. Do not give little importance to implementing the punishment required for any acts in opposition to the Religion, which your wife has committed, whether it is in the home or outside it. This should be the main reason that causes you to become angry, thus no other reason should affect you (besides this one).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. What has been stated previously does not mean that you should leave matters alone until that result comes to happen. Thus, whenever you realize that a matter is left alone, weigh it with seriousness and determination, without being too harsh or rude about it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15. The woman is the head of the household, the one responsible for it. So do not attempt to meddle into affairs that do not fall into your area of duties and responsibilities, such as the food and the order of the house.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16. Beware of scolding your wife or blaming her for a mistake she committed, in the presence of others, even if they are your own children. For indeed that is an act that goes against correct behavior and it will lead to raising anger in the hearts of people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">17. If you are forced to place punishment upon your wife, then let it be by staying away from her at bedtime. And do not boycott her except that it is done within the household. And avoid using foul language, insulting her, beating her and describing her with repulsive names. For these matters do not befit an exemplary husband.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">18. Having jealousy and caring about the modesty of your wife is a praiseworthy thing, which shows your love for her. However it is on the condition that you do not go to great extremes in this jealousy. For then at that point, it would turn into something worthy of no praise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19. Entering the house: Do not alarm your family by entering upon them suddenly. Rather, enter while they are aware of it, and greet them with Salaam. And ask about them and how they are doing. And do not forget to remember Allaah, the Mighty and Sublime, when you enter the house.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">20. Beware of spreading any secrets connected with the intimate encounters you have with your wife, for that is something restricted and forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">21. Constantly maintain the cleaning of your mouth and the freshening of your breath.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">22. Guardianship of your wife doesn&#8217;t mean that you can exploit what Allaah has bestowed upon you from taking charge of her, such that you harm and oppress her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">23. Showing respect and kindness to your wife&#8217;s family is showing respect and kindness to her. And this applies even after her death, on the condition that it is not accompanied by an act forbidden in the Religion, such as intermingling of the sexes or being in privacy (with them).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">24. Too much joking will lead to (your family having) little fear (of disobeying you) and a lack of respect for you. So do not joke too much with your wife.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">25. Be considerate that fulfilling the conditions which you promised to your wife during the pre-marriage agreement is a matter possessing the highest of importance and priority. So do not neglect that after getting married.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">26. When you lecture your wife or reprimand her or simply speak to her, choose the kindest and nicest of words and expressions for your speech. And do not reprimand her in front of others or in front of your children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">27. It is not proper for you to ask your wife to look for work outside of the house or to spend upon you from her wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">28. Do not overburden your wife with acts that she is not able to handle. Consider, with extreme regard, the environment she was raised up in. Rural service is not like urban service, and the service of a strong woman and her preparation for it is not like the service of a weak woman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">29. There is nothing in the obligation of a woman&#8217;s service to her husband that negates his assisting her in that regard, if he should find the free time. Rather, this is from the good manners of living between the spouses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This discussion will continue in an upcoming issue, if Allaah wills.</p>

PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[From the upcoming Al-Ibaanah publication: <b>&#8220;Raising Children in Light of the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah&#8221;</b> by &#8216;Abdus-Salaam As-Sulaymaan. The book was introduced and commended by Shaikh Saalih Al-Fawzaan.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>2. Choosing the Mother (i.e. one’s wife):</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If someone wishes to produce ripe fruits, he will indeed search for the land that is most fertile. One of the great aspects of wisdom behind getting married is to produce righteous offspring that will worship Allaah and serve as a provision for their parents. The Prophet said: <b>“Marry women that are loving and fertile for indeed I will outnumber the nations through you.”</b> [Reported by Abu Dawood] [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the Prophet clarified the people’s standards when seeking a partner for marriage, saying: <b>“A woman is married for four (reasons): Her wealth, her lineage, her beauty and her religion. So choose the woman with (good) religious qualities, may your hand be covered in dust.”</b>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says: <b>“Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient and guard in the husband’s absence what Allaah orders them to guard.”</b> [Surah An-Nisaa: 34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The devoutly obedient (Qaanitaat) here refers to those women obey their husbands – by guarding their honor, wealth and lives in their absence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet warned about (marrying) a beautiful woman from a bad origin, saying: <b>“Beware of the green manure.”</b> The Companions asked: “What is the green manure?” He said: <b>“A beautiful woman of bad origin (i.e. upbringing).”</b> [Reported by Ad-Daaraqutnee] [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, he praised a woman with good religious qualities, saying: <b>“Shall I not inform you of the best treasure that a man gathers – A righteous wife.”</b> [Reported by Al-Haakim] [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said: <b>“Choose for your seeds (a good mother), for indeed breeding is a strategy.”</b>[Reported by Ibn Maajah] [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is from the rights that a child has over his father – that he picks a good mother for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man once came to ‘Umar bin Al-Khattaab complaining about his son being undutiful to him. He had brought his son with him and began blaming him for his disobedience, so the son asked: “Doesn’t a son have a right over his father also?” ‘Umar said: “Of course.” The son said: “Then what is it?” ‘Umar replied: “That his father carefully chooses a mother for him, that he gives him a good name and that he teaches him the Qur’aan.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At this, the son said: “My father has not done any of these things. As for my mother, she was a black slave woman that used to belong to a Zoroastrian (Majoos). He named me Ju’al and did not teach me even one letter from the Qur’aan.” ‘Umar turned to the man and said: “You came to me to complain about your son being undutiful to you, however, it is you who were undutiful to him before that!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul-Aswad Ad-Du’alee once told his children: “I was good to you when you were children, when you grew up, and also before you were born.” They asked: “And how is it that you were good to us before we were born?” He said: “I chose for you a mother through whom you would not be mistreated.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ar-Riyaashee would recite this same theme in the following poetic verses:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>“The first good thing I did for you was my choosing (for you)<br />
an honorable woman of noble descent and clear virtue.”</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Wife Searching for a Righteous Husband:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as a husband should look for a righteous wife, so too should a woman look to choose a righteous husband. Abu Hurairah reported that the Messenger of Allaah said: <b>“If someone should come to you whose religion and character you are pleased with, marry (your daughter) off to him. If you do not do so, there will be mischief in the land and widespread corruption.”</b> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Based on this, we see that the firm foundation that a potential couple should base their selection of one another should be that of: Religion and Character. This is what will bring about a correct and proper upbringing for children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the wedding night when the groom consummates the marriage, it is recommended for him to say:<b>“O Allaah, I ask you for her good and the good that she was molded upon”</b> whilst placing his hand upon her head. He should also pray two rak’aat with her. [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Footnotes:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Reported by Abu Dawood (2050) and An-Nasaa’ee (3227) from the narration of Ma’qal bin Yassaar and authenticated by Ibn Hibbaan (4056 and 4057). The hadeeth was also reported by Ahmad in <i>al-Musnad</i> (12613) and Ibn Hibbaan (4028) from the narration of Anas bin Maalik.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Reported by Al-Bukhaaree (5090), Muslim (1466), Abu Dawood (2047), An-Nasaa’ee (3230) and Ahmad in <i>al-Musnad</i> (9521)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Reported by Ad-Daaraqutnee in <i>al-Afraad</i> from the narration of Abu Sa’eed in marfoo’ form. Al-‘Ajaloonee mentioned it in <i>Kashf-ul-Khafaa</i> (1/319, no. 855). What it means is that it is disliked to marry a corrupt woman since a woman with bad roots will affect her child negatively. The basis (for the similitude) is that crops grow upon manure that is placed in a dirty area. So the outward appearance of the crops appears nice but the inner appearance of the manure is vile and rotten. The word <i>diman</i> is the plural of the word <i>dimnah</i>, and that refers to manure (i.e. fertilizer). [4] Reported by Al-Haakim in <i>al-Mustadrak</i> (2/363, no. 3281) from the narration of Ibn ‘Abbaas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Reported by Ibn Maajah (1968) from the narration of ‘Aa’ishah, may Allaah be pleased with her, with the wording: <b>“Choose (a good mother) for your seeds, marry the suitable ones (among women) and wed (your children) to them.”</b> It is also reported with the wording: <b>“And look into which source you place your child for indeed breeding is a strategy.”</b> This hadeeth was transmitted by Al-Qadaa’ee in Musnad-ush-Shihaab (1/370, no. 638) from the narration of Ibn ‘Umar. Also see <i>Kashf-ul-Khafaa</i> (1/358, no. 960).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] Reported by At-Tirmidhee (1085) from the narration of Abu Haatim Al-Muznee, and he said: “This is a <i>hasan ghareeb</i> hadeeth.” Abu Haatim Al-Muznee was a Companion. No other hadeeth is known to have been reported by him on the Prophet except this hadeeth. Abu Dawood also mentioned it in <i>al-Maraaseel</i> (224) but according to him, Abu Haatim Al-Muznee is a Taabi’ee. The hadeeth also has a supporting witness in the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah with the wording: <b>“If someone whose religion and character you are pleased with proposes marriage to you (i.e. your daughter), then marry (her) off to him. If you fail to do so, there will be mischief in the land and widespread corruption.”</b> [Reported by At-Tirmidhee (1084) and Ibn Maajah (1967)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] Reported by Al-Haakim in <i>al-Mustadrak</i> (2/202, no. 2757); ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Amr reported that Allaah’s Messenger said: <b>“If one of you obtains a slave-girl or a wife or a riding beast, he should take hold of her forelock, supplicate for blessings and say: ‘O Allaah, I ask You for her good and the good that she was molded upon. And I seek refuge in You from her evil and the evil that she was molded upon.”</b> Al-Haakim authenticated it and Adh-Dhahabee agreed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Shaikh Saalih bin Fawzaan Al-Fawzaan<br />
SOURCE: His book “Tanbeehaat ‘alaa Ahkaam takhtassu bil-Mu’minaat” (pg. 97-99)<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory on you O Muslim woman to obey your husband in matters of good. Abu Hurairah reported that Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“If a woman prays her five (daily) prayers and keeps her private parts chaste and obeys her husband, she will enter Paradise from any of the doors of Paradise she wishes.”</b> [Reported by Ibn Hibbaan in his Saheeh]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Abu Hurairah (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>), Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“It is not lawful for a woman to fast while her husband is present unless she has his permission. And she must not allow anyone in his home except with his permission.”</b> [Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from Abu Hurairah (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>), Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“When a man calls his wife to bed and she does not come to him, and he spends the night angry with her, the angels curse her until the morning arrives.”</b> [Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the report of Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim, the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“By the One in whose Hand my soul is, there is no man that calls his wife to bed and she refuses him, except that the One who is above the heavens is displeased with her until he (the husband) becomes content with her.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the rights the husband possesses over his wife is that she fulfills the duty of tending to his household and not coming out from it except with his permission. The Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“The woman is the caretaker of her husband’s household and she will be questioned as to her responsibility.”</b> [Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another right he possesses over her is that she fulfills the duties of the household and that she does not make him hire a female servant, which will cause harm and due to which there will be a risk of danger for himself and his children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said commenting on Allaah’s saying: <b>“Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient and guard in the husband’s absence what Allaah orders them to guard (i.e. their chastity).”</b> [Surah An-Nisaa: 34]: “This mandates the unrestricted obligation of a woman obeying her husband, in all affairs, such as serving him, traveling with him, assisting him and other matters, as is indicated in the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger.” [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great scholar, Ibn Al-Qayyim, said: “Those who say that it is obligatory for the woman to serve the husband use (this ayah) as proof in that those who Allaah directed His Speech to (on this occasion) considered this to be from <i>al-ma’roof</i> (good). But as for the woman relaxing and having the husband serve her, sweep, grind the flour, knead the bread, wash the clothes, fix the bed, and serve the household, then that is from <i>al-munkar</i> (evil).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says: <b>‘And they (women) have rights (over their husbands) similar to those (of their husbands) over them.’</b> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 228]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says: <b>‘Men are the protectors and maintainers over women.’</b> [Surah An-Nisaa: 34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a woman doesn’t serve her husband, but instead he acts like a servant to her, then this means that she is the protector and maintainer over him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He further said: “For indeed Allaah obligated him to spend on her, to clothe her and to provide her with a place of dwelling in exchange for his enjoying her and her serving him, as well as what the habits of the spouses call for.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, the binding marriage agreements require that the spouses live in kindness. And kindness means a woman’s serving (her husband) and taking care of the inner affairs of the household.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said: “And there is no difference as to whether the woman is prestigious or lowly, or if she is poor or rich. Just look at this woman who was the most prestigious of women in the world…” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is referring to Faatimah (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhaa</i>) for she would serve her husband and come to the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) complaining to him, but he would not complain about her.</p>

Husband&#8217;s rights concerning his Wife</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 8: </span></p>
<h3 align="center"><span><em>The Book of Marriage (Kitab Al-Nikah) </em></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Marriage is a social institution as old as the human race itself. It may be defined as a relation between a man and a woman which is recognised by custom or law and involves certain rights and duties, both in the case of the parties entering the Union, and in case of the children born of it. Marriage has thus two main functions to perform: it is the means adopted by human society for regulating relations between the sexes; and it furnishes the mechanism by means of which the relations of a child to the community is determined. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The rites and ceremonies of marriage have been different with different peoples and in different ages. but these two functions mentioned above are common even where in marriage. It always implies the right of sexual intercourse as allowed and recognised by society and the duties of the parents in bringing up children. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Islam recognises this institution and accepts it as the basis of human society after purging it of all those evils which had penetrated it. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Firstly, Islam does not regard it as a union only for the gratification of sexual lost, but a social contract with wide and varied responsibilities and duties. The reason behind it is that, according to the Divine Faith, a woman is not a plaything in the hand of man. but a spiritual and moral being who is entrusted to him on the sacred pledge to which Allah is made a witness. The wife is, therefore, not meant. to provide sensuous pleasure only to the male, but to fully co-operate with him in making the life of the family and ultimately of the whole humanity significantly meaningful. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The Holy Qur&#8217;an has in so many verses pointed out the different purposes of marriage. It states:&#8221; And of His signs is that He has created wives for you from yourselves that you might find quiet of wind in them, and He put between you love and affection&#8221; (xxx. 21). In this verse it has been said that the female is not inferior to the male in the sense that the former is created out of a superior stuff while the latter comes of a base origin. Both man and woman are the progeny of Adam and thus both have the same soul. The purpose of marriage, according to the Holy Qur&#8217;an, is therefore, the union of the two souls which are one in essence. Their separate existence is an unnatural state of their being which changes Into the natural state when they are united by marriage and thus are brought close to each other physically, mentally and emotionally. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Both man and woman are the joint heirs of the grace of life, and unless there is a very close and intimate form of companionship in them, they cannot enjoy the true grace of life.&#8221; He it is Who created you from a single soul, and of the same did He make his spouse, that he might find comfort in her&#8221; (vii. 189).&#8221; Comfort&#8221; implies much more than a mere sexual gratification. It is not too much to say that the whole conception of the marriage relation in Islam is charged with spiritual and moral ideas, and must of necessity elevate the status of matrimonial alliance in the individual and social life. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>In Islam the union of the sexes has been purified and the joy of the married relation secured by the absolute prohibition of every kind of extra-matzimonial connection. The Holy Qur&#8217;an stresses upon the people to marry as it is the most effective means whereby one can lead a virtuous life free from immorality and emotional inhibition. The Holy Qur&#8217;an says:&#8221; They (your wives) are as a garment to you, and you are as a garment to them&#8221; (ii. 187). The mutual relation of husband and wife is here described in words which could not be surpassed in beauty. Herein is the correct description of the relationship between the two. The husband and the wife are for mutual support, mutual comfort and mutual protection, fitting into each other as garments fit into each other. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Then the Holy Qur&#8217;an also makes it clear that this union is not a temporary relationship between two individuals of opposite sexes: It is a permanent and enduring relationship in the sense that both the parties should put in their earnest endeavours to lead their lives in perfect harmony and acquitting themselves creditably of the responsibilities saddled upon them by entering into this sacred contract. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The Holy Qur&#8217;an farther points out that sexual gratification in the married life is not meant only for the satisfaction of the physical lust, but it mustbe directed to some higher ends.&#8221; Your women are tilth for you, so go into your tilth as ye like, and provide beforehand for your souls, and fear Allah and know that you are going to meet Him&#8221; (iii. 223). Here the wives are likened to the cultivable land which are ploughed for sowing and reaping the produce (in the form of offspring) and not merely for carnal indulgence. The concluding part of the verse refers to still higher and sublimer ends which tell that even in the height of carnal pleasures the moral and spiritual responsibilities should not in any way be lost sight of; rather one should be more conscious to them when one is enjoying physical pleasures as these are the moments when the fear of the Lord and the accountability in the Hereafter is likely to be blurred or effaced from one&#8217;s mind. </span></p>

So I and a friend of mine from Banu Sulaim went out, until we found a young woman of Banu Amir who was like a young she-camel having a long neck. We made proposal to her for contracting temporary marriage with us, and presented to her our cloaks (as dower). She began to look and found me more handsome than my friend, but found the cloak of my friend more beautiful than my cloak. She thought in her wind for a while, but then preferred me to my friend. So I remained with her for three (nights), and then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) commanded us to part with them (such women).</span></p>

Ibn Abbas called him and said: You are an uncouth person, devoid of sense. By my life, Mut&#8217;a was practised during the lifetime of the leader of the pious (he meant Allah&#8217;s Messenger, may peace be upon him), and Ibn Zubair said to him: just do it yourselves, and by Allah, if you do that I will stone you with your stones. Ibn Shihab said. Khalid b. Muhajir b. Saifullah informed me: While I was sitting in the company of a person, a person came to him and he asked for a religious verdict about Mut&#8217;a and he permitted him to do it. Ibn Abu &#8216;Amrah al-Ansari (Allah be pleased with him) said to him: Be gentle. It was permitted in- the early days of Islam, (for one) who was driven to it under the stress of necessity just as (the eating of) carrion and the blood and flesh of swine and then Allah intensified (the commands of) His religion and prohibited it (altogether). Ibn Shihab reported: Rabi&#8217; b. Sabra told me that his father (Sabra) said: I contracted temporary marriage with a woman of Banu &#8216;Amir for two cloaks during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) ; then he forbade us to do Mut&#8217;a.

Umm Ruman (my mother) came to me and I was at that time on a swing along with my playmates. She called me loudly and I went to her and I did not know what she had wanted of me. She took hold of my hand and took me to the door, and I was saying: Ha, ha (as if I was gasping), until the agitation of my heart was over. She took me to a house, where had gathered the women of the Ansar. They all blessed me and wished me good luck and said: May you have share in good. She (my mother) entrusted me to them. They washed my head and embellished me and nothing frightened me. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (, may peace be upon him) came there in the morning, and I was entrusted to him.</span></p>

He repeated it thrice. In the meanwhile the people went out for their work, and said: By Allah, Muhammad (has come). Abd al-&#8216;Aziz or some of our com- panions said: Muhammad and the army (have come). He said: We took it (the territory of Khaibar) by force, and there were gathered the prisoners of war. There came Dihya and he said: Messenger of Allah, bestow upon me a girl ont of the prisones. He said: Go and get any girl. He made a choice for Safiyya daughter of Huyayy (b. Akhtab). There came a person to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and said: Apostle of Allah, you have bestowed Safiyya bint Huyayy, the chief of Quraiza and al-Nadir, upon Dihya and she is worthy of you only. He said: Call him along with her. So he came along with her. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) saw her he said: Take any other woman from among the prisoners.

Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Khaibar is ruined. Verily when we get down in the valley of a people, evil is the morning of the warned ones (al-Qur&#8217;an, xxxvii. 177). Allah, the Majestic and the Glorious, defeated them (the inhabitants of Khaibar), and there fell to the lot of Dihya a beautiful girl, and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) got her in exchange of seven heads, and then entrusted her to Umm Sulaim so that she might embellish her and prepare her (for marriage) with him. He (the narrator) said: He had been under the impression that he had said that so that she might spend her period of &#8216;Iddah in her (Umm Sulaim&#8217;s) house. (The woman) was Safiyya daughter of Huyayy. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) arranged the wedding feast consisting of dates, cheese, and refined butter, and pits were dug and tiers were set in them dining cloths, and there was brought cheese and refined butter, and these were placed there. And the people ate to their fill, and they said: We do not know whether he (the Holy Prophet) had married her (as a free woman), or as a slave woman. They said: If he (the Holy Prophet) would make her wear the veil, then she would be a (free married) woman, and if he would not make her wear the veil, then she should be a slave woman. When he intended to ride, he made her wear the veil and she sat on the hind part of the camel; so they came to know that he had married her. As they approached Medina, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) drove (his ride) quickly and so we did. &#8216;Adba&#8217; (the name of Allah&#8217;s Apostle&#8217;s camel) stumbled and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) fell down and she (Radrat Safiyya: also fell down. He (the Holy Prophet) stood up and covered her. woman looked towards her and said: May Allah keep away the Jewess! He (the narrator) said: I said: Aba Hamza, did Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) really fall down? He said: Yes, by Allah, he in fact fell down. Anas said: I also saw the wedding feast of Zainab, and he (the Holy Prophet) served bread and meat to the people, and made them eat to their heart&#8217;s content, and he (the Holy Prophet) sent me to call people, and as he was free (from the ceremony) he stood up and I followed him. Two persons were left and they were busy in talking and did not get out (of the apartment). He (the Holy Prophet) then proceeded towards (the apartments of) his wives. He greeted with as-Salamu &#8216;alaikum to every one of them and said: Members of the household, how are you? They said: Messenger of Allah, we are in good state &#8216;How do you find your family? He would say: In good state. When he was free from (this work of exchanging greetings) he came back, and I also came back along with him. And as he reached the door, (he found) that the two men were still busy in talking. And when they saw him having returned, they stood up and went out; and by Allah! I do not know whether I had informed him, or there was a revelation to him (to the affect) that they had gone. He (the Holy Prophet) then came back and I also returned along with him, and as he put his step on the threshold of his door he hung a curtain between me and him, and (it was on this occasion) that Allah revealed this verse: (&#8221; O you who believe), do not enter the houses of the Prophet unless permission is given to &#8216;you&#8221; (xxxiii. 53).</span></p>

He sent (a messenger) to Dihya and he gave him whatever he demanded. He then sent her to my mother and asked her to embellish her. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) then got out of Khaibar until when he was on the other side of it, he halted, and a tent was pitched for him. When it was morning Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He who has surplus of provision with him should bring that to us. Some persons would bring the surplus of dates, and the other surplus of mush of barley until there became a heap of bals. They began to eat the hais and began to drink out of the pond which had the water of rainfall in it and which was situated by their side. Anas said that that constituted the wedding feast of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). He (further) said: We proceeded until we saw the walls of Medina, and we were delighted. We made our mounts run quickly and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) also made his mount run quickly. And Safiyya (Allah be pleased with her) was at his back, and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had seated her behind him. The camel of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) stumbled and he (the Holy Prophet) fell down and she also fell down. And none among the people was seeing him and her, until Allah&#8217;s Messeuger (may peace be upon him) stood up and he covered her, and we came to him and he said: We have received no injury. We entered Medina and there came out the young ladies of the household. They saw her (hadrat Safiyya) and blamed her for falling down.</span></p>

Zaid went on until he came to her and she was fermenting her flour. He (Zaid) said: As I saw her I felt in my heart an idea of her greatness so much so that I could not see towards her (simply for the fact) that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had made a mention of her. So I turned my back towards her. and I turned upon my heels, and said: Zainab, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has sent (me) with a message to you. She said: I do not do anything until I solicit the will of my Lord. So she stood at her place of worship and the (verse of) the Qur&#8217;an (pertaining to her marriage) were revealed, and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to her without permission. He (the narrator) said: I saw that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) served us bread and meat until it was broad day light and the people went away, but some persons who were busy in con- versation stayed on in the house after the meal. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) also went out and I also followed him, and he began to visit the apartments of his wives greeting them (with the words): As-Salamu &#8216;alaikum, and they would say: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, how did you find your family (hadrat Zainab)? He (the narrator) stated: I do not know whether I had informed him that the people had gone out or he (the Holy Prophet) informed me (about that). He moved on until he entered the apartment, and I also went and wanted to enter (the apartment) along with him, but he threw a curtain between me and him, as (the verfes pertaining to seclusion) had been revealed, and people were instructed in what they had been instructed. Ibn Rafii had made this addition in his narration:&#8221; O you who believe, enter not the houses of the Prophet unless permission is given to you for a meal, not waiting for its cooking being finished&#8230;&#8221; to the words&#8221;&#8230; Allah forbears not from the truth.&#8221;</span></p>

So I went along with it to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: My mother offers you salutations, and says that it is a humble gift for you on our behalf. He said: Place it here, and then said: Go and invite on my behalf so and so and anyone whom you meet, and he even named some persons. He (Anas) said: I invited whom he had named and whom I met. I (one of the narrators) said: I said to Anas: How many (persons) were there? He (Anas) said: They were about three hundred persons. Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) (said to me): Anas, bring that earthen vessel. They (the guests) then began to enter until the courtyard and the apartment were fully packed. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Make a circle of ten (guests), and every person should eat from that nearest to him. They began to eat, until they ate to their fill. A group went out (after eating the food), and another group came in until all of them had eaten. He (the Holy Prophet) said to me: Anas, lift it (the earthen vessel), so I lifted it, but I could not assess whether it had more (food) when I placed it (before Allah&#8217;s Messenger) or when I lifted it (after the people had been served out of it). A group among them (the guests) began to talk in the house of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was sitting and his wife had been sitting with her face turned towards the wall. It was troublesome for Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), so Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) went out and greeted his wives. He then returned. When they (the guests) saw that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had returned they thought that it (their overstay) was something troublesome for him. He (the narrator) said: They hastened towards the door and all of them went out. And there came Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and he hung a curtain and went in, and I was sitting in his apartment and he did not stay but for a short while. He then came to me and these verses were revealed. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came out and recited them to the people:&#8221; O you who believe, enter not the houses of the Prophet unless permission is given to you for a meal, not waiting for its cooking being finished-but when you are invited, enter, and when you have taken food, disperse not seeking to listen to talk. Surely this gives the Prophet trouble&#8221;, to the end of verse (xxxiii. 53). (Al-Ja&#8217;d said that Anas [b. Malik] stated: I am the first amongst the people to hear these verses), and henceforth the wives of the Apostle (may peace be upon him) began to observe seclusion (al-hijab).</span></p>

He said: Yes, and added: We went out with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) on the expedition to the Bi&#8217;l-Mustaliq and took captive some excellent Arab women; and we desired them, for we were suffering from the absence of our wives, (but at the same time) we also desired ransom for them. So we decided to have sexual intercourse with them but by observing &#8216;azl (Withdrawing the male sexual organ before emission of semen to avoid-conception). But we said: We are doing an act whereas Allah&#8217;s Messenger is amongst us; why not ask him? So we asked Allah&#8217;s Mes- senger (may peace be upon him), and he said: It does not matter if you do not do it, for every soul that is to be born up to the Day of Resurrection will be born.</span></p>

So when he divided (his stay) with them, the turn of the first wife did not come but on the ninth (day).

It was (the night when he had to stay) in the house of &#8216;A&#8217;isha (Allah be pleased with her), when Zainab came there. He (the Holy Prophet) stretched his hand towards her (Zainab), whereupon she (&#8216;A&#8217;isha) said: It is Zainab. Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) withdrew his hand. There was an altercation between the two until their voices became loud (and it was at that time) when Iqama was pronounced for prayer. There happened to come Abu Bakr and he heard their voices and said: Messenger of Allah, (kindly) come for prayer, and throw dust in their moths.

So I was called back, and I said (to myself): He would return me the camel, and nothing was more displeasing to me than this (that after having received the price I should also get the camel). He said: Take your camel and keep its price with you, (also).</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Jabir b. &#8216;Abdullah (Allah be pleased with them) reported: We were with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) in a journey, and I was riding a camel meant for carrying water and it lagged behind all persons. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) hit it or goaded it (I think) with something he had with him. And after it (it moved so quickly) that it went ahead of all persons and it struggled with me (to move faster than I permitted It) and I had to restrain it. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Do you sell it at such and such (price)? May Allah grant you pardon. I said: Allah&#8217;s Apostle, it is yours. He (again) said: Do you sell it at such and such (price)? May Allah grant you pardon. &#8216; I said: Allah&#8217;s Apostle, it is yours. He said to me: Have you married after the death of your father? I said: Yes. He (again) said: With one previously married or a virgin? I said: With one previously married. He said: Why didn&#8217;t you marry a virgin who might amuse you and you might amuse her, and she might sport with you and you might sport with her? Abu Nadra said: That was the common phrase which the Muslims spoke:&#8221; You do such and such (thing) and Allah may grant you pardon.&#8221;</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.062.001">Volume 7, Book 62, Number 1: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A group of three men came to the houses of the wives of the  Prophet asking how the Prophet worshipped (Allah), and when they were informed about that,  they considered their worship insufficient and said, &#8220;Where are we from the Prophet  as his past and future sins have been forgiven.&#8221; Then one of them said, &#8220;I will  offer the prayer throughout the night forever.&#8221; The other said, &#8220;I will fast  throughout the year and will not break my fast.&#8221; The third said, &#8220;I will keep  away from the women and will not marry forever.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to them and  said, &#8220;Are you the same people who said so-and-so? By Allah, I am more submissive to  Allah and more afraid of Him than you; yet I fast and break my fast, I do sleep and I also  marry women. So he who does not follow my tradition in religion, is not from me (not one  of my followers).&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.062.002"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 62, Number 2: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ursa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that he asked &#8216;Aisha about the Statement of Allah: &#8216;If you  fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry (other)  women of your choice, two or three or four; but if you fear that you shall not be able to  deal justly (with them), then only one, or (the captives) that your right hands possess.  That will be nearer to prevent you from doing injustice.&#8217; (4.3) &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;O my  nephew! (This Verse has been revealed in connection with) an orphan girl under the  guardianship of her guardian who is attracted by her wealth and beauty and intends to  marry her with a Mahr less than what other women of her standard deserve. So they (such  guardians) have been forbidden to marry them unless they do justice to them and give them  their full Mahr, and they are ordered to marry other women instead of them.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 62, Number 3: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Alqama: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was with Abdullah, &#8216;Uthman met him at Mina and  said, &#8220;O Abu &#8216;Abdur-Rahman ! I have something to say to you.&#8221; So both of them  went aside and &#8216;Uthman said, &#8220;O Abu &#8216;Abdur-Rah. man! Shall we marry you to a virgin  who will make you remember your past days?&#8221; When &#8216;Abdullah felt that he was not in  need of that, he beckoned me (to join him) saying, &#8220;O &#8216;Alqama!&#8221; Then I heard him  saying (in reply to &#8216;Uthman), &#8220;As you have said that, (I tell you that) the Prophet  once said to us, &#8216;O young people! Whoever among you is able to marry, should marry, and  whoever is not able to marry, is recommended to fast, as fasting diminishes his sexual  power. </font></p>
<hr />
<p></a><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.062.004"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 62, Number 4: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were with the Prophet while we were young and had no  wealth whatever. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O young people! Whoever among you can  marry, should marry, because it helps him lower his gaze and guard his modesty (i.e. his  private parts from committing illegal sexual intercourse etc.), and whoever is not able to  marry, should fast, as fasting diminishes his sexual power.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 62, Number 5: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ata: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We presented ourselves along with Ibn &#8216;Abbas at the funeral  procession of Maimuna at a place called Sarif. Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;This is the wife of  the Prophet so when you lift her bier, do not Jerk it or shake it much, but walk smoothly  because the Prophet had nine wives and he used to observe the night turns with eight of  them, and for one of them there was no night turn.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet I used to go round (have sexual relations with)  all his wives in one night, and he had nine wives. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Said bin Jubair: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn &#8216;Abbas asked me, &#8220;Are you married?&#8221; I  replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Marry, for the best person of this (Muslim) nation  (i.e., Muhammad) of all other Muslims, had the largest number of wives.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr />
<p></a><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.062.008"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 62, Number 8: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The rewards (of deeds) are  according to the intention, and everybody will get the reward for what he has intended. So  whoever emigrated for Allah&#8217;s and His Apostle&#8217;s sake, his emigration was for Allah and His  Apostle; and whoever emigrated for worldly benefits, or to marry a woman, then his  emigration was for the thing for what he emigrated for.&#8221; (1) </font></p>
<hr />
<p></a><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.062.009"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 62, Number 9: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Masud: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We used to fight in the holy battles in the company of the  Prophet and we had no wives with us. So we said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall we get  castrated?&#8221; The Prophet forbade us to do so. </font></p>
<hr />
<p></a><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.062.010"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 62, Number 10: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf came (from Mecca to Medina) and the  Prophet made a bond of brotherhood between him and Sad bin Ar-Rabi&#8217; Al-Ansari. Al-Ansari  had two wives, so he suggested that &#8216;Abdur-Rahman take half, his wives and property.  &#8216;Abdur-Rahman replied, &#8220;May Allah bless you with your wives and property. Kindly show  me the market.&#8221; So &#8216;Abdur-Rahman went to the market and gained (in bargains) some  dried yoghurt and some butter. After a few days the Prophet saw Abdur-Rahman with some  yellow stains on his clothes and asked him, &#8220;What is that, O &#8216;Abdur-Rahman?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;I had married an Ansari woman.&#8221; The Prophet asked, &#8220;How much Mahr  did you give her?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;The weight of one (date) stone of gold.&#8221;  The Prophet said, &#8220;Offer a banquet, even with one sheep.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sad bin Abi Waqqas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle forbade &#8216;Uthman bin Maz&#8217;un to abstain from  marrying (and other pleasures) and if he had allowed him, we would have gotten ourselves  castrated.(1) </font></p>

<p></a><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.062.012"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 62, Number 12: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sad bin Abi Waqqas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet prevented &#8216;Uthman bin Mazun from that (not  marrying), and had he allowed him, we would have got ourselves castrated.(1) </font></p>
<hr />
<p></a><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.062.013o"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 62, Number 13o: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We used to participate in the holy battles led by Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and we had nothing (no wives) with us. So we said, &#8220;Shall we get ourselves  castrated?&#8221; He forbade us that and then allowed us to marry women with a temporary  contract (2) and recited to us: &#8212; &#8216;O you who believe ! Make not unlawful the good things  which Allah has made lawful for you, but commit no transgression.&#8217; (5.87) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I am a young man and I am  afraid that I may commit illegal sexual intercourse and I cannot afford to marry.&#8221; He  kept silent, and then repeated my question once again, but he kept silent. I said the same  (for the third time) and he remained silent. Then repeated my question (for the fourth  time), and only then the Prophet said, &#8220;O Abu Huraira! The pen has dried after  writing what you are going to confront. So (it does not matter whether you) get yourself  castrated or not.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha : </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Suppose you landed in a  valley where there is a tree of which something has been eaten and then you found trees of  which nothing has been eaten, of which tree would you let your camel graze?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;(I will let my camel graze) of the one of which nothing has been eaten before.&#8221;  (The sub-narrator added: &#8216;Aisha meant that Allah&#8217;s Apostle had not married a virgin  besides herself .) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said (to me), &#8220;You have been shown to  me twice in (my) dreams. A man was carrying you in a silken cloth and said to me, &#8216;This is  your wife.&#8217; I uncovered it; and behold, it was you. I said to myself, &#8216;If this dream is  from Allah, He will cause it to come true.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While we were returning from a Ghazwa (Holy Battle) with  the Prophet, I started driving my camel fast, as it was a lazy camel A rider came behind  me and pricked my camel with a spear he had with him, and then my camel started running as  fast as the best camel you may see. Behold! The rider was the Prophet himself. He said,  &#8216;What makes you in such a hurry?&#8221; I replied, I am newly married &#8221; He said,  &#8220;Did you marry a virgin or a matron? I replied, &#8220;A matron.&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you marry a young girl so that you may play with her and she with  you?&#8221; When we were about to enter (Medina), the Prophet said, &#8220;Wait so that you  may enter (Medina) at night so that the lady of unkempt hair may comb her hair and the one  whose husband has been absent may shave her pubic region. </font></p>

The Muslims wondered, &#8220;Is she (Saffiyya)  considered as his wife or his slave girl?&#8221; Then they said, &#8220;If he orders her to  veil herself, she will be one of the mothers of the Believers; but if he does not order  her to veil herself, she will be a slave girl. So when the Prophet proceeded from there,  he spared her a space behind him (on his she-camel) and put a screening veil between her  and the people. </font></p>

When the lady saw that he did not say anything, she sat down. A man from his  companions got up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! If you are not in need of her, then  marry her to me.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Have you got anything to offer?&#8221; The  man said, &#8220;No, by Allah, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The Prophet said (to him), &#8220;Go  to your family and see if you have something.&#8221; The man went and returned, saying,  &#8220;No, by Allah, I have not found anything.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;(Go  again) and look for something, even if it is an iron ring.&#8221; He went again and  returned, saying, &#8220;No, by Allah, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I could not find even an iron  ring, but this is my Izar (waist sheet).&#8221; He had no rida. He added, &#8220;I give half  of it to her.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;What will she do with your Izar? If you  wear it, she will be naked, and if she wears it, you will be naked.&#8221; So that man sat  down for a long while and then got up (to depart). When Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw him going, he  ordered that he be called back. When he came, the Prophet said, &#8220;How much of the  Quran do you know?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I know such Sura and such Sura,&#8221; counting  them. The Prophet said, &#8220;Do you know them by heart?&#8221; He replied,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Go, I marry her to you for that much of the Quran  which you have.&#8221; </font></p>

It was the custom in  the Pre-lslamic Period that if somebody adopted a boy, the people would call him the son  of the adoptive father and he would be the latter&#8217;s heir. But when Allah revealed the  Divine Verses: &#8216;Call them by (the names of) their fathers . . . your freed-slaves,&#8217; (33.5)  the adopted persons were called by their fathers&#8217; names.

This Verse refers to the orphan girl who is under the guardianship of her guardian who  likes her beauty and wealth and wishes to (marry her and) curtails her Mahr. Such  guardians have been forbidden to marry them unless they do justice by giving them their  full Mahr, and they have been ordered to marry other than them. The people asked for the  verdict of Allah&#8217;s Apostle after that, so Allah revealed: &#8216;They ask your instruction  concerning the women . . . whom you desire to marry.&#8217; (4.127) So Allah revealed to them  that if the orphan girl had beauty and wealth, they desired to marry her and for her  family status. They can only marry them if they give them their full Mahr. And if they had  no desire to marry them because of their lack of wealth and beauty, they would leave them  and marry other women. So, as they used to leave them, when they had no interest, in them,  they were forbidden to marry them when they had such interest, unless they treated them  justly and gave them their full Mahr Apostle said, &#8216;If at all there is evil omen, it is in  the horse, the woman and the house.&#8221; a lady is to be warded off. And the Statement of  Allah: &#8216;Truly, among your wives and your children, there are enemies for you (i.e may stop  you from the obedience of Allah)&#8217; (64.14) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Marry my sister, the  daughter of Abu Sufyan.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Do you like that?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes,  for even now I am not your only wife; and the most beloved person to share the good with  me is my sister.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;But that is not lawful for me (i.e., to be  married to two sisters at a time.)&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! By Allah, we  have heard that you want to marry Durra, the daughter of Abu Salama.&#8221; He said,  &#8220;You mean the daughter of Um Salama?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;By  Allah ! Even if she were not my stepdaughter, she would not be lawful for me to marry, for  she is my foster niece, for Thuwaiba has suckled me and Abu Salama; so you should neither  present your daughters, nor your sisters to me.&#8221; </font></p>

I went to &#8216;Uthman bin &#8216;Affan  and presented Hafsa (for marriage) to him. He said, &#8220;I will think it over.&#8217; I waited  for a few days, then he met me and said, &#8216;It seems that it is not possible for me to marry  at present.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Umar further said, &#8220;I met Abu Bakr As-Siddique and said to him,  &#8216;If you wish, I will marry my daughter Hafsa to you.&#8221; Abu Bakr kept quiet and did not  say anything to me in reply. I became more angry with him than with &#8216;Uthman. I waited for  a few days and then Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked for her hand, and I gave her in marriage to him.  Afterwards I met Abu Bakr who said, &#8216;Perhaps you became angry with me when you presented  Hafsa to me and I did not give you a reply?&#8217; I said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Abu Bakr said, &#8216;Nothing  stopped me to respond to your offer except that I knew that Allah&#8217;s Apostle had mentioned  her, and I never wanted to let out the secret of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. And if Allah&#8217;s Apostle  had refused her, I would have accepted her.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Um Habiba said to Allah&#8217;s Apostle &#8220;We have heard that  you want to marry Durra bint Abu-Salama.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Can she be  married along with Um Salama (her mother)? Even if I have not married Um Salama, she would  not be lawful for me to marry, for her father is my foster brother.&#8221; &#8216;And there is no  blame on you if you make hint of betrothal or conceal it in your hearts. Allah is  Oft-Forgiving, Most Forbearing.&#8217; (2.235) Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Hint your intention of  marrying&#8217; is made by saying (to the widow) for example: &#8220;I want to marry, and I wish  that Allah will make a righteous lady available for me.&#8217; &#8221; Al-Qasim said: One may say  to the widow: &#8216;I hold all respect for you, and I am interested in you; Allah will bring  you much good, or something similar &#8216;Ata said: One should hint his intention, and should  not declare it openly. One may say: &#8216;I have some need. Have good tidings. Praise be to  Allah; you are fit to remarry.&#8217; She (the widow) may say in reply: I am listening to what  you say,&#8217; but she should not make a promise. Her guardian should not make a promise (to  somebody to get her married to him) without her knowledge. But if, while still in the  Iddat period, she makes a promise to marry somebody, and he ultimately marries her, they  are not to be separated by divorce (i.e., the marriage is valid). </font></p>

I have not found anything.&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Go again and look for something, even if it were an iron ring.&#8221; He went and  returned, saying, &#8220;No, by Allah, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that he asked &#8216;Aisha, saying to her, &#8220;O Mother! (In  what connection was this Verse revealed): </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with  orphan girls (to the end of the verse) that your right hands possess?&#8221; (4.3) Aisha  said, &#8220;O my nephew! It was about the female orphan under the protection of her  guardian who was interested in her beauty and wealth and wanted to marry her with a little  or reduced Mahr. So such guardians were forbidden to marry female orphans unless they deal  with them justly and give their full Mahr; and they were ordered to marry women other than  them.&#8221;&#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;(Later) the people asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle, for instructions,  and then Allah revealed: &#8216;They ask your instruction concerning the women . . . And yet  whom you desire to marry.&#8217; (4.127) So Allah revealed to them in this Verse that-if a  female orphan had wealth and beauty, they desired to marry her and were interested in her  noble descent and the reduction of her Mahr; but if she was not desired by them because of  her lack in fortune and beauty they left her and married some other woman. So, as they  used to leave her when they had no interest in her, they had no right to marry her if they  had the desire to do so, unless they deal justly with her and gave her a full amount of  Mahr.&#8221; </font></p>

I took it to him  and he said, &#8220;Put it down,&#8221; and ordered me to call some men whom he named, and  to invite whomever I would meet. I did what he ordered me to do, and when I returned, I  found the house crowded with people and saw the Prophet keeping his hand over the Haisa  and saying over it whatever Allah wished (him to say). Then he called the men in batches  of ten to eat of it, and he said to them, &#8220;Mention the Name of Allah, and each man  should eat of the dish the nearest to him.&#8221; When all of them had finished their  meals, some of them left and a few remained there talking, over which I felt unhappy. Then  the Prophet went out towards the dwelling places (of his wives) and I too, went out after  him and told him that those people had left. Then he returned and entered his dwelling  place and let the curtains fall while I was in (his) dwelling place, and he was reciting  the Verses:&#8211; &#8216;O you who believe! Enter not the Prophet&#8217;s house until leave is given you  for a meal, (and then) not (as early as) to what for its preparation. But when you are  invited, enter, and when you have taken your meals, disperse without sitting for a talk.  Verily such (behavior) annoys the Prophet; and he would be shy of (asking) you (to go),  but Allah is not shy of (telling you) the Truth.&#8217; (33-53) Abu Uthman said: Anas said,  &#8220;I served the Prophet for ten years.&#8221; </font></p>

It was  revealed for the first time when Allah&#8217;s Apostle had consummated his marriage with Zainab  bint Jahsh. When the day dawned, the Prophet was a bridegroom and he invited the people to  a banquet, so they came, ate, and then all left except a few who remained with the Prophet  for a long time. The Prophet got up and went out, and I too went out with him so that  those people might leave too. The Prophet proceeded and so did I, till he came to the  threshold of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s dwelling place. Then thinking that these people have left by then,  he returned and so did I along with him till he entered upon Zainab and behold, they were  still sitting and had not gone. So the Prophet again went away and I went away along with  him. When we reached the threshold of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s dwelling place, he thought that they had  left, and so he returned and I too, returned along with him and found those people had  left.

Sad said to &#8216;Abdur-Rahman,  &#8220;I will divide and share my property with you and will give one of my two wives to  you.&#8221; &#8216;Abdur-Rahman said, &#8220;May Allah bless you, your wives and property (I am  not in need of that; but kindly show me the way to the market).&#8221; So &#8216;Abdur-Rahman  went to the market and traded there gaining a profit of some dried yoghurt and butter, and  married (an Ansari woman). The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Give a banquet, even if with one  sheep.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Eleven women sat (at a place) and promised and contracted  that they would not conceal anything of the news of their husbands. The first one said,  &#8220;My husband is like the meat of a lean weak camel which is kept on the top of a  mountain which is neither easy to climb, nor is the meat fat, so that one might put up  with the trouble of fetching it.&#8221; The second one said, &#8220;I shall not relate my  husband&#8217;s news, for I fear that I may not be able to finish his story, for if I describe  him, I will mention all his defects and bad traits.&#8221; The third one said, &#8220;My  husband is a tall man; if I describe him (and he hears of that) he will divorce me, and if  I keep quiet, he will neither divorce me nor treat me as a wife.&#8221; The fourth one  said, &#8220;My husband is a moderate person like the night of Tihama which is neither hot  nor cold. I am neither afraid of him, nor am I discontented with him.&#8221; The fifth one  said, &#8220;My husband, when entering (the house) is a leopard, and when going out, is a  lion. He does not ask about whatever is in the house.&#8221; The sixth one said, &#8220;If  my husband eats. he eats too much (leaving the dishes empty), and if he drinks he leaves  nothing, and if he sleeps he sleeps alone (away from me) covered in garments and does not  stretch his hands here and there so as to know how I fare (get along).&#8221; The seventh  one said, &#8220;My husband is a wrong-doer or weak and foolish. All the defects are  present in him. He may injure your head or your body or may do both.&#8221; The eighth one  said, &#8220;My husband is soft to touch like a rabbit and smells like a Zarnab (a kind of  good smelling grass).&#8221; The ninth one said, &#8220;My husband is a tall generous man  wearing a long strap for carrying his sword. His ashes are abundant and his house is near  to the people who would easily consult him.&#8221; The tenth one said, &#8220;My husband is  Malik, and what is Malik? Malik is greater than whatever I say about him. (He is beyond  and above all praises which can come to my mind). Most of his camels are kept at home  (ready to be slaughtered for the guests) and only a few are taken to the pastures. When  the camels hear the sound of the lute (or the tambourine) they realize that they are going  to be slaughtered for the guests.&#8221; The eleventh one said, &#8220;My husband is Abu Zar  and what is Abu Zar (i.e., what should I say about him)? He has given me many ornaments  and my ears are heavily loaded with them and my arms have become fat (i.e., I have become  fat). And he has pleased me, and I have become so happy that I feel proud of myself. He  found me with my family who were mere owners of sheep and living in poverty, and brought  me to a respected family having horses and camels and threshing and purifying grain .  Whatever I say, he does not rebuke or insult me. When I sleep, I sleep till late in the  morning, and when I drink water (or milk), I drink my fill. The mother of Abu Zar and what  may one say in praise of the mother of Abu Zar? Her saddle bags were always full of  provision and her house was spacious. As for the son of Abu Zar, what may one say of the  son of Abu Zar? His bed is as narrow as an unsheathed sword and an arm of a kid (of four  months) satisfies his hunger. As for the daughter of Abu Zar, she is obedient to her  father and to her mother. She has a fat well-built body and that arouses the jealousy of  her husband&#8217;s other wife. As for the (maid) slave girl of Abu Zar, what may one say of the  (maid) slavegirl of Abu Zar? She does not uncover our secrets but keeps them, and does not  waste our provisions and does not leave the rubbish scattered everywhere in our  house.&#8221; The eleventh lady added, &#8220;One day it so happened that Abu Zar went out  at the time when the milk was being milked from the animals, and he saw a woman who had  two sons like two leopards playing with her two breasts. (On seeing her) he divorced me  and married her. Thereafter I married a noble man who used to ride a fast tireless horse  and keep a spear in his hand. He gave me many things, and also a pair of every kind of  livestock and said, &#8216;Eat (of this), O Um Zar, and give provision to your relatives.&#8221;  She added, &#8220;Yet, all those things which my second husband gave me could not fill the  smallest utensil of Abu Zar&#8217;s.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha then said: Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to me, &#8220;I  am to you as Abu Zar was to his wife Um Zar.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas : </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I had been eager to ask &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab about the two  ladies from among the wives of the Prophet regarding whom Allah said &#8216;If you two (wives of  the Prophet namely Aisha and Hafsa) turn in repentance to Allah, your hearts are indeed so  inclined (to oppose what the Prophet likes). (66.4) till &#8216;Umar performed the Hajj and I  too, performed the Hajj along with him. (On the way) &#8216;Umar went aside to answer the call  of nature, and I also went aside along with him carrying a tumbler full of water, and when  &#8216;Umar had finished answering the call of nature, I poured water over his hands and he  performed the ablution. Then I said to him, &#8220;O chief of the Believers! Who were the  two ladies from among the wives of the Prophet regarding whom Allah said: &#8216;If you two  (wives of the Prophet) turn in repentance to Allah your hearts are indeed so inclined (to  oppose what the Prophet likes)?&#8221; (66.4) He said, &#8220;I am astonished at your  question, O Ibn Abbas. They were &#8216;Aisha and Hafsa.&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar went on narrating the  Hadith and said, &#8220;I and an Ansari neighbor of mine from Bani Umaiyya bin Zaid who  used to live in Awali-al-Medina, used to visit the Prophet in turn. He used to go one day  and I another day. When I went, I would bring him the news of what had happened that day  regarding the Divine Inspiration and other things, and when he went, he used to do the  same for me. We, the people of Quraish used to have the upper hand over our wives, but  when we came to the Ansar, we found that their women had the upper hand over their men, so  our women also started learning the ways of the Ansari women. I shouted at my wife and she  retorted against me and I disliked that she should answer me back. She said to me, &#8216;Why  are you so surprised at my answering you back? By Allah, the wives of the Prophet answer  him back and some of them may leave (does not speak to) him throughout the day till the  night.&#8217; The (talk) scared me and I said to her, &#8216;Whoever has done so will be ruined!&#8217; Then  I proceeded after dressing myself, and entered upon Hafsa and said to her, &#8216;Does anyone of  you keep the Prophet angry till night?&#8217; She said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; I said, &#8216;You are a ruined losing  person! Don&#8217;t you fear that Allah may get angry for the anger of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and thus  you will be ruined? So do not ask more from the Prophet and do not answer him back and do  not give up talking to him. Ask me whatever you need and do not be tempted to imitate your  neighbor (i.e., &#8216;Aisha) in her manners for she is more charming than you and more beloved  to the Prophet .&#8221; Umar added,&#8221;At that time a talk was circulating among us that  (the tribe of) Ghassan were preparing their horses to invade us. My Ansari companion, on  the day of his turn, went (to the town) and returned to us at night and knocked at my door  violently and asked if I was there. I became horrified and came out to him. He said,  &#8216;Today a great thing has happened.&#8217; I asked, &#8216;What is it? Have (the people of) Ghassan  come?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No, but (What has happened) is greater and more horrifying than that:  Allah&#8217;s Apostle; has divorced his wives. &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;The Prophet kept away from his  wives and I said &#8220;Hafsa is a ruined loser.&#8217; I had already thought that most probably  this (divorce) would happen in the near future. So I dressed myself and offered the  morning prayer with the Prophet and then the Prophet; entered an upper room and stayed  there in seclusion. I entered upon Hafsa and saw her weeping. I asked, &#8216;What makes you  weep? Did I not warn you about that? Did the Prophet divorce you all?&#8217; She said, &#8216;I do not  know. There he is retired alone in the upper room.&#8217; I came out and sat near the pulpit and  saw a group of people sitting around it and some of them were weeping. I sat with them for  a while but could not endure the situation, so I went to the upper room where the Prophet;  was and said to a black slave of his, &#8216;Will you get the permission (of the Prophet ) for  &#8216;Umar (to enter)?&#8217; The slave went in, talked to the Prophet about it and then returned  saying, &#8216;I have spoken to the Prophet and mentioned you but he kept quiet.&#8217; Then I  returned and sat with the group of people sitting near the pulpit. but I could not bear  the situation and once again I said to the slave, &#8216;Will you get the permission for &#8216;Umar?&#8217;  He went in and returned saying, &#8216;I mentioned you to him but he kept quiet.&#8217; So I returned  again and sat with the group of people sitting near the pulpit, but I could not bear the  situation, and so I went to the slave and said, &#8216;Will you get the permission for &#8216;Umar?&#8217;  He went in and returned to me saying, &#8216;I mentioned you to him but he kept quiet.&#8217; When I  was leaving, behold! The slave called me, saying, &#8216;The Prophet has given you permission.&#8217;  Then I entered upon Allah&#8217;s Apostle and saw him Lying on a bed made of stalks of date palm  leaves and there was no bedding between it and him. The stalks left marks on his side and  he was leaning on a leather pillow stuffed with date-palm fires. I greeted him and while  still standing I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Have you divorced your wives?&#8217; He looked at me  and said, &#8216;No.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Allah Akbar!&#8217; And then, while still standing, I said chatting,  &#8216;Will you heed what I say, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle? We, the people of Quraish used to have power  over our women, but when we arrived at Medina we found that the men (here) were  overpowered by their women.&#8217; The Prophet smiled and then I said to him, &#8216;Will you heed  what I say, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle? I entered upon Hafsa and said to her, &#8220;Do not be  tempted to imitate your companion (&#8216;Aisha), for she is more charming than you and more  beloved to the Prophet.&#8217; &#8221; The Prophet smiled for a second time. When I saw him  smiling, I sat down. Then I looked around his house, and by Allah, I could not see  anything of importance in his house except three hides, so I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  Invoke Allah to make your followers rich, for the Persians and the Romans have been made  prosperous and they have been given (the pleasures of the world), although they do not  worship Allah.&#8217; Thereupon the Prophet sat up as he was reclining. and said, &#8216;Are you of  such an opinion, O the son of Al-Khattab? These are the people who have received the  rewards for their good deeds in this world.&#8217; I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Ask Allah to  forgive me.&#8217; Then the Prophet kept away from his wives for twenty-nine days because of the  story which Hafsa had disclosed to &#8216;Aisha. The Prophet had said, &#8216;I will not enter upon  them (my wives) for one month,&#8217; because of his anger towards them, when Allah had  admonished him. So, when twenty nine days had passed, the Prophet first entered upon  &#8216;Aisha. &#8216;Aisha said to him, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! You had sworn that you would not enter  upon us for one month, but now only twenty-nine days have passed, for I have been counting  them one by one.&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;The (present) month is of twenty nine days.&#8217; &#8216;Aisha  added, &#8216;Then Allah revealed the Verses of the option. (2) And out of all his-wives he  asked me first, and I chose him.&#8217; Then he gave option to his other wives and they said  what &#8216;Aisha had said . &#8221; (1) The Prophet, &#8216; had decided to abstain from eating a  certain kind of food because of a certain event, so Allah blamed him for doing so. Some of  his wives were the cause of him taking that decision, therefore he deserted them for one  month. See Quran: (66.4) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>During the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, the sun eclipsed.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle offered the prayer of (the) eclipse) and so did the people along with him.  He performed a long Qiyam (standing posture) during which Surat-al-Baqara could have been  recited; then he performed a pro-longed bowing, then raised his head and stood for a long  time which was slightly less than that of the first Qiyam (and recited Qur&#8217;an). Then he  performed a prolonged bowing again but the period was shorter than the period of the first  bowing, then he stood up and then prostrated. Again he stood up, but this time the period  of standing was less than the first standing. Then he performed a prolonged bowing but of  a lesser duration than the first, then he stood up again for a long time but for a lesser  duration than the first. Then he performed a prolonged bowing but of lesser duration than  the first, and then he again stood up, and then prostrated and then finished his prayer.  By then the sun eclipse had cleared. The Prophet then said, &#8220;The sun and the moon are  two signs among the signs of Allah, and they do not eclipse because of the death or birth  of someone, so when you observe the eclipse, remember Allah (offer the eclipse  prayer).&#8221; They (the people) said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We saw you stretching your  hand to take something at this place of yours, then we saw you stepping backward.&#8221; He  said, &#8220;I saw Paradise (or Paradise was shown to me), and I stretched my hand to pluck  a bunch (of grapes), and had I plucked it, you would have eaten of it as long as this  world exists. Then I saw the (Hell) Fire, and I have never before, seen such a horrible  sight as that, and I saw that the majority of its dwellers were women.&#8221; The people  asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What is the reason for that?&#8221; He replied,  &#8220;Because of their ungratefulness.&#8221; It was said. &#8220;Do they disbelieve in  Allah (are they ungrateful to Allah)?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;They are not thankful to  their husbands and are ungrateful for the favors done to them. Even if you do good to one  of them all your life, when she seems some harshness from you, she will say, &#8220;I have  never seen any good from you.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Az-Zubair married me, he had no real property or any  slave or anything else except a camel which drew water from the well, and his horse. I  used to feed his horse with fodder and drew water and sew the bucket for drawing it, and  prepare the dough, but I did not know how to bake bread. So our Ansari neighbors used to  bake bread for me, and they were honorable ladies. I used to carry the date stones on my  head from Zubair&#8217;s land given to him by Allah&#8217;s Apostle and this land was two third  Farsakh (about two miles) from my house. One day, while I was coming with the date stones  on my head, I met Allah&#8217;s Apostle along with some Ansari people. He called me and then,  (directing his camel to kneel down) said, &#8220;Ikh! Ikh!&#8221; so as to make me ride  behind him (on his camel). I felt shy to travel with the men and remembered Az-Zubair and  his sense of Ghira, as he was one of those people who had the greatest sense of Ghira.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle noticed that I felt shy, so he proceeded. I came to Az-Zubair and said,  &#8220;I met Allah&#8217;s Apostle while I was carrying a load of date stones on my head, and he  had some companions with him. He made his camel kneel down so that I might ride, but I  felt shy in his presence and remembered your sense of Ghira (See the glossary). On that  Az-Zubair said, &#8220;By Allah, your carrying the date stones (and you being seen by the  Prophet in such a state) is more shameful to me than your riding with him.&#8221; (I  continued serving in this way) till Abu Bakr sent me a servant to look after the horse,  whereupon I felt as if he had set me free. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 62, Number 152: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While the Prophet was in the house of one of his wives, one  of the mothers of the believers sent a meal in a dish. The wife at whose house the Prophet  was, struck the hand of the servant, causing the dish to fall and break. The Prophet  gathered the broken pieces of the dish and then started collecting on them the food which  had been in the dish and said, &#8220;Your mother (my wife) felt jealous.&#8221; Then he  detained the servant till a (sound) dish was brought from the wife at whose house he was.  He gave the sound dish to the wife whose dish had been broken and kept the broken one at  the house where it had been broken. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet, said, &#8220;I entered Paradise and saw a  palace and asked whose palace is this? They (the Angels) said, &#8220;This palace belongs  to &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab.&#8217; I intended to enter it, and nothing stopped me except my  knowledge about your sense of Ghira (self-respect (O Umar).&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you! O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! How  dare I think of my Ghira (self-respect) being offended by you?&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While we were sitting with Allah&#8217;s Apostle, (he) Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said, &#8220;While I was sleeping, I saw a woman performing ablution beside a  palace. I asked, &#8220;Whose palace is this?&#8217; It was said, &#8216;This palace belongs to &#8216;Umar.&#8217;  Then I remembered his sense of Ghira and returned.&#8221; On that &#8216;Umar started weeping in  that gathering and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! How dare I think of my self-respect  being offended by you?&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to her, &#8220;I you are pleased  with me or angry with me.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Whence do you know that?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;When you are pleased with me, you say, &#8216;No, by the Lord of Muhammad,&#8217; but when you  are angry with me, then you say, &#8216;No, by the Lord of Abraham.&#8217; &#8221; Thereupon I said,  &#8220;Yes (you are right), but by Allah, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, I leave nothing but your  name.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I never felt so jealous of any wife of Allah&#8217;s Apostle as I  did of Khadija because Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to remember and praise her too often and  because it was revealed to Allah&#8217;s Apostle that he should give her (Khadija) the glad  tidings of her having a palace of Qasab in Paradise . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle who was on the pulpit, saying,  &#8220;Banu Hisham bin Al-Mughira have requested me to allow them to marry their daughter  to Ali bin Abu Talib, but I don&#8217;t give permission, and will not give permission unless  &#8216;Ali bin Abi Talib divorces my daughter in order to marry their daughter, because Fatima  is a part of my body, and I hate what she hates to see, and what hurts her, hurts  me.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I will narrate to you a Habith I heard from Allah&#8217;s Apostle  and none other than I will tell you of it. I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;From  among the portents of the Hour are the following: Religious knowledge will be taken away;  General ignorance (in religious matters) will increase; illegal Sexual intercourse will  prevail: Drinking of alcoholic drinks will prevail. Men will decrease in number, and women  will increase in number, so much so that fifty women will be looked after by one  man.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Beware of entering upon the  ladies.&#8221; A man from the Ansar said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What about Al-Hamu the  in-laws of the wife (the brothers of her husband or his nephews etc.)?&#8221; The Prophet  replied: The in-laws of the wife are death itself. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas : </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;No man should stay with a lady in  seclusion except in the presence of a Dhu-Muhram.&#8221; A man stood up and said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! My wife has gone out intending to perform the Hajj and I have been  enrolled (in the army) for such-and-such campaign.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Return  and perform the Hajj with your wife.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 62, Number 161: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>An Ansari woman came to the Prophet and he took her aside  and said (to her). &#8220;By Allah, you (Ansar) are the most beloved people to me.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Um Salama: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that while the Prophet was with her, there was an  effeminate man in the house. The effeminate man said to Um Salama&#8217;s brother, &#8216;Abdullah bin  Abi Umaiyya, &#8220;If Allah should make you conquer Ta&#8217;if tomorrow, I recommend that you  take the daughter of Ghailan (in marriage) for (she is so fat) that she shows four folds  of flesh when facing you and eight when she turns her back.&#8221; Thereupon the Prophet  said (to us), &#8220;This (effeminate man) should not enter upon you (anymore).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet was screening me with his Rida&#8217; (garment  covering the upper part of the body) while I was looking at the Ethiopians who were  playing in the courtyard of the mosque. (I continued watching) till I was satisfied. So  you may deduce from this event how a little girl (who has not reached the age of puberty)  who is eager to enjoy amusement should be treated in this respect. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 62, Number 164: </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once Sada bint Zam&#8217;a went out at night for some need, and  &#8216;Umar saw her, and recognizing her, he said (to her), &#8220;By Allah, O Sada! You cannot  hide yourself from us.&#8221; So she returned to the Prophet and mentioned that to him  while he was sitting in my dwelling taking his supper and holding a bone covered with meat  in his hand. Then the Divine Inspiration was revealed to him and when that state was over,  he (the Prophet was saying: &#8220;O women! You have been allowed by Allah to go out for  your needs.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;If the wife of anyone of you asks  permission to go to the mosque, he should not forbid her.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My foster uncle came and asked permission (to enter) but I  refused to admit him till I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about that. He said, &#8220;He is your  uncle, so allow him to come in.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have been suckled  by a woman and not by a man.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;He is your uncle, so let  him enter upon you.&#8221; And that happened after the order of Al-Hijab (compulsory  veiling) was revealed. All things which become unlawful because of blood relations are  unlawful because of the corresponding foster suckling relations. </font></p>

Then he had sexual relations with them but none of them delivered  any child except one who delivered a half person. The Prophet said, &#8220;If Solomon had  said: &#8216;If Allah will,&#8217; Allah would have fulfilled his (above) desire and that saying would  have made him more hopeful.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I was with Allah&#8217;s Apostle in a Ghazwa, and when we  returned, I wanted to hurry, while riding a slow camel. A rider came behind me. I looked  back and saw that the rider was Allah&#8217;s Apostle . He said (to me), &#8220;What makes you in  such a hurry?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I am newly married.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Did you  marry a virgin or a matron?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;(Not a virgin but) a matron.&#8221; He  said, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you marry a young girl with whom you could play and who could play  with you?&#8221; Then when we approached (Medina) and were going to enter (it), the Prophet  said, &#8220;Wait till you enter (your homes) at night (in the first part of the night) so  that the ladies with unkempt hair may comb their hair, and those whose husbands have been  absent (for a long time) may shave their pubic hair.&#8221; (The sub-narrator, Hashim said:  A reliable narrator told me that the Prophet added in this Hadith: &#8220;(Seek to beget)  children!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were with the Prophet in Ghazwa, and when we returned  and approached Medina, I wanted to hurry while riding a slow camel. A rider overtook me  and pricked my camel with a spear which he had, whereupon my camel started running as fast  as any other fast camel you may see. I looked back, and behold, the rider was Allah&#8217;s  Apostle . I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I am newly married &#8221; He asked, &#8220;Have  you got married?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;A virgin or a  matron?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;(Not a virgin) but a matron&#8221; He said, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t  you marry a young girl so that you could play with her and she with you?&#8221; When we  reached (near Medina) and were going to enter it, the Prophet said, &#8220;Wait till you  enter your home early in the night so that the lady whose hair is unkempt may comb her  hair and that the lady whose husband has been away may shave her pubic hair.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Hazim: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people differed about the type of treatment which had  been given to Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the day (of the battle) of Uhud. So they asked Sahl bin  Sad As-Sa&#8217;id who was the only surviving Companion (of the Prophet) at Medina. He replied,  &#8220;Nobody Is left at Medina who knows it better than I. Fatima was washing the blood  off his face and &#8216;Ali was bringing water in his shield, and then a mat of date-palm leaves  was burnt and (the ash) was inserted into the wound.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Ibn &#8216;Abbas answering a man who asked him, &#8220;Did  you attend the prayer of &#8216;Id al Adha or &#8216;Id-al-Fitr with Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas  replied, &#8220;Yes, and had it not been for my close relationship with him, I could not  have offered it.&#8221; (That was because of his young age). Ibn &#8216;Abbas further said,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle went out and offered the Id prayer and then delivered the sermon.&#8221;  Ibn &#8216;Abbas did not mention anything about the Adhan (the call for prayer) or the Iqama. He  added, &#8220;Then the Prophet went to the women and instructed them and gave them  religious advice and ordered them to give alms and I saw them reaching out (their hands  to) their ears and necks (to take off the earrings and necklaces, etc.) and throwing (it)  towards Bilal. Then the Prophet returned with Bilal to his house . &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Noble Shaykh, I hope for from you—may Allaah grant you Tawfeeq, and may He benefit me and those listening—and answer to my question; rather, my problem which affects me in my life and my worship; and I fear that it will separate me from my religion. So I want from you a remedy which will heal me and other than myself from the youth; specifically since we are nearing this blessed month. The problem is the secret habit; what is its ruling? Does it make Ghusl obligatory? Does it affect the prayer, fasting, and (other acts of) worship? Open for us a door by way of which we can exit; may Allaah open for you and the listeners the eight doors of paradise.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b style="color:#000000;">[56] Question:</b><span style="color:#000000;"> <span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling on masturbation?</span></span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><b style="color:#000000;">Answer: </b><span style="color:#000000;">We have no doubts regarding the forbiddance of such a practice. And this is due to two reasons, the first of which is the saying of Allaah, the Most High, concerning the description of the believers: </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#008000;">“Successful indeed are the believers. Those who offer their prayer with full submissiveness. And those who turn away from false and vain talk. And those who pay the Zakaah. And those who guard their chastity – Except with their wives or (slaves) that their right hands possess, for (in that) they are free from blame. But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors.”</span><span style="color:#000000;"> [Surah Al-Mu’minoon: 1-8] </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#000000;">Imaam Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee used this ayah as proof for the forbiddance of masturbating. This is since, in this ayah, Allaah has placed two ways for the true believers to fulfill their desires &#8211; either by marrying free women or by enjoying the slave women and female war captives. Then He says: </span><b style="color:#000000;">”But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors”</b><span style="color:#000000;"> meaning: Whoever desires a way by which to transmit his desires, apart from these two ways of marriage and taking female war captives, then he is a transgressor and a wrongdoer. </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#000000;">As for the second reason, then it has been medically established that there are unhealthy consequences for the one who does such an act, and that there are harms to the health caused by this practice, especially for those who constantly engage in it day and night. It is reported on the Prophet (</span><i style="color:#000000;">sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i><span style="color:#000000;">) that he said: </span><b style="color:#000000;">”Do not harm and do not be harmed.”</b><span style="color:#000000;"> Thus it is not permissible for a Muslim to engage in anything that will cause harm to himself or to others.</span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#000000;">There is one more thing that must be mentioned and it is that those who engage themselves in this practice fall under the statement of Allaah: </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><b style="color:#000000;">“Will you exchange that which is lower for that which is better?”</b><span style="color:#000000;"> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 61] </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#000000;">Also there has been reported on the Prophet (</span><i style="color:#000000;">sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i><span style="color:#000000;">) that which further confirms this forbiddance and it is his saying: </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O you group of young men! Whoever amongst you is able to marry then let him marry, for indeed it is the best means for lowering one&#8217;s gaze and the best way to protect one&#8217;s private parts. And whosoever is not able, then let him fast, for indeed it will be a shield for him.&#8221; </span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from his book &#8216;The rulings of al-Khula&#8217; in Islaam&#8217; pg. 36-38.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great scholar and daa&#8217;ee, Dr. Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali[1] said, &#8220;&#8230;.And in the Sunan of Ibn Majah the prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam) stated, &#8220;From the things that makes a man happy is a righteous wife whom whenever he looks at her she pleases him, whenever he commands her she obeys him, and whenever he is absent she is faithful with herself and his wealth.&#8221; Hadeeth hasan (hadeeth no. 1857).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So look &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on you &#8211; at this hadeeth which illustrates therein a very high wisdom from the lips of the one who has been given concise, eloquent speech that contains much profound meaning. For indeed herein he summed up the conditions for a happy martial life:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The first one is that the woman is attractive in the eyes of the husband<br />
2. She willingly fulfills his requests and does what he wants; and this is the sign of true love<br />
3. He trusts her and she trusts him. Hence if he is absent for a long or short period, he will be rest assured that she will safeguard her honor and integrity, and ensure that his wealth is not wasted</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Without these conditions neither of the spouses can ever be happy. And the Europeans have claimed to have attained the pinnacle of marital bliss because they allow the fiancé to interact with his fiancée before the marriage in a manner that is very disturbing. It is quite possible for this relationship to continue like this for years whereby they are &#8216;still getting to know each other,&#8217; to get to learn the other person&#8217;s behavioral traits and personality so that they can be more compatible with each other in order to make the relationship more lasting. They know however that this is a big farce. Because neither of the spouses trust the other &#8211; as far as being faithful to each other, or being honest with their money. Because the husband cannot tell his wife to do anything because obedience is not an obligation for them. Hence they are like two business or trade partners. And this illustrates the fallacy of the stipulation which is that they must &#8216;be in love&#8217; first.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the argument that supports unrestricted interaction before the marriage contract, (this is also a fallacy) because they do not really get to know the true character of the other companion because each of them &#8216;puts on an act&#8217; for the other, and feign signs of adulation for fear that the engagement will be called off. And almost none of them reveals his/her true character until they get married. And there are many incidents like this that proves this to be true. For indeed this happened in Germany in the city of Bonn wherein a man who was engaged to his fiancée for 20 years, and they lived together as a man would live with his wife. However when they married the marriage did not last but one year; all of it being disagreements, bickering, and argumentation, eventually ending in divorce.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Foot Notes:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] He is a descendant of the Prophet&#8217;s grandson Husain (radiallaahu anhu). He was born in Morocco in 1311 (1893) and he died 1408 (1997). He is well known for his translation of the meanings of the interpretation of the Noble Qur&#8217;an and Sahih Al-Bukhari.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Hammaad al-Ansaaree said about him, &#8220;In reality I have met anyone who has more knowledge in so many various subjects other than Dr. al-Hilali. Forty five years have passed and I have never seen anyone like him. He was fluent in languages such as Hebrew, German, English, Spanish, in addition to being a scholar in Arabic. He is my shaykh for I benefit from him greatly. He was salafi in his aqeedah, and if you read his book about at-Tawheed you would know that no one knows at-Tawheed in the Qur&#8217;an like him.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Answered by the Noble Scholar and Muftee<br />
Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez bin &#8216;Abdullaah bin Baaz [1]<br />
Al-Istiqaamah Issue Issue No.2 &#8211; Safar 1417H / July 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>INCREASING EEMAAN (FAITH)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[Q]</i></b>: <span style="color:#ff0000;"><i>Firstly</i></span>: I begin my question by seeking your advice that I may benefit from you with regards to how I may increase my <i> eemaan</i> (faith)?<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000;"><i>Secondly</i></span>: I wish to learn about the religion, however Islaamic books are very rare in my country (Algeria), except some books which are with some brothers &#8211; may Allaah reward them with goodness.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000;"><i>Thirdly</i></span>: I work as a builder and the people that I work with do not really have sound faith and their speech is nothing more than gossip and obscenities.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000;"><i>Fourthly</i></span>: I keep company with a brother whose beliefs are corrupt and who constantly speaks ill of the righteous and believing brothers and I feel very distraught about this. So I hope that you will direct me to a cure for this disease.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[A]</i></b>: <span style="color:#993300;"><strong><i>Firstly</i></strong></span>: We advise you to recite the Qur&#8217;aan frequently and that you increase in your hearing of it and in your recitation of it. Reflect and consider its meaning to the best of your ability and what you do not understand of it, then ask the people of knowledge of your country about it, or write to those outside of your country from the Scholars of Sunnah (Prophetic guidance).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also advise you to increase in the <i> dhikr</i> (remembrance) of Allaah with such remembrances and supplications that are authentically related, such as saying <i>laa ilahaa ilallaah</i> (that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah), or saying <i>subhaanallaah</i> <i>wal-hamdulillaah wa laa ilaha ilallaahu wallaahu akbar</i> (declaring Allaah free from all imperfections, praising Him and declaring that none has the right to be worshipped except Him and that He is greater), and their like. For this purpose, we urge you to refer to books such as al <i>Kalimut-Tayyib</i> of Ibn Taymiyyah, al <i>Waabilus-Sayyib</i> of Ibn al-Qayyim, <i>Riyaadhus-Saaliheen</i> and <i> al-Adhkaar</i> both by Imaam an-Nawawee, and their like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because the remembrance of Allaah increases <i> eemaan</i> (faith) and causes hearts to attain tranquility, as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;Indeed in the remembrance of Allaah do hearts find tranquility.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ar-Ra&#8217;dd 13:28].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also preserve your five daily Prayers, your Fasting and the rest of your obligations &#8211; along with hoping in Allaah&#8217;s mercy and forgiveness and relying upon Him in all your affairs. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;The Believers ate only those who, when Allaah is mentioned, feel a fear in the hearts, and when His Verses are recited to them, it increases their <i>eemaan</i> (faith), and they put their trust and rely upon Allaah alone. They are those who perform the Prayer and spend out of that which We have given them, they are Believers in truth. For them ate grades of dignity and nobility with their Lord, and also forgiveness and generous provisions.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Anfaal 8:2-4].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><i>Secondly</i></strong></span>: Islaamic books are easily found in every Muslim country, especially in public libraries and bookshops. So the one who seeks after them will find them. We advise you to refer to the people of knowledge of the <i> Sharee&#8217;ah</i> (Prescribed Law of Allaah) so that they may direct you to suitable books for you to read, borrow or buy. If there are any problems regarding this, then it is not fitting for us to stop answering your questions from the Pure Revelation &#8211; and We ask Allaah that He makes us firm in that, and only His help is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;"><i>Thirdly</i>, <i>Fourthly</i>:</span> </strong>It is upon you to keep good company and to sit in righteous gatherings in order to benefit from them and their manners and their knowledge and that they may assist you in cultivating obedience to Allaah. So be careful and beware of bad companionship, and evil gathering. Beware, so that they may not influence you, adversely affecting your morals and manners, such that you fall into ill-repute, or that they weaken your resolve and determination in fulfilling your religious obligations and the obligations to your family. Indeed, the Prophet <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> advised the Ummah to sit in good gatherings, and he warned them from the evil and foul gatherings, and he gave a noble example about this, when he said: <i>&#8220;The example of a good companion and a bad companion is like that of a seller of musk, and the one who blows the blacksmith&#8217;s bellows. As for the seller of musk then either he will grant you some, or you buy some from him, or at the very least you enjoy a pleasant smell from him. As for the one who blows the blacksmith&#8217;s bellows, then either he will burn your clothes, or you will get an offensive smell from him.&#8221;</i> This was related by al-Bukhaaree (4/323), from Abu Moosaa al-Ash&#8217;aree <i> radiallaahu &#8216;anhu.</i> 1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>CONCERNING A WOMAN&#8217;S <i>MAHR</i> (DOWRY)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[Q]</i></b>: I and many others have observed that many people are very excessive when it comes to the matter of the <i> mahr</i> (wedding dowry that is paid to the bride), and that they seek great amounts of <i> mahr</i> when it comes to the marriage of their daughters, and they stipulate as a condition the giving of other gifts to them, along with the <i> mahr</i>. This wealth that people demand in such cases, is it <i> halaal</i> (lawful) or <i> haraam</i> (unlawful)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: What is prescribed in the <i> Sharee&#8217;ah</i> is that the <i> mahr</i> should be a small amount and that people should not compete with each other in this regard, acting in accordance with the many <i> ahaadeeth</i> which are related about this. They should also help facilitate marriages and be keen in preserving the modesty and decency of the young Muslim men and women. And it is not permissible for the <i>awliyaa</i> (guardians of the brides-to-be) to demand and stipulate gifts for themselves, since they have no right at all in this matter. Rather the right belongs to the woman, and in some particular cases to the father. He may stipulate a condition as long as it does not harm the daughter, nor lead to the delaying of the marriage. However, if the father forgoes such a right then this is better and more preferable. Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects &#8211; says:<b> &#8220;And marry those amongst you who are single and also marry the pious of your male and female slaves. If they be poor, Allaah will enrich them out of His Bounty.&#8221; </b>[Soorah an-Noor 24:32].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the <i> hadeeth</i> of &#8216;Uqbah ibn &#8216;Aamir <i> radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i>, the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> &#8220;The best dowry is that which is easy.&#8221;</i> This was narrated by Abu Daawood and al-Haakim who authenticated it. And once a woman offered herself to the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> for marriage. However, one of his Companions desired to marry her, so the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said [regarding the <i>mahr</i>]: <i>&#8220;Bring something, even if it be an iron ring.&#8221;</i> So when he could not find even this, the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> married them for the dowry that the man would teach whatever of the Qur&#8217;aan he knew to her. 2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the dowry of the Prophet <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s</i> wives was five-hundred dirhams, which is equivalent to one-hundred and thirty riyaals today. And his daughters were married for the <i> mahr</i> of four-hundred dinaars, which is equivalent to one-hundred riyaals today. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a most beautiful example to follow.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:21].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whenever the difficulties relating to marriage are lightened, then preserving the modesty and decency of young men and women becomes easier, shameful and evil deeds decrease, and the Ummah &#8211; as a result &#8211; will increase in number. However if this matter is made difficult, and people continue competing with each other with regards to the <i> mahr</i> (dowry), then the number of marriages will decrease, fornication will become more widespread and more young men and women will remain unmarried &#8211; except those whom Allaah saves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So my sincere advice to all the Muslims, wherever they may be, is to facilitate the marriage process and to cooperate in this and make it easy. They should turn away from demanding excessive <i> mahr</i> and avoid unnecessary hardships and difficulties in the <i>waleemah</i> (wedding-feast). Rather, they should content themselves with a <i> waleemah</i> that is according to the <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i>, in which the burdens and difficulties for the husband and wife are minimal. May Allaah improve and rectify all the affairs of the Muslims and may He give them the guidance and ability to cling to the <i> Sunnah</i> (Prophetic guidance) in all matters. 3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>IMPURITIES UPON ONE&#8217;S CLOTHING WHILST PRAYING</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[Q]</i></b>: If a person finds some impurity upon his clothes after he has finished praying in it, does the Prayer have to be prayed again?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[A]</i></b>: Whosoever prays, and is unaware that there are impurities upon his body or his clothes during the Prayer, but only realises after he has completed it, then his Prayer will be deemed as correct, according to the most correct position of the Scholars. Similarly, if he was aware of such impurities before the Prayer, but then forgot about this at the time of praying and did not remember except after the Prayer, then his Prayer likewise will be correct. Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic said: <b> &#8220;Our Lord! Do not take us to task if we forget or fall into error.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:286]. It has been authentically related about Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, that one day he <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> led the people in Prayer, wearing his shoes. Then the angel Jibreel came to him during the Prayer and informed him that there was some dirt on his shoes. So the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> removed them and continued with his Prayer and he did not repeat the Prayer.4 This is part of the ease which Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects &#8211; has given to His servants out of His Mercy for them. However, if a person forgets that he had passed wind, then prays in that state, he must &#8211; by <i> ijmaa&#8217;</i> (consensus) of the Scholars &#8211; repeat his prayer again, when he remembers. This is due to the saying of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>: <i> &#8220;The Prayer will not be accepted without purification nor will charity be accepted from wealth that is unlawful.&#8221;</i> This has been related by Muslim in his <i> Saheeh</i> (1/140) and the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s</i> saying: <i> &#8220;The Prayer of any one of you who has released wind will not be accepted, until he makes wudhoo (ablution).&#8221;</i> Related by al-Bukhaaree and Muslim. 5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>SLAUGHTERING FOR OTHER THAN ALLAAH</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[Q]</i></b>: The slaughtering of sheep and other such animals at the graves of the pious people, for their sake and in order to please and draw closer to them, is a custom amongst my family. I have tried to prevent them from doing so, but it has only made them more resolute in doing so. I have said to them that this is shirk (associating partners in the worship) of Allaah. But they respond by saying: We only worship Allaah the way He deserves to be worshipped. However, we visit the graves of the <i>awliyaa</i> (the pious friends of Allaah) and supplicate to Allaah, through the right of the pious people, so that harm and difficulties may be averted from us. I have said to them that this is not from the religion, but they just tell me to leave them alone upon what they are doing. So what do you suggest should be the cure for such people, and what do you suggest I do to counter act this <i> bid&#8217;ah</i> (innovation)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i></i></b><b><i>[A]</i></b>: It is known from the evidences related in the Qur&#8217;aan and the <i> Sunnah</i> that sacrificing for other than Allaah, in order to draw close to other than Allaah &#8211; whether sacrificing for the <i>jinns</i>, <i>awliyaa</i>, idols or other than that from the creation &#8211; is an act of shirk and is an act of <i>jaahiliyyah</i> (pre-Islaamic ignorance) that was practiced by the <i>mushriks</i> (those who worshipped the pious men, <i>jinns</i>, angels, stones, statues, etc, along with worshipping Allaah). Allaah- the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;Say: Indeed my Prayer, my sacrifce, my living and my dying are all for Allaah Lord of the worlds. No partner do I setup with Him in this, and this is what I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:162]. So Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; clearly explains in this verse that sacrificing to other than Allaah is like praying to other than Him. And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;Indeed We have granted to the Prophet sallallaabu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam the Kawthar (a river in Paradise whose banks are lined with tents made from hollow pearls). Therefore turn in Prayer to your Lord and sacrifice to Him alone.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Kawthar 108:1-2]. So Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects &#8211; commanded His Prophet in these noble verses that he should pray only to His Lord and that he should sacrifice to only Him, which was opposite of what the <i>mushriks</i> did, in that they used to prostrate to other than Allaah and to sacrifice to other than Him. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And your Lord has commanded that you worship none but Him.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Israa 17:23]. And He &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;And they have not been commanded except to worship Allaah alone making the religion purely and sincerely for Him.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Bayyinah 98:5]. And there are many other verses with the same meaning. So, since sacrificing is one of the acts of <i> &#8216;ibaadah</i> (worship), then it is obligatory to make this action purely and sincerely for Allaah alone, without directing it to other than Him. Also &#8216;Alee ibn Abee Taalib <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> said that the Prophet <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said:<i> &#8220;May Allaah curse the one who sacrifices to other than Allaah.&#8221;</i> This has been related by Muslim in his Saheeh (no.765).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for supplicating to Allaah and asking Him by the right of the <i> awliyaa</i> or by the right of His Messenger, or by the status of His Messenger &#8211; then this does not constitute shirk, but rather it is a <i> bid&#8217;ah</i> (innovation) which leads to shirk, in the opinion of the majority of Scholars. This is because <i>du&#8217;aa</i> (supplication) is an act of worship, and how it is to be done can only be known from the Revelation. And there is nothing authentically established from our Prophet <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> to show the permissibility or validity of this type of <i> tawassul</i> (seeking the means of nearness to Allaah by invoking an intermediary) in which Allaah is asked through the right of His Prophet or the right of the <i> awliyaa</i> or any of His creation. So it is not permissible for any Muslim to innovate new forms of <i> tawassul</i> which has not been prescribed by Allaah, as He &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:<b> &#8220;Or do they have partners with Allaah who prescribe for them a religion which Allaah has not prescribed.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ash-Shooraa 42:21]. And the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> &#8220;Whosoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it, will be rejected&#8221;</i>, and in another authentic narration: <i> &#8220;Whosoever does an action that I have not commanded, it will be rejected.&#8221;</i> 7 And the meaning of this is that such innovated actions will be rejected and not accepted from its doer. Thus it is obligatory for the Muslims to restrict themselves to only what Allaah has prescribed and to beware of what people have innovated into the religion. As regards the prescribed forms of <i>tawassul</i> then they are: <i>tawassul</i> (seeking the means of nearness to Allaah) through His Names and His Attributes and by righteous actions, and by one&#8217;s <i>eemaan</i> (faith) in Allaah and His Messenger, and other righteous and prescribed actions similar to this. 9</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Istiqaamah Magazine]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Q.3]:</strong> Even though my husband &#8211; may Allaah forgive him &#8211; is a person of good character and fears Allaah, yet he does not treat me with kindness. He is always moody, frowning and troubled at heart &#8211; and he often says that I am the cause of this. However, Allaah knows &#8211; and all praise is for Allaah &#8211; that I do fulfill his rights and try to bring to him tranquility and peace of mind and I try to stay clear of all that which displeases him, whilst patiently bearing his excesses against me. Every time I ask him about something, or speak about a particular matter, he becomes angry and says that my speech is stupidity &#8211; even though I know that he is perfectly happy in the company of his friends and associates. However, when it concerns me, then he does not treat me in the same manner, nor with the same feeling. This causes me great hurt and anger and I have often considered leaving the house. I have &#8211; and all praise is for Allaah &#8211; been educated to a good level and fulfill that which Allaah has obligated me with. O noble Shaykh! If I leave the house with my children, try to educate them and live my own life, will I be sinful in doing so? Or should I continue to live in my present circumstance, abstain from speaking and continue patiently bearing these difficulties? Please advise me as to what I should do &#8211; and may Allaah reward you with goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [A.3]:</strong> There is no doubt that it is obligatory for the husband and wife to live together in a kind and sociable manner. There should be good manners and treatment between them, along with affection and pleasant behaviour &#8211; as Allaah the Mighty and Majestic – says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘<strong>And live with them in honour and in kindness.</strong>’’ [Sooratun-Nisaa‘ 4:19 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His &#8211; the Most Perfect – saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘<strong>And the wives have rights over the husbands &#8211; similar to those of the husbands over them &#8211; in that which is reasonable. But men have a degree over them.</strong>’’ [Sooratul-Baqarah 2:228]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) said, ‘‘Righteousness is good character.’’ [1] And he (<em>’alayhis-salaatu was-salaam</em>) then said, ‘‘Do not consider any good action as insignificant- even if it is meeting your brother with a cheerful face.’’ [2] And he (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) also said, ‘‘The most perfect of Believers in <em>eemaan </em>(faith) is the one with the best character. And the best of you are those that are best to their women-folk, and I am the best amongst you to my family.’’ [3] There are besides these many other <em>ahaadeeth</em> which are a general proof for the encouragement of good character, cheerful meeting and good companionship between Muslims. If this is the general case between Muslims, then good treatment between husband and wife and relatives is even more important. You have done well in patiently persevering and bearing the ill treatment and bad character from your husband. However, I advise you to have even greater patience and not to leave the house, and if Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; wills, there will be a great deal of good in this and a praiseworthy end for you. Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘<strong>Patiently persevere! Indeed Allaah is with those who patiently persevere.</strong>’’ [Sooratul-Anfaal 6:46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic – saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘<strong>Indeed whosoever fears Allaah, obeys Him, turns away from disobedience and patiently perseveres, then Allaah does not cause the rewards of the doers of good to be lost.</strong>’’ [Soorah Yoosuf 12:90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic – saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘<strong>Only those who patiently persevere shall receive their reward in full without reckoning.</strong>’’ [Sooratuz-Zumar 39:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘<strong>So patiently persevere! Indeed, the end will be good for those who are pious.</strong>’’[Soorah Hood 11:49]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, this does not prevent you from speaking to your husband with such words, and behaving with him in such a manner, that will soften his heart- and lead to him being pleased with you and fulfilling your rights of companionship. And as long as he is fulfilling the main and important obligations towards you, then try not to ask him for any worldly need, until his heart is opened and his chest is expanded in accepting your request and fulfilling your needs; in this way &#8211; if Allaah wills your ending will be a praiseworthy one. May Allaah grant you increase in all that is good, and that the condition of your husband improves, and that he is guided to good character, kindness in companionship and to fulfilling the rights that are due upon him. Indeed Allaah is the best of those who are asked, and only He guides to the path that is straight. [4]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Muslim narrated the following hadith:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Isnad: Suleiman bin &#8216;Abdir Rahman and &#8216;Ali bin Hujr » &#8216;Ibsai bin Bunus » Hisham bin &#8216;Urwa » &#8216;Abd Allaah bin &#8216;Urwah » &#8216;Urwah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha (radi Allaahu &#8216;anha):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Eleven women sat (at a place) and promised and contracted that they would not conceal anything of the news of their husbands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The first</b> one said, &#8220;My husband is like the meat of a lean weak camel which is kept on the top of a mountain which is neither easy to climb, nor is the meat fat, so that one might put up with the trouble of fetching it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The second</b> one said, &#8220;I shall not relate my husband&#8217;s news, for I fear that I may not be able to finish his story, for if I describe him, I will mention all his defects and bad traits.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The third </b>one said, &#8220;My husband is a tall man; if I describe him (and he hears of that) he will divorce me, and if I keep quiet, he will neither divorce me nor treat me as a wife.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The fourth</b> one said, &#8220;My husband is a moderate person like the night of Tihama which is neither hot nor cold. I am neither afraid of him, nor am I discontented with him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The fifth </b>one said, &#8220;My husband, when entering (the house) is a leopard, and when going out, is a lion. He does not ask about whatever is in the house.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The sixth</b> one said, &#8220;If my husband eats. he eats too much (leaving the dishes empty), and if he drinks he leaves nothing, and if he sleeps he sleeps alone (away from me) covered in garments and does not stretch his hands here and there so as to know how I fare (get along).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The seventh</b> one said, &#8220;My husband is a wrong-doer or weak and foolish. All the defects are present in him. He may injure your head or your body or may do both.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The eighth</b> one said, &#8220;My husband is soft to touch like a rabbit and smells like a Zar&#8217;nab (a kind of good smelling grass).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The ninth</b> one said, &#8220;My husband is a tall generous man wearing a long strap for carrying his sword. His ashes are Aboondant and his house is near to the people who would easily consult him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The tenth </b>one said, &#8220;My husband is Maalik, and what is Maalik? Maalik is greater than whatever I say about him. (He is beyond and above all praises which can come to my mind). Most of his camels are kept at home (ready to be slaughtered for the guests) and only a few are taken to the pastures. When the camels hear the sound of the lute (or the tambourine) they realize that they are going to be slaughtered for the guests.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The eleventh</b> one said, &#8220;My husband is Aboo Zar&#8217; and what is Aboo Zar&#8217; (i.e., what should I say about him)? He has given me many ornaments and my ears are heavily loaded with them and my arms have become fat (i.e., I have become fat). And he has pleased me, and I have become so happy that I feel proud of myself. He found me with my family who were mere owners of sheep and living in poverty, and brought me to a respected family having horses and camels and threshing and purifying grain . Whatever I say, he does not rebuke or insult me. When I sleep, I sleep till late in the morning, and when I drink water (or milk), I drink my fill. The mother of Aboo Zar&#8217; and what may one say in praise of the mother of Aboo Zar&#8217;? Her saddle bags were always full of provision and her house was spacious. As for the son of Aboo Zar&#8217;, what may one say of the son of Aboo Zar&#8217;? His bed is as narrow as an unsheathed sword and an arm of a kid (of four months) satisfies his hunger. As for the daughter of Aboo Zar&#8217;, she is obedient to her father and to her mother. She has a fat well-built body and that arouses the jealousy of her husband&#8217;s other wife. As for the (maid) slave girl of Aboo Zar&#8217;, what may one say of the (maid) slave girl of Aboo Zar&#8217;? She does not uncover our secrets but keeps them, and does not waste our provisions and does not leave the rubbish scattered everywhere in our house.&#8221; The eleventh lady added, &#8220;One day it so happened that Aboo Zar&#8217; went out at the time when the milk was being milked from the animals, and he saw a woman who had two sons like two leopards playing with her two breasts. (On seeing her) he divorced me and married her. Thereafter I married a noble man who used to ride a fast tireless horse and keep a spear in his hand. He gave me many things, and also a pair of every kind of livestock and said, &#8216;Eat (of this), O Um Zar&#8217;, and give provision to your relatives.&#8221; She added, &#8220;Yet, all those things which my second husband gave me could not fill the smallest utensil of Aboo Zar&#8217;s.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha then said: Allaah&#8217;s Apostle said to me, &#8220;I am to you as Aboo Zar&#8217; was to his wife Um Zar&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">May Allaah grant the believing women the thorough reflection upon this Hadeeth&#8230;Ameen!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">By Shaykh ’Abdul-’Azeez Ibn ’Abdullaah Ibn Baaz<br />
[al-Istiqaamah] [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>COMPATIBILITY IS ONLY BASED UPON RELIGION AND PIETY: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the evil and reprehensible matters is that some who claim to be from the tribe of Haashim (i.e. claim to be a <em>Sayyid</em>; someone related to the Prophet’s (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) family) say that there is no <em>kafaa‘ah</em> (marriage compatibility) between them and someone from outside of their own clan. So they do not get married outside of their clan, nor allow anyone from outside of their clan to marry them. This is a great error, a monstrous ignorance, oppression against the woman, and it is a legislation which neither Allaah nor His Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) legislated or prescribed. Rather, Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>O mankind! We have created you from a male and female, and have made you into nations and tribes; that you may know one another, Indeed the most noblest of you with Allaah is the one who has the most taqwaa </strong>(piety, fear, and obedience of Allaah)<strong>.</strong>” [Sooratul-Hujuraat 49:13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>Indeed the Believers are but brothers.</strong>” [Sooratul-Hujuraat 49:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>The Believers &#8211; men and women &#8211; are allies and protectors, one to another.</strong>” [Sooratut-Tawbah 9:71]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>So their Lord accepted from them their supplication, and responded: Never will I allow to be lost the actions of any of you, be they male or female. You are one to another.</strong>” [Soorah Aali-’Imraan 3:195]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “Indeed there is no excellence for an arab over a non-arab, nor for a non-arab over on arab, nor for a white person over a black one, nor for a black person over a white one, except through <em>taqwaa</em> (piety and obedience to Allaah). The people are from Aadam, and Aadam was from earth.” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) also said: “Indeed my <em>awliyaa‘</em> (friends and allies) are not the tribe of so and so. Rather my friends and allies are the <em>muttaqoon</em> (those who possess <em>taqwaa</em>) &#8211; wherever they may be.” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “If there comes to you a person whose Religion and character are pleasing to you, then marry him (i.e. give the girl in marriage to him). If you do not do this, there will be <em>fitnah</em> (trial and discord) and great <em>fasaad </em>(corruption) upon the earth.” This was related by at-Tirmidhee and others, with a <em>hasan isnaad </em>(good chain of narration). [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) married Zaynab bint Jahsh of the Quraysh (i.e. the Prophet’s clan) to Zayd Ibn Haarithah, his freed slave. He married Faatimah bint Qays from the Quraysh clan, to Usaamah, the son of Zayd. Bilaal ibn Rabaah, the Ethiopian married the sister of ’Abdur-Rahmaan Ibn ’Awf of the Quraysh. So the purpose here is to explain the falsehood of those who claim that it is forbidden, or detested, for someone from the Prophet&#8217;s (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) clan to marry outside of that clan or tribe. Rather, what it is obligatory in this matter is to consider only Religion as the compatibility factor. So the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) distanced Aboo Taalib and Aboo Lahab (his uncles) &#8211; because they were not Muslims and drew near Salmaan the Persian, Suhayb the Roman, and Bilaal the Ethiopian. This is because they possessed <em>eemaan</em> (faith) and piety, and they followed the Prescribed Laws and traversed the Straight Path. Thus, whosoever adopts this false and ignorant practice of barring Haashimee women from marrying from outside of their clan or tribe, will only achieve blameworthy results; such as corruption of the people, or adversely affecting the birth-rates, even though Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>And marry those amongst you who are single, and the righteous from your slaves. If they be poor, Allaah will enrich them out of His Bounty. And Allaah is all-Sufficient for His creation, the all-Knowing about their state.</strong>” [Sooratun-Noor 24:32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He commanded to marry those that are single, and to marry all other categories of Muslims &#8211; irrespective of whether they be rich or poor. Thus, since the Islaamic <em>Sharee’ah</em> urges and encourages the institution of marriage. So the Muslims should hasten to fulfill this command of Allaah and of His Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) when he said: “O youths! Whosoever amongst you has the ability to marry, then let him do so; for it lowers the gaze and restrains the private parts. But whosoever does not have the ability then let him take to fasting; for indeed it is a shield for him.” Its authenticity has been agreed upon. [5] Thus, it is incumbent upon the guardians to fear Allaah concerning their guardianship, since it is an <em>amaanah</em> (trust and responsibility) around their necks, and Allaah will question them concerning this trust. So it is upon them to hasten in getting their daughters, sons, and sisters married, to the extent that this task has taken full effect in life, and the corruption and harms of not doing so have been minimized. And it is known that when women are prevented from getting married, or if their marriage is delayed and deferred, then this is a cause for calamities to occur, a cause for shameful moral crimes to take place, and a cause for a decline in standards of behaviour. So &#8211; O worshippers of Allaah &#8211; it is upon you to fear Allaah regarding your own selves, and with regards to the daughters, sisters, and other women whom Allaah has been placed under your charge and authority, and that the Muslims should come in order to realise the good and the happiness for the society, and to follow the path that will increase the good and lessen the crimes. And you should know that you will all be questioned and held to account about your actions, as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>By your Lord! We shall call them all to account for all that they used to do.</strong>” [Sooratul-Hijr 15:92]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>And to Allaah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth, that He may punish those who do evil with that which they have done; and reward those who do good with Paradise which is best.</strong> ” [Sooratun-Najm 53:31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So hasten in getting your sons and daughters married, following in the footsteps of your Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>), and the footsteps of the noble <em>Sahaabah</em> (Companions) (<em>radiyallaahu ’anhum</em>), and all those who follow their path and guidance. I also advise you all not to seek excessive sums for the <em>mahr</em> (dowry), but rather be moderate in this, and that you strive to select pious and righteous people for marriage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah to grant us the understanding of the Religion; grant us firmness upon it; and that He protects us and all the Muslims from the evil promptings of our own souls, and our evil resultant actions; and that He keeps away from us the deviating trials and discords, whether open or hidden. And we ask Allaah also to correct all those who have a position of authority over the affairs of the Muslims, and that He rectifies them. Indeed he is the One having the power to do so. And may Allaah extol and send blessings of peace upon Muhammad, and upon his Family, Companions and all those who follow them.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong style="line-height:1.5em;">1. Question: Is it permissible for a father to compel his daughter into a marriage with someone she does not desire?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer: It is not permissible for the father or someone besides him to compel the one who is under his guardianship to marry someone she does not desire to marry. Rather, it is necessary to seek her consent and permission due to the saying of the Messenger (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam): <i>The virgin is not to be married until her consent has been sought. They said: O Messenger of Allaah! What is her consent? He replied: Her silence.</i> And in another wording: <i>And regarding the virgin, her father seeks her consent and her consent is her silence.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore it is obligatory upon the father when she reaches the age of nine or greater that he asks for her consent. It is likewise for her guardians, they do not marry her without her consent. This is obligatory upon all of them. Whoever marries his daughter without permission/consent then the marriage is not correct because one of the conditions of the marriage is the consent and pleasure of both parties. So if he marries her without her being pleased with it and compels her with strong threats or even beating, the marriage is not valid&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is required from the prospective husband, when he knows that she does not desire him for marriage, that he does not pursue the matter even if her father facilitates this for him (give him permission). It is obligatory for him to fear Allaah and not to come to the woman who does not want him for marriage&#8230; It is obligatory for him to beware of what Allaah has made unlawful upon him and this is because the Messenger (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) ordered the girls consent to be sought (first).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2. Question: I have a sister and my father married her to someone without seeking her opinion and without her being pleased with it. She is twenty-one years of age and he made a false testimony for the marriage contract (saying) that the girl agrees to the marriage&#8230; So what is the ruling regarding this marriage contract&#8230;?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer: &#8230;However the correct saying in this matter is that it is not lawful for the father or any one else to compel the girl into marriage with someone she does not desire even if he is suitable, because the Messenger (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said: <i>Do not marry the virgin until her permission has been sought.</i> And this is general &#8211; no one is exempted from it, not (even) her guardians. It is reported in Saheeh Muslim: <i>The virgin, her father is to seek her consent.</i>..</p>

<p><span style="text-align:justify;">The </span><i style="text-align:justify;">Nikah</i><span style="text-align:justify;"> is from the ways of Allah with regard to his creation, between the children of Adam, male and female.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With it there are great benefits, from them: chastity of the two spouses, one to the other; to fulfill what is required from the husband towards his wife; the husband taking care of his wife; and protecting her. From it is also the fulfilling of the desires of both sexes and from it is having children. There are many benefits from <i>Nikah</i>&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most important thing is that it keeps you chaste from adultery, from fornication and the loss of lineage, and from the corruption of moral uprightness. There is the protection of one’s health.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for adultery and fornication then their end place is in epidemics and in lethal illnesses, as is well-known.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center"><b>وَلَا تَقْرَبُوا الزِّنَا إِنَّهُ كَانَ فَاحِشَةً وَسَاءَ سَبِيلًا ٣٢</b><b></b></p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center"><span style="color:#008000;">And come not near to unlawful sexual intercourse. Verily, it is a <i>Fahishah</i> [i.e. anything that transgresses its limits (a great sin)], and an evil way (that leads one to Hell unless Allah forgives him).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center">[Surah Al-&#8216;Isrā&#8217;:32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With it there is the loss of lineage, the spread of illnesses, the loss of modesty and chastity. With it there are great harms; fornication, we seek refuge with Allah, what an evil way. The harms of fornication are not limited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With <i>Nikah</i>, there is a protection from fornication and from its harms, and all praises are due to Allah. <i>Nikah</i> produces offspring. As for fornication then it is a loss. The offspring from fornication have no father and no lineage, and we seek refuge with Allah. Lost&#8230; This is from the disadvantages of fornication.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Allah) didn&#8217;t say don&#8217;t fornicate, he said don&#8217;t come close to it, &#8216;don&#8217;t come near to it&#8217;, i.e. stay away from the means that lead to fornication. Such as: looking, the seclusion with a man, the traveling of the woman by herself, her showing off her beauty. These are means that lead to falling into fornication. Allah has not allowed them, he has prohibited them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If there is leniency in these means then fornication will take place. If there is leniency in these means then fornication will take place, because the desires are present. Desires are present between men and women. If they sat together and mixed then fornication is close. <i>Shaytaan</i> is present, if a man secluded himself with a woman, then <i>shaytaan</i> is the third one amongst them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They say you have bad thoughts and that you are pessimists. We are not pessimists, this is the reality. This is the reality and if these means that Allah has prohibited are violated, then fornication will occur, no doubt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even the righteous man, the religious one, there is a danger upon him from the woman. Especially if she was beautiful and he secluded himself with her or traveled with her or she joined him at work. Or if she sat with him in the classroom, or in an exam, or in meetings. Or if she sat with him on the television, or on the radio, as his colleague, i.e. a presenter next to him, and she is beautified and he is a youth. Far is Allah from all imperfections. Do you bring petrol next to fire? Petrol is by itself and the fire is by itself. You bring her next to him! This is like that; no it is worse than petrol and fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Desires… we seek refuge with Allah, desires are strong. So for this reason Allah (the Exalted, Most High), has placed barriers that prevent falling in to fornication. If they are preserved, fornication is lessened or cut-off. If they are lost, then fornication will occur without a doubt. No matter what, even if they are religious or modest, the children of Adam are not saved from fornication except by the means that prevent it.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The wife hates that her husband should marry with another woman even though she knows that Allâh has prescribed it and allowed it. Is she now considered to hate something Allâh has prescribed?</span></p>
<p><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This question has been posed several times. It is a natural hate, not a religious such. She is not hating that which Allâh has revealed. She is a believer and a Muslim. This is part of the female jealousy. This is the jealousy among the women. It is only part of the natural hate. It is not a hate towards that which Allâh has prescribed. It is only a hate towards the co-wife.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Some women are overcome by the urge to communicate what is said in the house and their marital life to their relatives and friends. Some of what is said is secret, and the husband does not want anyone else to know it. What is the ruling on women who divulge these secrets and communicate them to those outside the house, or to some members of the household?</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The practice, as some women do, of communicating what is said in the house, and communicating details about their marital life to relatives and friends, is a forbidden thing. It is not permissible for a woman to divulge the secrets of her house or her affairs with her husband to any person. Allaah, The Most High says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient (to Allaah and to their husbands), and guard in the husband’s absence what Allaah orders them to guard (e.g. their chastity and their husband’s property)”</span> An-Nisa’ 4:34</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; and the prophet Sallalaahu alaihi wa sallam informed us that the worst of people in rank before Allaah on the Day of Resurrection will be a man who has sexual intercourse with his wife and she with him, then he communicates her secrets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad bin Saalih al-`Uthaymeen<br />

<p>6 – From Abu Hurairah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211; </em>who said that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p align="center">‫لا يَفْرَكْ مُؤْمِنٌ مُؤْمِنَةً إِنْ كَرِهَ مِنْهَا خُلُقًا رَضِيَ مِنْهَا آخَرَ</p>

<p>7 – From Abdullaah bin Zamah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> that the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said:</p>
<p align="center">يعمد أحدكم فيجلد امرأته جلد العبد فلعله يضاجعها من أخر يومه</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">‘None of you should lash your wife[11] like the lashing of a slave, and then perhaps at night he has intercourse with her.</span>’[12]</p>
<p>8 – From Sa’ad bin Abi Waqqas <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> that the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p align="center">إِنَّكَ لَنْ تُنْفِقَ نَفَقَةً تَبْتَغِي بِهَا وَجْهَ اللَّهِ إِلا أُجِرْتَ عَلَيْهَا ، حَتَّى فِي اللُّقْمَةِ تَرْفَعُهَا إِلَى فِي امْرَأَتِكَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">‘Indeed you do not spend some wealth desiring the Face of Allaah except that you are rewarded for it, even for the food you place in your wife’s mouth.’</span>[13]</p>
<p>9 &#8211;  ‘Aeysha <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anha</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p align="center">ما ضرب صلى الله عليه وسلم بيده خادما قط و لا امرأة</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">‘The <strong>Messenger of Allaah </strong><strong><em>&#8211;</em></strong><strong><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em></strong><strong><em>&#8211;</em></strong><strong> never ever hit</strong>[14] a servant, or <strong>a woman</strong>.</span>’[15]</p>
<p>10 – Ibn Abbas <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">‘Indeed I love to beautify myself for my wife just like I love that she beautifies herself for me.</span>’[16]</p>
<p>11 – From Abdullaah bin ‘Amr <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p align="center">كفى بالمرء إثماً أن يضيع من يقوت</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">‘It is sufficient as a sin upon a man that he does not take responsibility over those he is responsible for.</span>’[17]</p>
<p>12- From Ibn Umar <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> the Messenger of Allaah said:</p>
<p align="center">إن أعظم الذنوب عند الله رجل تزوج امرأة فلما قضى حاجته منها طلقها وذهب بمهرها ، ورجل استعمل رجلا فذهب بأجرته ، وآخر يقتل دابة عبثا</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"> ‘Indeed the greatest of sins to Allaah are that a man marries a woman and when he has satisfied his need from her, he divorces her and goes off with her dowry.  And that a man employs another man and goes off with his salary and that a person kills his riding animal frivolously.</span>’[18]</p>
<p>13- From Mu’aweeyah bin Haydah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said:</p>
<p>‘I asked the Messenger of Allaah what is the right that the wife has upon one of us?</p>
<p>The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p align="center">أن تطعمها إذا طعمت وتكسوها إذا اكتسيت ولا تضرب الوجه ولا تقبح ولا تهجر إلا في البيت</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">‘That you feed her when you eat, and clothe her when you clothe yourself,[19] and do not hit her on her face and do not say may Allaah deface you,[20] and do not keep away from her except in the home</span>[21].’[22]</p>
<p>In another wording from Bahz Hakeem from his father, with the wording: He said: ‘I had said: O Prophet of Allaah, regarding our wives, what should we do and what should we be cautioned from?’</p>
<p>The Messenger said:</p>
<p>حرثك ، إئت حرثك أنى شئت غير أن لا تضرب الوجه ، ولا تقبح ، ولا تهجر إلا في البيت ، وأطعم إذا طعمت ، واكس إذا اكتسيت ، كيف وقد أفضى بعضكم إلى بعض ، ( بما حل عليه)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">‘She is your tilth, come to your tilth as you please, except that you do not strike her face, nor say may Allaah make you ugly, nor keep away from her except in the house, and feed her when you eat, and clothe her when you clothe yourself, and how can you not since you have gone in unto each other, except with what she has been made permissible for you.</span>’[23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13- From al-Miqdam bin Ma’dee Karib al-Kindi that the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> stood amongst the people and praised Allaah and exalted Him and said:</p>
<p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُوصِيكُمْ بِالنِّسَاءِ خَيْرًا، إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُوصِيكُمْ بِالنِّسَاءِ خَيْرًا، فَإِنَّهُنَّ أُمَّهَاتُكُمْ وَبَنَاتُكُمْ وَخَالاتُكُمْ، إِنَّ الرَّجُلَ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ يَتَزَوَّجُ الْمَرْأَةَ وَمَا تُعَلِّقُ يَدَاهَا الْخَيْطَ، فَمَا يَرْغَبُ وَاحِدٌ مِنْهُمَا عَنْ صَاحِبِهِ حَتَّى يَمُوتَا هَرَمًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">‘Indeed Allaah <strong>advices</strong><strong>[24]</strong> you in the strongest possible terms to be good to women, indeed Allaah advices you in the strongest possible terms to be good to women, advices you in the strongest possible terms with regards to women, indeed they are your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, your paternal aunts (father’s sisters) and your maternal aunts (mother’s sisters).  Indeed a man from the people of the two books (Jews &amp; Christians) marries a woman and does not hit her, each one of them continues to desire his companion until he dies in old age.’</span></p>
<p>Abu Salmah said I narrated this hadeeth to al-Ala bin Sufyaan al-Ghassanee who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">‘Indeed it has reached me that from the evil hidden sins which Allaah has made <em>Haraam</em>, which are not clearly mentioned in the Qur’aan, are that a man marries a woman and when his companion becomes old and she has stayed with him for a long time, and has produced all that her womb can, then he divorces her without any reason to do so.’</span>[25]</p>
<p>14 – Shaykh AbdurRahman bin Nasr as-Sa’adi (d. 1376 A.H.) said:</p>
<p>‘Allaah Ta’ala said regarding dealings:</p>
<p align="center">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#993300;">And do not forget liberality between yourselves.</span> &gt;&gt; [Baqarah: 227]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Which means, make a place for excellence and Ihsaan in your dealings.  <strong>Do not take all your rights, rather make things easy and do not make them difficult</strong>, and be pardoning in buying and selling, in settling a debt and times of need.  And whoever necessitates upon himself this goodness achieves a lot of good and great good. And Allaah Knows best.’</span>[26]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Shaykh Rabee’ ibn Haadee al-Madkhali said: ‘This Ayaah confirmed the blessing of living together in tranquillity since Allaah placed love and mercy between the husband and wife. Verily this blessing of living together in tranquillity cannot be achieved except if it is in an atmosphere which is surrounded and fragranced by love and mercy.’</p>

<p>[2] Shaykh AbdurRahman bin Nasr as-Sa’adi (d. 1376 A.H.) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘From those signs that indicate Allaah’s Mercy and His concern for His slaves, and His great Wisdom and His all-Encompassing knowledge is &lt;&lt; that He created for you from yourselves mates &gt;&gt; whom are suited to you and you are suited for them, and they are similar to you and you are similar to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;that you may find tranquility in them; and He placed between you affection and mercy.&gt;&gt; with what results from marriage is a means that causes love and mercy, so a person receives enjoyment and pleasure from the wife and the benefit of the presence of offspring and educating them, and finds tranquility with them and generally you do not find amongst people the like of the love and mercy found between husband and wife.’</p>

<p>[4] al-Hafidh Emaad ad-Deen Isma’eel Ibn Katheer (d. 774 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em>  said: ‘This means, speak to them in a good way and make your actions and your appearance  good as much as you can, just like you would love that from your partner, then you should deal with her as you would like to be dealt with, as Allaah Ta’ala said: &lt;&lt; And they (women) have rights (over their husbands as regards living expenses, etc.) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect, etc.) to what is reasonable,&gt;&gt; and the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘and the best of you are those who are best to their women.’ And from the Messenger’s mannerisms was that he would live with his wives in a beautiful way, always smiling, being playful with his family and being gentle with them, and spending on them and making his women laugh.’ [Taken from: ‘Tafseer al-Qur’aan al-Atheem’ 1/608]</p>

<p>[Riyadh as-Saliheen p. 159]</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>[7]  Shaykh Uthaymeen said: ‘Regarding the saying of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>: ‘The best of you . . .’ This person is the best of the people, he is the best of them to his wife. So if you have any goodness, then make that goodness for the closest of the people to you, and make it so that your wife is the first to benefit from this good.</p>
<p>And this is the opposite of what some people do today, you find that he has bad manners with his wife, and has good behavior with other people, and this is a great mistake.</p>
<p>Your wife has the most right to good behavior, and having the best manners to them, because she is the one who is with you day and night, openly and secretly.  If you are afflicted with something she is afflicted along with you, and if your happy, she is happy along with you, if your sad, she is sad along with you, therefore you should make your dealings with her better than your dealings with strangers, so the best of the people are those who are best of them to their wives.</p>
<p>I ask Allaah to complete my <em>Eemaan</em> and that of the Muslims, and that he makes us the best of the slaves of Allaah to our wives and upon those who have a right upon us. [Taken from: ‘Explanation of Riyadh as-Saliheen’ 3/134]</p>

<p>[8] Albaani said in ‘Silsilah Saheehah’ no. 284, ‘it is from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211; </em>collected by Tirmidhi and Ahmad and the first part of the hadeeth is collected by Abu Dawood, Ibn Abee Shaybah in ‘al-Musannaf’, Abu Na’eem in ‘al-Hileeyah’ and Haakim and he said it is Saheeh upon the conditions of Muslim and Dhahabi agreed with him.’</p>

<p>[11] Shaykh Uthaymeen said: ‘He lashes his wife like he lashes any other person as if there was no relationship between him and his wife, and as if she is a captive slave, helper to him.  This is not befitting because the relationship between a man and his wife is a special relationship, which must be built upon love, compassion, and keeping far away from evil, whether it is in speech or in action.</p>
<p>As for lashing her like lashing a slave, then at night to have intercourse with her, then how is it possible that you have intercourse with her at night with love, and then take pleasure and desire from her and you had lashed her like the lashing of a slave? !</p>
<p>This is a contradiction; this is why the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>rebuked this action. It is not befitting that this occurs from a human being, and the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> spoke the truth, indeed this does not befit an intelligent person more over a believer.’ [Taken from: ‘Sharh Riyadh as-Saliheen’ 3/119]</p>

<p>[14] Shaykh AbdulMuhsin al-Abbad al-Badr said about this hadeeth in his explanation of Sunnan Abi Dawood:</p>
<p>‘The compiler mentions the hadeeth of ‘Aeysha <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anha</em><em>&#8211;</em>:</p>
<p>‘That the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> never ever hit a servant, or a woman.’</p>
<p>That was because of his noble manners, he was forgiving and he <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> would live with his wives in a good way. An incident of hitting a servant, from those servants who used to serve him, never occurred.  He <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> never hit any of his wives, rather he was gentle, merciful, forgiving and he <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> love and gentleness.  This indicates to his <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> perfect mannerisms, even though there perhaps may have occurred transgression and matters by which some servants warranted reprimanding, however the Prophet’s <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> character and his way was gentle, forgiving and pardoning in his matters.’</p>

<p>[19] Shaykh Uthaymeen said: regarding the saying of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em> ‘that you feed her when you eat, and clothe her when you clothe yourself,’ Which means, do not specify clothing yourself without taking a concern in clothing her, nor feeding yourself and not feeding her.  Rather she is your partner, it is obligatory to spend on her as you spend upon yourself, so much so that many of the scholars say: ‘If a man does not spend on his wife, and she requests a divorce from the judge, then it is upon the judge to cancel the marriage, due to the husband being deficient about her right which is obligatory for her.’ [Explanation of Riyad as-Saliheen 3/131]</p>

So do not say: ‘You are from a unnoble tribe, or from an evil family etc.’ all of this is from claiming she is ugly which Allaah has prohibited.’ [Explanation of Riyad as-Saliheen 3/132]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Iblis places his throne upon water; he then sends detachments (for creating dissension) ; the nearer to him in rank are those who are most notorious in creating dissension. One of them comes and says: I did so and so. And he says: You have done nothing. Then one amongst them comes and says: <strong>I did not spare so and so until I sowed the seed of discord between a husband and a wife.</strong> The Satan goes near him and says: <strong>&#8216;You have done well.</strong> A&#8217;mash said: <strong>He then embraces him.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 1: Here in Sri Lanka some Kafirs (disbelievers) have accepted Islam, especially Buddhists, but they stay married according to their former religions. One might be married to his niece and they have children. In such a case, we cannot separate them. What should we do?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: If both spouses accept Islam together, and they are married in a way that is impermissible in Islam, they must be separated at once, such as a couple who accepts Islam while the wife is her husband&#8217;s niece.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In such a case, they must be forced to leave each other, as it is impermissible for a Muslim to marry his niece.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is according to Allah&#8217;s saying (Exalted be He), Forbidden to you (for marriage) are: your mothers until His saying, your sister’s daughters and similar cases. A man who accepts Islam while he is married to two sisters is asked to divorce one of them. This is according to what was narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhy and Al-Nasa&#8217;y, on the authority of Al-Dahhak ibn Fayruz, from his father that he said, When I embraced Islam, I was married to two sisters. The Prophet (peace be upon him) ordered me to divorce one of them. The wording of Al-Tirmidhy is choose either one of them that you wish. May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Source: <strong>General Presidency of Scholarly Research and Ifta (alifta.net)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) married to several wives following his migration to Madinah. His practice of polygyny was not something novel, as polygyny was widely practiced by all people and nations. Some societies allowed unlimited number of wives until some men had more than seven hundred wives, not including slave women. Some Arabs were reported to have taken in marriage more than ten wives. When Ghilan ibn Salamah Al-Thaqafy embraced Islam, he was married to ten wives. The Prophet (peace be upon him) instructed him, saying: Choose four of them (and divorce the rest).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Polygamy was also practiced by the ancient Greeks in Athens, China, Babylonia, Assyria, ancient Egypt, and the Jews were also polygamous. Prophet Sulayman (Solomon, peace be upon him) had seven hundred free women as wives and three hundred slave women. Al-Bukhari related in his Sahih (authentic) Book of Hadith: Sulayman (the son of) Dawud (David) said, ‘Tonight I will go to a hundred women, each of whom will give birth to a boy who will fight in the Cause of Allah.’ The Angel said to him, ‘Say: In sha’a-Allah (If it be the Will of Allah).’ But he did not say so, as he forgot. He went to them but none of them gave birth, apart from one woman who gave birth to half a child. The Prophet (peace be upon him) further said, ‘Had he said: In sha’a-Allah, he would not have broken his oath and he would have had more hope of fulfilling his wish.’ The Christian church also permitted polygyny and did not object to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Prophet’s marriage to nine wives</strong> at the same time was merely an implementation of Divine Instructions and Wisdom. Allah (may He be Exalted) states:<br />
So when Zaid had accomplished his desire from her (i.e. divorced her), We gave her to you in marriage, so that (in the future) there may be no difficulty for believers in respect to (the marriage of) the wives of their adopted sons when the latter have no desire to keep them (i.e. they have divorced them). And Allâh’s Command must be fulfilled. There is no blame on the Prophet (peace be upon him) in that which Allâh has made legal for him. That has been Allâh’s Way with those who have passed away of (the Prophets of) old.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Stating the fact that it is Allah Who made it lawful for His Messenger to marry several wives, He revealed:<br />
O Prophet (Muhammad peace be upon him)! Verily, We have made lawful to you your wives, to whom you have paid their Mahr (bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage), and those (slaves) whom your right hand possesses – whom Allâh has given to you Allah then limited the number of the Messenger’s wives to nine, all of whom he was forbidden to divorce. Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted) states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not lawful for you (to marry other) women after this, nor to change them for other wives even though their beauty attracts you</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the marriages of the Prophet (peace be upon him) were all necessitated by Divine Command. It is not permissible to compare other cases with that of the Prophet (peace be upon him). This matter was restricted to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) alone. None among the Muslim Ummah (nation) is permitted to marry beyond four women under the pretext that the Prophet (peace be upon him) married nine women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who criticize the Prophet of Islam and brand Muslims as lustful are in manifest error. Worse still, we find Muslims who level blasphemous charges at the Prophet (peace be upon him) and take the subject of his marriages in jest. Had true faith entered their hearts, they would not have allowed such thoughts to occupy their minds. Had they carefully examined the circumstances that surrounded each marriage, they would have thought otherwise. The Prophet (peace be upon him) contracted marriages either to protect and support a widowed woman, or bring comfort to the families whose hearts were broken by the death of their beloved father, or to cement the bonds of love with the clan of his wives, or to honor a free woman who fulfilled Allah’s Command and went against the traditions of her society by marrying a slave rather than a master seeking the Good Pleasure of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Had the Prophet (peace be upon him) been lustful, he would have opted to marry when he was in his prime youth, a period when desire for sexual gratification is at its peak. However, he married several wives only after he had grown into old age, when his desire for women had weakened. At the young age of twenty-five, he was married to only one wife, Khadijah bint Khuwaylid (may Allah be pleased with her), who was fifteen years older than him. She was forty while he was only twenty-five. He remained with her until she died.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It should also be noted that all the women whom he (peace be upon him) married had been married previously, except ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her). The wives of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) were:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1- Sawdah bint Zam‘ah ibn Qays Al-Qurashiyyah</strong> (may Allah be pleased with her): The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) got married to her following the death of her husband, Al-Sakran ibn ‘Amr ibn ‘Abd Shams. This took place after the death of his wife, Khadijah bint Khuwaylid, in Makkah and before his migration to Madinah. When<br />
she grew old, she gave up her day and night to ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2- ‘Aishah bint Al-Siddiq</strong> (may Allah be pleased with her): The Prophet (peace be upon him) contracted marriage with her before Sawdah. However, he did not consummate marriage with her until after its consummation with Sawdah. Among all his wives ‘Aishah was the only virgin whom the Prophet (peace be upon him) married. His marriage to ‘Aishah was meant to strengthen the bonds of kinship with Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq, the first man to embrace Islam and to support and believe in every word the Prophet (peace be upon him) uttered. He also sacrificed all his wealth for the sake of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3- Hafsah bint ‘Umar ibn Al-Khattab</strong> (may Allah be pleased with her): The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) took her in marriage although she was a previously married woman who lacked feminine charm. The Prophet (peace be upon him) married her because of the close relationship he had with her father.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4- Umm Salamah Hind bint Suhail Al-Makhzumiyyah</strong> (may Allah be pleased with her): The Prophet (peace be upon him) married her following the death of her husband, Abu Salamah ibn ‘Abd Al-Asad. His intention was to support her children. When the Prophet (peace be upon him) proposed to marry her, she said: “A woman like me is not suitable for marriage. I have become a barren woman, and I am jealous and have children.” The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) replied: I am older than you; as for jealousy, Allah will remove it, and as for children Allah and His Messenger are responsible for them. The Prophet (peace be upon him) then married her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>5- Zaynab bint Jahsh</strong> (may Allah be pleased with her): The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) married her after she was divorced by her husband Zayd ibn Harithah, the freed slave (and adopted son) of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). The Prophet (peace be upon him) was rewarding her compliance with Allah’s Command. It was through this marriage that Allah established the permissibility of marrying the wife of one’s adopted son, a matter which was difficult for the community at that time to undertake. Allah (may He be Exalted) states:<br />
So when Zaid had accomplished his desire from her (i.e. divorced her), We gave her to you in marriage, so that (in the future) there may be no difficulty for the believers in respect to (the marriage of) the wives of their adopted sons when the latter have no desire to keep them (i.e. they have divorced them). And Allâh’s Command must be fulfilled.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>6- Umm Habibah bint Abu Sufyan</strong> (may Allah be pleased with her): The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) married her after her husband, ‘Ubaydullah ibn Jahsh, apostatized from Islam. She stayed away from him until he died.<br />
She was in her thirties when the Prophet (peace be upon him) married her. He contracted the marriage while she was in Abyssinia (Ethiopia). The Prophet (peace be upon him) authorized Al-Najashy to conclude the marriage contract. Her authorizer was Khalid ibn Sa‘id ibn Al-‘As. Al-Najashy gave her four hundred Dinars as Sadaq (mandatory gift to a bride from the groom). This took place in the seventh year of Hijrah (the Prophet’s migration to Madinah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>7- Juwayriyyah bint Al-Harith</strong> (may Allah be pleased with her): The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) married her after her husband Musani‘ ibn Safwan was killed on the Battle of Al-Muraysi‘. The Prophet (peace be upon him) intended to honor her people by this marriage relationship with them, especially after they had been taken as war captives in the Battle of Banu Al-Mustaliq.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>8- Safiyyah bint Huyay ibn Akhtab</strong> (may Allah be pleased with her): The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) married her to bring solace to her broken heart following the murder of her father, paternal uncle and husband.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>9- Maymunah bint Al-Harith Al-Hilaliyyah</strong> (may Allah be pleased with her): The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) married her following the death of her husband, Abu Rahm ibn ‘Abd Al-‘Uzza Al-‘Amiry. This marriage took place in the seventh year of Hijrah. She (may Allah be pleased with her) was approaching forty by that time.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Polygyny </strong>: The condition or practice of having more than one wife at one time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">source: silsilat ul-hudaa wa nnoor, tape no. 787/3<br />
<em>asaheeha translations</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question: “Is it allowed for a woman to come between her husband and polygyny?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaani (<em>rahimahullaah</em>):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Of course, I believe that this is not allowed for her because of two reasons: 1) she is hindering (her husband) from the (lawful) path of Allaah, and 2) she is opposing the command of her husband. Because you know that the obedience of a woman to her husband is obligatory as is the case with the obedience of a member of a nation to the Muslim ruler – I don’t say blind obedience, but rather complete obedience – except that which the Legislation has made an exception, i.e. except if it is in disobedience to Allaah. And based on this there are Legislated rulings: that if the Muslim ruler commands something that is fundamentally allowed, this command becomes obligatory upon the one who is commanded with it to carry out, because it is the command of the <em>Walee ul-Amr</em> (Muslim ruler). Exactly likewise is the affair with respect to the wife with her husband.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a husband commands his wife to do something which is fundamentally allowed in the Legislation and which the woman is able to carry out, then it is obligatory upon her to obey him. And if she does not obey him, she has disobeyed Allaah and His Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em>. <strong>Therefore when a woman sets up obstacles that may come between her husband and the thing he wants to attain which Allaah (<em>‘azza wa jal</em>) has allowed, let alone if the allowed matter is something desired and legislated, then no doubt she will be disobedient two times</strong>: 1) as I mentioned previously, she is hindering (her husband) from the (lawful) path, and 2) she is opposing her husband in something that is not for her to oppose because she is able (to carry it out) and he is not wanting to do an act of disobedience to Allaah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">PS : Webster’s New World Dictionary defines <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Polygamy </strong></span>as &#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">the practice of having two or more wives or husbands at the same time</span>.&#8221;  Since Muslim women are not allowed to have two or more husbands at the same time, let’s find a better word:  <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Polygyny</strong></span>.  The same dictionary defines <strong>polygyny </strong>as &#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">a practice of having two or more wives at the same time</span>.&#8221; <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Polyandry </strong></span>(Greek: poly- many, andros- man) refers to a form of marriage in which a woman has two or more husbands at the same time</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: How did the Prophet (peace be upon him) deal with the teenage phase of Muslim youth, in order to help them go through this stage?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A:</strong> The Prophet (peace be upon him) paid great attention to Muslim youth, and gave them and their parents special guidance and directives.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He gave the parents these instructions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Command your children to pray when they become seven years old, and beat them for (neglecting) it when they become ten years old; and arrange their beds (to sleep) separately.</strong> Reported by Ahmad and Abu Dawud.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (peace be upon him) addressed the youth by saying: <strong>&#8216;O young people! Whoever among you is able to marry, should marry, for marriage helps him lower his gaze and keep his virtuousness, and whoever is not able to marry, is recommended to observe Sawm (fast), for Sawm diminishes his sexual desire.</strong> (Agreed upon by Imams Al-Bukhari and Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet, his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[Q]</strong><em>:</em> I and many others have observed that many people are very excessive when it comes to the matter of the <em> mahr</em> (wedding dowry that is paid to the bride), and that they seek great amounts of <em> mahr</em> when it comes to the marriage of their daughters, and they stipulate as a condition the giving of other gifts to them, along with the <em> mahr</em>. This wealth that people demand in such cases, is it <em> halaal</em> (lawful) or <em> haraam</em> (unlawful)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: What is prescribed in the <em> Sharee&#8217;ah</em> is that the <em> mahr</em> should be a small amount and that people should not compete with each other in this regard, acting in accordance with the many <em> ahaadeeth</em> which are related about this. They should also help facilitate marriages and be keen in preserving the modesty and decency of the young Muslim men and women. And it is not permissible for the <em>awliyaa</em> (guardians of the brides-to-be) to demand and stipulate gifts for themselves, since they have no right at all in this matter. Rather the right belongs to the woman, and in some particular cases to the father. He may stipulate a condition as long as it does not harm the daughter, nor lead to the delaying of the marriage. However, if the father forgoes such a right then this is better and more preferable. Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects &#8211; says:<strong> &#8220;And marry those amongst you who are single and also marry the pious of your male and female slaves. If they be poor, Allaah will enrich them out of His Bounty.&#8221; </strong>[Soorah an-Noor 24:32].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the <em> hadeeth</em> of &#8216;Uqbah ibn &#8216;Aamir <em> radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</em>, the Prophet <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> said: <em> &#8220;The best dowry is that which is easy.&#8221;</em> This was narrated by Abu Daawood and al-Haakim who authenticated it. And once a woman offered herself to the Prophet <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> for marriage. However, one of his Companions desired to marry her, so the Prophet <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> said [regarding the <em>mahr</em>]: <em>&#8220;Bring something, even if it be an iron ring.&#8221;</em> So when he could not find even this, the Prophet <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> married them for the dowry that the man would teach whatever of the Qur&#8217;aan he knew to her. 2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the dowry of the Prophet <em> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s</em> wives was five-hundred dirhams, which is equivalent to one-hundred and thirty riyaals today. And his daughters were married for the <em> mahr</em> of four-hundred dinaars, which is equivalent to one-hundred riyaals today. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <strong> &#8220;Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a most beautiful example to follow.&#8221;</strong> [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:21].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whenever the difficulties relating to marriage are lightened, then preserving the modesty and decency of young men and women becomes easier, shameful and evil deeds decrease, and the Ummah &#8211; as a result &#8211; will increase in number. However if this matter is made difficult, and people continue competing with each other with regards to the <em> mahr</em> (dowry), then the number of marriages will decrease, fornication will become more widespread and more young men and women will remain unmarried &#8211; except those whom Allaah saves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So my sincere advice to all the Muslims, wherever they may be, is to facilitate the marriage process and to cooperate in this and make it easy. They should turn away from demanding excessive <em> mahr</em> and avoid unnecessary hardships and difficulties in the <em>waleemah</em> (wedding-feast). Rather, they should content themselves with a <em> waleemah</em> that is according to the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em>, in which the burdens and difficulties for the husband and wife are minimal. May Allaah improve and rectify all the affairs of the Muslims and may He give them the guidance and ability to cling to the <em> Sunnah</em> (Prophetic guidance) in all matters. 3</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">Taken from the Book: The Structure of the Muslim Family by the shaykh al&#8217;Allaamah Muhammad Amaan ibn Ali al-Jaami died: 1416H</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[004:034] <span style="color:#008000;"><em>Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allâh has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse, as you can see, clearly gives the responsibility of leading and governing the family to the man. Additionally, the verse never failed to clarify the reason for this; rather, it explained why.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said, &#8220;because Allâh has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means.&#8221; [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1][TN}: Al-Qurtubi said in his tafseer [5/161] :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;Some of the people of knowledge have understood from the saying of Allah, the Most High, &#8220;because they spend (to support them) from their means.&#8221; That whenever the husband is incapable of supporting his wife then he is not considered to be maintaining her. If he is not maintaining her, then she can seek that the marriage contract be annulled because one of the intents behind the legislation of marriage has been lost.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. That both of them performed and fulfill the rights and obligations that Allah has made compulsory upon them as it pertains to the other partner. The wife should not demand to receive exactly the same rights that belong to the husband, and the husband should not use the authority or leadership that Allah has graced him with as an opportunity to oppress her and beat her unjustly. [ page # 49-50]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. It is essential that the woman obey her husband as much as she can when he commands her. As this is a station that Allah has granted to the men as mentioned in the two previous verses: &#8220;Man are the protectors and maintainer of women&#8221; [An-Nisaa: 34] and &#8220;But men have a degree of responsibility over them&#8221; [Al-Baqarah: 228]  [page # 5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Amaan al-Jaami rahimahullaah advises in &#8220;The Structure of The Muslim Family&#8221; (translated by brother Hasan As-Somali hafithahullaah) pg 31.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It is upon the intelligent Muslim woman to study her religion to allow her to truly grasp the position of Islam towards the woman and the dignified position Islam has given her. Additionally, she should not pay attention to every imbecile that makes unfounded claims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At the same time, she should examine some of the foreign constitutions, like the French constitution, to truly understand the position that these constitutions have towards the women.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
