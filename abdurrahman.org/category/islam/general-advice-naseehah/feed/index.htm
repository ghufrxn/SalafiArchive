										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Verily Allaah loves three things for you and he hates three things for you. He loves that you worship Him alone, and that you do not join anyone else in your worship of him and that you do not worship other than him, He loves that you hold tight altogether to the rope of Allaah and that you do not be divided.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And Allaah hates for you hearsay (he said and she said – qeela wa qaal – spreading rumours), he hates for you excessive questioning (questioning that brings about no benefit), thirdly, he hates for you the wasting of money.”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Khutbah is based on the explanation of <strong>Shaykh Rabee ibn Hadee (hafidhahullaah)</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah Issue No.7 &#8211; Rabî&#8217; ul-Awwal 1418H / July 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>IS CLINGING TO THE RELIGION A CAUSE OF AFFLICTION?</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: There was a person in our city who was very firm in practicing the Religion, and was later afflicted with an illness. Some of the people started saying to him that the cause of him being afflicted with this illness is because of his adhering to the Religion. Being affected with this type of talk, the person then shaved off his beard and he neglected his Prayers. So is it permissible to say that the cause of his affliction was due to him clinging to the commandments of the Religion? And the one who says such a thing, is he considered a <i>kaafir</i> (disbeliever) because of such a saying?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: &#8221;Clinging on to the Religion is not a cause for his illness. Rather, it is a cause for every good, both in this life and in the Hereafter. And it is not permissible for any Muslim, that when some foolish and ignorant people utter words such as this, to give them any weight. Nor is it permissible to shave one&#8217;s beard or shorten it, or to neglect guarding the five obligatory Prayers in congregation. Rather, it is obligatory for such a person to remain steadfast upon the truth, and to keep away from all that Allaah has prohibited, and to beware of all that which angers Allaah and incurs His punishment &#8211; by obeying Allaah and His Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects said: <b>&#8220;Whosoever obeys Allaah and His Messenger will be admitted into Gardens of Paradise, beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever. That will be the greatest achievement. But whosoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger and oversteps His limits, Allaah will cast him in the Fire, to abide therein; and he shall have a humiliating punishment.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:13-14]. And Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Whosoever has taqwaa (piety, fear and obedience) of Allaah, He will make a way out for him. And He will provide for him from places he could never imagine.&#8221;</b> [Soorah at-Talaaq 65:2-3]. And He &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Whosoever has taqwaa of Allaah, He will make his affair easy for him,&#8221; </b>[Soorah at-Talaaq 65:4]. And the verses with this meaning are plentiful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the person who says that the cause for such affliction is due to being firm and steadfast upon the Religion &#8211; then such a person is ignorant. It is obligatory to censure such a person and to know that clinging to the Religion does not bring about anything except good. As for what occurs to a Muslim by way of a calamity that he dislikes, then this is a form of expiating his evil actions and a forgiveness for his sins. As regards to the issue of <i>takfeer</i> (declaring a Muslim to be a <i>kaafir</i>, a disbeliever) upon this person, then this requires detail, and is known from the chapters concerning the judgement upon a <i>murtad</i> (apostate) &#8211; which can be found in the books of Islaamic jurisprudence and understanding. And with Allaah is the power and ability.&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>CRYING DUE TO ILLNESS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: I am ill and I sometimes cry because of what happens to me after my illness. Is this considered an action which opposes Allaah and of not being pleased with what He has decreed? I do not do this action willfully. Likewise, does that ruling also include talking to my relatives about my illness?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: &#8220;There is no harm in crying, if it is simply tears coming from the eyes, without wailing. This is based upon the statement of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, when his son Ibraaheem passed away: <i>&#8220;The eye sheds tears and the heart grieves, yet we do not say anything except what is pleasing to our Lord. By your death &#8211; O Ibraaheem &#8211; we are indeed in grief.&#8221;</i>2 The <i>ahaadeeth</i> with this meaning are numerous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also no harm in you speaking about your illness to your relatives and friends, providing that you praise and thank Allaah, glorify Him and ask Him for sound health, following the permissible means. We advise you to patiently persevere and to hope in a reward from Allaah. I give you the glad tidings, as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; has said: <b>&#8220;Only those who are patient shall recieve their reward in full, without reckoning.&#8221;</b> [Soorah az-Zumar 39:10]. The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> also said: <i>&#8220;A Muslim is not afflicted with fatigue, sorrow, disease or pain &#8211; even if it be the pricking of a thorn &#8211; except that due to it, Allaah will expiate some of his sins.&#8221;</i>3 Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> also said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever Allaah intends good for, He afflicts him with some calamity.&#8221;</i>4 So we ask Allaah to grant you a cure and sound health, as well as goodness of the heart and actions. Indeed He is the One who hears and the One who responds.&#8221;5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>SAFEGUARDING THE PRAYERS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: A leaflet was sent to us and with it was a copy of a page which has been distributed amongst the people, and which included a hadeeth attributed to the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> which said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever misses the Prayer due to laziness, then Allaah will punish him with fifteen punishments &#8230;&#8221;</i> So what is the authenticity of this particular hadeeth?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: &#8220;This hadeeth is a lie upon the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and there is no basis at all for it being authentic &#8211; as has been explained by al-Haafidh adh-Dhahabee, <i>rahimahullaah</i>, in <i>al-Meezaan</i> and al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr in <i>Lisaanul-Meezaan</i>. So it is a must that whosoever comes across such a leaflet that he burns it and that he admonishes the one who produced it, in order to defend the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and to protect his Sunnah from the lies of the liars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what has been Recorded in the great Qur&#8217;aan and the authentic Sunnah of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> -with regards to the importance of the Prayer and warning against being lazy in performing it and a threat for whosoever does this &#8211; is more than sufficient against the lies of the liars. So Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Guard strictly your five daily Prayers and in particular the middle Prayer (i.e. the &#8216;Asr Prayer), and stand before Allaah with obedience.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:238]. And Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: &#8220;And then there came after them a people who gave up their Prayer and followed their lusts. So they will be thrown into the Hellfire.&#8221; [Soorah Maryam 19:59]. And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;So woe be upon those who pray; those who delay their Prayer from the fixed stated times.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;oon 107:3-4]. And the verses with this meaning are plentiful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;The covenant between us and them is the Salaah (Prayer), so whosoever abandons it has committed an act of disbelief.&#8221;</i> Recorded by Imaam Ahmad and the compilers of the four Sunan with a Saheeh (authentic) <i>isnaad</i> (chain of narration).6 And also his <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s</i> saying: <i>&#8220;Between a person and between al-Kufr (disbelief) and ash-Shirk (associating partners with Allaah in the worship of Allaah) is abandoning the Salaah (Prayer).&#8221; </i>Recorded by Muslim in his Saheeh (1/62). Also the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> mentions the Salaah (Prayer) to his Companions one day, saying: <i>&#8220;Whosoever safeguards them, then that will be a light, a proof and a means of salvation for him on the Day of Resurrection. But whosoever does not safeguard them, then he has no light, nor proof nor salvation and on the Day of Resurrection he will be gathered along with Fir&#8217;awn, Haamaan, Qaaroon and &#8216;Ubayy ibn Khalf.&#8221;</i> Recorded by Imaam Ahmad with a <i>Hasan isnaad</i>.7</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the Scholars have said, in explanation to the above hadeeth, that whosoever leaves the Prayer, the he will be raised up, on the Day of Judgement, along with those <i>kaafirs</i> (disbelievers). Thus, if the reason for his leaving the Prayer was due to leadership, then he has resembled Fir&#8217;awn in this, and would be raised along with him and sent to the Fire of the Day of Resurrection. If the reason for leaving the Prayer was due to his ministerial post or a similar occupation, then he has resembled Haamaan, the minister to Fir&#8217;awn, and he will be raised along with him on the Day of Resurrection and sent to the Fire. If the reason for leaving the Prayer was due to wealth and false desires, then he has resembled Qaaroon &#8211; upon whom Allaah bestowed great wealth, yet he became arrogant against the truth and followed his false desires, due to this wealth &#8211; and would be raised up along with him on the Day of Resurrection and sent to the Fire. If the reason for leaving the Prayer was business, or other such social transactions and work, then he has resembled &#8216;Ubayy ibn Khalf, the famous trader from the disbelievers of Makkah &#8211; so he will be raised up along with him on the Day of Resurrection and sent to the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah for forgiveness and protection from their condition and the likes of their condition.&#8221;8</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>PRAYING DURING THE FRIDAY SERMON</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: There was a discussion that took place between some brothers and myself regarding praying two rak&#8217;ahs upon entering the mosque and the Imaam is delivering the Friday <i>khutbah</i> (sermon). I ask you &#8211; O noble Shaykh &#8211; to give us a ruling concerning this. Is it allowed or not? The brothers who generally come and pray in the mosque are upon the <i>madhhab</i> of Imaam Maalik.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: &#8220;The Sunnah upon entering the masjid (mosque) is to pray two <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> of <i>tahyatul masjid </i>(a Prayer far greeting the mosque), even if the Imaam is delivering the Friday khutbah, due to the sayings of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>: <i>&#8220;When anyone of you enters the masjid, then let him not sit until he prays two rak&#8217;ahs.&#8221;</i> Recorded by al-Bukhaaree (1/293) and Muslim (2/155). Likewise Muslim relates in his Saheeh (3/1415), from Jaabir <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i>, that the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;When any of you comes on the day of Jumu&#8217;ah (Friday), and the Imaam is delivering the khutbah, then let him pray two rak&#8217;ahs and let him make them short.&#8221;</i> So this is a clear and authentic text concerning this issue. It is not permissible for anyone to oppose it. So perhaps this particular narration did not reach Imaam Maalik <i>rahimahullaah</i>, if it is established from him that he prohibited the praying of these two rak&#8217;ahs at the time of the khutbah. However, when the authentic Sunnah becomes clear, then it is not permissible to oppose it with the saying of anyone else &#8211; whosoever he may be.9 About this Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;O you who Believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger and those in authority amongst you. And if you differ in anything amongst yourselves then refer it to Allaah and His Messenger if you do believe in Allaah and the Last Day. That is better and most suitable for final determination.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:59]. And He &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And in whatever you differ, then the judgement belongs to Allaah,&#8221;</b> [Soorah ash-Shooraa 42:10]. And it is known that the judgement of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> is from the judgement of Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; as Allaah said: <b>&#8220;Whosoever obeys the Messenger, has indeed obeyed Allaah.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:80]. And with Allaah rests the power and ability.&#8221;10</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>BEING TOO SHY TO CENSURE EVIL</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: I am a young woman who hates <i>gheebah</i> (backbiting) and <i>nameemah</i> (tale carrying). Sometimes I am amongst a group of people who speak about others and the begin to backbite and spread tales. In my soul, I hate and despise what they are doing, but I am too shy and therefore do not have the ability to make them stop. Also, I have no other place to go to get away from them. Allaah knows that I wish they would start talking about something else. So am I sinful in sitting with them, and what is the obligation upon me in this case? May Allaah grant you what is best for Islaam and the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: &#8220;In this case you are sinful, unless you repel the evil. If they accept that from you, then all praises are due to Allaah. If they do not accept that from you, then you must leave them and not sit with them. This is because Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; stated: <b>&#8220;When you see those engaged in false conversation about Our Verses, by mocking at them, then keep away from them until they turn to another topic.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:68]. Likewise, the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever sees an evil then let him change it by his hand. if he is unable to do this, then let him change it with his tongue. If he is unable to do this, then let him change it with his heart &#8211; and that is the weakest of eemaan (faith).&#8221;</i> This was Recorded by Muslim in his Saheeh (no.49). And the verses and narrations with this meaning are plentiful.&#8221;11</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>RUNNING AWAY FROM THE QUR&#8217;AAN</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q]: What is your advice &#8211; O Shaykh &#8211; for those who go without reading the Qur&#8217;aan for a month, or even many months, and who have no excuse for such behaviors? However, you will find some of them reading those magazines that contain no benefit for them, and following them up closely!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: &#8220;It is recommended for every Believing man and woman to recite the Book of Allaah often, with due contemplation and understanding. This may be done by using a copy of the Qur&#8217;aan or from one&#8217;s memory. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;This is a Book which We have sent down to you, full of blessings, that you may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may remember.&#8221; </b>[Soorah Saad 38:29].And:<b> &#8220;Indeed those who recite the Book of Allaah and offer the Prayer perfectly and spend in charity out of what We have provided for them &#8211; secretly and openly &#8211; hope for a sure trade-gain that will never perish. That He may pay them their wages in full and give them even more out of His Grace. Indeed, He is Oft-Forgiving, ready to appreciate good deeds.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Faatir 35:29-30].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The aforementioned recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan includes both reciting and acting upon it. The recitation is to be done with contemplation and understanding of it. Sincerity to Allaah is a means of complying with and acting upon the Qur&#8217;aan, and its recitation contains a great reward &#8211; as the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Recite the Qur&#8217;aan. For on the Day of Resurrection, it shall come as an intercessor for its companion.&#8221;</i> This was recorded by Muslim in his Saheeh (no.804). The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> also said: &#8220;The best of you is he who learns the Qur&#8217;aan and teaches it.&#8221; This was Recorded by al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh (3/66). Another narration states: <i>&#8220;Whosoever reads one harf (letter) of the Qur&#8217;aan shall receive a good deed and ten good deeds similar to it. I do not say that Alif Laam Meem is a harf but Alif is a harf and Laam is a harf and Meem is a harf.&#8221;</i>12 The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said to &#8216;Abdullaah ibn &#8220;Amr ibn al-&#8216;Aas: <i>&#8220;Complete the recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan once a month.&#8221;</i> He said: I am able to do more than that. So he said: <i>&#8220;Then complete its recital once in seven days.&#8221;</i>13 The Companions used to complete the entire Qur&#8217;aan once every seven days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I advise all the readers of the Qur&#8217;aan to increase in their reading of it, with contemplation and understanding it, along with sincerity to Allaah in this &#8211; with the purpose of learning and benefiting from the Qur&#8217;aan. They should read the entire Qur&#8217;aan once a month. If, however, they are able to do more than this without any difficulty, then they should complete it in less than this time. However, it is best not to complete it in less than three days, since this is the least amount of time that the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> mentioned to &#8216;Abdullaah ibn &#8216;Amr ibn al-&#8216;Aas. This is because if it is read in less than three days, the person becomes hasty and lacks thought and concentration &#8230;&#8221;14</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><strong>Al-Istiqaamah</strong> Magazine, Issue No.6 &#8211; Dhul-Qa&#8217;dah 1417H / March 1997</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kumail ibn Ziyaad said: &#8216;Alee ibn Abee Taalib took hold of my hand and took me off towards the desert. When we reached it, he sat down, took a deep breath and then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O Kumail ibn Ziyaad! The hearts are receptacles, so the best of them is the one which preserves the best. So memorise what I say to you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The people are of three (types)</strong>: the Scholar who is rabbaanee [1],  the one learning being upon the path of salvation, and the confused rabble who follow everyone who calls out &#8211; bending along with every wind &#8211; they are not enlightened by the light of knowledge, nor do they lean upon a firm support.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Knowledge is better than wealth</strong>. Knowledge is a protection for you, whereas it is you that has to protect wealth. The zakaat of knowledge is action, whereas spending decreases wealth. And love of the Scholar is part of the Religion. Knowledge brings about obedience for the Scholar in his own lifetime and causes him to have good repute after his death, whereas the benefit of wealth ceases when it passes away. The hoarders of wealth have died even though they are still alive, whereas the Scholars remain for as long as time remains &#8211; their persons are lost, but their examples remain in the hearts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here, indeed here &#8211; (and he pointed to his chest) &#8211; there is knowledge, if only I could find carriers for it. But instead I have found them quick to comprehend, but not trustworthy. They use what pertains to the Religion for worldly ends. They seek to use Allaah&#8217;s proofs against His Book, blindly following the people of truth, but having no insight regarding receiving it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Doubt pierces their hearts when anything problematic arises. They are neither this nor that. They do not know where the truth lies, and if they are mistaken then they do not know why. They are ardently in love with something the true state of which they do not know &#8211; so they become a trial for others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed, the utmost good is for the one to whom Allaah grants understanding of the Religion And it is enough ignorance for a person that he does not know about his Religion. Such a person is passionately addicted to pleasures, accustomed to following desires, or is one given to amassing wealth and piling it up. Such people are not from the callers to the Religion rather they are more like the grazing cattle. And thus knowledge passes away with the passing away of those who carry it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oh Allaah, yes! The earth will not be without one who stands upright for Allaah, with proof &#8211; so that Allaah&#8217;s proofs and clear signs are not abolished. They are the ones who are few in number, but having the most value to Allaah. With them, Allaah asserts His proofs amongst their contemporaries and cultivates them in the hearts of those similar to them. With them, knowledge assaults and comes upon the true state of affairs, so that which those accustomed to easy living find difficult therein, they find easy; and they are at home with that which causes consternation to the ignorant ones. They live in this world with their bodies, whereas their souls are attached to higher things. They are Allaah&#8217;s ambassadors in His land and the callers to His Religion. Oh how I would like to see them, and I seek Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness for myself and for you. If you wish then you may leave.&#8221; [2]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">By the Imâm &#8211; the Shaykh of Islâm &#8211; Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah [1]<br />
Al-Ibaanah Magazine , Issue No.3 &#8211; Dhul-Qa’dah 1416H / April 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[1] Six Etiquettes of Learning</b> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim &#8211; <i>rahimahullâh</i> &#8211; said:<br />
“There are six stages to knowledge:-<br />
<i>Firstly</i>: Asking questions in a good manner.<br />
<i>Secondly</i>: Remaining quiet and listening attentively.<br />
<i>Thirdly</i>: Understanding well.<br />
<i>Fourthly</i>: Memorising.<br />
<i>Fifthly</i>: Teaching.<br />
<i>Sixthly</i> &#8211; and it is its fruit: Acting upon the knowledge and keeping to its limits.” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[2] Fruits of Humility</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim &#8211; <i>rahimahullâh</i> &#8211; said: [4]<br />
One of the <i>Salaf</i> (Pious Predecessors) said: “Indeed a servant commits a sin by which he enters Paradise; and another does a good deed by which he enters the Fire.” It was asked: How is that? So he replied: “The one who committed the sin, constantly thinks about it; which causes him to fear it, regret it, weep over it and feel ashamed in front of his Lord the Most High &#8211; due to it. He stands before Allâh, broken-hearted and with his head lowered in humility. So this sin is more beneficial to him than doing many acts of obedience, since it caused him to have humility and humbleness &#8211; which leads to the servant’s happiness and success &#8211; to the extent that this sin becomes the cause for him entering Paradise. As for the doer of good, then he does not consider this good a favour from his Lord upon him. Rather, he becomes arrogant and amazed with himself, saying: I have achieved such and such, and such and such. So this further increases him in self-adulation, pride and arrogance &#8211; such that this becomes the cause for his destruction.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[3] Purifying the Heart</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim &#8211; <i> rahimahullâh</i> &#8211; said:<br />
“There is no doubt that the heart becomes covered with rust, just as metal dishes &#8211; silver, and their like &#8211; become rusty. So the rust of the heart is polished with <i>dhikr</i> (remembrance of Allâh), for <i>dhikr </i> polishes the heart until it becomes like a shiny mirror. However, when <i> dhikr</i> is abandoned, the rust returns; and when it commences then the heart again begins to be cleansed. Thus the heart becoming rusty is due to two matters: sins and <i>ghaflah</i> (neglecting remembrance of Allâh). Likewise, it is cleansed and polished by two things: <i>istigfâr</i> (seeking Allâh’s forgiveness) and <i>dhikr</i>.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[4] Jihâd Against the Self</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Jihâd (striving) against the soul has four stages:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Firstly</i>: To strive in learning guidance and the religion of truth, without which there will be no success. Indeed, there can be no true happiness, nor any delight in this world and in the Herefater, except through it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Secondly</i>: Striving to act upon what has been learnt, since knowledge without action will not benefit, rather it will cause harm.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Thirdly</i>: Striving to invite others towards it and to teach those who do not know, otherwise he may be considered from those who hide what Allâh has revealed of guidance and clear explanation. Such knowledge will neither benefit, nor save a person from the punishment of Allâh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Fourthly</i>: Striving to be patient and persevering against those who oppose this <i> da’wah</i> (call) to Allâh and those who seek to cause harm &#8211; patiently bearing all these hardships for the sake of Allâh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When these four stages are completed then such a person is considered to be amongst the <i> Rabbâniyyûn</i>. The <i>Salaf</i> were agreed that a Scholar does not deserve the title of <i>Rabbânî</i> until he recognises and knows the truth, acts upon it, and teaches it to others. So whosoever has knowledge, acts upon it, and teaches this knowledge to others, is considered from the <i>Rabbâniyyûn</i>.” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[5] Trials of the Heart</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyirn said, whilst commenting upon the following hadîth: <i>“Trials and tribulations will be presented to hearts, as a reed mat is interwoven stick by stick. Any heart which absorbs these trials will have a black mark put in it. However, any heart that rejects them will have a white mark put in it. The result is that hearts will be of two kinds: one white like a white stone, which will not be harmed by trials as long as the heavens and earth endure; and the other dark and rusty, like an over-turned vessel; not able to recognise the good, nor reject evil, but rather being absorbed with its desires.”</i> [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The <i>fitan</i> (trials) which are presented to the hearts &#8211; and which are the cause of its weakness &#8211; are: [i] the trials relating to <i>shahwah</i> (false desire) and [ii] the trials relating to <i>shubhah</i> (doubt) &#8230; So the first causes intentions and desires to be corrupted, whilst the second causes knowledge and beliefs to be corrupted.” [8] Speaking about such trials, he &#8211; <i>rahimahullâh</i> &#8211; said: “Hearts &#8211; when exposed to such <i> fitan</i> (trials) &#8211; are of two types: [The first type]: a heart, which, when exposed to such trials, absorbs it like a sponge that soaks-up water, leaving in it a black stain. Such a heart continues to soak-up the various trials that are presented to it, until it becomes dark and corrupted &#8211; which is what is meant by <i>“an over-turned vessel”</i>, so when this occurs, two dangerous and deadly diseases take hold of it and plunge it into destruction</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Firstly</i>: confusing good with evil, so it neither recognises the good, nor rejects the evil. This disease may take hold of it to such an extent that it believes good to be evil; and evil to be good, <i>Sunnah</i> to be <i> bid’ah</i> (innovation); and innovations to be the <i>Sunnah</i>, and the truth to be falsehood; and falsehood the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Secondly</i>: judging by its whims and desires, over and against what Allâh’s Messenger <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> came with &#8211; being enslaved by its whims and desires and being led by them also.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[The second type]: a white heart in which the light of <i>îmân</i> is bright and its radiance is illuminating. So when trials are presented to such a heart, it rejects and turns away from them. This further increases its light and illumination and its strength.” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[6] Four Principles of Worship</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“(The <i>Âyah</i>): <b>“You alone do we worship.”</b> [Sûrah al-Fâtihah 1:5] is built upon four principles:- Ascertaining what Allâh and His Messenger love and are pleased with, from [i] the sayings of the heart and [ii] of the tongue; and [iii] the actions of the heart and [iv] of the limbs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <i>al-’ubûdiyyah</i> (servitude and slavery to Allâh) is a comprehensive term for all these for stages. The one who actualises them has indeed actualised: <b>“You alone do we worship.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>The saying of the heart</b></i>: It is <i>i’tiqâd</i> (belief) in what Allâh &#8211; <i>the Most Perfect</i> &#8211; informed about His Self; concerning His Names, His Attributes, His Actions, His Angels, and all that He sent upon the tongue of His Messenger <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>The saying of the tongue</b></i>: It is to inform and convey (what Allâh has revealed), to call to it, defend it, to explain the false innovations which oppose it, to establish its remembrance and to convey what it orders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>The action of the heart</b></i>: Such as love for Him, reliance upon Him, repenting to Him, having fear and hope in Him, making the <i>Dîn</i> purely and sincerely for Him, having patience in what He orders and prohibits, having patience with what He decrees and being pleased with it, having allegiance and enmity for His sake, humbling oneself in front of Him and having humility in front of Him, becoming tranquil with Him and other than this from the actions of the heart which are actually connected to the action of the limbs &#8230; and actions of the limbs without the action of the heart is of little benefit, if any benefit at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>The action of the limbs</b></i>: Such as Prayer and <i>Jihâd</i>, attending the <i>Jumu’ah</i> and being with the <i>Jamâ’ah</i>, aiding those who are unable and displaying goodness and kindness to the creation, and other than this.” [10]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>References</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. He is Abû ’Abdullâh, Shamsud-Dîn Muhammad ibn Abû Bakr better known as Ibn al-Qayyim (or Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah). He was born in the year 691H in the city of Damascus. From an early age he set about acquiring knowledge and studied under many prominent teachers, the most notable of whom was Shaykhul-Islâm Ibn Taymiyyah. His students include the likes of Ibn Kathîr, adh-Dhahabî, Ibn Bajab, Ibn ’Abdul-Hâdî and others. He authored over ninety books and booklets &#8211; all of them being characterised by their touching address to the soul and the heart, as well as their accuracy, precision and depth of research. Ibn al-Qayyim died on the night of Thursday 13th Rajab at the time of the ’Ishâ <i>adhân</i> in the year 751H. Testaments about his comprehensive knowledge, firm adherence to the way of the <i>Salaf</i>; excellent manners, worship and <i>zuhd</i> have been given by Al-Hâfidh Ibn Hajar in ad-<i>Dururul-Kâminah</i> (3/400), Al-Hâfidh Ibn Rajab in <i> Dhayl Tabaqâtul-Hanâbilah</i> (2/447), ash-Shawkânî in <i>al-Badrut-Tâli’</i> (2/143-146) and also Al-Hâfidh Ibn Kathîr who said about him in <i>al-Bidâyah wan-Nihâyah</i> (14/246): “He attained great proficiency in many branches of knowledge, particularly knowledge of <i>Tafsîr</i>, Hadîth and <i>Usûl</i>. When Shaykh Taqiyyud-Dîn Ibn Taymiyyah returned from Egypt in the year 712H, he stayed with the Shaykh until he died, learning a great deal of knowledge from him; along with the knowledge which he had already occupied himself in obtaining. So he became a singular Scholar in many branches of knowledge. He also continued to seek knowledge greatly day and night and was constant in humbly calling upon his Lord. He recited well and had fine manners. He had a great deal of love and did not harbour any envy for anyone, nor harm anyone, nor seek to find fault with anyone, nor bear any malice towards anyone. I was one of those who most often kept company with him and I was one of the most beloved of people to him. I do not know anyone in the world, in this time, who is a greater worshipper than him. His <i>Salâh</i> (Prayer) used to be very lengthy, with prolonged <i>rukû’</i> (bowing) and <i>sujûd</i> (prostration). His companions would often reproach him for this, yet he never retorted back, nor did he abandon this practice &#8211; may Allâh shower His Mercy upon him.”<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah Magazine , Issue No.6 &#8211; Dhul-Qa&#8217;dah 1417H / March 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullaah ibn Mas&#8217;ood <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> relates that the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> would supplicate:<i> &#8220;O Allaah! I ask You for guidance, piety, safety and well-being, and contentment and sufficiency.&#8221;</i> [<b><i>Allaahumma innee as&#8217;alukal-hudaa wat-tuqaa wal-&#8216;afaafa wal-ghinaa</i></b>].1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam as-Sa&#8217;dee (d.1376H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <i>du&#8217;aa</i> (supplication) is from the most comprehensive and beneficial <i>du&#8217;aas</i> (supplications), since it includes asking Allaah for well-being with regards to both the Religion and the world. Thus, <i>al-hudaa</i> (the guidance) is beneficial knowledge, and <i>at-tuqaa </i>(i.e. <i>taqwaa</i> or piety) is righteous actions and leaving-off what Allaah and His Messenger have forbidden; and this is (asking) for correctness and well-being of a person&#8217;s Religion. For indeed, the Religion comprises of beneficial knowledge and recognising the truth &#8211; which is guidance &#8211; and standing firm upon obedience to Allaah and His Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> &#8211; and this is piety.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <i>al-&#8216;afaafa</i> (well-being and safety) and <i>al-ghinaa</i> (contentment and sufficiency) comprises of being safe from (the harms of) the creation and that the heart is not attached to them. And it also comprises of being contented with Allaah and what He provides, and seeking whatever will cause the heart to be satisfied with Him. So with this, happiness in this worldly life is completed, and the heart tastes true sweetness and delight &#8211; and this is a goodly life. So whosoever is granted the provisions of guidance, Piety. well-being and contentment has indeed achieved true happiness, and has acquired all that could be possibly sought after, as well as being saved from all that is dreadful and frightening.&#8221;2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>KNOWLEDGE AND HUMILITY</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam adh-Dhahabee (d.748H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whosoever seeks knowledge for actions, then his knowledge makes him humble and fearful, and causes him to weep at (the deficiencies in) himself. But whosoever seeks knowledge for the sake of merely teaching, giving verdicts, in order to brag, or to show-off; becomes foolish, arrogant and looks down in contempt at the people, and is destroyed by pride, and the people hate him. <b>&#8220;Truly he succeeds who purifies his soul, and he fails who corrupts it.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ash-Shams 99:4-5]. Meaning that it is corrupted with sin and disobedience.&#8221;3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>REMEMBERING THE GUIDANCE</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Qaadee &#8216;Iyaadh (d.591H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; relates: &#8220;Mu&#8217;sab ibn &#8216;Abdullaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Imaam Maalik (d.179H) would mention the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, his colour would change and he would have to lean down, and those in his gathering would feel disturbed. So one day, on being asked about this, he said: If you had seen what I have seen, you would not have rejected what you had seen. I have seen Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir (d.130H) &#8211; and he was the leader of the Reciters &#8211; that he would never be asked about a <i>hadeeth</i> (Prophetic narration), except that he would weep, until we had mercy upon him. And I have seen Ja&#8217;far ibn Muhammad (d.148H) who used to smile alot. Yet whenever the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was mentioned to him, he would turn pale. I have never seen him narrating the <i>hadeeth</i> of the Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, except in a state of purification. And when times deteriorated, I never saw him except in one of three conditions: Either Praying, observing silence, or reciting the Qur&#8217;aan. He never uttered a word having no significance, and he was one of the Scholars and worshippers who had great fear of Allaah. Whenever &#8216;Abdur-Rahmaan ibn al-Qaasim (d.126H) mentioned the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, he turned pale, as if the blood had been drained from his face, and his tongue dried-up due to reverence for Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. I went to &#8216;Aamir ibn &#8216;Abdullaah ibn az-Zubayr (d.123H), and whenever the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was mentioned to him, he would weep so much, until he was unable to weep any longer. I saw az-Zuhree (d.124H) &#8211; and he was from the kindest of people, and closest to them &#8211; that when the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was mentioned to him, he would not be able to recognise you, nor would you be able to recognise him. I came to Safwaan ibn Sulaym (d.132H) &#8211; and he was one of the <i>mujtahid</i> Scholars and worshippers &#8211; that whenever he mentioned the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> he would weep, and he would not stop weeping, to the extent that the people would have to get up and leave him.&#8221;4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is from the likes of such weeping souls that we have inherited the knowledge of our Religion!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Saalih al-Uthaymeen<br />
Source: Al-Istiqaamah Magazine , Issue No.5 &#8211; Ramadân 1417H / January 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed all praise is for Allaah. We praise Him, we seek His help and we seek forgiveness from Him. And we seek refuge in Allaah from the evils within our own souls and our evil actions. Whomsoever Allaah guide, then none can misguide him; and whomsoever Allaah leaves to stray, then none can guide him aright. Indeed it is Allaah who sent His Messenger Muhammad <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> with the Guidance and the Religion of Truth, and he conveyed this Message, fulfilled his trust, fought <i>Jihaad</i> as it should be fought, and he did not die except that he left his Ummah (nation) upon a clear path, its night is like its day, and no one deviates from it except that he is destroyed. And may Allaah extol and send blessings of peace upon His Messenger Muhammad, and upon his Family, his Companions, and those who follow them in goodness. Then to proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So on this night, Sunday the 27th of Rabee&#8217;ul-Awwal 1417H &#8211; which corresponds to the 10th of August 1996CE &#8211; I am pleased to have this opportunity to say a few words to you. I hope that Allaah would bless them and that He would also bless our brothers in England; who have traveled from various places in order to here these few words on the telephone, for which they will receive &#8211; with the help of Allaah &#8211; that promise which has been mentioned by the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> when he said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever treads a path to seek knowledge, then Allaah would make easy for him a path to Paradise.&#8221;</i>1 So I ask from my brothers to accept these <i>wasaayah</i> (legacies and sincere advices) which I hope would be of benefit to them:-</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>THE FIRST LEGACY</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I advise you to have the <i>taqwaa</i> of Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; both in private and public. And <i>taqwaa</i> means that a person should stand firm upon the obedience of Allaah, doing what Allaah ordered him to do, and abandoning what He prohibited him from, starting with establishing the <i>Salaah</i> (Prayer) in their fixed and stated times, and in congregation, for those who are obliged to do so. Along with the five daily Prayers, you should also pray the <i>rawaatib</i> (stressed and recommended Prayers) which are connected to the five daily Prayers &#8211; and they are four <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> before the <i>Dhuhr</i> Prayer and two after it. Two <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> after the <i>Maghrib</i> Prayer. Two <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> after the <i>&#8216;Ishaa</i> Prayer. And two <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> before the <i>Fajr</i> Prayer. The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;There is no Muslim who Prays twelve optional rak&#8217;ahs from the non-obligatory Prayer every day, except that Allaah will build for him a house in Paradise.&#8221;</i>2 Likewise, you should pay the Zakaah; which is an obligatory amount taken from your wealth and given to the poor and the needy. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said to his Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Take charity from their wealth in order to purify them and to sanctify them by it.&#8221;</b> [Soorah a-Tawbah 9:103].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said to Mu&#8217;aadh ibn Jabal, when he was sending him to Yemen: <i>&#8220;And inform them that Allaah has obligated upon them to give charity from their wealth, to be taken from the rich and given to the poor.&#8221;</i>3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, one should fast in the month of Ramadaan, because Allaah has prescribed it for this Ummah, and one should make the <i>Hajj</i> (Pilgramage) and the <i>&#8216;Umrah</i> (Lesser Pilgramage) for whosoever has the ability to do so. These are the pillars of Islaam, after the first pillar which is the <i>Shahaadatain</i> (the two testimonies); to testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and to testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>THE SECOND LEGACY</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I advise my brothers that they should unify their ranks, and that they should be like a single body seeking to establish the Religion of Allaah, as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allaah has prescribed for you the same Religion which He prescribed to Noah, and that which We revealed to the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, and that which We prescribed to Ibraaheem, Moses and Jesus <i>&#8216;alayhimus-salaam</i>, saying: That you should establish the Religion by doing that which you were commanded with, and that you should not make any divisions in it.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ash-Shooraa 42:13].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus it becomes very clear that what is required from us &#8211; as it was required from the Prophets who were foremost in resolve &#8211; is to establish the Religion and not to make any divisions therein. So our Lord &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; ordered us to establish the Religion and not to make any divisions in it. O my brothers! Unite your ranks, and do not differ, since Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And do not dispute with each other, unless you loose courage and your power departs, but be patient. For indeed Allaah is with those who are patient.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Anfaal 8:46].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not label each other as being deviant, nor label each other as being sinners. If you see in any of your brothers that which is objectionable, then go to them and debate with them about this, until your word is unified, and thus cause the Ummah to remain united. None of you should try to slander his brother, since this will cause a great deal of enmity and hatred. Likewise, none of you should declare his Muslim brother to be a disbeliever, innovator or a sinner &#8211; since this is not from the nature of a Muslim.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>THE THIRD LEGACY</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also advise you &#8211; O brothers &#8211; to do those actions which will be the cause of love and affection to develop between you. Many people do not truly understand the Religion of Islaam. Indeed many people think that the Religion of Islaam includes certain bad traits &#8211; even though Islaam in reality objects to them &#8211; because some Muslims portray a false image of Islaam. Rather, the Religion of Islaam is a Religion of truthfulness, righteousness and justice. It is a Religion which calls for reconciling people. It is also a Religion which wages war against all bad actions and characteristics; such as lying, cheating, deception and transgressing upon others. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed Allaah enjoins upon you justice, kindness and the giving of good to relatives and near ones, and He prohibits you from all shameful and evil deeds, oppression and transgression. He admonishes you, in order that you may take heed and be reminded. And fulfil the Covenant of Allaah when you have made it, and do not break your oaths after you have confirmed them, and indeed you have appointed Allaah as your Guarantor. Indeed Allaah knows all what you do.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nahl 16:90-91].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O my brothers, <i>da&#8217;wah</i> (calling to Islaam) is to be done by your actions, as you are commanded to do it with your speech However, <i>da&#8217;wah</i> through actions will be more effective than <i>da&#8217;wah</i> which is merely done with speech. So I say again, that those who practice Islaam in a wrong manner, they will create a false understanding of Islaam in people&#8217;s view. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; has said about those who invite to what is correct, but do not practice themselves:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;O you who believe! Why do you say that which you do not do. It is most hateful to Allaah that you say that which you do not do.&#8221;</b> [Soorah as-Saff 61:2-3].</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>THE FOURTH LEGACY</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I advise you all to safeguard your time and to occupy yourselves in that which is beneficial. You should know that time is more precious than wealth, as Allaah &#8211; the Most Blessed, the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Until when death comes to him, he says: O my Lord! Give me respite so that I may then do righteous actions.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:333].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Time is such that when it departs it does not return, whereas wealth, when it departs, then it is possible to replace it. So time is of the utmost importance. This is why I advise you to safeguard your time, and to occupy yourselves in that which benefits. Keep away from <i>qeela wa qaal</i> (gossiping) &#8211; that so and so said such and such about this and that person &#8211; because the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said in an authentic narration: <i>&#8220;Indeed Allaah hates qeela wa qaal (gossip mongering), asking too many questions, and wasting one&#8217;s wealth.&#8221;</i>4 Unfortunately, many of the youths &#8211; after returning to the correct path, and uniting their hearts and unifying their word &#8211; have become disunited and fragmented into many factions, and this is due to the whisperings of Shaytaan amongst them and the disuniting of their word. So I advise the brothers to utilise your time in beneficial matters, and to keep away from <i>qeela wa qaal</i>. Indeed, time is like a sword; either you strike it, or it will strike you!</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>THE FIFTH LEGACY</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Call to Allaah with mildness, forebearance, and intending to rectify matters &#8211; not with harshness, nor intending to cause divisions. This is because Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said to His Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Call mankind to the way prescribed by your Lord, with wisdom, and admonish them with the examples and warnings that Allaah has provided in His Book, and argue with them in a way that is better.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nahl 16:125].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;By the mercy of Allaah you behaved with gentleness towards them. Had you been severe or harsh-hearted they would have left you and departed. So pass over their faults, and ask Allaah to forgive them, and consult them in the affairs.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aali-&#8216;Imraan 3:159].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, it is obligatory for the Believer to follow the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> in this, and to be mild and forebearing in calling to Allaah &#8211; the Most Blessed, the Most High &#8211; since it is authentically established from the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa aalihi wa sallam</i> that he said: <i>&#8220;Indeed Allaah is gentle and loves gentleness, and He gives due to gentleness that which He does not give due to harshness.&#8221;</i>5</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>THE SIXTH LEGACY</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Striving hard in acquiring knowledge, since that is the reason why you have left your cities and homes, and have left your family and friends. So it is upon you all to strive hard in gaining knowledge, and to study deeply &#8211; not merely to take an exam, rather it is for the knowledge itself. So strive hard in seeking knowledge. Finally, I ask Allaah that He enables us to utilise our time in a beneficial way, according to what Allaah &#8211; the Most Blessed, the Most High &#8211; has made us responsible for.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحَْٰمنِ الرَّحِيمِ<br />
الحمد لله والصلاة والسلام على رسول الله وعلى آله وصحبه ومن ولاه، وبعد،</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Beneficial points conveyed by brother Nabil Chogle [student of knowledge – recommended by Shaykh al-‘Anjaree (hafidhahullah)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the Kuwaiti Mashaykh the brother , Nabil Chogle, studied under are Shaykh al-‘Anjaree, Shaykh Tariq as-Suba’ee and Shaykh Ahmad as-Suba’ee (hafidhahumullah). Both Shaykh ‘Anjaree and Shaykh Ahmad as-Suba’ee have a recommendation from Shaykh Rabe’e and Shaykh ‘Ubayd al-Jabiree (hafidhahumullah). Shaykh ‘Anjaree (hafidhahullah) said Shaykh Rabe’e (hafidhahullah) praised Shaykh Taariq as-Suba’ee (hafidhahullah) saying he is “Hakeem Hakeem” (Wise Wise – Twice) i.e. he is really good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Below are some of the brief points that the brother had conveyed</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Shaykh al-‘Anjaree (hafidhahullah) constantly advised to be on the Furqaan (That which distinguishes truth from falsehood).</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The Shaykh also warned about the dangers of falling into Bid&#8217;ah (Innovation in the religion).</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. While teaching one of the books, Shaykh Ahmad as-Suba’ee (hafidhahullah) said that the correct explanation of the statement of prophet Muhammad (sallallahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) about Khutbat al-Haaja (The Sermon for Necessities) [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">مِنْ شُرُورِ أمنْفُسِنما مومِنْ م سيِّئماتِ أمعْ م مالِنما<br />
<strong>Min Shuroori an-Fusina wa-Min Sayeaati A’amaalinaa</strong><br />
[&#8220;We seek refuge in Allah] from the evils of ourselves and from the evils of our actions&#8221; ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">is that we don’t just seek refuge from the evils which our hands have brought forth rather we also seek refuge for the sins into which we fell and which were then followed by others. In Islaam you are rewarded for the good deeds you do and also for those people who follow you in good. Similarly you are punished for the sins that you do and for the misguidance of others who follow you in such sins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The evils of some innovations can be seen hundreds of years later. One of them is the counting of the beads which was not legislated during the time of the Prophet (sallallahu ‘alayhi wasalam). Another example is the seeking of refuge in Allah while yawning (Uttering “aa’odhu billahi min ash-shaytaanir-rajeem” while yawning). One more such innovation is the mentioning of “sadaqallahul adheem” after reciting the Quraan. All these are innovated affairs. The people who initiated these acts would have never thought how widespread these could get.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Based on the above it’s extremely important to know if a particular thing that you do is from Sunnah or not. You don’t know who is following you!</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. One should constantly sit with ‘Ulemaa (scholars) and be in touch with them. Shaykh Taariq (hafidhahullah) said he finished Buloogh al-Maraam three times from cover to cover with Shaykh ‘Abdul ‘Azeez ibn Baaz (rahimahullah). Shaykh Tariq (hafidhahullah) also said that in one single sitting with Shaykh ‘Abdul ‘Azeez ibn Baaz (rahimahullah) they used to study five different books.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. Shaykh Rabe’e advised to submit to the text (Quraan and the Sunnah). First of the ones to make Qiyaas (applying one’s own intelligence) was Iblees. His argument of him being made by fire made him think he was superior. This is one of the reasons of going astray.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. Warning of staying away from affairs of fighting and spilling blood. The rebels say loosing 20,000 lives or so is a small price for the oppression suffered. Verily for a Salafi every life is expensive. The whole affair of making Khurooj is not meant for the general public.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. Make a lot of supplications. Verily one of the reasons of winning the war in Jihad is the supplication of those who didn’t join.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. When Salman al-‘Awdah planned a visit to Kuwait, Shaykh al-‘Anjaree wrote a front page article in the newspaper clearing the affairs of Salman al-‘Awdah. The Kuwaiti government al-Hamdullilah went ahead and cancelled his visit. Some 50 odd scholars then thanked the government for its intervention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. The Shaykh also paid for a half page advert in one of the leading daily newspaper writing about “Guidance to Muslims upon Walee al-Amr”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. It is from Salafiyah to be from those who do charity discreetly. Also it’s better to go and help out the needy directly than to buy charity coupons. One should feel the charity. Seeing first hand the sufferings of the people increases one in Eemaan. He also mentioned names of Mashaykh from Kuwait regularly visiting refugee camps in Syria and Turkey to help our brothers who are being tested by Allah. May Allah ease their affairs. Verily He has power over all things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. Also he mentioned a Hadeeth about charity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Hurayrah (radhiallahu ‘anhu): The Prophet (sallallahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) commanded to give Sadaqah (charity). A man said, “Apostle of Allah, I have a Dinaar (currency of gold)”. He (sallallahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said, “Spend it on yourself”. He (the man) again said, “I have another”. He (sallallahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said, “Spend it on your children”. He (the man) again said, “I have another”. He (sallallahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said, “Spend it on your wife”. He (the man) again said, “I have another”. He (sallallahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said, “Spend it on your servant”. He (the man) finally said, “I have another”. He (sallallahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) replied, “You know best (what to do with it)”. [Sunan Abee Dawud, Book of Charity] [2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. One valuable advice which he mentioned from Shaykh al-’Anjaree (hafidhahullah) was the only way to succeed is to be a hard worker. Just because you are smart does not mean that you will succeed. Indeed success is from Allah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15. Manage time efficiently. If a task can be completed in 4 hours do not spend 13 days on it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16. Verily there is Barakah (blessing) in the mornings so do not spend it sleeping at home. (referring to the time post Salaat al-Fajr).</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">17. Keep a balance between Deen (religion) and Dunyah (worldly life) and let one of them strengthen the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">18. It’s not from the Salaf to just work 8 hours a day or 6 days a week. In fact they used to work all week around. The evidence is that the Khutbat al-Jumu&#8217;ah (Friday sermon) used to be short so that people could get back to their affairs at the earliest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19. Strive as much as you can. Do not wait. Aid the Dawah as much as you can and in any manner. Those capable of financial aid should help with money, those capable of printing flyers should do so, and those who can translate should do so.<br />
20. Be in constant touch of the Mashaykh and those whom they refer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وصلى الله على نبينا محمد وعلى آله وصحبه وسلم</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the name of Allāh, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.</p>
<p>As-salāmu &#8216;alaikum wa rahmatullāhi wa barakātuh.</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<div>Student <strong>Abu Remlah Adam Amreeki</strong> (hafidhahullaah) relayed the following scholarly advices:</div>
<div></div>
<div>Shaikh Abu Muhammad Ahmad As-Subay&#8217;ee (hafidhahullaah) said:</div>
<div>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Only strive in clinging to the Sunnah; even if all of mankind praised you, it would not increase you in anything with Allaah&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;There is nothing equivalent to being guided to the Sunnah; it is the most tremendous blessing after Tawheed.&#8221;</strong></span></p></blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Only strive in clinging to the Sunnah; even if all of mankind praised you, it would not increase you in anything with Allaah.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;From the evil effects of sins is that they weaken one&#8217;s ability to distinguish Truth from falsehood.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;If someone only speaks against those people whom have spoken against him first, then he&#8217;s not a sincere advisor.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;There&#8217;s NEVER been a single day that Jameeah IhyaaTuraath had ever been upon the Sunnah; it was founded upon other than Sunnah.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Search for the Truth (الحق), like the searching of a frantic mother who lost her child (as Allaah said what means:) and those who strive for Our sake, we will surely guide them to Our paths. (Al-Ankabut, ayah 69)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;The most tremendous way to purify the hearts: Cling to the Sunnah TRUTHFULLY, and recite the Qur`an with contemplation.&#8221;</span></strong></p></blockquote>
<div>Shaikh Rabee&#8217; Bin Haadee al-Madkhalee (hafidhahullaah) said:</div>
<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;That some of Ahl-Sunnah go easy on those who fall into tribulations (فتن) and falsehood in the name of &#8220;keeping them close,&#8221; or because they are considered to be &#8220;from Ahl-Sunnah,&#8221; then this does NOT benefit Islaam in anything.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;The most dangerous of the arrows and spears are the arrows of the Hadaadees; they and the enemies of Islaam are together in the same trench.&#8221;</strong></p></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>From the great wisdom in Shaikh Rabee&#8217;s advice about Al-Hajoori:</div>
<div>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Take MANLY stances with him.&#8221; </strong></span>[Don&#8217;t fear standing up to who opposes the Sunnah!]</p></blockquote>
</div>
<div>Shaikh Abu &#8216;Uthmaan Muhammad Al-Anjaaree (hafidhahullaah) said:</div>
<blockquote>
<div><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> &#8220;Having knowledge of the Correct Path and how to succeed in this life &amp; hereafter isn&#8217;t enough; a Sunni must have DETERMINATION (عزيمة)!&#8221;       </span></strong></div>
</blockquote>
<div>
<p>Shaikh Muhammad Ibn Salih al-&#8216;Uthaymeen (rahimahullaah):</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;There&#8217;s NOTHING in the Book nor Sunnah which allows the innovated Islamic political groups &amp; parties.&#8221; (جماعات و أحزاب)</strong></span></p></blockquote>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Shaikh &#8216;Ubaid ibn &#8216;Abdullaah al-Jaabiree (hafidhahullaah) said:</div>
<blockquote><p><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> &#8220;The khawaarij are dogs of the hellfire&#8230;they lie against Allaah, His Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), and His Religion; they are (those) who spoil the image of Islaam!&#8221;</span></strong></p></blockquote>

</em>Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari mentions in his ‘Saheeh’ from Wahab bin Munnabih that it was said to him: ‘Is not <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> the key to Paradise?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘Of course, however there is no key except that it has teeth, so if a key is brought which has teeth then it will be opened, otherwise it will not open.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qayyim continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">‘<strong>Allaah Subhanahu has placed keys for everything that is necessary</strong></span>, and they open the way, so Allaah made purification the key for prayer, as the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">‘The key to prayer is purification.’ [Saheeh al-Jamia as-Sagheer No.5885] .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">Like wise</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ihram is the key to Hajj,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Truthfulness is the key to righteousness,</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Taqwa (piety) is the key to success,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fervent desire and dread of Allaah is the key to being successful,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dua’ (Supplicating) is the key to being responded to,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zuhd (Abstaining from the luxuries of the world) is the key to desiring the Hereafter,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reflecting about that which Allaah calls His slaves to is the key to Eemaan (having faith),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Making the heart accept Islaam and making it secure for Allaah and having sincerity for Him by having love and hate and fulfilling His commands and leaving the prohibitions is the key to going in front of Allaah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Pondering upon the Qur’aan, and imploring Allaah before dawn and not sinning is the key to giving the heart life,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Being kind to the worshippers of the Creator and striving to benefit His worshippers is the key to obtaining mercy,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Striving to seek forgiveness from Allaah and Taqwa (piety) is the key to Rizq (provisions),</p>

</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a great matter from the most beneficial chapters of knowledge, namely knowing the keys to goodness and evil.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Haadi al-Arwaaha ila Bilaad al-Afraaha’ by Ibn Qayyim vol 1 p.139]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Source</strong>: Al-Fawaaid – A COLLECTION OF WISE SAYINGS – Imam Ibn AI-Qayyim,</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"> Rendered into English by: Bayan Translation Services</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In order for a place to contain something, it must be free from whatever contradicts it. This principle appljes to mankind and all creation as well as to belief and desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if the heart is obsessed by belief in falsehood, there will be no place for truth. Accordingly, if the tongue is involved in trivial discourse, one shall be incapable of useful speech, unless falsehood is abandoned.Hence, if the body is busy doing wrong actions, then acts of worship will be inapplicable unless these contradictory actions are abandoned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is how this principle is applied to concrete objects, and it is also applied to belief and religion. If the heart deviates from loving Allah, lacks yearning for Him and longing for His closeness, then the removal of contradictory feelings, like being related to other than Allah, is the only way for this heart to be overwhelmed by love for Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For the tongue to remember Allah, and the body to serve Him, one should be free of the impact of others like being busy remembering and serving them. Thus, if the heart is overwhelmed by the servants rather than the master, and is preoccupied with futile knowledge, surely there will be no place for being closer to Allah, or being acquainted with His Names, Attributes and judgments.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the heart listens to trivial discourse, there will be no place for listening or understanding the words of Allah. Besides, if the heart is inclined to love others, there will be no room to love Allah, and if the heart remembers others rather than Allah, no place will be found to remember Him, and the same applies to the tongue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhary recorded that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, <strong>&#8220;It is better for any of you that the inside of his body be filled with pus which may consume his body, than it be filled with poetry&#8221;</strong>&#8216; [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Prophetic tradition explained that it is possible that the inside of one&#8217;s body may be filled with poetry, which means that it might be exposed to suspicion, doubts, illusions, uncertainties, futile knowledge, and trivial discourse. So, if the heart is filled with such things, the facts of the Quran and precious knowledge, which cause happiness and perfection in mankind, will find no room in that heart.If a heart receives advice but it is filled with what contradicts it, there will be no place in that heart to accept this advice. The advice will simply pass over this heart and not be able to settle in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] Recorded by AI-Bukhary, in His Sahib, Book of AI-Adab (Good Manners and Form), Chapter on not recommending poetry, no. (6154), and recorded by Muslim in His Sahib no. (2258)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Source</strong> : Al-Fawa&#8217;id A Collection Of Wise Sayings Imam Ibn Al-Qayyim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are two kinds of meeting between friends:<br />
The first is a meeting based on sociability and spending time, in which are more disadvantages than advantage, the least of which is corruption of the heart, and wasting time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Second kind is a meeting for the sake of supporting one another, and recommending one another to the truth and to patience. This is the best kind, yet there are still three disadvantages therein,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Flattering each other.<br />
2. Being excessively talkative.<br />
3. That such meetings become a habit or routine and they fail to achieve their aims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Enjoying health, this worldly life, status, a wife or children, then surely those feelings are temporary and will eventually dissipate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are three kinds of passive feelings, which affect the heart and they are either related to the past, which causes sorrow, or related to the future so as to cause grief, of finally related to the present so as to cause distress.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the heart is not pure or honourable enough, and distance from every evil and malice, then it is unworthy to love, know and aspire to Allah. On the contrary, the lowest description of man&#8217;s heart is that he loves and aspires to this worldly life instead to Allah, the Almighty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When man&#8217;s love, knowledge and aspiration is directed in this worldly way, the heart becomes narrow and gloomy as it is distant from the source of its revival and life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Subsequently, the hearts of man can be divided into two kinds, the first of which is the heart of those, who incline to the Beneficent, which is the source of brightness, life, happiness, pleasure, delight and blessings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second one is the throne of the devil where narrowness, darkness, death, sorrow, distress and grief are settled therein. This heart is obsessed by sorrow for the past, and grief and distress for the present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In order for a place to contain something, it must be free from whatever contradicts it. This principle applies to mankind and all creation as well as to belief and desires.So, if the hearts is obsessed by belief in falsehood, there will be no place for truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, if the tongue is involved in trivial discourse, one shall be incapable of useful speech, unless falsehood is abandoned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, if the body is busy doing wrong actions, then acts of worship will be inapplicable unless these contradictory actions are abandoned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Stand firm against evil thoughts, for if you fail to do so, they will become ideas, if you do not, they will become desires, so fight against them. If you do not, they will become a form of determination and intention, if you do not resist, they will become actions, and if you do not follow them up with their opposite, they will become habits that will be hard to quit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, who did not make use of his eye, did not make use of his ear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The servant has a veil between him and Allah and another one between him and people. Whoever tore this veil between him and Allah, Allah will tear the veil between him and people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The servant has a Lord that he will stand in front of and a house that he will live in, so he must seek the pleasure of Allah before meeting Him and he should furnish his house before moving into it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Loosing time is harder than death, as loosing time keeps you away from Allah and the Hereafter, while death keeps you away from worldly life and people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The whole world from its beginning until its end is not worth an hour of sadness, so what about the sadness of whole life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What we love today will catch up with what we hate tomorrow, and what we hate today will catch up with what we love tomorrow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most precious reward during life is to busy yourself with most suitable and useful matters in their exact and suitable time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can he be rational who sells Paradise and what is in it, for one hour of passing pleasure?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The pious man will leave this worldly life while he did not obtain satisfaction in two matters: crying for himself and praising Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you are afraid of any creature, you will run away from it. When you are afraid of Allah, you will love Him and seek to be close to Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If knowledge is useful without actions, Allah, the Exalted would never have dispraised the people of the book, and if actions were useful without devotions, He would never have have dispraised the hypocrite.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Piety has Three Levels</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Protecting the heart and limbs against sin and forbidden actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Protecting them against undesirable matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Protecting against curiosity and whatever is not of one&#8217;s concern.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first will grant life to the servant, the second will grant his health and power, and the third will grant him happiness and joy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sea of pleasures may drown its owner and the swimmer fears to open his eyes under water.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Passing days are like dreams, the coming ones are wishes, and the time separating them is wasted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Buy for yourself (through doing good deeds) while there is still a market and you have the ability to buy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you do not work hard and face difficulties along your way in seeking glory, you will never taste honor and relief when you attain victory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was said to one of the worshippers: You are tiring yourself so much! He said: I want to achieve comfort from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The human being was honoured with blessings of faith and good health, but he misused them, so they were justly taken away from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The truth will only be shown to perceptive people who will use the light of their minds to see the consequences of the matters they face.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The pleasures of life are similar to brides who are dressing for those who will prefer and choose; them or the brides (rewards) of the Hereafter, and whoever knows the significant difference between the two, will choose the best (the Hereafter).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Affliction are but trials by which the faithful are distinguished from the unfaithful, and if you were to succeed therein, they would be turned to supporters by which you could attain your objective.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No one can indulge in unlawfulness except for two reasons, the first of which is failing to trust in Allah, despite the fact that if one obeys Him, he will surely be granted the best of lawful gains.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second reason is knowing that whoever abandons anything for the sake of Allah, surely He will grant him something better than what he has abandon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unfortunately, his vain desires surpass his patience and his inclination overpowers his mind, The first one has poor knowledge, and the second one has poor insight.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can one feel secure, who has an unmerciful wife, an unforgiving son, a distrusting neighbour, a friend who gives no advice, a partner who misjudges him, an enemy whose hostility never ceases, a soul that is inclined to evil, an adorned world, vain desires, influential lusts, furious anger, the deception of Satan, and controlling weakness? If Allah rescued and guided him, all those problems would be under control, and if Allah deserted and abandoned him, leaving him on his own, all these distresses would cause his destruction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He who tastes the pleasure of good health, surely the bitterness of patience will become easy for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The aim has priority in estimation, it is the last in existence, it is the principle according to the mind, and it is the end of the journey.</p>

<div>Your life in the present moment is in between the past and the future.</div>
<div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what has preceded can be rectified by tawbah (repentance), nadam (regret) and istighfar (seeking Allaah’s forgiveness). And this is something that will neither tire you, nor cause you to toil as you would with strenuous labour. Rather it is an action of the heart.Then as regards the future (then it can be corrected) by withholding yourself from sins. And this abandonment is merely the leaving of something and to be at ease from it. This also is not action of the limbs, which requires you to strive and toil. Rather this is a firm resolve and intention of the heart – which will give rest to your body, heart and thoughts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So as for what has preceded, then you rectify it with repentance. And as for the future – then you rectify it with firm resolve and intention. Neither of these involves any hardship or exertion of the limbs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But then your attention must be directed to your life in the present &#8211; the time between two times. If you waste it, then you have wasted the opportunity to be of the fortunate and saved ones. If you look after it, having rectified the two times – what is before and after it, as we have said – then you will be successful and achieve rest, delight and ever-lasting bliss. However, looking after it is harder than that which comes before and after it, since guarding it involves keeping to that which is most befitting and beneficial for your soul, and that which will bring it success and well-being.</p>
