<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;"><em>Ibn Rajab al-Ḥanbalī’s book, “Jāmi’ al-‘Ulūm wal-Ḥikam,” is an explanation of the forty-two famous ḥadīth collected by Imām an-Nawawī.  In this article, last part of the  twenty-fourth ḥadīth of that book explained.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The Explanation of:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">فَمَنْ وَجَدَ خَيْرًا فَلْيَحْمَدِ اللهَ، وَمَنْ وَجَدَ غَيْرَ ذَلِكَ فَلا يَلُوْمَنَّ إِلاّ نَفْسَهُ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“&#8230; So whoever finds good, let him thank Allah, and whoever finds other than that, let him blame only himself.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates that anything good is from Allah as a favor from himself to his worshipper even though the latter may not actually deserve it. And anything evil is from the children of Adam, from following their inclinations and desires as Allah ( عَزَّ وَجَلَّ ) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَّا أَصَابَكَ مِنْ حَسَنَةٍ فَمِنَ اللَّهِ وَمَا أَصَابَكَ مِن سَيِّئَةٍ فَمِن نَّفْسِكَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">What comes to you of good is from Allah, but what comes to you of evil is from yourself.</span> [Sūrah al-Nisā, 4:79]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Alī ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ) once said, “<strong>A worshipper should hope from none but Allah and should fear nothing but his own sins</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah wants prosperity and guidance for someone, he facilitates a way for the individual to obey him, and this is a favor from Allah. But when Allah abandons someone, he entrusts all affairs of the person to the individual himself; Allah renounces the person by removing all connections between himself and the individual. So Satan is then able to deceive such a person so that he becomes negligent of remembering Allah. He follows his own inclinations and desires and consequently his affairs are lost and forsaken. All the while, this is still fair and just from Allah because the evidence has already been established upon the individual by the revelation of the Qur&#8217;aan and the sending of the messenger. So there is no excuse before Allah for any of mankind after the sending of the messengers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If what is meant by “<strong>So whoever finds good</strong>” is whoever finds good in this life, then such a person is obliged to thank Allah, especially for the good reward of one’s good deeds that may be hastened in this life as Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَنْ عَمِلَ صَالِحًا مِّن ذَكَرٍ أَوْ أُنثَى وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَلَنُحْيِيَنَّهُ حَيَاةً طَيِّبَةً وَلَنَجْزِيَنَّهُمْ أَجْرَهُم بِأَحْسَنِ مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Whoever does righteousness, whether male or female, while he is a believer, we will surely cause him to live a good life. And we will surely give such individuals their reward according to the best of what they used to do.</span> [Sūrah al-Naḥl, 16:97]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And (upon the understanding above) such a person would be obliged to blame himself for the negative consequences he may experience in the worldly life for the bad deeds he committed as Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَنُذِيقَنَّهُم مِّنَ الْعَذَابِ الأَدْنَى دُونَ الْعَذَابِ الأَكْبَرِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And we will surely let them taste the nearer punishment short of the greater punishment that perhaps they will repent.</span> [Sūrah al-Sajdah, 32:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So for a true believer, when he is afflicted with any hardship in life, he looks inward, holding himself responsible. This in turn encourages him to return back to Allah with repentance and asking for forgiveness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, if what is meant by “So whoever finds good…whoever finds other than that” is in the hereafter, then this may be a way of Allah informing that those who find good in the hereafter will thank and praise Allah for that, and those who find otherwise should blame only themselves although at such a time blaming will be of no use. And this is an Arabic linguistic form in which the text is that of a command yet the meaning is actually to inform of a future event just as is the case with the ḥadīth in which the prophet ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَنْ كَذَبَ عَلَيَّ مُتَعَمِّدًا فَلْيَتَبَوَّأْ مَقْعَدَهُ مِنْ النَّارِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>Whoever intentionally lies against me, let him occupy his seat in the fire.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[This ḥadīth is mutawātir, meaning that it has been narrated by so many different chains of narrators that it is considered authentic. See for example ḥadīth no.1841 of “Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan al-Tirmidhī” by al-Albānī</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Whoever lies against me will indeed occupy his seat in the Hellfire. [The text is in the form of a command but is a way of informing of a future occurrence.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah has also informed us that the people of Paradise will thank Allah for that which he provides them of his bounty; he says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَنَزَعْنَا مَا فِي صُدُورِهِم مِّنْ غِلٍّ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهِمُ الأَنْهَارُ وَقَالُوا الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِي هَدَانَا لِهَذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لِنَهْتَدِيَ لَوْلا أَنْ هَدَانَا اللَّهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And we will have removed whatever is within their breasts of resentment, (while) flowing beneath them are rivers. And they will say, “Praise to Allah who has guided us to this, and we would never have been guided if Allah had not guided us.”</span> [Sūrah al-‘Arāf, 7:43]</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَالُوا الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِي صَدَقَنَا وَعْدَهُ وَأَوْرَثَنَا الْأَرْضَ نَتَبَوَّأُ مِنَ الْجَنَّةِ حَيْثُ نَشَاءُ.</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And they will say, “Praise to Allah who has fulfilled his promise to us and has made us inherit the earth (so) we may settle in Paradise wherever we will.”</span> [Sūrah al-Zumar, 39:74]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he ( تَعَالَى ) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَالُوا الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِي أَذْهَبَ عَنَّا الْحَزَنَ إِنَّ رَبَّنَا لَغَفُورٌ شَكُورٌ  الَّذِي أَحَلَّنَا دَارَ الْمُقَامَةِ مِن فَضْلِهِ لا يَمَسُّنَا فِيهَا نَصَبٌ وَلا يَمَسُّنَا فِيهَا لُغُوبٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And they will say, “Praise to Allah who has removed from us sorrow. Indeed, our lord is forgiving and appreciative – he who has settled us in the home of duration out of his bounty. There touches us therein no fatigue, and there touches us therein no weariness (of mind).”</span> [Sūrah al-Fāṭir, 35:34-35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the people of the fire, Allah informs us they will be blaming themselves, disgusted with and hating of their own souls. Allah ( تَعَالَى ) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَالَ الشَّيْطَانُ لَمَّا قُضِيَ الأَمْرُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ وَعَدَكُمْ وَعْدَ الْحَقِّ وَوَعَدتُّكُمْ فَأَخْلَفْتُكُمْ وَمَا كَانَ لِيَ عَلَيْكُم مِّن سُلْطَانٍ إِلاَّ أَن دَعَوْتُكُمْ فَاسْتَجَبْتُمْ لِي فَلا تَلُومُونِي وَلُومُوا أَنفُسَكُم</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And Satan will say when the matter has been concluded, “Indeed, Allah had promised you the promise of truth. And I promised you, but I betrayed you. But I had no authority over you except that I invited you and you responded to me. So do not blame me, but blame yourselves.”</span> [Sūrah Ibrāhīm, 14:22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا يُنَادَوْنَ لَمَقْتُ اللَّهِ أَكْبَرُ مِن مَّقْتِكُمْ أَنفُسَكُمْ إِذْ تُدْعَوْنَ إِلَى الإِيمَاَانِ فَتَكْفُرُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed, those who disbelieve will be addressed (in Hell), “The hatred of Allah was (even) greater than your hatred of yourselves when you were invited to faith, but you refused.”</span> [Sūrah Ghāfir, 40:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The righteous predecessors used to strive in doing good deeds, fearing the time when deeds will come to an end and they may then blame themselves for their shortcomings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was once said to Masrūq, “If only you would ease up with some of your worship in which you exert yourself.” He replied, “By Allah, even if he came to me and told me he would not punish me, I would exert myself in worship (of him).” He was asked, “Why is that?” to which he said: So that my own soul would pardon me if it entered the fire and so I would not have to blame it. Has there not come to you the statement of Allah:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلا أُقْسِمُ بِالنَّفْسِ اللَّوَّامَةِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And I swear by the self-reproaching soul</span>.[Sūrah al-Qiyāmah, 75:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They will blame and reproach themselves when they reach Hell. When the angels of punishment embrace them and stand between them and what they desire, when their hopes are cut off, and when mercy is withheld from them, every one of them will begin blaming and reproaching his own soul.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muṭraf Ibn ‘Abdullah used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Exert yourself in doing good deeds. If the decision is as we hope for—the mercy of Allah and his forgiveness—then for us will be levels (in Paradise). And if the decision is severe as we fear and of which we are cautious, let us not then say:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">رَبَّنَا أَخْرِجْنَا نَعْمَلْ صَالِحًا غَيْرَ الَّذِي كُنَّا نَعْمَلُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Our Lord, remove us; we will do righteousness other than what we used to do.”</span> [Sūrah Fāṭir, 35:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We will then say, “We did deeds but they did not benefit us.”</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 73 : Point 122</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Know, May Allah have mercy upon you! that the wealth of a Muslim is not permissible to take except for that which he gives willingly </strong>[1]<strong>. If a man has some wealth that was illegally acquired, then he is responsible for it. It is not permissible for anyone to take any thing from him, except with his permission. So perhaps he will repent and wish to restore it to its rightful owner, and you will have taken something unlawful.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] The Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The wealth of a Muslim is not permissible except what he gives willingly.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Ahmad and declared <em>saheeh</em> by Shaikh al-Albaanee (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) in <em>Saheehul-Jaami’</em> (no.7539) and <em>al-Irwaa’</em> (no.1459).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Title: “I Have Forbidden Oppression”<br />
شرح األربعني النبوييه :Title Original<br />
Author: Muḥammad Ibn Ṣāliḥ al-‘Uthaymīn</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Ḥadīth</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abū Dharr al-Ghifārī (رضي الله عنه) reported that the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) narrated that his lord said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Oh my servants, I have forbidden oppression even for myself, and I have made it forbidden among you as well, so do not oppress one another.”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Explanation</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says, <strong>“Oh my servants, I have made oppression forbidden even for myself,”</strong> and He (Azza wa Jal) may make something forbidden upon himself because the decision is His. As for us, we make nothing forbidden for Him, but He may forbid something upon Himself as he wishes just as He may obligate and decree something upon Himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Read the statement of Allah (تعالى ) :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “To who belongs whatever is in the heavens and earth?” Say, “To Allah.” He has decreed upon himself mercy.</span></strong>[4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he pledged upon himself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“My mercy surpasses my anger.”</strong></span> [5]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah has also made oppression forbidden among us as he says, “And I have made it forbidden among you as well.” This includes a person oppressing himself or others. However, the second meaning is more apparent as he then says, “So do not oppress one another.” Meaning: None of you may oppress another individual. Still, it is known that oppression may occur against oneself or against another;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;And we did not oppress them, but they oppressed themselves.&#8221;</strong></span> [6]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabic word for oppression, ظُلْم ẓulm, often revolves around failing to give someone else his or her rights or it could linguistically mean “shortcomings” as in the following verse as Allah says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Each of the two gardens produced its fruit and did not fall short thereof in anything.&#8221;</strong></span>[7]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This understanding of oppression—failing to give others their rights—is of two types: 1) refusing to fulfill an obligation to another person, and 2) unlawfully forcing another person to do something which he should not have to do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of the first type would be if you were to refuse to repay a debt to someone or to even postpone payment based on the prophet’s statement (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;A rich person’s (one with means to repay) postponement (of repaying) is oppression.&#8221;</strong></span> [8]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And an example of the second type would be if you claimed someone owed you something and you deceitfully produced evidence of the claim so that the individual was forced to pay – this is oppression.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <strong><span style="color:#993300;">By Allah’s command, “So do not oppress one another,” is there any exception to this order?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: No, oppression is forbidden under all circumstances, no exceptions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Is it permissible for us to take the wealth or possessions of the Muā’had?</strong></span> [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: No, it is neither permissible for us to take the wealth and possessions of those with whom we have an understood agreement of peace, nor is it permissible for us to take their blood. The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Whoever murders a Muā’had will not even smell the fragrance of Paradise although its fragrance can be smelled from forty years away</span></strong>. [10]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah for his help.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By this, we know the extent of the aggression, oppression, and utter misguidance of those arrogant individuals who hostilely transgress in taking the wealth and possessions of Muā’had unbelievers regardless of whether they are non-Muslims living peacefully with you in your land or if you were in their lands. We hear of some youths in non-Muslim lands claiming there is nothing wrong with taking wealth or ruining the possessions of disbelievers. You find them breaking street lights, destroying shops, and smashing cars. This is impermissible in Islam. Glorified is Allah! A nation of people accepts you as guests into their lands, you are under their authority and their agreement of trust and yet you betray them. This is the severest form of misrepresenting and dishonoring Islam; it is slandering and disgracing Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But the dishonor and disgrace is not actually against Islam. Rather it is against those individuals themselves – those who claim ascription to Islam. For that, it is incumbent to know that the wealth of non-Muslims under a trust or agreement of peace is sacred regardless of whether they are living peacefully among you or you with them in their lands. It is forbidden to show aggression and hostility against them because that is oppression.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]This article is taken from selected parts of Muḥammad Ibn Ṣāliḥ al-‘Uthaymīn’s explanation of ḥadīth twenty-four of the famous forty-two ḥadīth collection by Imām an-Nawawī known as “al-‘Arba’īn al-Nawawī” or “Nawawī’s Forty (Ḥadīth).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] This ḥadīth is actually much longer but only this portion is explained herein for brevity and for the article’s focus on the topic of oppression.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Recorded by Muslim (no. 2577), Aḥmad (5/153, 160, 177), al-Tirmidhī (no. 2495), and Ibn Mājah (no. 4257).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] The Quran, Sūrah al-An’ām, 6:12.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] This is a ḥadīth qudsī recorded by Muslim, al-Bukhārī, al-Nasāī, and Ibn Mājah. In the text of Muslim, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah created the creation, He pledged upon Himself in his book which is with him over his throne, “My mercy certainly overcomes my anger.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] The Quran, Sūrah Hūd, 11:101.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] The Quran, Sūrah al-Kahf, 18:33.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] Recorded by al-Bukhārī (no. 2166) and Muslim (no. 1564).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] Translator’s Note: Muā’had refers to non-Muslims with whom Muslims have a stated or understood agreement of peace. This may be in the form of official documents (such as entry visas into one another’s countries) or the lack of any official, government-sponsored declaration of war. Thus, the actions of today’s Muslim terrorists, as they declare whole groups or nations of non-Muslims as enemy combatants as they see fit, are neither Islamic nor are they in conjunction with the ḥadīth above (and many other Islamic texts), and Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] Recorded by al-Bukhārī (no. 3166).</p>

<p>21- The Different Types of Oppression and the Type Which Will not be Forgiven</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>1927- &#8220;Oppression is of three types, the oppression which Allaah will not leave, an oppression that will be forgiven, and an oppression that will not be forgiven.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As for the oppression which will not be forgiven, then Shirk will not be forgiven.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As for the oppression which will be forgiven, then that is the oppression which the slave commits between himself and his Lord.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As for the oppression which will not be left, then it is the oppression of the slaves, then Allaah will take the rights some from others.”</strong></span></p>

Chapter 26<br />
Unlawfulness of Oppression and Restoring Others Rights</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;There will be no friend, nor an intercessor for the Zalimun (polytheists and the wrongdoers), who could be given heed to.&#8221;</b></span><b> (40:18)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And for the Zalimun (wrongdoers, polytheists and disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah) there is no helper.&#8221;</b></span><b> (22:71)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>203.</b> Jabir bin `Abdullah (May Allah bepleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Beware of injustice, for oppression will be darkness on the Day of Resurrection; and beware of stinginess because it doomed those who were before you. It incited them to shed blood and treat the unlawful as lawful.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>204.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah bepleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;On the Resurrection Day, the rights will be paid to those to whom they are due so much so that a hornless sheep will be retaliated for by punishing the horned sheep which broke its horns&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>205.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah bepleased with them) reported: We were talking about the Farewell Pilgrimage without knowing what was it when Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was also present. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) stood up and recited the Praise and Glorification of Allah. He then gave a detailed account of Ad-Dajjal and said, &#8216;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Every Prophet sent by Allah had warned his people against his mischief. Nuh (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';"> )</span><span style="color:#0000ff;">warned his nation and so did all the Prophets after him. If he (i.e., Ad-Dajjal) appears among you, his condition will not remain hidden from you. Your Rubb is not one-eyed, but Ad-Dajjal is. His right eye is protruding like a swollen grape. Listen, Allah has made your blood, and your properties as inviolable as of this day of yours (i.e., the Day of Sacrifice), in this city of yours (i.e., Makkah), in this month of yours (i.e., Dhul -Hijjah)</span>.<span style="color:#0000ff;"> Listen, have I conveyed Allah&#8217;s Message to you?&#8217;</span>&#8216; The people replied in affirmative. There upon he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O Allah, bear witness.&#8221; And he repeated it thrice. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) concluded: &#8220;Do not revert after me as infidels killing one another&#8221;</span>.<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>206.</b> `Aishah (May Allah bepleased with her) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Whoever usurps unlawfully even a hand span of land a collar measuring seven times (this) land will be placed around his neck on the Day of Resurrection&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>207.</b>  Abu Musa (May Allah bepleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Verily, Allah gives respite to the oppressor. But when He seizes him, He does not let him escape.</span>&#8221; Then he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) recited,<span style="color:#ff0000;"> &#8220;Such is the Seizure of your Rubb when He seizes the (population of) towns while they are doing wrong. Verily, His Seizure is painful (and) severe&#8221;.</span> (11:102).<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>208.</b> Mu`adh (May Allah bepleased with him) reported that Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) sent me (as a governor of Yemen) and instructed me thus:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;You will go to the people of the Book. First call them to testify that `there is no true god except Allah, that I am (Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) the Messenger of Allah.&#8217; If they obey you, tell them that Allah has enjoined upon them five Salat (prayers) during the day and night; and if they obey you, inform them that Allah has made Zakat obligatory upon them; that it should be collected from their rich and distributed among their poor; and if they obey you refrain from picking up (as a share of Zakat) the best of their wealth. Beware of the supplication of the oppressed, for there is no barrier  between it and Allah&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>209.</b> Abu Humaid bin Sa`d As-Sa`idi (May Allah bepleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) employed a man from the tribe of Al-Azd named Ibn Lutbiyyah as collector of Zakat. When the employee returned (with the collections) he said: &#8220;(O Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)!) This is for you and this is mine because it was presented to me as gift.&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) rose to the pulpit and praised Allah and extolled Him. Then he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;I employ a man to do a job and he comes and says: `This is for you and this has been presented to me as gift&#8217;? Why did he not remain in the house of his father or the house of his mother and see whether gifts will be given to him or not? By Allah in Whose Hand is the life of Muhammad, if any one of you took anything wrongfully, he will bring it on the Day of Resurrection, carrying it on (his back), I will not recognize anyone of you, on the Day of Resurrection with a grunting camel, or a bellowing cow, or a bleating ewe.&#8221; Then he raised his hands till we could see the whiteness of his armpits.</span> Then he said thrice,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O Allah ! have I conveyed (Your Commandments)&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>210.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah bepleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He who has done a wrong affecting his brother&#8217;s honour or anything else, let him ask his forgiveness today before the time (i.e., the Day of Resurrection) when he will have neither a dinar nor a dirham. If he has done some good deeds, a portion equal to his wrong doings will be subtracted from them; but if he has no good deeds, he will be burdened with the evil deeds of the one he had wronged in the same proportion&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>211.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`as (May Allah bepleased with them) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;A Muslim is the one from whose tongue and hands the Muslims are safe; and a Muhajir (Emigrant) is the one who refrains from what Allah has forbidden&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>212.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`as (May Allah bepleased with them) reported: A man named Kirkirah, who was in charge of the personal effects of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) passed away and the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He is in the (Hell) Fire.&#8221;</span> Some people went to his house looking for its cause and found there a cloak that he had stolen. [Al-Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>213.</b> Abu Bakrah (May Allah bepleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Time has completed its cycle and has come to the state of the day when Allah created the heavens and the earth. The year consists of twelve months of which four are inviolable; three of them consecutive &#8211; Dhul-Qa`dah, Dhul-Hijjah and Muharram and Rajab, the month of Mudar (tribe), which comes between Jumada and Sha`ban. What month is this?&#8221;</span> We said, &#8220;Allah and His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) know better&#8221;. The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) remained silent for some time until we thought that he would give it a name other than its real name. Then asked,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Is it not (the month of) Dhul-Hijjah?&#8221;.</span> We replied in the affirmative. He asked,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Which city is this?&#8221;.</span> We replied: &#8220;Allah and His Messenger know better&#8221;. He remained silent until we thought that he would give it another name. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) asked,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Is it not Al-Baldah (Makkah)?</span>&#8221; We said: &#8220;Yes&#8221;. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) asked,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;What day is this?&#8221;.</span> We said: &#8220;Allah and His Messenger know better.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) remained silent until we thought that he would give it another name. He asked,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Is it not the day of An-Nahr (the sacrifice)?&#8221;</span>. We replied in the affirmative. Thereupon he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Your blood, your property and your honour are inviolable to you all like the inviolablity of this day of yours, in this city of yours and in this month of yours. You will soon meet your Rubb and He will ask you about your deeds. So do not turn to disbelief after me by striking the necks of one another. Behold! Let him who is present here convey (this message ) to him who is absent; for many a person to whom a message is conveyed has more retentive memory than the one who hears it.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) again said, &#8220;Have I conveyed the message to you? Behold! Have I conveyed the Commandments (of Allah) to you</span>.&#8221; We submitted: &#8220;Yes&#8221;. He then said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O Allah, bear witness (to this)&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>214</b>. Abu Umamah (May Allah bepleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah decrees the (Hell) Fire and debars Jannah for the one who usurps the rights of a believer by taking a false oath.</span>&#8221; One man asked: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Even if it should be for an insignificant thing?&#8221; He said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Even if it be a stick of the Arak tree (i.e., the tree from which Miswak sticks are taken)&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>215.</b> `Adi bin `Umairah (May Allah bepleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Whosoever among you is appointed by us to a position and he conceals from us even a needle or less, it will amount to misappropriation and he will be called upon to restore it on the Day of Resurrection&#8221;.</span> (`Adi bin `Umairah added:) A black man from the Ansar stood up &#8211; I can see him still &#8211; and said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, take back from me your assignment.&#8221; He (the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;What has happened to you?</span>&#8221; The man replied: &#8220;I have heard you saying such and such.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;I say that even now: Whosoever from you is appointed by us to a position, he should render an account of everything, big or small, and whatever he is given therefrom, he should take and he should desist from taking what is unlawful&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>216.</b>  `Umar bin Al-Khattab (May Allah bepleased with him) reported: On the day<span style="color:#800000;"> (of the battle)</span> of Khaibar, some Companions of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) came and remarked: &#8220;So-and-so is a martyr and so-and-so is a martyr&#8221;. When they came to a man about whom they said: &#8220;So-and-so is a martyr,&#8221; the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) declared,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;No. I have seen him in Hell for a mantle (or cloak) which he has stolen&#8221;.<br />
</span>[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>217.</b> Abu Qatadah Al-Harith bin Rib`i (May Allah bepleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Faith in Allah and striving in His Cause (Jihad) are the deeds of highest merit.</span>&#8221; A man stood up said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Tell me if I am killed in the Cause of Allah, will all my sins be forgiven?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Yes, if you are killed in the Cause of Allah while you are patient, hopeful of your reward and marching forward not retreating.&#8221;</span> Then the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to him<span style="color:#0000ff;">, &#8220;Repeat what you have said.</span>&#8221; The man said: &#8220;Tell me if I am killed in the Cause of Allah, will all my sins be remitted?&#8221;. He replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Yes, if you are martyred while you are patient, hopeful of your reward and march forward without retreating, unless, if you owe any debt, that will not be remitted. Angel Jibril told me that&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>218.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah bepleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Do you know who is the bankrupt?&#8221;</span> They said: &#8220;The bankrupt among us is one who has neither money with him nor any property&#8221;. He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The real bankrupt of my Ummah would be he who would come on the Day of Resurrection with Salat, Saum and Sadaqah (charity), (but he will find himself bankrupt on that day as he will have exhausted the good deeds) because he reviled others, brought calumny against others, unlawfully devoured the wealth of others, shed the blood of others and beat others; so his good deeds would be credited to the account of those (who suffered at his hand). If his good deeds fall short to clear the account, their sins would be entered in his account and he would be thrown in the (Hell) Fire&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>219.</b> Umm Salamah (May Allah bepleased with her) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Verily, I am only a human and the claimants bring to me (their disputes); perhaps some of them are more eloquent than others. I judge according to what I hear from them). So, he whom I, by my judgment, (give the undue share) out of the right of a Muslim, I in fact give him a portion of (Hell) Fire&#8221;.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>220.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah bepleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;A believer continues to guard his Faith (and thus hopes for Allah&#8217;s Mercy) so long as he does not shed blood unjustly&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>221.</b>  Khaulah bint `Thamir (May Allah bepleased with her) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Many people misappropriate (acquire wrongfully) Allah&#8217;s Property (meaning Muslims&#8217; property). These people will be cast in Hell on the Day of Resurrection&#8221;.</span><br />

<h3 align="center">Oppressions</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.043.620"></a>Volume 3, Book 43, Number 620:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;When the believers pass safely over (the bridge across) Hell, they will be stopped at a bridge in between Hell and Paradise where they will retaliate upon each other for the injustices done among them in the world, and when they get purified of all their sins, they will be admitted into Paradise. By Him in Whose Hands the life of Muhammad is everybody will recognize his dwelling in Paradise better than he recognizes his dwelling in this world.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 621:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Safwan bin Muhriz Almazini:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While I was walking with Ibn &#8216;Umar holding his hand, a man came in front of us and asked, &#8220;What have you heard from Allah&#8217;s Apostle about An-Najwa?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;Allah will bring a believer near Him and shelter him with His Screen and ask him: Did you commit such-and-such sins? He will say: Yes, my Lord. Allah will keep on asking him till he will confess all his sins and will think that he is ruined. Allah will say: &#8216;I did screen your sins in the world and I forgive them for you today&#8217;, and then he will be given the book of his good deeds. Regarding infidels and hypocrites (their evil acts will be exposed publicly) and the witnesses will say: These are the people who lied against their Lord. Behold! The Curse of Allah is upon the wrongdoers.&#8221; (11.18)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 622:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;A Muslim is a brother of another Muslim, so he should not oppress him, nor should he hand him over to an oppressor. Whoever fulfilled the needs of his brother, Allah will fulfill his needs; whoever brought his (Muslim) brother out of a discomfort, Allah will bring him out of the discomforts of the Day of Resurrection, and whoever screened a Muslim, Allah will screen him on the Day of Resurrection . &#8220;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 623:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Help your brother, whether he is an oppressor or he is an oppressed one.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 624:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Help your brother, whether he is an oppressor or he is an oppressed one. People asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! It is all right to help him if he is oppressed, but how should we help him if he is an oppressor?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;By preventing him from oppressing others.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 625:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Muawiya bin Suwald:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Al-Bara&#8217; bin &#8216;Azib saying, &#8220;The Prophet orders us to do seven things and prohibited us from doing seven other things.&#8221; Then Al-Bara&#8217; mentioned the following:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) To pay a visit to the sick (inquiring about his health),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) to follow funeral processions,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) to say to a sneezer, &#8220;May Allah be merciful to you&#8221; (if he says, &#8220;Praise be to Allah!&#8221;),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(4) to return greetings,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(5) to help the oppressed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(6) to accept invitations,</p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 648:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I had been eager to ask &#8216;Umar about the two ladies from among the wives of the Prophet regarding whom Allah said (in the Qur&#8217;an saying): If you two (wives of the Prophet namely Aisha and Hafsa) turn in repentance to Allah your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet likes) (66.4), till performed the Hajj along with &#8216;Umar (and on our way back from Hajj) he went aside (to answer the call of nature) and I also went aside along with him carrying a tumbler of water. When he had answered the call of nature and returned. I poured water on his hands from the tumbler and he performed ablution. I said, &#8220;O Chief of the believers! &#8216; Who were the two ladies from among the wives of the Prophet to whom Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;If you two return in repentance (66.4)? He said, &#8220;I am astonished at your question, O Ibn &#8216;Abbas. They were Aisha and Hafsa.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then &#8216;Umar went on relating the narration and said. &#8220;I and an Ansari neighbor of mine from Bani Umaiya bin Zaid who used to live in &#8216;Awali Al-Medina, used to visit the Prophet in turns. He used to go one day, and I another day. When I went I would bring him the news of what had happened that day regarding the instructions and orders and when he went, he used to do the same for me. We, the people of Quraish, used to have authority over women, but when we came to live with the Ansar, we noticed that the Ansari women had the upper hand over their men, so our women started acquiring the habits of the Ansari women. Once I shouted at my wife and she paid me back in my coin and I disliked that she should answer me back. She said, &#8216;Why do you take it ill that I retort upon you? By Allah, the wives of the Prophet retort upon him, and some of them may not speak with him for the whole day till night.&#8217; What she said scared me and I said to her, &#8216;Whoever amongst them does so, will be a great loser.&#8217; Then I dressed myself and went to Hafsa and asked her, &#8216;Does any of you keep Allah&#8217;s Apostle angry all the day long till night?&#8217; She replied in the affirmative. I said, &#8216;She is a ruined losing person (and will never have success)! Doesn&#8217;t she fear that Allah may get angry for the anger of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and thus she will be ruined? Don&#8217;t ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle too many things, and don&#8217;t retort upon him in any case, and don&#8217;t desert him. Demand from me whatever you like, and don&#8217;t be tempted to imitate your neighbor (i.e. &#8216;Aisha) in her behavior towards the Prophet), for she (i.e. Aisha) is more beautiful than you, and more beloved to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In those days it was rumored that Ghassan, (a tribe living in Sham) was getting prepared their horses to invade us. My companion went (to the Prophet on the day of his turn, went and returned to us at night and knocked at my door violently, asking whether I was sleeping. I was scared (by the hard knocking) and came out to him. He said that a great thing had happened. I asked him: What is it? Have Ghassan come? He replied that it was worse and more serious than that, and added that Allah&#8217;s Apostle had divorced all his wives. I said, Hafsa is a ruined loser! I expected that would happen some day.&#8217; So I dressed myself and offered the Fajr prayer with the Prophet. Then the Prophet entered an upper room and stayed there alone. I went to Hafsa and found her weeping. I asked her, &#8216;Why are you weeping? Didn&#8217;t I warn you? Have Allah&#8217;s Apostle divorced you all?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;I don&#8217;t know. He is there in the upper room.&#8217; I then went out and came to the pulpit and found a group of people around it and some of them were weeping. Then I sat with them for some time, but could not endure the situation. So I went to the upper room where the Prophet was and requested to a black slave of his: &#8220;Will you get the permission of (Allah&#8217;s Apostle) for Umar (to enter)? The slave went in, talked to the Prophet about it and came out saying, &#8216;I mentioned you to him but he did not reply.&#8217; So, I went and sat with the people who were sitting by the pulpit, but I could not bear the situation, so I went to the slave again and said: &#8220;Will you get he permission for Umar? He went in and brought the same reply as before. When I was leaving, behold, the slave called me saying, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle has granted you permission.&#8221; So, I entered upon the Prophet and saw him lying on a mat without wedding on it, and the mat had left its mark on the body of the Prophet, and he was leaning on a leather pillow stuffed with palm fires. I greeted him and while still standing, I said: &#8220;Have you divorced your wives?&#8217; He raised his eyes to me and replied in the negative. And then while still standing, I said chatting: &#8220;Will you heed what I say, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We, the people of Quraish used to have the upper hand over our women (wives), and when we came to the people whose women had the upper hand over them&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umar told the whole story (about his wife). &#8220;On that the Prophet smiled.&#8221; &#8216;Umar further said, &#8220;I then said, &#8216;I went to Hafsa and said to her: Do not be tempted to imitate your companion (&#8216;Aisha) for she is more beautiful than you and more beloved to the Prophet.&#8217; The Prophet smiled again. When I saw him smiling, I sat down and cast a glance at the room, and by Allah, I couldn&#8217;t see anything of importance but three hides. I said (to Allah&#8217;s Apostle) &#8220;Invoke Allah to make your followers prosperous for the Persians and the Byzantines have been made prosperous and given worldly luxuries, though they do not worship Allah?&#8217; The Prophet was leaning then (and on hearing my speech he sat straight) and said, &#8216;O Ibn Al-Khatttab! Do you have any doubt (that the Hereafter is better than this world)? These people have been given rewards of their good deeds in this world only.&#8217; I asked the Prophet . &#8216;Please ask Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for me. The Prophet did not go to his wives because of the secret which Hafsa had disclosed to &#8216;Aisha, and he said that he would not go to his wives for one month as he was angry with them when Allah admonished him (for his oath that he would not approach Maria). When twenty-nine days had passed, the Prophet went to Aisha first of all. She said to him, &#8216;You took an oath that you would not come to us for one month, and today only twenty-nine days have passed, as I have been counting them day by day.&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;The month is also of twenty-nine days.&#8217; That month consisted of twenty-nine days. &#8216;Aisha said, &#8216;When the Divine revelation of Choice was revealed, the Prophet started with me, saying to me, &#8216;I am telling you something, but you needn&#8217;t hurry to give the reply till you can consult your parents.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha knew that her parents would not advise her to part with the Prophet . The Prophet said that Allah had said:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;O Prophet! Say To your wives; If you desire The life of this world And its glitter, &#8230; then come! I will make a provision for you and set you free In a handsome manner. But if you seek Allah And His Apostle, and The Home of the Hereafter, then Verily, Allah has prepared For the good-doers amongst you A great reward.&#8217; (33.28) &#8216;Aisha said, &#8216;Am I to consult my parents about this? I indeed prefer Allah, His Apostle, and the Home of the Hereafter.&#8217; After that the Prophet gave the choice to his other wives and they also gave the same reply as &#8216;Aisha did.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;There was an Israeli man called Juraij, while he was praying, his mother came and called him, but he did not respond to her call. He said (to himself) whether he should continue the prayer or reply to his mother. She came to him the second time and called him and said, &#8220;O Allah! Do not let him die until he sees the faces of prostitutes.&#8221; Juraij used to live in a hermitage. A woman said that she would entice Juraij, so she went to him and presented herself (for an evil act) but he refused. She then went to a shepherd and allowed him to commit an illegal sexual intercourse with her and later she gave birth to a boy. She alleged that the baby was from Juraij. The people went to Juraij and broke down his hermitage, pulled him out of it and abused him. He performed ablution and offered the prayer, then he went to the male (baby) and asked him; &#8220;O boy! Who is your father?&#8221; The baby replied that his father was the shepherd. The people said that they would build for him a hermitage of gold but Juraij asked them to make it of mud only.&#8221;</p>

</strong>Compiled by <strong>Aboo Sufyaan &#8216;Uthmaan Beecher<br />
<a href="http://salafiyyah-kuwait.blogspot.in/2012/09/the-prophet-cannot-by-defended-by.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://salafiyyah-kuwait.blogspot.in/</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Verily all praise is due to Allaah, and may peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, and upon his family and his Companions, one and all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No Muslim would ever agree with the mocking, ridicule, and blasphemous lies directed at our Deen and at our beloved Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم).  Rather the Imaams of Ahlus-Sunnah, the likes of Maalik, al-Layth, Ahmad, Ishaaq, and ash-Shaafi’ee, have agreed unanimously that the one who mocks, ridicules, and defames the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) has disbelieved, and that the prescribed punishment for the one who lives in the lands of the Muslims and does that is death, a punishment that falls under the authority of the Muslim ruler.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that these types of attacks on our Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) will cause anger and make the stomach of every Muslim turn due to his love for Allaah, His Messenger, and His Deen.  But the Muslim who is truthful, sincere, and just, he doesn’t allow himself to be overcome by emotion and respond to these attacks with a knee-jerk reaction that entails actions which Allaah and His Messenger have prohibited.  Rather, like in all matters, he is first and foremost patient, and then he takes those matters back to the Qur’aan and Sunnah and the understanding of the Companions, and those ‘Ulamaa’ who are firmly-grounded in knowledge.  So he is patient and he plants his feet squarely upon knowledge, and he submits to what Allaah and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) have decreed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“O you who believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger, and those of you who have been placed in authority (over you). (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it back to Allaah and His Messenger, if you truly believe in Allaah and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination.”</em></span> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And al-Haafith Ibn Katheer mentions that “those of you who have been placed in authority (over you)”, according to Ibn ‘Abbaas, Mujaahid,  ‘Ataa’ and others from the Salaf refers to the ‘Ulamaa’. And Ibn Katheer mentions that it is general to both the rulers and the ‘Ulamaa’.  And of course this means the ‘Ulamaa’ of Ahlus-Sunnah, not those who ahlul-bid’ah call scholars, the likes of al-Qaradaawee, al-‘Awdah, ‘Abdur-Rahmaan ‘Abdul-Khaaliq, and other than them from the callers to misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What has transpired over the past few days in the lands of the Muslims and other than them as a reaction to the film attacking Islaam and insulting our beloved Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) &#8211; contradicts the guidance and Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم).  One should remember that these types of attacks are not something new.  Indeed Allaah mentions throughout the Qur’aan that His messengers (عليهم الصلاة و السلام) were constantly mocked and defamed, that their people called them crazy, mad, and even labeled them as sorcerers, etc.  Allaah تعالى said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“Likewise, no Messenger came to those before them except that they said: &#8220;A sorcerer or a madman!&#8221;</span></em> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this happened with the Prophets and Messengers from Nooh (عليه السلام) up to His final Messenger, Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the lifetime of Allaah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) there were those who cursed and insulted him openly.  Ka’b bin al-Ashraf al-Yahoodee, in al-Madeenah, used to recite defamatory poetry about him and made explicit poetry about the women of the Muslims.  And there was ‘Abdullaah bin Khatal in Makkah, who had two female singers who he had sing songs making fun of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم).</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Ka’b bin al-Ashraf, when he returned from Makkah to al-Madeenah and began reciting his poetry insulting him, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) asked his Companions, “<em><strong>Who will deal with Ka’b bin al-Ashraf? For indeed he has harmed Allaah and His Messenger</strong></em>.”  And this was when the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) was in his dawlah in al-Madeenah and he was the ruler, and Ka’b bin al-Ashraf was living under his authority in al-Madeenah.  But the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) didn’t ask his Companions to punish his neighbors, companions, or even his family members for what Ka’b bin al-Ashraf did.  Nor did he punish the representatives of his tribe, Banu an-Nadeer, or randomly target the Jews of al-Madeenah nor did he boycott their businesses.   Any person of sound intellect would agree that this would be unjust and defies logic, not to mention the texts of the Book and the Sunnah.  Instead he (صلى الله عليه وسلم) -as the ruler &#8211; dealt with Ka’b bin al-Ashraf, the one who caused that harm specifically.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> ‘Abdullaah bin Khatal was in Makkah, and he had two female singers who he taught to sing songs making fun of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم).  And at that time, the Prophet was in al-Madeenah, and was the ruler (صلى الله عليه وسلم), and never did he attack anyone from the kuffaar in al-Madeenah or any other town or village as retribution for the defamation and insults of ‘Abdullaah bin Khatal towards him.  Nor did he command his Companions to attack Makkah or its people because of him. Rather he was patient (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and did not oppress, and did not transgress.  He was patient and he was just (صلى الله عليه وسلم). So when the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) conquered Makkah, and he entered Makkah with his armies, he ordered them not to harm anyone who did not fight them, except for a small group of people who he named by name (صلى الله عليه وسلم).  From them – and here the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) had conquered Makkah, and had might and capability (qudrah) – from them was ‘Abdullaah bin Khatal and his two songstresses.  He didn’t tell them to kill Ibn Khatal’s neighbors or his family members. He didn’t  destroy the property of the members of his tribe.  Rather he ordered them to kill ‘Abdullaah bin Khatal and his two songstresses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are just two examples of how the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) dealt with those who abused him in his lifetime.   He was aadil (just), and was saabir (patient) &#8211; (صلى الله عليه وسلم).  He did not oppress and was not unjust, and these people cursed him, abused him, mocked him, and insulted him <strong>during his lifetime</strong> &#8211; (صلى الله عليه وسلم)!!   So where are the actions of the jamaa’aat (political groups and parties) and the ignorant folk who’ve been affected by them from the actions and example of Allaah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم)?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Where do you find that the Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and his Companions went to another town and protested, or that they murdered the innocent, or destroyed or burnt their property to the ground because of what the likes of Ibn al-Ashraf and Ibn Khatal did in Makkah and al-Madeenah?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather he was patient and just (صلى الله عليه وسلم)!!  And ‘adl (justice) is to put everything in it’s proper place.  And what we see from these people in Egypt, Yemen, Libya, and other places in the Middle East, is oppression, injustice, and deviation from his Sunnah.  And Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“So warn those who oppose his command, lest some fitnah befall him or they afflicted with a painful punishment.”</span> </em>[3]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what further elucidates the distinction between the guidance of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and those Muslims who have been overtaken by emotion and misguidance, is the narration of ‘Aa’ishah (رضى الله عنها), collected by al-Bukhaaree, Muslim, Ahmad and others, when a group of Jews entered upon the Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and said “as-saamu ‘alaykum” (death be upon you).  So ‘Aa’ishah (رضى الله عنها) understood what they said, so she responded:  “wa ‘alaykum as-saam wal-la’nah” (and death and curses be upon you).  So the Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:  “<em><strong>Take it easy, O ‘Aa’ishah!  Verily Allaah loves rifq (gentleness and leniency) in all matters</strong></em>.”  So ‘Aa’ishah said: “O Messenger of Allaah! Didn’t you hear what they said?” So he (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said: “<em><strong>I already responded to them (by saying) ‘wa ‘alaykum’ (and upon you, too)</strong></em>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Deen is not based on emotion.  Rather the Muslim who truly and sincerely loves Allaah and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) will stick to his guidance and his Sunnah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“Say:  if you truly love Allaah, then follow me. (If you do) Allaah will love you and forgive you for your sins.  And Allaah is all-forgiving, most merciful.”</em></span> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Here are some points to consider and reflect upon</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; These protests which have spread throughout the Muslim lands, even to our beloved Kuwait, are a bid’ah, as the ‘Ulamaa’ of Ahlus-Sunnah like Shaykh Ibn Baaz, Shaykh al-Albaanee, and Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen have clarified. [5] They are an act of opposing and contending with the Muslim ruler and are from the way of the Khawaarij.  Of course the <strong>jamaa’aat as-siyaasiyyah</strong> allow them and promote them as they are means for them to contend with the Muslim rulers and reach rulership itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; We’ve seen how the emotionally charged youth have taken to the streets in these protests and clashed with the police, and caused damage to property &#8211; not just the property of the American Embassies &#8211; which is in itself an act of oppression &#8211; but the property of the Muslims as well!  And this is supposed to be defense of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم)??!    It cannot be that the Muslims defend the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) with oppression when Allaah has commanded us with justice (‘adl):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“O you who believe! Stand out firmly for Allaah and be just witnesses and don’t let the enmity and hatred of a people keep you from being just. Be just! That is closer to Taqwaa.”</span></em> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Haafith Ibn Katheer</strong> said:  “Don’t let hatred for a people cause you to abandon justice towards them.  Rather exercise justice with everyone, whether it be a close friend or an enemy.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah</strong>:  “for indeed the people did not dispute in the fact that the end result of thulm (oppression and injustice) is evil and harmful, and the end result of ‘adl (justice) is good and noble.  And for this it has been said:  Allaah will aid the nation that is just, even if it is a disbelieving nation, and He will not aid the nation that is unjust and oppressive, even if it is a believing nation.”  [Majmoo’ al-Fataawaa (28/63)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then know that punishing others for the crimes and offenses of another is not justice!  Allaah says:<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><em>“No person earns any (sin) except against himself (only), and no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another.”</em> </span>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; The jamaa’aat as-siyaasiyyah use these protests and these types of events as a forum and a podium to spread their doubts and their conspiracy theories amongst the people and to turn them against their rulers.  They spout out anti-American, anti-western, and anti-Israeli rhetoric and place the blame for the destruction we’ve seen over the past few days on everyone but themselves.  ‘Ali al-Deqbas,  head of the Arab Parliament, actually blamed “international Zionism of being behind the unrest and inciting sedition and hatred of Islam and Muslims in the Middle East in favor of the Zionist entity”.  And the misguided statements like this are many.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; These protests – which as the ‘Ulamaa’ have said is a bid’ah – were used as a cover for those upon the manhaj of the Khawaarij to murder a U.S. ambassador and three other members of his staff, the murder of non-Muslims who were given amn (an assurance of safety and protection) and were from a country that has treaties and agreements with the government of Libya.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said: “Whoever – from the Muslims &#8211; kills a person who is under an agreement or treaty (with the Muslims), he will not smell the Fragrance of Jannah, even though it’s fragrance can be smelled from the distance of 40 years away.” [al-Bukhaaree]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration he said:  &#8220;The assurance of protection of the Muslims is one, so whoever betrays the assurance of protection and safety of another Muslim, then upon him is the curse of Allaah, and (the curse) of the Angels, and (the curse) of all the people.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr (رحمه الله) explained:  &#8220;His saying &#8216;The assurance of protection of the Muslims is one&#8217;, means that their giving an assurance of safety and security is correct (and binding).  So if one of them gives amn to a kaafir, then it is haraam upon anyone else to harm him…&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those non-Muslims who live and work in the Muslim countries have been given <span style="color:#808000;"><a href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-1tC" target="_blank"><span style="color:#808000;">amn (an assurance of safety and protection)</span></a></span>, so by attacking them is contending with and opposing the Muslim ruler, and is an act of treachery and oppression.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Taariq as-Subay’ee</strong> explained that if even one of the Muslims gives amn to a non-Muslim, even if that Muslim is a man or a woman, a free man or a slave, and even if that is by a gesture, or if a person is given amn by the authorities of a Muslim land through diplomatic agreements or by giving him a visa to enter that land – that person has an assurance of safety and protection from every Muslim.  It is totally haraam for any Muslim to harm him. And the person, &#8211; the Muslim -, who does, falls under the curse of Allaah, the Angels, and all of the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; Look to those at the head of these protests and you’ll see that all of them are from the heads and supporters of the jamaa’aat as-siyaasiyyah.  And the fact that none of the ‘Ulamaa’ of Ahlus-Sunnah have anything to do with this should be another sign for the person of intellect, just as Ibn ‘Abbaas (رضى الله تعالى عنهما) brought as a proof against the Khawaarij the fact that none of the Companions were with them, when he said (رضى الله عنهما): Indeed I’ve come to you from the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and there is not a single one of them with you!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211;  We see the Muslims protesting, fighting with the police, destroying property and other than that, all in the name of defending the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) from this film produced by a man living in America.  <span style="color:#ff9900;">What is amazing is that no one is upset over the masaajid that have graves in them where other than Allaah are worshipped besides Allaah, like the masjid of al-Badawee, Zaynab, or al-Hussayn?!</span>  The greatest sin that one can commit is committed in the lands of the Muslims, and the people are tearing down the American embassy over something they don’t have the authority or ability to do anything about?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“Verily, Allaah does not forgive that partners should be set up with him in worship (shirk), but He forgives what is less than that (from sins) for whomever He wills, and whoever sets up partners with Allaah in worship, he has indeed invented a tremendous sin.” </span></em> [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these Muslims and these jamaa’aat want to defend Prophet Muhammad(صلى الله عليه وسلم) – by committing oppression and injustice – but where is the defense of Allaah and His Tawheed from the shirk committed by muslims in the lands of the muslims themselves?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So know that Allaah (تبارك و تعالى) has commanded us with patience and justice, and forbidden us from injustice and oppression.  And there is no justice in the actions we see from our brothers and sisters in Egypt, Yemen, Tunisia, Morocco, Sudan, and the other countries that this is happening in.  Rather what we see is ignorance, oppression, misguidance, and deviation from the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what benefit have they brought about?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The producer of this shoddy film lives in America, and America is a country that has it’s own laws that it governs it’s citizens by.  And America also has treaties and agreements with almost all of these lands that their embassies are being attacked in, proven by the fact that they have embassies there to begin with.  So then this affair is not in the hands of us common folk, and we don’t have the capability to do anything about it.  What is upon us then is to be patient and cling to the Sunnah of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم).  And this is a better defense of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) than what we see from the jamaa’aat and those infected by them!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff9900;">And it is important to note that our patience and our clinging to the Sunnah during situations like this, when we don’t have the ability to change them, is not a sign of weakness or deficiency.  Rather it is the people of misguidance from the jamaa’aat as-siyaasiyyah that have duped our youth into thinking that not having the ability to act is the same as not acting, and this is misguidance and deception.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas’ood narrated that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) was praying by the Ka’bah, and when he went into sajdah, one of the companions of Aboo Jahl put the entrails of a camel on the Prophet’s back (صلى الله عليه وسلم) while Ibn Mas’ood looked on.  And Ibn Mas’ood said:  “I was watching but couldn’t do anything about it. If only I had the strength and ability (to stop them).” [al-Bukhaaree]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This shows us that in situations when we don’t have the capability to act, due to physical weakness, lack of strength or capability, or there being something else that prevents us from doing that, there is no shame or deficiency in that, just as the Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) himself could not aid Yaasir, ‘Ammaar, and Umm ‘Ammaar (رضى الله تعالى عنهم) when he saw them being tortured for their Eemaan in Allaah.  So he said to them (صلى الله عليه وسلم):  “Patience, O Aal-Yaasir (O family of Yaasir)! For indeed you’ve been promised Jannah.”  [9]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>What we’ve written here is not a defense of this film</strong>.  We find it just as offensive, appalling, and insulting as everyone else.  Nor is it a defense of America, Israel, or any other country.  Rather it is meant to be a defense of the Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and our Deen from those who go beyond the bounds, and those who play on the emotions of the Muslims and the emotional, disenfranchised youth, and call them to deviation and misguidance.  It is a call to patience, justice, and sticking to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه وسلم).  And this what was needed to be said and clarified.  And Allaah knows best.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Ubaadah bin as-Saamit narrated:  “The Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) took an oath of allegiance from us to listen and obey (the ruler) in adversity and prosperity, in pleasure and displeasure (and even) when somebody is given preference over us, and to not dispute or contend the authority of those it belongs to, and that we speak the truth wherever we may be without fearing in the matter of Allaah the blame of the blamer.” [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, and upon his family and his Companions, one and all.  And All praise and thanks are due to Allaah, Lord of al-&#8216;Aalameen.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Based on <strong>Sheikh Fawzaan</strong>&#8216;s explanation of Hadith #24 in An-Nawawee&#8217;s collection of 40 Hadith;On the authority of Abu Dharr (radiAllaahu anhu) from the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) from his Lord (&#8216;azza wa jall) that He said:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#008000;">O My servants ! I have forbidden dhulm (oppression) for Myself, and I have made it forbidden amongst you, so do not oppress one another&#8230;. <span style="color:#888888;">(Hadeeth Qudsi)</span><br />
</span></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Sheikh Fawzaan</strong> mentioned three types of dhulm (oppression);</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#993300;">1. Dhulm (oppression) between a servant and his Lord</span> &#8211; Shirk<br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> 2. Dhulm (oppression) between a servant and his nafs (own self)</span> &#8211; Base Desires and Sins<br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> 3. Dhulm (oppression) between one person and others</span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;<br />
Some Notes</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;</strong><span style="color:#008000;">Those who believe and do not mix their faith with <em>Dhulm</em>, these are the ones for whom there is faith, and they are rightly guided.</span>&#8221; [Sooratul An&#8217;aam][Here <em>Dhulm</em> &#8211; to associate partners with Allaah.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">Avoid oppression, because oppression will result in deep darkness on the Day of Ressurection</span>.&#8221; [Recorded by Muslim and others]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">Avoid the oppressed’s supplication (against you), even if he was a kafir, because there is no barrier in its way (to Allah)</span>.&#8221; [Recorded by Ahmed, Abu Ya&#8217;la , and others. Verified to be hasan by al-Albani as sahih no 767 and sahih ul-jami no 119]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">Whoever has oppressed his brother in regard to his honor or property should beg for his forgiveness today – before it will be taken from him on a day when there will be no dinars or dirhams: If he has good deeds, some of them will be taken to the amount of his oppression; and if he has no good deeds, some of his (oppressed) companion’s sins will be taken and loaded upon him</span>.&#8221; [Recorded by al-Bukhari and Ahmed]</p>
