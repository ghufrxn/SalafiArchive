<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ALL praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, the Most Merciful, the Beneficent, and the Master of the Day of Judgment. O Allah! Have Your <em>Salat</em> (1) and <em>Salam</em> (peace) and blessing upon Your slave and Messenger Muhammad and upon all of his companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Extraordinary consideration has been given by the Islamic Law to women&#8217;s affairs, all meant to protect her chastity, to honor her and to secure her position in life. The so called &#8220;restrictions&#8221; placed upon her regarding her dress and the display of her beauty and ornament is only to guard against all ways of corruption arising from such dazzling displays. What Islam has established is not a restriction on the freedom of women but is a firm protection for her from falling down to the lowest levels of humiliation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the means of this protection is the HIJAB. The characteristics of the Hijab are discussed, bringing the glad tidings promised (by Allah) to those women adhering to it. We also point out the danger of dazzling displays of ornaments and beauty as well as the terrible repercussions in this life and in the hereafter for those who practice <em>Tabar&#8217;ruj </em>(display of beauty).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It comes at a time when more women are throwing away their revealing clothes, and wearing the Hijab. This comes at a time when Muslim women wearing Hijab are attacked in &#8220;civilized&#8221; Europe (2)! and inFrance (3) Muslim women are prevented from wearing the head scarf / Hijab at school. These are times of trials for Muslims and particularly for Muslim women. We all have to remember the path of the Prophets: endurance, patience, holding on, and aiming high by keeping the way of Allah above everything.</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;"> (1) The <em>Salat</em> of Allah upon prophet Muhammad is His Praise and mentioning of the Prophet to the angels in the Most High place in Paradise</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;">(2) Bosnia is a testimony against the &#8220;civility&#8221; of Europe and the West. Civility stops at the word: Muslim or Islam!</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;">(3) The country that raises the banner of: equality, brotherhood, and freedom.!!!</span></p>
<h2><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE VIRTUES OF HIJAAB</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(1) AN ACT OF OBEDIENCE</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hijab is an act of obedience to Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) (4) and to His Messenger Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم (5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (سبحانه و تعالى) says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">وَمَا كَانَ لِمُؤْمِنٍ وَلَا مُؤْمِنَةٍ إِذَا قَضَى اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ أَمْرًا أَن يَكُونَ لَهُمُ الْخِيَرَةُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِمْ ۗ وَمَن يَعْصِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلَالًا مُّبِينًا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have an option in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, has indeed strayed in a plain error.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 33:36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) also says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">فَلَا وَرَبِّكَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ حَتَّىٰ يُحَكِّمُوكَ فِيمَا شَجَرَ بَيْنَهُمْ ثُمَّ لَا يَجِدُوا فِي أَنفُسِهِمْ حَرَجًا مِّمَّا قَضَيْتَ وَيُسَلِّمُوا تَسْلِيمًا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;But no by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) a judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 4:65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed,, Allah ordered that women must put on the Hijab (6)<a href="https://wp.me/p1VJ3-d3v">.</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (سبحانه و تعالى) says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">وَقُل لِّلْمُؤْمِنَاتِ يَغْضُضْنَ مِنْ أَبْصَارِهِنَّ وَيَحْفَظْنَ فُرُوجَهُنَّ وَلَا يُبْدِينَ زِينَتَهُنَّ إِلَّا مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا ۖ وَلْيَضْرِبْنَ بِخُمُرِهِنَّ عَلَىٰ جُيُوبِهِنَّ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things) and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts, etc.) and not to show off their adornment except what must (ordinarily) appear thereof, that they should draw their veils over their <em>Juyubihinna</em> </span>(7)<span style="color:#008000;">.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 24:31).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah considered the dazzling display of beauty an act of ignorance:</p>
<h3>وَقَرْنَ فِي بُيُوتِكُنَّ وَلَا تَبَرَّجْنَ تَبَرُّجَ الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ الْأُولَىٰ</h3>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And stay in your houses and do not display yourselves like that of the times of <em>Jahiliyeeyah</em></span>(8)<span style="color:#008000;"> (ignorance). &#8220;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 33:33)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He<a href="https://wp.me/p1VJ3-d3v">,</a> Most Glorified, says:</p>
<h3> وَإِذَا سَأَلْتُمُوهُنَّ مَتَاعًا فَاسْأَلُوهُنَّ مِن وَرَاءِ حِجَابٍ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ أَطْهَرُ لِقُلُوبِكُمْ وَقُلُوبِهِنَّ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And when you ask the Prophet&#8217;s wives for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 33:53)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above Ayah (verse) does not apply only to the Prophet&#8217;s wives but to all of the believing women. Carefully read the following saying of Allah (سبحانه و تعالى):</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ قُل لِّأَزْوَاجِكَ وَبَنَاتِكَ وَنِسَاءِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ يُدْنِينَ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِن جَلَابِيبِهِنَّ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ أَدْنَىٰ أَن يُعْرَفْنَ فَلَا يُؤْذَيْنَ ۗ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies (i.e. screen themselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the way). That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be annoyed.</span> (9) (Qur&#8217;an 33:59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The woman (i.e. any woman) is <em>A&#8217;wrah</em> (10)&#8221;, that is she must be covered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(4) <em>Subhanahu Wata&#8217;ala</em>, Most Glorified and Most High is He.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(5) صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم: <em>Salla Allahu Alaihi Wassalam</em>: May the <em>Salat</em> and Salaam (Peace) of Allah be upon His Prophet Muhammad</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(6)This is not something cultural. It is Allah&#8217;s order. Its conditions are not Arabian, Egyptian, Pakistani, Black or White American, etc. Its conditions are specified in the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah to provide a protection and safeguarding of women. No one knows about what is good for men and women more than their Creator, Allah. His laws are Wise as it is the case with all of His actions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(7) <em>Juyubihinna</em>: The respected scholars from <em>As-Salaf As-Saleh</em> (righteous predecessors) differed whether the veil cover of the body must include the hands and face or not. Today, respected scholars say that the hands and face must be covered. Other respected scholars say it is preferable for women to cover their whole bodies.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(8) <em>Jahilyeeyah</em>: The days of ignorance prior to the Revelation of the Qur&#8217;an.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(9) No one can ignore the molestation of women that exists in the so called &#8220;open&#8221; societies. The question is: why it is happening? The answer begins to shape up when people think about the purpose behind creation. Allah created us for the single purpose of worshipping Him alone. He detailed all the ways to fulfill this purpose in the Last Revelation to all mankind, the Qur&#8217;an. In it we can find how women and men can safeguard their dignity, honor, and morality. The worship of Allah is manifested in the following of His orders. Allah orders that men and women must avoid all the roads that lead to animalistic ways of living. The Hijab is one of Allah&#8217;s commands. It is an honor and protection for women as well as a true freedom for her body from the hands and eyes of aggressors and molesters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(10) This hadeeth is narrated by Abdullah bin Masoud and collected by At-Tirmidhi who said it is <em>Hassan-Ghareeb</em> i.e. good and <em>Ghareeb</em> (The <em>Ghareeb</em> is a narration by one narrator either in each level of the levels of the chain of narrators or in some levels of the chain). Also As-Suyouti hinted that it is authentic.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(2) THE HIJAB IS <em>IFFAH</em> (MODESTY):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) made the adherence to the Hijab a manifestation for chastity and modesty:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ قُل لِّأَزْوَاجِكَ وَبَنَاتِكَ وَنِسَاءِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ يُدْنِينَ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِن جَلَابِيبِهِنَّ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ أَدْنَىٰ أَن يُعْرَفْنَ فَلَا يُؤْذَيْنَ ۗ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies (i.e. screen themselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the way). That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be annoyed.</span> (Qur&#8217;an 33:59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the above Ayah there is an evidence that the recognition of the apparent beauty of the woman is harmful to her. When the cause of attraction ends, the restriction is removed. This is illustrated in the case of elderly women who may have lost every aspect of attraction. Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) made it permissible for them to lay aside their outer garments and expose their faces and hands reminding, however, that it is still better for them to keep their modesty:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">وَالْقَوَاعِدُ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ اللَّاتِي لَا يَرْجُونَ نِكَاحًا فَلَيْسَ عَلَيْهِنَّ جُنَاحٌ أَن يَضَعْنَ ثِيَابَهُنَّ غَيْرَ مُتَبَرِّجَاتٍ بِزِينَةٍ ۖ وَأَن يَسْتَعْفِفْنَ خَيْرٌ لَّهُنَّ ۗ وَاللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And as for women past child-bearing who do not expect wed-lock, it is no sin for them if they discard their (outer) in such a way as not to show their adornment; but it is best to be modest and Allah knows and sees all things provided they do not make a display of their beauty; but it is best to be modest and Allah knows and sees all things.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 24:60)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how about young women? Clearly they must stay modest find not display their beauty.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(3) THE HIJAB IS TAHARA (PURITY)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) had shown us the Hikma (Wisdom) behind the legislation of the Hijab:</p>
<h3> وَإِذَا سَأَلْتُمُوهُنَّ مَتَاعًا فَاسْأَلُوهُنَّ مِن وَرَاءِ حِجَابٍ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ أَطْهَرُ لِقُلُوبِكُمْ وَقُلُوبِهِنَّ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And when you ask them (the Prophet&#8217;s wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen, that is purer for your hearts and their hearts.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 33:53)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hijab makes for greater purity for the hearts of believing men and women because it screens against the desire of the heart. Without the Hijab, the heart may or may not desire. That is why the heart is more pure when the sight is blocked (by Hijab) and thus the prevention of <em>fitna</em> (evil actions) is very much manifested. The Hijab cuts off the ill thoughts and the greed of the sick hearts:</p>
<h3> تَخْضَعْنَ بِالْقَوْلِ فَيَطْمَعَ الَّذِي فِي قَلْبِهِ مَرَضٌ وَقُلْنَ قَوْلًا مَّعْرُوفًا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease (of hypocrisy or evil desire for adultery, etc.) should be moved with desire, but speak in an honorable manner.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 33:32)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(4) THE HIJAB IS A SHIELD</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Allah, Most High, is Ha&#8217;yeii </strong>(11)<strong>, Sit&#8217;teer </strong>(12)<strong>, He loves Haya&#8217; (Bashfulness) and Sitr (Shielding; Covering)&#8221;</strong>(13).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Any woman who takes off her clothes in other than her husband&#8217;s home (to show off for unlawful purposes). has broken Allah&#8217;s shield upon her&#8221;</strong> (14)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hadeeth demonstrates that depending upon the kind of action committed there will be either reward (if good) or punishment (if bad).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(11) <strong>Ha&#8217;yeii</strong>: Allah is Bashful: He does not unravel the acts of disobedience by His slaves. They openly disobey Allah while they are in need of Him, yet He (being <em>Ha&#8217;yeii</em>) is ashamed of humiliating them leaving the door of repentance opened for them. If, however, they become arrogant and persist on the spread of evil, and disobedience, Allah certainly is All-Just in His infliction of punishment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(12) <strong>Sit&#8217;teer</strong>: Allah is <em>Sit&#8217;teer</em>: He provides means that shield against the uncovering of disobedient acts. The slaves commit acts of disobedience while Allah is providing them with many of His favors. He (سبحانه و تعالى) gives the opportunity for each one of us to return to Him in repentance and to seek His forgiveness. He loves those who do not like the spread of sin. He dislikes the Muslim who publicizes his acts of sin and disobedience. He loves the Muslim who does not unravel the sins of his brother in Islam while at the same time calls him to repent. The Hijab is something beloved by Allaah because it is a shield against the spread of evil manifested in the display of beauty to strangers.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(5) THE HIJAB IS TAQWAH (RIGHTEOUSNESS)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) says:</p>
<h3>يَا بَنِي آدَمَ قَدْ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكُمْ لِبَاسًا يُوَارِي سَوْآتِكُمْ وَرِيشًا ۖ وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَىٰ ذَٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O Children of Adam! We have bestowed raiment upon you to cover yourselves (screen your private parts, etc.) and as an adornment. But the raiment of righteousness, that is better.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 7:26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The widespread forms of dresses in the world today are mostly for show off and hardly taken as a cover and shield of the woman&#8217;s body. To the believing women, however, the purpose is to safeguard their bodies and cover their private parts as a manifestation of the order of Allah. It is an act of <em>Taqwah</em> (righteousness ).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(6) THE HIJAB IS <em>EEMAN</em>(BELIEF OR FAITH)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) did not address His Words about the Hijab except to the believing women, Al-Mu&#8217;minat:</p>
<h3>وَقُل لِّلْمُؤْمِنَاتِ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And say (O Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) to the believing women.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 24: 31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another Ayah Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) also says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ قُل لِّأَزْوَاجِكَ وَبَنَاتِكَ وَ<span style="color:#008000;">نِسَاءِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</span> يُدْنِينَ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِن جَلَابِيبِهِنَّ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ أَدْنَىٰ أَن يُعْرَفْنَ فَلَا يُؤْذَيْنَ ۗ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And the believing women&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 33: 59).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A&#8217;isha (<em>Radiya Allahu anha</em>)(15)) the wife of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), addressed some women from the tribe of Banu Tameem who came visiting her and had light clothes on them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;If indeed you are believing women, then truly this is not the dress of the believing women, and if you are not believing women, then enjoy it.&#8221;</strong>(16)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(7) THE HIJAB IS <em>HAYA</em>&#8216; (BASHFULNESS)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Each religion has a morality and the morality of Islam is haya&#8217; (bashfulness).&#8221;</strong> (17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Bashfulness is from belief and belief is in Al-Jannah (Paradise).&#8221;</strong>(18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, he (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Bashfulness and belief are fully associated together if one is lifted the other follows suit.&#8221;</strong> (19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The mother of the believers, A&#8217;isha said: &#8220;I used to enter the room where the Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and my father were later buried in without having my garment on me, saying it is only my husband and my father&#8221;. But when Umar (<em>radi Allaahu anhu</em>) was later buried in (the same place), I did not enter the room except that I had my garment on being shy from Umar (<em>radi Allaahu anhu</em>).&#8221;(20) The Hijab fits the natural bashfulness which is a part of the nature of women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(17) Related by Imam Malik in his &#8220;Mu&#8217;wata&#8221; (2: 905-Arabic). The hadeeth chain is Mursal i.e. the chain of narrators is disconnected at one point or another. For example to say: &#8220;On the authority of A, on the authority of B, on the authority of C that the Prophet said &#8220;&#8230;.&#8221; . The hadeeth is Mursal if for example C did not hear directly from the Prophet. In the case of the above hadeeth, Ibin Habban connected the chain by two ways of narrators, both of them are weak.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(18) collected by At-Tirmidhi who said it is: &#8220;a good and authentic hadeeth&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(19) Narrated by Abdul&#8217;lah bin Umar as Related by Al-Hakim in his &#8220;Mustadrak&#8221; (1/22-Arabic) who said: &#8220;it is a good and authentic Hadeeth…..&#8221; and Al-Thahabi confirmed Al-Hakim on this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(20) As-Simt Ath&#8217;ameeen Fee Maniqib Ummahat Ul-Mu&#8217;mineen, p.91:A Book by Ibn As-Sakir that represents a collection of the great attributes of the Mothers of Believers (The wives of the Prophet-صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). AlHakim reported a similar narration and said that it is &#8220;good according to the conditions of Imam Bukhari and Imam Mulslim&#8221;, noting that both Imams did not discuss the chain of narration itself. Al- Thahabi had no comment about Al-Hakim&#8217;s narration.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hijab fits the natural feeling of <em>Gheerah</em> which is intrinsic in the straight man who does not like people to look at his wife or daughters. <em>Gheerah</em> is a driving emotion that drives the straight man to safeguard women who are related to him from strangers. The straight Muslim man has <em>Gheerah</em> for all Muslim women. Many in the world had lost this great moral aspect. In response to lust and desire men look (with desire) at other women while they do not mind that other men do the same to their wives or daughters! In &#8220;free&#8221; societies you see men sitting with strange women who are half-naked &#8220;enjoying&#8221; the scene! They introduce their wives to other strange men. Mutual looks here and there! Affairs develop and phone calls are exchanged. &#8220;Love affairs&#8221; destroys many families and children suffer most. What kind of &#8220;love&#8221; is this? The mixing of sexes and absence of Hijab kills the <em>Gheerah</em> in men. The eyes &#8220;eat up&#8221; other men and women! The inner &#8220;justification&#8221; is: since I can look they can look. It&#8217;s a &#8221; free choice&#8221;!! Few are those who feel anything when they discover their wives have &#8220;affairs&#8221;. They become numb!! No dignity ! No honor! The bottom line is that in many societies of this modern World the animalistic behaviors are becoming very apparent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ali (<em>radi Allaahu anhu</em>) said: &#8220;It was related to me that you women used to crowd the Kuffar (disbelieving men) from the non-Arabs in the markets; don&#8217;t you have <em>Gheerah</em>? There is no good in the one who does not have <em>Gheerah</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam considers <em>Gheerah</em> an integral part of faith .The dignity of the wife or daughter or any other Muslim woman must be highly respected and defended.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(1) COVERING ALL OF THE BODY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This respected author is in agreement with the position that the face and hands of the woman must be covered as he has detailed this in discussions of the Hijab issues in his book: &#8220;The Return of the Hijab, Part 3&#8221;. Some scholars say it is permissible to uncover the face and the hands of the woman as long as there is no <em>fitna</em> (infatuation) caused by her or inflicted upon her. They see that if: a) she is beautiful and beautifies her face and hands with external substances, and b) the society around her is corrupt where men do not lower their gaze, then it is prohibited for her to uncover her face and hands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(2) THE HIJAB MUST NOT BE A DISPLAY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hijab itself must not be a display. Allah ordained it so as to cover the beauty of women and not for show off. He (سبحانه و تعالى) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And not to show of their adornment except only that which is apparent.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 24: 31)</p>
<h3>وَقَرْنَ فِي بُيُوتِكُنَّ وَلَا تَبَرَّجْنَ تَبَرُّجَ الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ الْأُولَىٰ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And stay in your houses and do not display yourselves like that of the times of ignorance.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 33:33)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not logical that the Hijab itself be a source of display.(41)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(41) Some women put on attractive covers on their heads. This is against the purity of the Hijab and its essence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(3) THE HIJAB MUST NOT BE TRANSPARENT</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The purpose must be achieved. In order for the Hijab to be a cover, it must not be made of transparent material making the woman covered only by name(!) while in reality she is naked.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;In the latest part of my Ummah (nation of Muslims) there shall be women who would be naked in spite of being dressed, they have hair high like the humps of the <em>Bukht</em> camel, curse them, for they are cursed&#8221;</strong>(42).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) added in another hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;They will not enter <em>Al-Jannah</em> and would not perceive its odor, although its fragrance can be perceived from such and such distance</strong>.(43)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates that a woman could cause herself a grave and destructive sin if she puts on a garment that is thin and transparent and which clearly shapes her body&#8217;s features.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(42) At-Tabarani reported it and Al-Albani in his book &#8220;Al-Hijab&#8221; said it is authentic.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(43) At-Tabarani related this hadeeth in &#8220;Al-Mu&#8217;jam As-Sagheer&#8221; p.232 and Al-Albani said it Saheeh as in his book &#8220;The Hijab&#8221; p.56. As-Suyouti related on behalf of Ibin Abdul&#8217;Barr that: &#8220;The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) intended women who put on light clothes that shows off and shapes the body descriptions. In reality they are naked although they have clothes on them! &#8220;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(4) HIJAB MUST BE ROOMY, FLOWING AND NOT TIGHT</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hijab is a safeguard against Fitna. If tight, it will be descriptive of the woman&#8217;s body and this violates the purpose of Hijab.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Usaama Bin Zaid (رضي الله عنه) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) dressed me with a thick Qubtyeeyah (cotton dress from Egypt) which was a gift that he received from Duhia Al-Kalbi. So I gave it to my wife to wear. He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said : &#8220;What made you not to wear the Qubtyeeyah?&#8221; I said: &#8220;I dressed my wife with it. &#8221; He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: &#8221; <strong>Order her to put an undergarment (or gown) under it, because I am afraid it may describe the size of her bones</strong>.(44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(44) Reported by Ad&#8217;Diya&#8217; Al-Maqdissi, Imam Ahmed, At-Tabarani, AlBaihaqi, and Ibn Sa&#8217;d. It is also reported that Al-Haithami said: &#8220;amongst the chain of narrators is Abdullah Ibn Aqeel whose narrations are good; yet according to some scholars there is Da&#8217;eef (weakness) associated with him, and that the rest of narrators are Thuqat (men of confidence regarding reporting). Ad-Dahabi said: &#8221; the level of Abdullah Ibn Aqeel&#8217;s narration is not below the rating of &#8220;good&#8221; (In Meezan AlI&#8217;tidal: Measure of Balanced (verifications); Arabic).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(5) THE HIJAB MUST NOT BE PERFUMED WITH INCENSE</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Any woman who perfumes herself and passes by some people that they smell her scent, then she is a Zaniyah (prostitute).&#8221;</strong>(45)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(45) Related by Imam Ahmed, An-Nissa&#8217;ee, and Al-Hakim who said: &#8220;it has an authentic chain of narration&#8221; and Ad-Dahabi agreed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(6) THE HIJAB SHOULD NOT RESEMBLE MEN&#8217;S DRESS</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Women who assume the manners of men are not from us and also those of men who assume the manners of women.&#8221;</strong>(46)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu-Huraira (رضي الله عنه) narrated that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The prophet </strong>(صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)<strong> cursed the man who wears the dress of a woman and the woman who wears the dress of a man.&#8221;</strong> (47)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(46) Reported by Imam Ahmed and Abu Na&#8217;eem. Al-Albani authenticated it in his book &#8220;Al-Hijab&#8221; (PP 66-67).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(47) Related by An-Nissa&#8217;ee, Imam Ahmed, Ibn Khuzayemah, Ibn Hab&#8217;ban and authenticated by the scholar Ahmed Shakir.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(7) THE HIJAB MUST NOT RESEMBLE THE GARMENTS OF THE KUFFAR</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The one who takes the similitude (manner) of a certain people becomes one of them.&#8221; </strong>(49)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullah bin Umar (رضي الله عنه) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) saw me wearing two clothes dyed in saffron, whereupon he said: these are the clothes (usually worn) by the Kuffar, so do not wear them.&#8221;</strong> (50)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(49) Related by Abu Dawoud, Ahmed (as part of a another hadeeth), Ibn Taymeeyah said that the hadeeth has a good chain of narration (i.e. that reported by Abu Dawoud) and that it is a &#8220;good hadeeth&#8221;; As-Suyouti said :&#8221;it is &#8220;Hassan: Good&#8221; and Ibn Hajar reported it in &#8220;<em>Fath Al-Bari</em>&#8221; and supported it with another evidence (a <em>Murssal</em>) with a good chain of narration.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(50) Saheeh Muslim, V. 3, hadeeth # 5173</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(8) THE HIJAB IS NOT FOR FAME!</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The one who wears a garment designed for a worldly fame, Allah will make him wear a garment of humiliation on the Day of Resurrection then he will be set ablaze.&#8221;</strong> (51)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The garment of fame is any garment a person wears to make him/her look famous. This applies whether the garment is highly precious and shows admiration to the life of this world or if it is chosen of a low quality to show lack of interest to this worldly life. The person may put on clothes with distinct colors so as to draw attention, act proudly and/or arrogantly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(51) Related by Abu Dawoud, Ibn Majah, and Al-Munthari said that it is <em>hassan</em> (good) as well as Ibn Muflih. Imam As-Shawkani said: &#8220;The narrators of the chain are <em>Thuqat</em>&#8221; and Al-Alabni reported in his book &#8220;Al-Hijab&#8221; p. 110 that it is <em>hassan</em> .</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(9) WATCH FOR &#8220;CONCEALED&#8221; WAYS OF DISPLAY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Examining the various conditions about the Hijab one can clearly recognize that many of the young Muslim women are not fulfilling these conditions. They consider what they put on now, wrongly as &#8220;Hijab&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The enemies of the Islamic revival wanted to destroy it in its infancy by oppression and cruelty. Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) defeated their plots and held the believing men and women steadfast in their obedience of Him (سبحانه و تعالى). The enemies of Islam realized that they should deal with the Islamic revival in a wicked way in order to sway this revival away from its course towards Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They started to spread innovated forms of &#8220;Hijab&#8221; as a &#8220;midway&#8221; solution by which the Muslim woman can &#8220;please&#8221; Allah (they claim so!) and at the same time &#8220;accommodate&#8221; her society and preserve her &#8220;beauty&#8221; and &#8220;glamour&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The modern &#8220;boutique&#8221; stores were declining in their trade due to the widespread use of the true Islamic Hijab. Suddenly, the markets were flooded with altered forms of <em>Tabar&#8217;ruj</em> under the name &#8216;modern/contemporary Hijab&#8217;. In the beginning this was protested and women were cautious. A group of &#8220;displaying women&#8221; who were embarrassed with the Islamic Hijab rushed towards the &#8220;contemporary Hijab&#8221; to &#8220;relief&#8217; themselves from the pressing social realities caused by the spread of Hijab. With time the phenomenon of &#8220;concealed display&#8221; became widespread and known as &#8220;contemporary Hijab&#8221;. Women friendly to this course think they are the best of girls and best of wives while in fact they are as one poet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>If they relate to the Hijab</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#808000;"><strong> It is the relation of an intruder</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So! O women of this kind be mindful to Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) and His Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and do not be deceived by those who may &#8220;bless&#8221; this action of yours and conceal their true intentions. Do not be deceived and let your response be: &#8221; I am better than those who are in a complete state of display!&#8221; There is no excuse to follow the evil. Know that the fire of Hell has different lower levels while Paradise has different higher levels. So it is proper to follow your sisters who truly adhere to the Islamic Hijab and its conditions. Aim high towards the highest levels of Al-Jannah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been related that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Look at those who stand at lower levels than you (regarding worldly wealth) and those who stand at higher levels than you in religion (adherence to faith). for this would not make the favors (conferred upon you by Allah) insignificant (in your eyes).&#8221;</strong> (52)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Az-Zohri reported (53) that Ummar Ibn Al-Khatab (رضي الله عنه) recited the saying of Allah (سبحانه و تعالى):</p>
<h3>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ قَالُوا رَبُّنَا اللَّهُ ثُمَّ اسْتَقَامُوا تَتَنَزَّلُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمَلَائِكَةُ أَلَّا تَخَافُوا وَلَا تَحْزَنُوا وَأَبْشِرُوا بِالْجَنَّةِ الَّتِي كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily those who say: &#8220;Our Lord is Allah (Alone), and then they stood straight (i.e. they believed in the Oneness of Allah and worshipped none but Him (Alone) and obeyed Him for all that He ordered them) on them the angels will descend (at the time of their death) (saying); &#8220;Fear you not, nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of <em>Al-Jannah</em> which you have been Promised!)</span> (Qur&#8217;an 41:30).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;They, by Allah, followed the straight path of Allah by obeying Him and did not dodge like wolves.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hassan Al Basri, may Allah&#8217;s Mercy be upon him, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">&#8220;If Shaytan (Devil) looks and finds you continuously adhering to the obedience of Allah he will seek you (i.e. check you) one time after the other. If he finds that you are still holding, he becomes weary of you and rejects you. But if you adhere one time and you do not another, then he becomes covetous: he wants to have you for himself.&#8221;</span> (54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So come on to a straight path that has no crookedness and a guidance that has no misleading ways in it, and to an honest repentance that has no disobedience in it:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">وَتُوبُوا إِلَى اللَّهِ جَمِيعًا أَيُّهَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And turn you all together to Allah (and beg Him) to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 24:31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(52) The origin of this hadeeth was reported in Saheeh Al-Bukhari in the Book of Riqaq and Muslim in the Book of Az-Zuhd V.4, hadeeth # 7070, P 1530, and At-Tirmidhi in the Book of Qiyamah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(53) Reported by Imam Ahmed and Ibn Al-Mubarak. Imam Ahmed reported it in the Book of Az-Zuhd p. 115 and 110, respectively.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(54) Reported by Ibn Al-Mubarak in his book &#8220;<em>Az-Zuhd</em>&#8221; p. 7 # 20</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THE HONEST MUSLIM</strong> receives the order of Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) and hastens to manifest his love to Islam into action and listens to and obeys the Sunnah of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). He does not give attention to the lost and misleading ways of the masses of human beings who do not realize their awaiting destiny. Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) negated the existence of belief in those who turn away from Him and from His Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) saying:</p>
<h3>وَيَقُولُونَ آمَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَبِالرَّسُولِ وَأَطَعْنَا ثُمَّ يَتَوَلَّىٰ فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُم مِّن بَعْدِ ذَٰلِكَ ۚ وَمَا أُولَٰئِكَ بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ</h3>
<h3>وَإِذَا دُعُوا إِلَى اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ لِيَحْكُمَ بَيْنَهُمْ إِذَا فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُم مُّعْرِضُونَ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;They (hypocrites) say: &#8220;We have believed in Allah and in the Messenger (Muhammad-صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), and we obey&#8221;, then a party of them turn away thereafter, such are not believers. And when they are called to Allah (i.e. His Words-the Qur&#8217;an) and His Messenger to judge between them, lo! a party of them refuse to come and turn away.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 24: 47-48 )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand:</p>
<h3>إِنَّمَا كَانَ قَوْلَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ إِذَا دُعُوا إِلَى اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ لِيَحْكُمَ بَيْنَهُمْ أَن يَقُولُوا سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا ۚ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ</h3>
<h3>وَمَن يُطِعِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَيَخْشَ اللَّهَ وَيَتَّقْهِ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْفَائِزُونَ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The saying of the faithful believers when they are called to Allah (His Words-the Qur&#8217;an) and His Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) to judge between them is only that they say: &#8216;We hear and we obey.&#8217; And such are the successful (who will live for ever in <em>Al-Jannah</em>).&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 24: 51-52)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Safiyyah, the daughter of Shayebah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;While we were at A&#8217;isha&#8217;s (<em>radi Allahu anha</em>) we mentioned the women of Qureish and their good favors, then A&#8217;isha said: &#8220;indeed the women of Qureish have a good favor and by Allah I have not seen better than the women of Al-Ansar in their strength of acceptance of the Book of Allah and in the belief in the Revelation: At the time when Surat An-Nur was sent down (and in it Allah says): &#8220;<strong>Let them (believing women) draw their veils over Juyubihinna</strong>.&#8221; soon their husbands turned to them reciting what Allah had sent down to them (i.e. the above Ayah), the man recites to his wife, his daughter, his sister and to every female relative. Not a single woman of them except that she took up her engraved <em>Mirt</em> (55) (wrapper) and covered her head and face in acceptance and belief in what Allah had sent down from His Book. The next morning they were behind the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), covered as if black crows were on top of their heads.&#8221; (56)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, there is no choice but to submit the order of Allah and no hesitation should exist in following the ruling of Allah. So come for repentance, O My Muslim Sister, and watch for words like &#8220;<strong>I will repent, I will pray, I will cover with Hijab</strong>&#8220;, because delaying the repentance is a sin that you must repent from! Say as Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) said on the tongue of Moosa (May Allah&#8217;s peace be upon him) :</p>
<h3>عَجِلْتُ إِلَيْكَ رَبِّ لِتَرْضَىٰ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;I HASTENED TO YOU, O MY LORD, TO PLEASE YOU&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 20:84)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And say as the believing men and women said:</p>
<h3> سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا ۖ غُفْرَانَكَ رَبَّنَا وَإِلَيْكَ الْمَصِيرُ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;WE HEAR AND WE OBEY. (WE SEEK) YOUR FORGIVENESS, OUR LORD, AND TO YOU IS THE RETURN&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 285)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(55) With pictures of houses and dwellings.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;">(56) Reported in The <em>Tafseer</em> of Al-Qur&#8217;an Al-Ath&#8217;eem by Ibn Katheer 5:90 (Arabic)</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(1) TABARRUJ IS A DISOBEDIENCE TO ALLAH &amp; HIS MESSENGER</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who disobeys Allah and his Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) can only harm himself and cannot in any way harm Allah. The Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2018/03/05/the-disgrace-of-tabarruj-display-of-womans-charm/">:</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;All of my followers will enter <em>Al-Jannah</em> except those who refuse.&#8221; They said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! Who will refuse? &#8221; He said, &#8220;Whoever obeys me will enter <em>Al-Jannah</em>, and whoever disobeys me is the one who refuses (to enter it).&#8221;</strong> (21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported that Mu&#8217;awiyah (رضي الله عنه) gave a sermon in Humss (Syria) and mentioned that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) prohibited seven things and that he (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) named <em>Tabarruj</em> as one of them (22).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;oud (رضي الله عنه) reported that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) &#8220;Used to dislike ten kinds of behavior and he (Abdullah) mentioned amongst them: &#8220;<strong><em>Tabarruj</em> by means of displaying beautification in an improper place</strong>.&#8221;(23). Imam As- Suyouti, may Allah&#8217;s mercy be upon him, said: &#8220;<em>Tabarruj</em> by displaying beautification is showing off to strangers and this is disliked. This is the explanation of &#8220;an improper place.&#8221; It is not so if the beautification is done for the husband<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2018/03/05/the-disgrace-of-tabarruj-display-of-womans-charm/">.</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(21) Saheeh Al-Bukhari (English-Arabic, Dar Al-Arabia, Publ. Beirut,Lebanon), V.9, hadeeth # 384, p.284</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> (22) Related by Imam Ahmed in his Mussnad 4/101-Arabic.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> (23) Related by An-Nissa&#8217;ee in his &#8221; Sunan &#8220;Arabic 8/141.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(2) TABARRUJ IS A GRAVE DESTRUCTIVE SIN</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umay&#8217;mah, the daughter of Ruqay&#8217;ah came to the Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) to acknowledge the message of Islam and that he (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) is the Messenger of Allah. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) told her:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;I give my acknowledgment that you must not set partners to worship besides Allah and that you don&#8217;t steal or commit fornication and adultery, that you don&#8217;t kill your child, that you don&#8217;t commit any falsehood before your hands and between your legs, that you don&#8217;t wail, and that you don&#8217;t make <em>Tabarruj</em> like that of <em>Jaahiliyyah</em>&#8220;</strong> (24).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is clear that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) associated <em>Tabarruj</em> with grave destructive sins<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2018/03/05/the-disgrace-of-tabarruj-display-of-womans-charm/">.</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(24) Related by Imam Ahmed in his &#8220;<em>Mussnad</em>&#8221; 2/196. The scholar Ahmed Shaker, may Allah&#8217;s Mercy be upon him, said : &#8220;Its chain of narration is good&#8221;. He also said that Ibn Katheer in his &#8220;<em>Tafseer</em> :Explanation of the Qur&#8217;an 8: 327-328&#8243; mentioned this hadeeth saying, &#8220;its chain of narration is good&#8221; and he related it to At-Tirmidhi, An-Nissa&#8217;ee and Ibin Majah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(3) TABARRUJ BRINGS THE CURSE AND EXPULSION FROM THE MERCY OF ALLAH</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;There shall be, in the latter part of my nation, women who are dressed but </strong>(in fact)<strong> naked, on their heads are humps like those of <em>Bukht</em> </strong>(one kind of camel)<strong>, curse them for they are surely cursed.&#8221;</strong>(25)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(25) At-Tabarani related this hadeeth in &#8220;<em>Al-Mu&#8217;jam As-Sagheer</em>&#8221; p.232 and Al-Albani said it <em>Saheeh</em> as in his book &#8220;The Hijab&#8221; p.56. As-Suyouti related on behalf of Ibn Abdul&#8217;Barr that: &#8220;The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) intended women who put on light clothes that shows off and shapes the body descriptions. In reality they are naked although they have clothes on them! &#8220;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(4) TABARRUJ IS AN ATTRIBUTE OF THE PEOPLE OF HELL</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Of the people of Hell there are two types whom I have never seen, the one possessing whips like the tail of an ox and they flog people with them. The second one, women who would be naked in spite of their being dressed, who are seduced </strong>(to wrong paths)<strong> and seduce others with their hair high like humps. These women would not get into <em>Al-Jannah</em> and they would not perceive its odor, although its fragrance can be perceived from such and such distance.&#8221;</strong> (26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(26) Saheeh Muslim (English-Arabic, Published by Dar Al-Arabia, Beirut. Lebanon) V. 4 hadeeth # 6840 p. 1486.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(5) TABARRUJ IS DARKNESS ON THE DAY OF RESURRECTION</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is related that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The parable of a woman who moves with slow sweeping motion, trailing her beautified clothes, performing not for her husband, is like darkness on the Day of Judgment; she has </strong>(or comes with)<strong> no light&#8221;</strong> (27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(27) Related by Imam At-Tirmidhi in his &#8220;Sunan&#8221; # 1167. Al-Albani said it is a weak hadeeth (See Al-Albani&#8217;s collection &#8220;Ad-Da&#8217;eefah&#8221; (Collection of Weak Hadeeths) # 1800. Abu Bakr Bin Arabi, may Allah&#8217;s Mercy be upon him, said: &#8220;At-Tirmidhi related this hadeeth and said it is weak but its meaning is correct because the &#8220;enjoyment&#8221; in disobedience is in fact torture and suffering……&#8221;. The meaning indicates that this type of women will come on the Day of Judgment Blackened in darkness as if she physically originated from darkness. In contrast, what appears to be difficult and painful in performance of obedient acts, is a true enjoyment because of the reward awaiting those who obey Allah and His Messenger e.g. the odor of the mouth of a fasting Muslim may not be pleasant in this world. To Allah, however, it is better than the odor of Musk because the Muslim had obeyed Allah and performed what is due upon him from fasting. Similarly the woman wearing her Hijab may be looked upon as &#8220;reactionary, old fashioned, a walking tent! etc.&#8221; She is the winner on the Day of Judgment and those who mock her put themselves on a dangerous road. They may be subjected to the wrath of Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(6) TABARRUJ IS NIFAQ (HYPOCRISY)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The best of your women is the affectionate , the fertile (in productivity), the propitious (favorable), the consultative if they fear Allah. The Most evil of your women are the <em>Mutabar&#8217;rijat</em> (those who do <em>Tabarruj</em>), the <em>Mutakhayelat</em> (who strut/swagger), and they are the hypocrite ones. Those who enter <em>Al-Jannah</em> are like the Cough Crow.&#8221;</strong> (28)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Cough Crow has a red beak and red legs. This is an expression of metonymy indicating that few women enter Heaven because this kind of crow is rare.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(28) Reported by Al-Baihaqi in &#8220;As-Sunan&#8221; V.7 p.82. Also reported by Abu Na&#8217;eem in &#8220;Al-Hiliyah&#8221; V. 8, p. 376 with a reference to Abdullah bin Masoud (رضي الله عنه) as the narrator. See also Al-Albani&#8217;s &#8220;Chain of Authentic Hadeeths &#8211; Arabic&#8221; # 1849 and 632.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(7) TABARRUJ IS DISGRACEFUL</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Any woman who takes off her clothes in other than her husbands home </strong>(to show off for an unlawful purpose)<strong>, has broken the shield between her and Allah.&#8221;</strong> (29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Al- Man&#8217;nawi, may Allah have Mercy upon him, said: &#8220;The saying of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) &#8216; any woman who takes off her clothes in other than her husbands home&#8217; means showing off her beauty to strangers by taking off her shield of clothes. She &#8220;has broken the shield between her and Allah&#8221; because Allah had said:</p>
<h3>يَا بَنِي آدَمَ قَدْ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكُمْ لِبَاسًا يُوَارِي سَوْآتِكُمْ وَرِيشًا ۖ وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَىٰ ذَٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O children of Adam! We have bestowed raiment upon you to cover yourselves (screen your private parts etc.) and as an adornment. But the raiment of righteousness, that is better.&#8221;</span>(Qur&#8217;an 7:26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a woman does not fear Allah and uncover her private parts then she is breaking the shield between her and Allah, Most High. And because she uncovered and dishonored herself and committed a treason with her husband, Allah will uncover her shield, she will be in a scandal&#8230; &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(29) Related by Imam Ahmed and Al-Hakim in his &#8220;<em>Mustadrek</em>&#8221; (Arabic) V.4, p.288 who said it is <em>Saheeh</em> (authentic) according to the conditions of Muslim and Al-Bukhari, and Ad-Dahabi agreed as well as Ibin Majah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(8) TABARRUJ IS AN UNCHASTE AND DISGRACEFUL SIN</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The woman is <em>A&#8217;wrah</em>, All of her body is not to be shown (30). To wear the clothes that show off and shapes her body features is disgraceful and Allah  orders His slaves to stay away from disgraceful sins:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">وَإِذَا فَعَلُوا فَاحِشَةً قَالُوا وَجَدْنَا عَلَيْهَا آبَاءَنَا وَاللَّهُ أَمَرَنَا بِهَا<br />
قُلْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَأْمُرُ بِالْفَحْشَاءِ ۖ أَتَقُولُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;When they commit a <em>Fahisha</em> (evil deed, going round the <em>Ka&#8217;ba</em> in naked state as in the times of <em>Jahilyeeyah</em>, every kind of unlawful sexual intercourse etc.), they say: &#8216;We found our fathers doing it and Allah has commanded us of it.&#8217; Say: &#8220;Nay, Allah never commands of <em>Fahisha</em>. Do you say of Allah what you know not?&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 7:28)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is <em>Shaytan</em> (Satan) who orders such disgraceful sins. Allah  says:</p>
<h3><strong>الشَّيْطَانُ يَعِدُكُمُ الْفَقْرَ وَيَأْمُرُكُم بِالْفَحْشَاءِ</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;<em>Shaytan</em> threatens you with poverty and orders you to commit sins.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 268)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Mutabar&#8217;rijah</em> is a sinful virus that spreads disgraceful sins amongst the Muslim society. Allah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يُحِبُّونَ أَن تَشِيعَ الْفَاحِشَةُ فِي الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَالْآخِرَةِ ۚ وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنتُمْ لَا تَعْلَمُونَ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily, those who like, that (the crime of) illegal sexual intercourse should be propagated among those who believe, they will have a painful torment in this world and in the Hereafter. And Allah knows and you know not.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 24:19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tabarruj is a leading cause for the spread of <em>Zina</em> (illegal sexual intercourse).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(30) See footnote # 7.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(9) TABARRUJ IS A SATANIC WAY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The story of Adam and his wife demonstrates how the enemy of Allah, Satan, was so covetous to incite them to show their private parts in order to spread evil and disgraceful sins. It also shows that the <em>Tabarruj</em> of women is a primary goal for <em>Shaytan</em> to achieve. Allah says:</p>
<h3>يَا بَنِي آدَمَ قَدْ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكُمْ لِبَاسًا يُوَارِي سَوْآتِكُمْ وَرِيشًا ۖ وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَىٰ ذَٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O children of Adam! We have bestowed raiment upon you to cover yourselves (screen your private parts etc.) and as an adornment. But the raiment of righteousness, that is better.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 7:26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is clear that Satan is the one who established the call for <em>Tabarruj</em> and show off and that he is the leader of those &#8220;leaders&#8221; who call for the &#8220;liberation of women&#8221;. Satan is the &#8220;Imam&#8221; of everyone who obeys and follows him in disobedience to Allah (The Most Merciful), especially those <em>Mutabar&#8217;rijat</em> who harm the Muslims and deceive their youth. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;I have not left after me any (chance) of turmoil more harmful to men than the harm done to the men because of women</strong>.(31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Adam forgot, made a mistake, repented and asked forgiveness from Allah and Allah the Oft-Forgiving accepted Adam&#8217;s repentance. The struggle between Adam&#8217;s off-springs and Shaytan continues. The devil still whispers to drive us , men and women, to disobey Allah and follow sin. There is no safeguard except in the return to Allah in good faith and repentance, remembering Allah, asking His help to overcome lust and desire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(31) Saheeh Muslim (English translation; published by Dar Al-Arabia) V. 4, hadeeth # 6603, p. 1431</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(10) TABARRUJ IS THE WAY OF JEWS</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jews have an important role in the destruction of nations through the <em>Fitna</em>. (seduction/temptation) of women. The spread of <em>Tabarruj</em> is an effective weapon of their widespread establishments. They have an extensive experience in this field. One should look around only to see who runs Hollywood and famous Houses of &#8220;Fashions&#8221; and &#8220;Magazines&#8221; as well as the world of advertisement!. R-rated, X-rated movies and clothes are widespread. In fact the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Watch out for this worldly life (safeguard yourselves from its temptations); avoid the allurement of women: verily, the first trial for the people of Israel was caused by women.</strong> (32)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their Books also testify to this fact. In the Third Chapter of Isaiah ( 16, 17):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Lord said: &#8220;Because the daughters of Zion are haughty and walk with necks outstretched ogling and mincing as they go, their anklets tinkling with every step. The Lord shall cover the scalps of Zion&#8217;s daughters with scabs, and the Lord shall bare their heads.&#8221; Furthermore, &#8220;On that day the Lord will do away with the finery of the anklets, sunbursts, and crescents; the pendants, bracelets, and veils; the headdresses, bangles, cinctures, perfume boxes, and amulets; the signet rings, and the rose rings; the court dresses, wraps, cloaks, and purses; the mirrors,..&#8221; (Isaiah, 3, 18-23; The New American Bible).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Although the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) warned against mimicking the <em>Kuffar</em> (non-believers) and their ways, especially the ways of women. Many Muslims do not abide by this warning (33). This is a testimony for the prophecy of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;You would tread the same path as was trodden by those before you inch by inch and step by step so that if they had entered into the hole of a <em>Dhab</em> </strong>(a desert lizard)<strong>, you would follow them in this also. We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, do you mean Jews and Christians </strong>(by your words)<strong>&#8221; those before you&#8221;? he said: Who else (than those two religious groups).</strong> (34)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The similarity of those women who disobey Allah and his Messenger to the Jews is very evident because their response to Allah&#8217;s commands was similar to that of the Jews:</p>
<h3>قَالُوا سَمِعْنَا وَعَصَيْنَا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;We have heard and disobeyed&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 93)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is unlike the response of the believing women:</p>
<h3>َقَالُوا سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;We hear and we obey.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 285)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They remember the saying of Allah:</p>
<h3>وَمَن يُشَاقِقِ الرَّسُولَ مِن بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ الْهُدَىٰ وَيَتَّبِعْ غَيْرَ سَبِيلِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ نُوَلِّهِ مَا تَوَلَّىٰ وَنُصْلِهِ جَهَنَّمَ ۖ وَسَاءَتْ مَصِيرًا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger (Muhammad صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) after the right path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers&#8217; way, We shall keep him in the path he has chosen and burn him in Hell; what an evil destination!&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 4: 115)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(32) Ibid, footnote # 31; Hadeeth # 6606, p.1432</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(33) It is sad to see many who dislike the Kuffar in certain ways imitate them in their ways of living thinking that their materialistic progress could not be achieved except in acting, dressing, eating, jogging, sleeping ..like them. The true Muslim, however, remembers that any progress must meet the purpose for our presence on earth: all action must be related to the worship of Allah. The Kuffar have taken some of the means which Allah had created and used it for worldly gains. We are ordered to make the means adhere to the purpose of our creation: the worship of Allah Alone and thus uses the means to defend Islam and Muslims and secure the needs of life as well. Why should some of us dress the way Allah ordered and some does not? Should we choose Allah&#8217;s way or the Kuffar way? All the success is measured by one criterion: does it meet the pleasure of Allah or not?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(34) A famous and Saheeh hadeeth reported by Al-Bukhari, Muslim and others. The text here is as reported in Saheeh Muslim V. 4, hadeeth # 6448, p.1403</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(11) TABARRUJ IS A FILTHY JAHILYEEYAH (IGNORANCE)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says:</p>
<h3>وَقَرْنَ فِي بُيُوتِكُنَّ وَلَا تَبَرَّجْنَ تَبَرُّجَ الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ الْأُولَىٰ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And stay in your houses and do not display yourselves like that of the times of ignorance&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 33:33)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) described the times of ignorance as filthy and wicked and ordered us to reject it. Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) described the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) as :</p>
<h3>يُحِلُّ لَهُمُ الطَّيِّبَاتِ وَيُحَرِّمُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْخَبَائِثَ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;He allows them as lawful <em>At-Tayyibat</em> (all i.e. good and lawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods, etc.), and prohibits them as unlawful <em>Al-Khaba&#8217;ith</em> (all i.e. evil and unlawful as regard things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods, etc.)&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 7: 157)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The call to bring about the times of Jahilyeeyah is similar to the call for Tabarruj, both of which are wicked ways that the Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) made unlawful. He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Verily! every matter of Jahilyeeyah is under my feet!&#8221;</strong> (35)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tabarruj and all forms of Jahilyeeyah such as false pride and haughtiness, ill thoughts about Allah, call for falsehood, setting up rivals with Allah, ruling by other than the laws of Islam, usury, etc., are all included.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(35) Related by Abu Dawoud, At-Tirmidhi, Ibin Majah, and Ad-Darime&#8217;i and Imam Ahmed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(12) TABARRUJ IS AN ANIMAL ACT, RETARDATION (DECADENCE) AND DECLINE</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To reveal and expose are natural behaviors of animals. Whenever man inclines towards such behaviors he starts his decline to a level lower than the level of manhood which Allah had bestowed upon him. Allah bestowed a natural inclination (<em>Fitrah</em>) towards covering, preservation, and safeguarding modesty. To consider the acts of display, exposition, and uncovering as acts of beauty reflects a corruption to the <em>Fitrah</em> and a degeneration in taste and a sign of decadence and decline.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The progress of man&#8217;s civility is linked to his/her covering of the body. The Hijab cover is fitting to the instinct of <em>Gheerah</em> which draws its strength from the soul. The so called &#8220;liberation from the chains of covering&#8221; is an instinct that draws its strength from lust which incites <em>Tabarruj</em> and mixing of the sexes. The one who is satisfied with this latter instinct must sacrifice the first one in order to silence the voice of the innate <em>Gheerah</em> in his heart in return for the &#8220;enjoyment&#8221; of <em>Tabarruj</em> and mixing. From this we understand that the <em>Tabarruj</em> is a sign of corruption of <em>Fitrah</em>, lack of bashfulness, <em>Gheerah</em>, and insensitivity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(13) TABARRUJ IS A DOOR TO WIDESPREAD EVIL</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who carefully examines the Islamic Texts (Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah) and the lessons of history, becomes convinced about the evils of <em>Tabarruj</em> and its harm, both on religious and worldly matters especially when it is associated with the mixing of sexes. Some of its underlying consequences are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Competition amongst the Displaying Women in Showing Off their Beauty. This is seduction, and it leads to the spoiling of morality and leaves women as merchandise articles exhibited for anyone to look at.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Corruption of the Morality of Men, Especially the Youth and Those in Adolescence. It pushes them to commit various kinds of sins (36).</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Destruction of Family Ties and Causing a Lack of Trust Between Family Members and the Spread of Divorce.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Commercial Abuse of Women In The World of Advertisement, Entertainment And Other Areas As Well.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Doing Harm to Women by Declaring Their Ill Intentions and Evil Conscience Thus Rendering Her Venerable To Harm By The Wicked And The Insolent.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Spread of Diseases.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Sins didn&#8217;t spread in any particular nation until they openly conduct it and as a result, plague and other illnesses that were not present among their predecessors became widespread amongst them.&#8221;</strong> (37)</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Facilitates The Sin of <em>Zina</em> (Fornication) By The Eye.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The adultery of the eyes is the lustful look. .&#8221;</strong> (38)</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><em>Tabarruj</em> Makes it Difficult to Lower The Gaze.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Justifiably Brings Down Allah&#8217;s Punishment</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The punishment of Allah is more severe than atomic bombs and earthquakes. Allah  says:</p>
<h3>وَإِذَا أَرَدْنَا أَن نُّهْلِكَ قَرْيَةً أَمَرْنَا مُتْرَفِيهَا فَفَسَقُوا فِيهَا فَحَقَّ عَلَيْهَا الْقَوْلُ فَدَمَّرْنَاهَا تَدْمِيرًا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And when We </span>(39)<span style="color:#008000;"> decide to destroy a town (population), We (first) send a definite order (to obey Allah and be righteous) to those among them [or We (first) increase in number those of its Population] who are given the good things in this life. Then, they transgress therein, and thus the word (of torment) is justified against it (them). Then We destroy it with complete destruction.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 17: 16)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;When people see wrong </strong>(or evil)<strong> and they don&#8217;t change it, then it is imminent that the punishment of Allah will fall upon them.</strong> (40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(36) You may have seen teen-age kids on the corners of many streets in Europe and in North America rooming around, smoking to get high, half naked, and on drugs looking to engage in sex. Why? What happened? Many try to hide from the hard facts! The drive for lust and materialistic life became the &#8220;god&#8221; of the new generations: the Pepsi-Michael-MTV- Jackson generations. The result: AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(37) Part of a lengthy hadeeth related by Ibin Majah, Abu Na&#8217;eem, and Al- Hakim who said: &#8220;it has a good chain of narrators&#8221;. Ad-Dahabi agreed to Al-Hakim&#8217;s report.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(38) Saheeh Muslim V.4, hadeeth # 6421 p. 1397</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(39) &#8220;We&#8221; Plural Pronoun: Is used to stress the Greatness and Power of Allah Who is One. It is common with Semitic languages for any Monarch to use Plural Pronoun. It is also used by members of the Royal Family in England. To Allah, however, belong the Highest and most Perfect Example.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[42] Question: What is the ruling concerning a woman cutting some of her hair?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer: With regard to a woman cutting her hair, then one must look into the motive behind her doing it. So if a woman cuts her hair in imitation of the disbelieving or sinful women, then it is not permissible for her to cut it while having this intention. As for cutting only a small portion from her hair or cutting it in accordance to the desires of her husband, then I do not see anything preventing this from being done.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported in Saheeh Muslim (no. 320) that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The Prophet&#8217;s wives used to cut their hair to the point that it would reach the earlobes.&#8221;</span></em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: <em>silsilat ul-hudaa wa nnoor – </em>the series of guidance and light &#8211; tape no. 697</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question #3: “Is it allowed for the woman to put on make-up if she leaves her house wearing the<em> hijaab</em>?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh al-Albaani </em>(<em>rahimahullaah</em>) answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>It is not permissible for the woman who does not wear <em>hijaab</em>, let alone who wears <em>hijaab</em>, to use the makeup of the disbeliever, the make-up of the rebellious and disobedient (to Allaah). </strong>When were you aware of some women’s adornment called by a name for which Allaah did not send down an authority: ‘make-up’? This is a word that we don’t know, not us nor your forefathers from before. Rather, it is a foreign word expressing an adornment for the rebellious and disobedient women of Europe; and our women – except those of them whom Allaah protects – unfortunately imitate decorating themselves with this adornment which the Islamic society is being affected by, namely make-up. So it is not permissible for the woman. And this reality is one of the strange ironies: in the road we see a woman wearing a decent <em>hijaab</em> (but) I don’t say the Islamically legislated <em>hijaab</em>; she ties what they call the ‘<em>ishaarb</em>’ – or <em>khimaar</em> which is the (correct) Arabic word – covering her hair, her neck and so on, but she has face powder and lipstick on. This (wearing the <em>hijaab</em>) is against this (wearing make-up): two contradictory, conflicting matters that do not go together. What is the reason (for this type of occurrence)? It is one of two things: either ignorance and heedlessness of the Islamically legislated ruling or it is due to the women’s following of the whisperings of <em>shaytaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, we firstly remind the women who suffer from this make-up. Then secondly, we remind the guardians of women such as a father or a husband or a brother, due to the fact that (the Prophet) (<em>‘alayhi ssalaat wa ssalaam</em>) said: ‘Everyone of you is a shepherd and everyone of you is responsible for his flock. So the man is a shepherd and he is responsible for his flock-’[1] to the end of the<em>hadeeth</em>. Thus, the Arabic or general proverb states: ‘The horse is from the horseman.’ So you, the husband of the woman, it is not permissible for you to allow her to go out in this manner which puts to trial the middle-aged men, let alone the young men! And you, O man, O father, O brother, are supposed to be very jealous. Why? Because the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa aalihi wa sallam</em>) used to say: ‘<strong>A <em>duyyooth </em>will not enter Paradise</strong>.’[2] Why? Who is a <em>duyyooth</em>? He is the one who does not guard his womenfolk jealously.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaikh Saalih Al-Fawzaan</strong> was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“What is your advice to the male guardians of certain women that are lax when it comes to the issue of the Hijaab and who are engrossed in exposing their alluring bodily features to male-strangers in the markets and other places? What is the role of a woman’s male guardian in safeguarding her Religion?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So he replied: </strong></p>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah says: <b>‘Men are the protectors and maintainers of women because Allaah has favored some of them (i.e. men) over others (women).’</b> [Surah An-Nisaa: 34] Allaah has enabled and entrusted men to take care of and be responsible for women. And He commanded the women to obey Him and forbade them from disobeying Him. This includes the Hijaab.The Hijaab is one of Allaah’s commandments. So therefore it is an obligation on her male-guardian to require her to wear it, regardless is he is her direct male-guardian such as her father, son, brother or someone who has guardianship over her, or if he is the general guardian, such as the Muslim ruler who may mandate the Muslim women to wear the Hijaab.</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Muslim ruler may oblige the women of his country to wear the Hijaab, in the general sense, while the male guardians in charge of households may oblige the women who live in their homes to wear the Hijaab (in the specific sense). They are responsible for these women. If the women knew that the general ruler in charge of her affairs as well as her specific male-guardian oblige her to obey Allaah and abandon disobeying Him, she would not put up any resistance in these matters. But when the male-guardians show laxity in these matters, the women become audacious. And there are callers to evil, lewdness, and hypocrisy behind them who encourage them to unveil and take off the Hijaab.</p>
<p>So the matter today is dangerous. It is incumbent upon a woman’s male guardians – both the general and the specific ones – to assist and aid one another in obliging the women to abide by the Hijaab. It is also an obligation upon the male guardians, may Allaah grant them correctness, to silence the tongues of those who invite to evil and corruption – those who call to unveiling and to the removal of the Hijaab. This is what Allaah has entrusted them with.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Removing all things that prevent Water from Reaching the Skin</strong>:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:justify;">This means that a person must remove everything covering the body parts he washes during ablution that would prevent water from reaching his skin. This applies to those who work with <strong>paint</strong>. If this substance sticks hard onto the body parts they wash during ablution to the point that water cannot reach the skin, one is obligated to take it off by using paint remover before performing ablution.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:justify;">This also applies to <strong>nail polish</strong>, which women put on their nails. They must remove this from their nails before performing ablution. A Muslim woman must remove this nail polish whenever she intends to perform ablution or ritual bathing, i.e. ghusl from sexual impurity. She may use this nail polish in her home afterward depending on whether she agrees with her husband that it is a means of beautification and adornment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Enjoining certain Manners so that the Mothers of the Believers may be an Example; and the Prohibition of Tabarruj</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tafsir Ibn Kathir</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the good manners which Allah enjoined upon the wives of the Prophet so that they would be an example for the women of the Ummah to follow. Allah said, addressing the wives of the Prophet that they should fear Allah as He commanded them, and that no other woman is like them or can be their equal in virtue and status. Then Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَلاَ تَخْضَعْنَ بِالْقَوْلِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(then be not soft in speech,) As-Suddi and others said, this means, do not be gentle in speech when addressing men. Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَيَطْمَعَ الَّذِى فِى قَلْبِهِ مَرَضٌ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(lest he in whose heart is a disease should be moved with desire,) means, something unclean.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَقُلْنَ قَوْلاً مَّعْرُوفاً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(but speak in an honorable manner.) Ibn Zayd said: &#8220;Decent and honorable talk that is known to be good.&#8221; This means that she should address non-Mahram men in a manner in which there is no softness, i.e., a woman should not address a non-Mahram man in the same way that she addresses her husband.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَقَرْنَ فِى بُيُوتِكُنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And stay in your houses,) means, stay in your houses and do not come out except for a purpose. One of the purposes mentioned in Shari`ah is prayer in the Masjid, so long as the conditions are fulfilled, as the Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«لَا تَمْنَعُوا إِمَاءَ اللهِ مَسَاجِدَ اللهِ وَلْيَخْرُجْنَ وَهُنَّ تَفِلَات»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Do not prevent the female servants of Allah from the Masjids of Allah, but have them go out without wearing fragrance.) According to another report:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«وَبُيُوتُهُنَّ خَيْرٌ لَهُن»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(even though their houses are better for them.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلاَ تَبَرَّجْنَ تَبَرُّجَ الْجَـهِلِيَّةِ الاٍّولَى]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and do not Tabarruj yourselves like the Tabarruj of the times of ignorance,) Mujahid said: &#8220;Women used to go out walking in front of men, and this was the Tabarruj of Jahiliyyah.&#8221; Qatadah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلاَ تَبَرَّجْنَ تَبَرُّجَ الْجَـهِلِيَّةِ الاٍّولَى]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and do not Tabarruj yourselves like the Taburruj of the times of ignorance,) &#8220;When they go out of their homes walking in a shameless and flirtatious manner, and Allah, may He be exalted, forbade that.&#8221; Muqatil bin Hayyan said:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(and do not Tabarruj yourselves like the Tabarruj of the times of ignorance,) &#8220;Tabarruj is when a woman puts a Khimar on her head but does not tie it properly.&#8221; So her necklaces, earrings and neck, and all of that can be seen. This is Tabarruj, and Allah addresses all the women of the believers with regard to Tabarruj.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(and perform the Salah, and give Zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger.) Allah first forbids them from evil, then He enjoins them to do good by establishing regular prayer, which means worshipping Allah alone with no partner or associate, and paying Zakah, which means doing good to other people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأَطِعْنَ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and obey Allah and His Messenger.) This is an instance of something specific being followed by something general.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fatwa no. 21778</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: The habit of lightening eyebrows has recently spread among women; they lighten the hairs below and above the eyebrow, so that it resembles Nams (removing hair from the face/eyebrows). This habit is an imitation of Western countries. The lightening substance is also medically harmful. What is the ruling of Shari`ah (Islamic law) on this deed? Please advise. May Allah reward you! It is worth mentioning that most women request a written Fatwa (legal opinion issued by a qualified Muslim scholar), and refuse to abide by verbal ones. May Allah make us benefit from it and preserve the religion of this Ummah (nation based on one creed). Indeed, He is the One able to do so.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">It is not permissible to lighten above and below the eyebrows in the way that was mentioned, as it entails changing Allah’s creation and resembles Nams which is prohibited, being in the same sense. It is even more prohibited if it entails imitation of non-Muslims, or if it is harmful to the body or hair. This is because Allah (Exalted be He) says: <span style="color:#008000;"><em>…and do not throw yourselves into destruction</em></span> The Prophet (peace be upon him) also said: “<em><span style="color:#008000;">There should be neither harming nor reciprocating harm.”</span></em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Wearing coloured contact lenses</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling regarding wearing coloured contact lenses with the justification (for doing so) being for beautification and following the latest trend (fashion), keeping in mind that their price is no less than 700 (Saudi) Riyals (approximately £120)?</span></p>
<p><strong>Response</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no harm in wearing contact lenses due to necessity; As for other than that, then it is better to leave doing so especially if they are expensive, since this equates to being excessive in (spending one’s wealth) which is prohibited, in addition to that which exists therein of deceit and covering up the reality because they make the eyes appear in other than their natural state without there being a (Islaamically justifiable) need for that.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Some methods of adornment are available in our markets, such as <strong>artificial nails</strong>, <strong>false eyelashes</strong>, and <strong>colored contact lenses</strong> to change the eye color. There are many inquiries about such cosmetics, due to their being widespread among women. Please, Your Eminence, we would like you to guide us to the right thing. May Allah safeguard you with His Guidance!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is impermissible to wear artificial nails, false eyelashes, and colored contact lenses, because they are harmful to the body, and they also entail deception and changing the creation of Allah (Exalted be He). May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling regarding women cutting their hair? Some women beautify themselves in this way even if they are single. Where is the limit? What is the ruling on side parting?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn Bâz</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not allowed for the women to cut the hair. Their hair is their beauty. When they cut it, they subject the hair to disfigurement and an uneven hair.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the hair were to be really long, it is then allowed to cut the ends. It has been confirmed that the prophet’s (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) wives did it after his death. If the hair gets really long, she then may do so since she experiences difficulties with the washing and combing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for side parting, it is not allowed. It is an imitation of women that are Mumîlât Mâmilât.</p>

<p><strong>The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta&#8217;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Question 3: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling on a woman parting her hair on the side, making only one braid, or wearing it in a bun, with the intention of making herself beautiful for her husband or to look good because it suits her?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to <strong>parting the hair on the side</strong>, this involves imitating the Kafir (disbelieving) women, and it is proven that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said it is Haram (prohibited) to imitate the Kafirs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to <strong>gathering the hair and letting it hang down on the back</strong>, either braided or not, there is nothing wrong with that so long as it is covered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, <strong>making it into a bun (on top of the head)</strong> is not permitted, because that is an imitation of Kafir women and it is Haram to imitate them. The Prophet (peace be upon him) warned against that when he said: &#8220;<span style="color:#666699;">There are two types amongst the denizens of the Fire whom I have not seen yet: Men having whips like the tails of cows with which they flog people, and women who would be naked in spite of their being dressed, who seduce others (to wrong paths) and are being seduced; their heads will appear like the humps of the Bactrian camels inclined to one side. These (women) would not enter Jannah (Paradise) nor perceive its odor, even though its odor can be perceived at such and such (very remote) distance.</span>&#8221; (Related by Ahmad and Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the legal decision on the decorations and ornaments where the Glorious Name &#8220;Allah&#8221; and the name of the Prophet &#8220;Muhammad&#8221; are engraved? I work in business and I have dealings with some Muslim brothers in some countries. They want to know whether the Glorious Name &#8220;Allah&#8221; should be written on the right side and the name &#8220;Muhammad&#8221; on the left side or not?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">You will find three forms attached to this letter which I want to ask about. Is it permissible to imprint them on the excellent crystal and other ornaments? Please, advise. May Allah reward you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;">A: It is not permissible to write <strong>&#8220;In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful&#8221;</strong> on ornaments and other decorative items, for the phrase &#8220;In the name of Allah, Most Gracious,Most Merciful&#8221; is an Ayah. To write it on such things exposes it to humiliation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;">Also, it is not permissible to write the <strong>Glorious Name &#8220;Allah&#8221;</strong> on such things, because this may expose it to humiliation. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;">Likewise, <strong>the name of the Prophet</strong> (peace be upon him) should not be imprinted on these things to protect it from degradation and prevent the overestimation prohibited by the Prophet (peace be upon him).</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The interpretation of this verse that it refers to<strong> eyebrow-plucking, tattooing, teeth-filing, and hair extensions</strong>, has come to us in a hadeeth: &#8220;The Prophet  cursed the woman who plucks eyebrows and the one who has her eyebrows plucked; the woman who extends hair and has her hair extended; and the woman who tattoos and has herself tattooed.&#8221;</span> [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A <strong>Naamisah</strong> is someone who plucks the hair from the eyebrows with either a scissor or a razor blade or by removing it using any other method by which eyebrow hair is removed. This is what is known as an-nams (eyebrow-plucking) which the Prophet cursed any woman that did it. A Mutanammisah is a woman that asks for her eyebrows to be plucked. She is also cursed based on the statement of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are women that have been afflicted by this crime of plucking the eyebrows based on their following of the disbelieving women, lewd sinful women and ignorant women that do not care about disobeying Allaah and His Messenger . Then after they remove their eye-brows, they bring a color dye and draw lines in its place. O, how perfect Allaah is from all imperfections!! Are dyes better than eyebrows? Are they better than what Allaah has created?! This is altering Allaah&#8217;s creation. So it is not permissible for a Muslim woman to follow these evil practices and immoral customs, and change Allaah&#8217;s creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A <strong>Waashimah</strong> is a woman that draws tattoos, which is done by either sticking needles into the skin or slicing open the skin to the point that bloods comes out and putting in its place some dye or coloring until there remains green lines either on her hand or her face. This is washam, i.e. tattooing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Mustawshimah is a woman that requests that this be done to her. This is a form of changing and altering Allaah&#8217;s creation. By Allaah, which of the two is better ­ the color of the skin, which Allaah created, or this deformed color?? Rather it is blind-following and obedience to the Devil in what he orders:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And indeed I will order them to alter the creation of Allaah.&#8221; [Surah An-Nisaa: 119]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A <strong>Waasilah</strong> is a woman that attaches another set of hair to her own hair. This is deceptive and misleading. An example of it is when a woman puts on a wig or she adds pieces of hair to her own hair to the point that someone will think that this is how her hair is, when in fact it is someone else&#8217;s hair and not from herself. This woman is a Waasilah and she as well as the one who asks for this to be done to her are both cursed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, <strong>al-washar</strong> means: Filing and making gaps in the teeth. &#8220;The Prophet cursed the women that make gaps between their teeth for beauty.&#8221; [16].This refers to the women that file their teeth and place gaps between them, thinking that this is from beauty when in fact it is obedience to the Devil. Washar is unlawful. As for fixing one&#8217;s teeth if there are defects in them and they need to be fixed, then there is nothing wrong with this since it is a form of treatment or a means of removing a deformity. As for teeth that do not have any flaws or disease, then it is not permissible for a woman to apply any form of filing, placing of gaps, and so on to them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Women Wearing Hijab And Make-up In Public: Two Conflicting Contradictions In Islam &#8211; Shaykh Albanee </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="font-family:times;">source: silsilat ul-hudaa wa nnoor &#8211; the series of guidance and light &#8211; tape no. 697</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">maa shaa Allaah this is truly a much needed clarification of the ruling on makeup, about which many are unaware. shaykh al-albaani (rahimahullaah) advises both women and men in this regard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question #3: “Is it allowed for the woman to put on make-up if she leaves her house wearing the<em> hijaab</em>?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh al-Albaani </em>(<em>rahimahullaah</em>) answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>It is not permissible for the woman who does not wear <em>hijaab</em>, let alone who wears <em>hijaab</em>, to use the makeup of the disbeliever, the make-up of the rebellious and disobedient (to Allaah). </strong>When were you aware of some women’s adornment called by a name for which Allaah did not send down an authority: ‘make-up’? This is a word that we don’t know, not us nor your forefathers from before. Rather, it is a foreign word expressing an adornment for the rebellious and disobedient women of Europe; and our women – except those of them whom Allaah protects – unfortunately imitate decorating themselves with this adornment which the Islamic society is being affected by, namely make-up. So it is not permissible for the woman. And this reality is one of the strange ironies: in the road we see a woman wearing a decent <em>hijaab</em> (but) I don’t say the Islamically legislated <em>hijaab</em>; she ties what they call the ‘<em>ishaarb</em>’ – or <em>khimaar</em> which is the (correct) Arabic word – covering her hair, her neck and so on, but she has face powder and lipstick on. This (wearing the <em>hijaab</em>) is against this (wearing make-up): two contradictory, conflicting matters that do not go together. What is the reason (for this type of occurrence)? It is one of two things: either ignorance and heedlessness of the Islamically legislated ruling or it is due to the women’s following of the temptations of <em>shaytaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, we firstly remind the women who suffer from this make-up. Then secondly, we remind the guardians of women such as a father or a husband or a brother, due to the fact that (the Prophet) (<em>‘alayhi ssalaat wa ssalaam</em>) said: ‘Everyone of you is a shepherd and everyone of you is responsible for his flock. So the man is a shepherd and he is responsible for his flock-’[1] to the end of the <em>hadeeth</em>. Thus, the Arabic or general proverb states: ‘The horse is from the horseman.’ So you, the husband of the woman, it is not permissible for you to allow her to go out in this manner which puts to trial the middle-aged men, let alone the young men! And you, O man, O father, O brother, are supposed to be very jealous. Why? Because the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa aalihi wa sallam</em>) used to say: ‘<strong>A <em>duyyooth </em>will not enter Paradise</strong>.’[2] Why? Who is a <em>duyyooth</em>? He is the one who does not guard his womenfolk jealously.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the response to what the <strong>Sheikhah Umm Abdillah Al-Waad&#8217;eeyah</strong>, may Allah preserve her, had when a flyer was shown and translated to her, for a <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>sisters beauty and spa</strong> </span>gathering in the west. The request was made to the sister Umm Abdillah Al-Britaaniyah, may Allah preserve her, to ask the Sheikhah about this issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The response from the Sheikhah:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praises are due to Allah. And may the prayer and peace be upon the Messenger of Allah (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). I bear witness that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah alone without any partners, and I bear witness that Muhammad (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is his slave and messenger. To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Firstly, it is upon every Muslim woman to know that Allah has made it obligatory upon her to remain at home. As He has said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَقَرْنَ فِي بُيُوتِكُنَّ وَلَا تَبَرَّجْنَ تَبَرُّجَ الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ ٣٣:٣٣</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And stay in your homes (Oh you women) and do not display your adornments or beauty like the days of Ignorance&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the foundation, however if it becomes necessary for her to leave her home then there is no objection. Provided that she leaves for a reason permitted by the legislation of Al-Islaam. This is because of the speech of the Prophet:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">قد أنِنَ الله لكُنَّ أنْ تُخْرُجْنَ لِحَوائِجِكُنَّ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed it has been permitted for you (women) to leave your homes&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected in the Saheeh of Imaam Muhammad bin Ismaa&#8217;eel Al-Bukhaari #5237</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, if she leaves her home then it is likewise obligatory upon her to wear Al-Hijaab in a well-mannered fashion with modesty. As for a woman leaving her home to such events mentioned in the question, then it includes wasting time. Also, it is from resembling the disbelieving women, which is forbidden. The Prophet (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">من تشبَّهَ بِقومٍ فهو منهم</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever resembles a people then he is from them&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated from Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar Collected in the Musnad of Imaam Ahmad Vol. 2 page 50 and Graded Hasan by Imaam Al-Albaani</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also includes polishing the nails with nail polish. This act as a barrier against water when performing ablution. And whatever does this is prohibited. Except in the case of the menstruating woman. It also includes the women taking a bath or relaxing in water for hours. This legislatively is called &#8220;الحمامات&#8221; (Spas) and is prohibited (for women) because of the Hadeeth narrated by &#8216;Aaisha. She reported that the Prophet (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">أيُّما امرَأةٍ وَضَعَتْ ثِيابَها في غَيرِ بيتِ زَوْجِها, هَتَكَتْ ما بينَها و بينَ اللهِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Which ever woman takes off her clothing in other than her husband&#8217;s house then she has indeed ripped the protection between her and Allah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Hadeeth is Saheeh collected in the Musnad of Imaam Ahmad</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So to summarize, it is not permissible to attend such events because of the contradictions to the legislation of Al-Islaam it presents. Such as wasting time and spending a lot of money without a justified reason. Also, I add to this subject that perhaps the women maybe caused to expose her Awrah this is because the beautician may seek to treat her whole body or most of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">لا يَنظُرُ الرَّجل أِلى عَوْرَةِ الرَّجل, و لا المَرْأَةُ أِلى عَوْرَةِ المَرْأةِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;No man should look at another man&#8217;s &#8216;awrah, nor should a woman look at another woman&#8217;s &#8216;awrah&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected in the Saheeh of Imaam Muslim bin Al-Hajjaaj # 766. Narrated on the authority of Abi Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudri</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And perhaps it maybe a male beautician in which the prohibition and sin is far greater.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So stay far away from this oh Muslimaat. May Allah grant you all success with that. Accustom yourselves to staying in your homes and beware of resembling the disbelieving women because verily this leads to having amity (friendship, love, etc.) for the disbelieving women and love of resembling them inwardly. That is in relation to their belief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, I advise you all to leave those lands that oppress its people and to have adherence upon this Haneef religion. And Allah is the one who grants success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al praises are due to the Lord of all existence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;</p>
