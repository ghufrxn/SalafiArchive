<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">31-Ruling on making Du&#8217;a&#8217; the dead</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: What is the ruling on those who make Du&#8217;a&#8217; (supplication) to the dead?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ans by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who make Du`a&#8217; (supplication) to the dead are Mushriks (those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). If they make Du&#8217;a&#8217; to the dead, idols, trees, stones, angels or jinn, they will be regarded as Kafirs (disbelievers) as making Du&#8217;a&#8217; to all these leads to one thing; namely, Kufr (disbelief that takes the Muslim out of Islam),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One thing that can be excluded from this ruling which is seeking help from his fellow Muslim brother or non-Muslim like buying a commodity from a non-Muslim, asking him to build a shop or mend a car while the person while he is alive. This case is considered to be exceptional and is not a kind of Shirk. It is similar to what Allah (Exalted be He) mentions in the story of Musa (Moses): <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(The man of his own) party asked him for help against his foe)</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one asks his fellow Muslim brother or the non-Muslim, who is present, to do something for him like building a house, mending the car, or plowing the land in return for something, or they agree upon doing something that is legally permitted, there will be nothing wrong as all these things are normal and can be done by human beings who are alive and present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But what is Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect) is making Du&#8217;a&#8217; to those who are not present and cannot hear him, the dead or a living person whom he thinks to be supernatural and has a mysterious power. This understanding leads him to think that if he makes Du&#8217;a&#8217; to this person for forgiveness and admittance to paradise, he will be able to do this because of something secret about this person. This is Munkar even if the person who is invoked besides Allah (Exalted be He) is living.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Sufis who worship their Shaykhs and their senior and prestigious persons who are dead. They ask them for help and make Du&#8217;a&#8217; to them to cure the sick. All these things are considered to be major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) <strong>even if the person whom they make Du`a&#8217; to is alive because they ask him something beyond his abilities</strong>. This behavior differs from asking a person to lend you something, build a house for you, cultivate some land, mend a car, bring your belongings from the car, and so on. All these things are normal and contain there is nothing wrong in them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"></p>



<p>On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (<em>radi Allaahu anhu</em>) who said:&nbsp;The Messenger of Allah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,&nbsp; “Verily Allah <em>ta’ala</em> has said:</p>



<p><span style="color: #008000">‘Whosoever shows enmity to a <strong><a style="color: #008000" href="https://abdurrahman.org/category/islam/awliya/"><em>wali</em></a> </strong>(friend) of Mine, then I have declared war against him. And My servant does not draw near to Me with anything more loved to Me than the religious duties I have obligated upon him. And My servant continues to draw near to me with <em>nafil</em> (supererogatory) deeds until I Love him. When I Love him, I am his hearing with which he hears, and his sight with which he sees, and his hand with which he strikes, and his foot with which he walks. Were he to ask [something] of Me, I would surely give it to him; and were he to seek refuge with Me, I would surely grant him refuge.’</span> ”</p>



<p>[Bukhari]</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/how-a-common-person-from-the-people-of-tawheed-defeated-the-scholar-from-grave-worshippers" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/JJkuhC</a><br />
—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [24]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there is nothing than can possibly do without or be independent of Allaah – no angel, nor any heaven nor any earth, nor anyone from the <em>jinn</em> nor anyone from mankind, nor any inanimate object, whether mountains or oceans; everything is dependent upon Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>O mankind! You are the ones who are needy and dependent upon Allaah.  And Allaah, He is the One who is Independent – the One deserving of all praise.</em></span> (Sooratul-Faa<u>t</u>ir (35), <em>aayah </em>15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So everything is dependent upon Him and not upon the <em>awliyaa</em>.  (beloved servants of Allaah) and not upon the heavens.  And whoever says that the <em>awliyaa</em>.  (beloved servants of Allaah) have power and ability which is different to human power and ability, and whoever says that they have some control over the creation and that they benefit and harm, besides Allaah; then this is the saying of the unbelievers and the <em>mu<u>sh</u>riks</em>.  So the <em>awliyaa</em>.  (beloved servants of Allaah), and the Messengers and the angels, have no independence from Allaah and they cannot do anything without Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this nullifies the worship of everything besides Allaah, whether idols or other things.  How can you worship things that are themselves dependent (upon Allaah) and forget the One in whose Hand is the Ownership and the Mastery of everything?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And for this reason one of the scholars from the grave-worshippers, he said to a common person from the people of <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, “You people say that the <em>awliyaa</em>.  (beloved servants of Allaah), they can’t benefit and they can’t bring harm.” So he said, “Yes, we say that they don’t bring benefit and they don’t bring harm.” So he (the grave-worshipper) said, “Does not Allaah, the Most High, say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Do not consider those who are killed in Allaah’s cause as being dead.  Rather, they are alive, with their Lord, being given provision.”</span></em> (Soorah Aal-`Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>169)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So (this man who is only just a regular person) he responded to him and said, “Did Allaah say <strong><em>yurzaqoon</em> </strong>(يُرْزَقون – they are given provision) or did He say <strong><em>yarzuqoon</em> </strong>(يَرْزُقون – they give provision)?” So the man said, “Rather He said, <strong><em>yurzaqoon</em> </strong>(يُرْزَقون – they are given provision) with a <em><u>d</u>ammah</em> on the <em>yaa’</em>” So (the man who is a common person), he said, “In that case I will ask the One who Provides for them and I will not ask them.” So that person of knowledge was defeated in argument by the evidence of this common person who was upon the correct natural disposition.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#752722;" class="has-inline-color">The Transcribed Text from the audio:</span></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم </p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In the name of Allah, The Most Beneficent, The Most Merciful. I testify that there is no true God worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is Allah&#8217;s true slave and messenger. May Allah&#8217;s salah and salaam be upon the noble prophet, the believers of his family and the noble companions and those who follow on their path until the Day of resurrection. I ask Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ‎) to make us from those who follow their path until the Day we meet Him (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ‎) while pleased with us.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">We continue with the discussion on correct creed. What we are going to cover now is correct creed with the respect to karaamaat and the miracles.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">It is from the creed of Ahlul sunnah and from the basic foundations of their creed is to believe in the karaamaat. Karamaat means charisma that occur by the Auliya&#8217;, those righteous who are close to Allah.This forms part of the principles of the creed of Ahlul sunaah.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Who is the Walee? The walee is defined in the Qur&#8217;an: ٱلَّذِینَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَكَانُوا۟ یَتَّقُونَ  These are the auliya&#8217;, those who believe and are pious, complying with the commands of Allah and  are abstaining from his prohibitions, these are Auliya, the friends of Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ‎). These are the righteous who are close to Allah.  This is defined clearly in Surah Yunus in chapter 10 verse 62 and 63. </p>



<p>Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ) says</p>



<p>أَلَاۤ إِنَّ أَوۡلِیَاۤءَ ٱللَّهِ لَا خَوۡفٌ عَلَیۡهِمۡ وَلَا هُمۡ یَحۡزَنُونَ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>&#8220;No doubt verily the Auliya&#8217; no fear shall come upon them&#8221;</strong></p>



<p>Who are they? </p>



<p>Then comes the definition:    </p>



<p><strong>ٱلَّذِینَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَكَانُوا۟ یَتَّقُونَ</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>&#8220;Those who believe in Tawheed and feared Allah much (by abstaining from evil deeds and sins and by doing righteous deeds).&#8221;</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And the karamaah is a matter that transcends the conceivable or customary or natural, Allah makes occur on the hands of one of His auliya&#8217; as He chooses as a help on some religious matter or a worldly matter.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And the karamaah does not reach the level of the miracles, which is to the prophets and the messengers.So all those ordinary occurrences and habits which Allah manifests through the Auliya&#8217; in terms of various knowledges, spiritual experiences, powers, influences, and those that are mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an like in surah al kahf the people of the cave and also regarding former communities and about the initial period of the sahaabah and the successors of this ummah and also those that all exist in this ummah till today and will continue to remain till the Day of Judgement. Allah makes them manifest on the hands of the friends of Allah. The happenings of the karaamaat, the charisma through the followers guidance of Allah&#8217;s messenger is true and these karaamaat as we said is an unusual event which Allah manifests through one of His auliya&#8217; for supporting a mundane or a spiritual matter.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And the difference between karaamaat and miracles, miracles mean mujizat implies that miracles is the claim of prophethood and messengership but karaamaat does not imply this.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And there are a number of points of wisdom and aims in the manifestation of karaamaat and the important among these are as follows:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>(1)</strong> They are like miracles which prove the perfection of the power of Allah and the dominance of His will. They are like miracles in the sense that whatever Allah wills, He is the Greatest performer of it. Allah has an addition to this methods and known causes other methods also which are beyond the access of the human knowledge nor can the human sense organs their reason.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>The story of the people of the cave</strong> (ashabul kahf) is one of such evidences, including that sleep that Allah imposed upon them for a long time along with protecting their bodies from being disintegrated.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Another of these is the <strong>provision being given to Maryam</strong> (alaihassalam), the daughter of &#8216;Imran, in the arches on which zakariya had left astonished and said &#8220;where do you get it from these provisions?&#8221; She said &#8220;from Allah.&#8221;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And likewise the fact Maryam becoming pregnant and the <strong>birth of Jesus alayhis salaam without a father</strong>.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And<strong> talking by Jesus while still in cradle </strong>and this did not occur only with Jesus, meaning there are those who spoke in the cradle other than Jesus as authentically reported in Bukhari and Muslim from the hadith of Abu Huraira (radhiyallaahu anhu) from the prophet (ﷺ) who said that three ones are only who spoke in the cradle, three only, Jesus is one of them.<br /><br />The second one: There was a man amongst the children of Israeel, his name was <strong>Jurayj</strong>, this man was praying one time and his mother came and called upon him, she needed something from him. So he talked to himself “shall I respond or shall I continue the prayers?” So she invoked and said “O Allah! don&#8217;t make him die until he sees the faces of the woman who solicits sex. And while he was in his place of worship a woman came and she talked to him into illegal sexual intercourse and he refused. So she went to a shepherd and asked him for the same thing and she seduced him into that.  She gave birth to a child and she went to say that this is the  child of Jurayj, so the people came to him and broke the door of his place of worship and brought him down, insulted him. So he went to make ablution and prayed to Allah concerning this child from this prostitute.  So He came to the child and talked to the child and said “Who is your father?” The child spoke in the cradle and said “the shepherd”. So everyone was amazed and astonished and they came apologised and said &#8220;we will build your place of worship from gold&#8221; He said &#8220;no, just build it from mud.&#8221;<br /><br />And the third one: one woman was suckling her child and this took place <strong>a woman from children of Israeel</strong>, a man who was on his mount passed by.  So she liked that man and said “O Allah! make my son like him this”, the child left her breast and directed himself towards the rider and said “O Allah! don&#8217;t make me like him” and then he came back to suckle. And Abu Huraira said: while the prophet was reciting the hadeeth to them as if I remember looking at the prophet ﷺ suckling his finger. Then a slave-girl passed by the woman and then she said “O Allah! don&#8217;t make my son like her” he left her breast and said “O Allah! make me like her”  So she talked to her child “why?” and he said that rider was a tyrant from the tyrants and this girl they say that she was a thief, stole certain things and that she committed adultery while she was innocent.<br /><br />So this hadeeth tells us of some of these karaamaat and from this we know that three spoke in the cradle Eesa (alayhis salaam), the child who spoke to Jurayj and this child of this woman from the children of Israeel.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Also from this is the story of the man in surah Al Baqarah whom Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ‎) made him die for a hundred years then resurrected him.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And the story of the three who from the children of Israeel who went to a cave and a huge rock came and blocked the entrance of the cave and they invoked Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ‎) each by his own righteous deed and Allah made the rock move until they had a clearance to leave and save them.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And there are many other instances and that the karaamaat exist in this ummah until Day of resurrection because of it is belief and righteousness.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Now if anyone comes up with an extraordinary matter, transcends the norm this can not be a purification for this person that he is a friend of Allah until his actions refer to the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah and it becomes evident that he is a follower of the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah openly and outwardly manifesting his Worship of Allah in accordance to the Sunnah.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The friends of Allah are true and existing and they have merits as in the hadeeth of Sahih Bukhari: Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ‎) says “<strong>whoever stand in enmity towards any of the auliya&#8217; then he is at war with Him (glorious and exalted be He)</strong>.”</p>



<p>The karaamaat of the auliya&#8217; are in fact the miracles of the prophets, for the auliya&#8217; receive these karaamaat by following the guidance of their prophets and acting accordingly.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The karaamaat of the auliya&#8217;, and now we know the definition of auliya&#8217;, it is that glad tidings in which Allah has given them in the world itself. The Bushra which is called tidings means every such thing which proves their being protectors, supporters, friends and having good end in here and hereafter.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">As we said earlier the karaamaat still exists in the ummah and will be found until the Day of resurrection and observation is the best argument to prove it.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The philosophers have denied the karaamaat of the friends of Allah even as they have denied the miracles of the prophets.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The Mu&#8217;tazila sect and some of Ash&#8217;ari sects have also denied the occurrence of the karaamaat claiming these are like miracles but this is a false claim as we have mentioned that it does not imply a claim of Prophethood in no way.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">One must remain vigilant from the <strong>Dajjal</strong>, the false liars of these innovators and the deeds of the misguided people and satanic show of  extraordinary occurrences who call themselves <strong>sufi</strong>, such as entering into the fire, striking one&#8217;s body with weapons, catching hold of snakes and foretelling about the unseen and so forth.These are not karaamaat. The karaamaat are performed by the auliya&#8217; of Allah and these are not the auliya&#8217; of Allah but these are shayateen in the form of men.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">We ask Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ‎) to protect us from all false Creed and all innovations and to guide the ummah to follow the path of the prophet ﷺ and the righteous predecessors.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left"><strong>Karamat-ul-Awliya’</strong><br />The fourth question of Fatwa no. <span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">9027 </span><br />The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta&#8217;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><b></b><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Q 4:</b><b> Do the Awliya&#8217; (pious people) perform Karamahs (extraordinary events caused by Allah for or through a pious person)? </b>Can they change anything in the heavens or on earth? Do they intercede with Allah for others while they are in Barzakh (period between death and the Resurrection) or not?</span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span class="HarfBody"><b>A: </b><b>Karamah </b>is an extraordinary event which Allah (Exalted be He) bestows on a pious person as an honor to protect him against harm, benefit him, or help him defend people&#8217;s rights. </span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span class="HarfBody">But a pious person cannot perform these events whenever he wishes just as the prophet could not perform miracles by himself whenever he wished. It is Allah Alone Who helps them to do all these things. </span></p>



<p><span class="HarfBody">Allah (Exalted be He) says:</span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:#000000;" title="Surah Al-`Ankabut, 29: 50" target="_blank" name="Andtheysay:Whyarenotsigns"></a>And they say: &#8220;Why are not signs sent down to him from his Lord? Say: &#8220;The signs are only with Allâh, and I am only a plain warner.&#8221;</span></strong></span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span class="HarfBody">Also pious people are not empowered with any superiority to change things in the heavens or on earth except for what Allah enables them just like all other humans. They can make changes in things like farming, building, trading, and such works which ordinary humans do&nbsp;</span><span class="HarfBody">with Allah&#8217;s Will. In Barzakh, pious people cannot intercede for anyone whether alive or dead, as Allah (Exalted be He) says: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Say: “To Allâh belongs all intercession.&#8221;</span></strong></span></p>



<p><span class="HarfBody">Allah also says: </span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span class="HarfBody"><strong><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Zukhruf, 43: 86" target="_blank" name="Andthosewhomtheyinvokeinstead"></a><span style="color:#000000;">And those whom they invoke instead of Him have no power of intercession &#8211; except for those who bear witness to the truth knowingly (i.e. believed in the Oneness of Allâh, and obeyed His Orders), and they know (the facts about the Oneness of Allâh).</span></strong></span></p>



<p><span class="HarfBody">Moreover, He says: </span></p>



<p><span class="HarfBody"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His Permission</span></strong></span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span class="HarfBody">Whoever believes that pious people govern the universe or that they know the Ghayb (Unseen), is a Kafir (disbeliever), as Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody">To Allâh belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is therein, and He is Able to do all things.</span></strong></span></p>



<p><span class="HarfBody">Also Allah (Glorified be He) says:</span></p>



<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:#000000;" title="Surah Al-Naml, 27: 65" target="_blank" name="Say:Noneintheheavensandthe"></a>Say: “None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghaib (Unseen) except Allâh”</span></strong></span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span class="HarfBody">Allah (Glorified be He) removes all ambiguity whatsoever and declares the truth in a clear-cut manner when addressing the Prophet (peace be upon him):&nbsp;</span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong><span class="HarfBody"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-A`raf, 7: 188" target="_blank" name="Say(OMuhammad%D8%B5%D9%84%D9%89%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%87%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%85):"></a><span style="color:#000000;">Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8220;I possess no power over benefit or harm to myself except as Allâh wills. If I had the knowledge of the Ghaib (Unseen), I should have secured for myself an abundance of wealth, and no evil should have touched me. I am but a warner, and a bringer of glad tidings unto people who believe.&#8221;</span></span></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;There is no obedience due to anyone in disobedience to Allaah Tabarak wa Ta&#8217;aala.&#8221;</strong> [Silsilah Saheehah: 179]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;There is no obedience in disobedience to Allaah Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;aala.&#8221;</strong> [Silsilah Saheehah: 180 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;There is no obedience to mankind in disobedience to Allaah, indeed obedience is in goodness.</strong>&#8220;[Silsilah Saheehah: 181]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The reason for this hadeeth:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah- sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – dispatched an army, and he commanded a man to lead them, who lit a fire, and the man said to the army: enter into the fire. The people wanted to enter into the fire, but some of them said : verily we have just fled from the fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was mentioned to the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – and he said to those who wanted to enter into it: if you entered it you would have remained in it until the Day of Judgment, and he said a good word to the others, and he said…..(the above hadeeth).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The extra wording in the hadeeth is from Tayyalisee and the context is by Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration by him where he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – dispatched a battalion and ordered a man from the Ansaar to lead them, and he ordered them to listen to him and obey him. They caused this man to get angry, so he said to them: Gather some firewood for me, so they gathered it for him. Then he said: light the fire and they lit the fire, then he said to them: Did not the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – order you to listen and to obey me? They said Yes, of course.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said &#8211; enter in to the fire!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they started to look at each other, and said (and in another narration: a young boy said to them) : indeed we fled to the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – from the fire, [ do not be hasty, until you meet the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – and if he orders you to enter it, then enter into it ], so this is what they did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man&#8217;s anger came down/subsided, and the fire was put out. When they returned to the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – and mentioned it to him, he said: if you had entered it, you would never have exited from it, <strong>indeed obedience is in goodness</strong>.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhari (8/47, 13/109), Muslim (6/16), Ahmad (1/82, 134) and other narrations which contain the extra wording is also by Ahmad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth has many benefits, the most important of which is the impermissibility of obedience to anyone, if it is disobedience to Allaah Tabarak wa Ta&#8217;aala, whether it is the leaders, scholars and the shaykhs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from this hadeeth you get to know the misguidance of different groups of people;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The first:</strong></span> some of the soofis who obey their shaykhs, even if they command them to commit sins, using as a proof, that they in reality are not committing sins. Also that the shaykh sees that which the follower does not see.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I know a shaykh from amongst these people who appointed himself as a leader. He mentioned a story to his followers in some of his lessons in the masjid, the summary of which is, one of the Soofi shaykhs ordered one of his followers that during the night he should go to his father and kill him while he is in his bed next to his wife! So when he killed him, he returned to the shaykh, happily having carried out the command of the shaykh! The shaykh looked at him and said: Do you think that you have really killed your father? Rather he is your mother&#8217;s boyfriend! As for your father he is away!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he makes and presents a Sharia&#8217; ruling, as he claims, from his story, and he says to his followers : If a shaykh orders his follower with a ruling which is apparently against the Sharia&#8217;, it is upon the followers to obey him in this, then he said: Do you not see this shaykh, he apparently orders the boy to kill his father, however in reality he ordered him to kill the one who fornicated with his mother, and that person deserved to be killed!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The falsity of this story is not hidden according to the Sharia&#8217; from many angles:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Firstly</strong></span>: Carrying out the punishment is not the right of the shaykh, no matter how important he is; rather it is from the right of the leader or the one in charge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Secondly</strong> </span>: if the case was that this actually took place, then why did he only carry out the punishment on the man and not the woman, and they both fornicated?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Thirdly</strong></span>: the Sharia&#8217; ruling for the married adulterer is to be stoned to death, and the person is not killed except by stoning. From this it is clear that the shaykh has opposed the Sharia&#8217; from many angles, this is also the situation with the follower who based upon this previous story, made it incumbent upon the Muslims to be obedient to the shaykh, to the extent one of them said to the people: if you see the shaykh and he is wearing a cross around his neck, then it is not allowed to criticize him!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With all the clarity of the absurdity of these stories, and their opposition together to the Sharia&#8217; and to the intellect, we find some people become deceived by these stories, and amongst them some of the cultured youth. A discussion took place between me and one of those youths about that story, and he had heard it from that follower of the shaykh, and what the shaykh had based his ruling upon. However, the discussion with him did not bring about any benefit. He persisted in believing this story, since according to his claim, it was a miracle, and he added: you people reject miracles!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when I said to him: If your shaykh orders you to kill your father, would you do it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: Indeed, I have not reached that level yet!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So after this can anyone be blamed for characterizing the religion of these shaykhs except that they are the opium of the people?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The second group is:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The blind followers who prefer to follow the statements of the Madhab above the statement of the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam with what is clearly taken from the statements of the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam. So if it is said to one of them, for example: <strong>do not pray the Sunnah of the Fajr prayer after the obligatory prayer has begun</strong>, due to the prohibition of the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – from doing so, which is clear, they do not obey, and they say the Madhab allows this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it is said to them: <strong>the Nikah at-Tahleel</strong> ( whereby another man marries the divorced woman and then divorces so that she can be allowed to marry her first husband) is invalid, because the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – cursed the one who does this. They would answer by saying: No, but it is permissible according to such and such Madhab!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are hundreds of issues like this, and this is why many of the scholars held the opinion that the saying of Allaah Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala about the Christians: &lt;&lt; <strong>They took their rabbis and their monks to be their lords besides Allaah</strong> &gt;&gt; applies to these blind followers, as Fahkr ar-Razi has explained in his Tafseer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">(6) <strong>Conjuration</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">Q: Among us are some members of a dervish order; one of them is a relative of ours. He is an illiterate man, not gifted by any agility or wit, but he drank a sip of water from the hands of the head of this order to be able to perform charlatan tricks and sorcery before the people. He can strike his stomach with every cutting weapon such as daggers, swords, pieces of wood, bullets, etc. He is neither a practicing Muslim, nor does he perform the obligatory acts of worship enjoined by Allah such as Salah (Prayer), Sawm (Fasting) and others.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">Please clarify the opinion of Islam regarding this matter. What is the secret of his ability to strike himself in this manner? Please reply in writing, as this phenomenon takes place in our country and in other Arab and Muslim countries as well.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Allah sent Muhammad (peace be upon him) as the Final Messenger, on the authority of Qur’anic texts and Ijma‘ (scholarly consensus), as Allah says (what means), Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allâh and the last (end) of the Prophets. (Surah Al-Ahzab, 33: 40). Hadiths were reported from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) by a significant number of trustworthy narrators to show that he is the Last of Prophets; and Muslims have unanimously agreed to this.</p>
<p><strong>Awliya’ (supporters) are of two types</strong>: Awliya’ of Allah, and Awliya’ of Satan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (may He be praised and Exalted) has explained in His Book and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace be upon him) that He has Awliya’ from among mankind, and that Satan also has his Awliya’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, Allah distinguishes between those who serve and support Him and those who serve and support Satan, saying (what means): No doubt! Verily, the Auliyâ’ of Allâh [i.e. those who believe in the Oneness of Allâh and fear Allâh much (abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which he has forbidden), and love Allâh much (perform all kinds of good deeds which He has ordained)], no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve. Those who believed (in the Oneness of Allâh &#8211; Islâmic Monotheism), and used to fear Allâh much (by abstaining from evil deeds and sins and by doing righteous deeds). For them are glad tidings, in the life of the present world (i.e. through a righteous dream seen by the person himself or shown to others), and in the Hereafter. No change can there be in the Words of Allâh. This is indeed the supreme success. (Surah Yunus, 10: 62-64).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah also states, Allâh is the Walî (Protector or Guardian) of those who believe. He brings them out from darkness into light. But as for those who disbelieve, their Auliyâ (supporters and helpers) are Tâghût [false deities and false leaders], they bring them out from light into darkness. Those are the dwellers of the Fire, and they will abide therein forever. (See V.2:81,82) (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 257). It is mentioned in the Sahih (authentic) Hadith narrated by Al-Bukhari and others, from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he stated, Allah says: “Whoever antagonizes a Waliy (sing. of Awliya’) of Mine has challenged Me to fight &#8211; or I have declared war against him.” The Prophet (peace be upon him) informed that if anyone declares hostility to the Awliya’ of Allah, he thus declares hostility and a fighting challenge against Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah also mentions the Awliya’ of Satan when He states: So when you want to recite the Qur’ân, seek refuge with Allâh from Shaitân (Satan), the outcast (the cursed one). Verily! He has no power over those who believe and put their trust only in their Lord (Allâh). His power is only over those who obey and follow him (Satan), and those who join partners with Him (Allâh i.e. those who are Mushrikûn i.e. polytheists. See Verse 6:121). (Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 98-100). Allah also says: And whoever takes Shaitân (Satan) as a Walî (protector or helper) instead of Allâh, has surely suffered a manifest loss. (Surah Al-Nisa’, 4: 119).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah also says: Verily, We made the Shayâtin (devils) Auliyâ’ (protectors and helpers) for those who believe not. And when they commit a Fâhishah (evil deed, going round the Ka‘bah in naked state, and every kind of unlawful sexual intercourse), they say: “We found our fathers doing it&#8221; until Allah’s saying: surely they took the Shayâtîn (devils) as Auliyâ’ (protectors and helpers) instead of Allâh, and think that they are guided. (Surah Al-A‘raf, 7: 27-30). Allah also says: And certainly, the Shayâtîn (devils) do inspire their friends (from mankind) to dispute with you, and if you obey them [by making Al-Maitah (a dead animal) legal by eating it], then you would indeed be Mushrikûn (polytheists); [because they (devils and their friends) made lawful to you to eat that which Allâh has made unlawful to eat and you obeyed them by considering it lawful to eat, and by doing so you worshipped them; and to worship others besides Allâh is polytheism]. (Surah Al-An‘am, 6: 121). Allah relates the statement of the Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham, peace be upon him) who said: &#8220;O my father! Verily I fear lest a torment from the Most Gracious (Allâh) should overtake you, so that you become a companion of Shaitân (Satan) (in the Hell-fire).&#8221; [Tafsir Al-Qurtubî] (Surah Maryam, 19: 45). Allah also says: O you who believe! Take not My enemies and your enemies (i.e. disbelievers and polytheists) as friends, showing affection towards them until Allah’s saying: Verily, You, only You, are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.&#8221; (Surah Al-Mumtahanah, 60: 1-5).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is authentically reported in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) from ‘Amr Ibn Al-‘As (may Allah be pleased with him) that he heard the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) say publicly, not in secret: Behold! The family of so-and-so (referring to one group among his relatives) are not of my Awliya’ (supporters). Verily, my Wali (Protector, Supporter, and Helper) is Allah and the righteous believers.</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong> Thus, the difference between the Awliya’ of the All-Merciful and the Awliya’ of Satan is</strong>:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Awliya’ of the All-Merciful are the Allah-fearing, pious believers, as Allah states: No doubt! Verily, the Auliyâ’ of Allâh [i.e. those who believe in the Oneness of Allâh and fear Allâh much (abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which he has forbidden), and love Allâh much (perform all kinds of good deeds which He has ordained)], no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve. Those who believed (in the Oneness of Allâh &#8211; Islâmic Monotheism), and used to fear Allâh much (by abstaining from evil deeds and sins and by doing righteous deeds). (Surah Yunus, 10: 62-63); whereas the latter are those who show hostility towards Allah and do not obey His Law.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, the best Awliya’ of Allah are His Messengers; Allah has manifested miracles and performed Karamahs (wonders) through His Messengers. Allah may also bring about Karamahs at the hands of His Awliya’; whereas the astounding feats performed by the Awliya’ of Satan are diabolical practices. The Shaykh of Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said, “Linguistically speaking a Mu‘jizah (miracle) refers to anything extraordinary, as defined by the precedent Imams like Imam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal and others who call it a sign, yet many of the latter Imams differentiate between them in terms of wording, attributing a Mu‘jizah (miracle) to a Prophet and a Karamah (wonder) to a Waliy. However, both of them signify something extraordinary.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Given this, the person in question is of the Awliya’ of Satan, and his mentioned acts are satanic and deception wrought on people’s eyes. These acts are nothing real; they are illusions and deception wrought on people by the help of the devils.<br />
May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>
