<p class="has-text-align-center"></p>



<p>On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (<em>radi Allaahu anhu</em>) who said:&nbsp;The Messenger of Allah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said,&nbsp; “Verily Allah <em>ta’ala</em> has said:</p>



<p><span style="color: #008000">‘Whosoever shows enmity to a <strong><a style="color: #008000" href="https://abdurrahman.org/category/islam/awliya/"><em>wali</em></a> </strong>(friend) of Mine, then I have declared war against him. And My servant does not draw near to Me with anything more loved to Me than the religious duties I have obligated upon him. And My servant continues to draw near to me with <em>nafil</em> (supererogatory) deeds until I Love him. When I Love him, I am his hearing with which he hears, and his sight with which he sees, and his hand with which he strikes, and his foot with which he walks. Were he to ask [something] of Me, I would surely give it to him; and were he to seek refuge with Me, I would surely grant him refuge.’</span> ”</p>



<p>[Bukhari]</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Seventh Event</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Books of Deeds are Distributed</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People’s books of deeds will be distributed, open for them to read. An individual’s book of deeds is the register with every action he did in life written inside. These deeds are being written now by the angels entrusted with recording the actions of all the children of Adam. Allah (تعالى) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِنَّ عَلَيْكُمْ لَحَافِظِينَ كِرَامًا كَاتِبِينَ يَعْلَمُونَ مَا تَفْعَلُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And indeed, (appointed) over you are keepers, honorable recorders. They know whatever you do.</span> [Surah al-Isrā, 82:10-12][69]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These angels record in a book everything a person does because they are always with him. And on the Day of Resurrection, Allah will bring forth this book, making it known to the person as he says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَكُلَّ إِنسَانٍ أَلْزَمْنَاهُ طَائِرَهُ فِي عُنُقِهِ وَنُخْرِجُ لَهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ كِتَابًا يَلْقَاهُ مَنشُورًا </span><span style="color:#000000;">اقْرَأْ كِتَابَكَ كَفَى بِنَفْسِكَ الْيَوْمَ عَلَيْكَ حَسِيبًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Every person, we have imposed his fate upon his neck. And we will produce for him, on the Day of Resurrection, a record which he will find spread open. (It will be said to him,) “Read your book. You are sufficient today as a reckoner against yourself. </span>[Surah al-Isrā, 17:13-14.]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Recording of Good Deeds</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Both good deeds and bad deeds are written in these books. As for the good deeds, the actions a person actually does are recorded, as are his good intentions and even those deeds he intends to do but may not have actually done them. So there are three types of rewarded behavior: 1) good deeds performed, 2) good intentions, and 3) good deeds intended but not performed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>1. Good Deeds:</strong> </span>It is clear that a person’s good deeds are written.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>2. Good Intentions:</strong></span> Intending to do a good deed is also recorded in a person’s favor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But a reward is given for only the intention and not necessarily the action intended. This is based on the hadith of a rich man who spends his wealth in charity and a poor man who says, “<strong>If I had wealth, I would do what he does</strong>.” About these two, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَهُوَ بِنِيَّتِهِ فَأَجْرُهُمَا سَوَاءٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>He is rewarded for his intention, and the reward is the same for both</em>.</span>[71]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So both the rich and poor are equally rewarded in intention but not in action. This is also confirmed by the narration in which the poor immigrants of Medina complained to the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) saying, “Oh messenger of Allah, the wealthy have overtaken us (in reward).” The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said (as a way to catch up with the wealthy in rewards):</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">تُسَبِّحُونَ وَتُكَبِّرُونَ وَتَحْمَدُونَ دُبُرَ كُلِّ صَلاةٍ ثَلاثًا وَثَلاثِينَ مَرَّة</span></h2>
<p><em><span style="color:#808000;">Glorify Allah, declare his greatness, and thank him after each prayer thirty-three times.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But when this advice reached the wealthy, they too did likewise. So the poor returned, complaining to the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) again that the rich are now doing both— giving charity and praising Allah after the prayers. He (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) then said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ذَلِكَ فَضْلُ اللَّهِ يُؤْتِهِ مَنْ يَشَاءُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>That is the favor of Allah he gives to whom he wishes. </em></span>[Recorded by al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet did not reply the second time that the poor, despite their sincere intentions, would have the same reward as the rich in deed. And this is fair because a man who does not perform a certain deed is not the same as the one who actually does it, yet he may still get a similar reward for the intention alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>3. Good Deeds Intended but Not Performed:</strong> </span>The third type of rewarded behavior which a person may find written in his book of deeds is the actions he may sincerely intend to do but did not actually do them. The difference between this type and the second is that for these intentions, he does receive a reward for the action itself. These are the deeds that an individual may intend to do and perhaps he does as much as he is able to of such deed. Then something prevents him from completing the deed. In such case, a full good deed will be recorded based on the statement of Allah:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يَخْرُجْ مِن بَيْتِهِ مُهَاجِرًا إِلَى اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ ثُمَّ يُدْرِكْهُ الْمَوْتُ فَقَدْ وَقَعَ أَجْرُهُ عَلَى اللَّهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever leaves his home as an emigrant to Allah and his messenger and then death overtakes him, his reward has already become incumbent upon Allah.</span>[Surah al-Nisa, 4:100]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this is also good news for students of religious knowledge. For example, if someone intends to study religious knowledge for the purpose of benefiting others with such information, defending the Sunnah of the messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) and spreading Allah’s religion throughout the earth, yet he is unable to complete his studies—perhaps he dies in the process, for example—he will still have those good deeds recorded for him and he will achieve its rewards.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even if a person has a habit of performing a particular good deed but for some reason he is unable to do it under certain circumstances, he still has the good deed recorded for him. The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا مَرِضَ الْعَبْدُ أَوْ سَافَرَ كُتِبَ لَهُ مِثْلُ مَا كَانَ يَعْمَلُ مُقِيمًا صَحِيحًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>When a servant becomes sick or travels, whatever he used to do while residing at home or healthy will still be recorded for him.</em></span> [Recorded by al-Bukhari]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Recording of Bad Deeds</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for bad deeds, they are written against a person if: 1) he actually does a bad deed, 2) he intends and hopes to do the bad deed, and 3) he intends to do the bad deed and tries to commit it but for some reason he is unable to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>1. Bad Deeds:</strong></span> This is clear; if someone does a bad deed, he has it recorded against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>2. Bad Intentions:</strong> </span>Sins an individual intends or hopes to do are also written against him. But like good intentions, he has a bad deed recorded for the intention and not a full bad deed for the action intended. The proof of this is in the same hadith mentioned about good intentions. The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) spoke about a person Allah had provided wealth but no knowledge so that he aimlessly wasted his wealth. A person Allah had given neither wealth nor knowledge then said, “If I had wealth, I would do what he does,” admiring the former’s wasteful spending. So the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَهُوَ بِنِيَّتِهِ فَوِزْرُهُمَا سَوَاءٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>He is recorded for his intention, and the sin is the same for both of them.</em></span> [75]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>As for an individual intending to do a bad deed but refrains from it, this is of three types:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">1) If the person does not do the deed because he was unable though he tried to do it, he is just like a person who actually did the bad deed,</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">2) If he refrains from doing the deed for the sake of Allah, he is rewarded, and</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">3) If he simply decides not to do it (but not for the sake of Allah) or even if committing the deed did not seriously cross his mind, then he has neither sin nor reward written for him.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>3. Bad Deeds Intended but Not Performed:</strong> </span>These are also recorded against a person as complete bad deeds if the person tried his utmost to do them based on the statement (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) of the prophet:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ذَا تَوَاجَهَ الْمُسْلِمَانِ بِسَيْفَيْهِمَا فَكِلاهُمَا مِنْ أَهْلِ النَّارِ</span></h2>
<p><span style="color:#808000;"><em>If two Muslims face off with their swords (i.e. if they fight to the death), both of them are people of the fire.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After hearing this, the companions asked, “Messenger of Allah, we understand about the killer, but why the one killed too?” He replied:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّهُ أَرَادَ قَتْلَ صَاحِبِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>He also wanted to kill his opponent.</em></span>[Recorded by al-Bukhari and Muslim.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, if someone wanted to drink alcohol but something happened so that he was unable to do it, it is still recorded against him as a bad deed because he tried as much as he could to commit it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To conclude this topic we must know that Allah rewards good deeds with rewards greater than the original good deed, but He recompenses a bad deed only equivalent to the original sin; He says (تعالى) :</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَن جَاءَ بِالْحَسَنَةِ فَلَهُ عَشْرُ أَمْثَالِهَا وَمَن جَاءَ بِالسَّيِّئَةِ فَلا يُجْزَى إِلاَّ مِثْلَهَا وَهُمْ لا يُظْلَمُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>Whoever comes (on the Day of Judgment) with a good deed will have ten times the like thereof, and whoever comes with an evil deed will not be recompensed except the like thereof, and they will not be wronged.</em></span> [77]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Receiving the Books of Deeds</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">About the distribution of these books and the ways in which people will receive them, Allah (تعالى) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِيَ كِتَابَهُ بِيَمِينِهِ فَسَوْفَ يُحَاسَبُ حِسَابًا يَسِيرًا وَيَنقَلِبُ إِلَى أَهْلِهِ </span><span style="color:#000000;">مَسْرُورًا وَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِيَ كِتَابَهُ وَرَاءَ ظَهْرِهِ فَسَوْفَ يَدْعُو ثُبُورًا وَيَصْلَى سَعِيرًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Then as for he who is given his record in his right hand, he will be judged with an easy reckoning, and he will return to his people in happiness. But as for he who is given his record behind his back, he will cry out for destruction, and he will burn in a blaze.</span>[Surah al-Inshiqaq, 84:7-12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِيَ كِتَابَهُ بِشِمَالِهِ فَيَقُولُ يَا لَيْتَنِي لَمْ أُوتَ كِتَابِيَهْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">But as for he who is given his record in his left hand, he will say, “Oh, I wish I had never been given my record.” </span>[Surah al-Haqqah, 69:25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the Day of Judgment, people will receive their books of deeds in different ways. Some will be given their books in their right hands – these are the believers. In this is also an indication that the right hand is more honorable and so a believer is given his book in his right hand. When the believer receives his book of deeds, he will take it with his right hand, rejoice, then cry out:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِيَ كِتَابَهُ بِيَمِينِهِ فَيَقُولُ هَاؤُمُ اقْرَءُوا كِتَابِيَهْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">So as for he who is given his record in his right hand, he will say, “Here,read my record!” </span>[Surah al-Haqqah, 69:19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for a disbeliever in Allah, he receives his book of deeds in his left hand or from behind his back. He will then cry out for destruction:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِيَ كِتَابَهُ بِشِمَالِهِ فَيَقُولُ يَا لَيْتَنِي لَمْ أُوتَ كِتَابِيَهْ وَلَمْ أَدْرِ مَا حِسَابِيَهْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">But as for he who is given his record in his left hand, he will say, “Oh, I wish I had never been given my record and had never known what my account was.</span>[Surah al-Haqqah, 69:25-26.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the manner in which people receive their books of deeds is of three types: in the right hand, in the left hand, and behind the back. But these three types are only different in description and are not three separate ways books will be distributed. This is because if an individual receives his book of deeds from behind his back, he is at the same time given his book in his left hand—he takes it with his left hand, reaching his hand behind him. And since he receives his book with his left hand, he is known as one of the “People of the Left.” [82] He receives his book behind his back because during his life, he turned his back on the book of Allah. So it is only befitting that in return, he is given his book of deeds from behind his back, and Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To conclude, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَكُلَّ إِنسَانٍ أَلْزَمْنَاهُ طَائِرَهُ فِي عُنُقِهِ وَنُخْرِجُ لَهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ كِتَابًا يَلْقَاهُ مَنشُورًا </span><span style="color:#000000;">اقْرَأْ كِتَابَكَ كَفَى بِنَفْسِكَ الْيَوْمَ عَلَيْكَ حَسِيبًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Every person, we have imposed his fate upon his neck. And we will produce for him, on the Day of Resurrection, a record which he will find spread open. (It will be said to him,) “Read your book. You are sufficient today as a reckoner against yourself. </span>[Surah al-Isra, 17:13-14.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his fate (i.e. his deeds) imposed on his neck, this is the most befitting attachment for a person’s deeds – bound to his neck – because he will never be separated from them until he dies. He will find his book open; he neither expends effort nor does he find difficulty in opening it. &#8220;<strong>Read your book</strong>&#8221; Read what has been written for or against you. &#8220;<strong>Your own self is sufficient as a reckoner against you today</strong>&#8220;. This is the perfection of justice and fairness – that the individual will be responsible for taking himself to account.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have in front of us now a door we may close on every bad deed, every sin: repentance. Regardless of how great a sin may be, when someone repents to Allah, he will forgive him. Even if a person continuously repeated the same sin but he repents, Allah will forgive him. The matter is still within our hands, so we must ensure that nothing is written in this book except righteous deeds before Allah judges creation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[69] Surah al-Isrā, 82:10-12.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Surah Qaf, 50:17-18, Allah informs us that the angels are seated on the right and left of us:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِذْ يَتَلَقَّى الْمُتَلَقِّيَانِ عَنِ الْيَمِينِ وَعَنِ الشِّمَالِ قَعِيدٌ مَّا يَلْفِظُ مِن قَوْلٍ إِلاَّ لَدَيْهِ رَقِيبٌ عَتِيدٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">When the two receivers receive, seated on the right and on the left. Not a word does he utter but there is a watcher by him ready (to record it).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[71] Recorded by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah and al-Albani said it is authentic in “Sahih Sunan al-Tirmidhi” (no. 1894).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The full text of the hadith is:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ثَلاثَةٌ أُقْسِمُ عَلَيْهِنَّ وَأُحَدِّثُكُمْ حَدِيثًا فَاحْفَظُوهُ ، قَالَ : مَا نَقَصَ مَالُ عَبْدٍ مِنْ صَدَقَةٍ ، وَلا ظُلِمَ عَبْدٌ مَظْلَمَةً فَصَبَرَ عَلَيْهَا إِلاَّ زَادَهُ اللَّهُ عِزًّا ، </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَلا فَتَحَ عَبْدٌ بَابَ مَسْأَلَةٍ إِلاَّ فَتَحَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ بَابَ فَقْرٍ &#8211; أَوْ كَلِمَةً نَحْوَهَا &#8211; وَأُحَدِّثُكُمْ حَدِيثًا فَاحْفَظُوهُ ، قَالَ : إِنَّمَا الدُّنْيَا لأَرْبَعَةِ نَفَرٍ : عَبْدٍ </span><span style="color:#000000;">رَزَقَهُ اللَّهُ مَالاً وَعِلْمًا فَهُوَ يَتَّقِي فِيهِ رَبَّهُ وَيَصِلُ فِيهِ رَحِمَهُ ، وَيَعْلَمُ لِلَّهِ فِيهِ حَقًّا فَهَذَا بِأَفْضَلِ الْمَنَازِلِ ، وَعَبْدٍ رَزَقَهُ اللَّهُ عِلْمًا وَلَمْ يَرْزُقْهُ مَالاً </span><span style="color:#000000;">فَهُوَ صَادِقُ النِّيَّةِ يَقُولُ : لَوْ أَنَّ لِي مَالاً لَعَمِلْتُ بِعَمَلِ فُلانٍ ، فَهُوَ بِنِيَّتِهِ فَأَجْرُهُمَا سَوَاءٌ ، وَعَبْدٍ رَزَقَهُ اللَّهُ مَالاً وَلَمْ يَرْزُقْهُ عِلْمًا فَهُوَ يَخْبِطُ فِي </span><span style="color:#000000;">مَالِهِ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ لا يَتَّقِي فِيهِ رَبَّهُ وَلا يَصِلُ فِيهِ رَحِمَهُ وَلا يَعْلَمُ لِلَّهِ فِيهِ حَقًّا فَهَذَا بِأَخْبَثِ الْمَنَازِلِ ، وَعَبْدٍ لَمْ يَرْزُقْهُ اللَّهُ مَالاً وَلا عِلْمًا فَهُوَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">يَقُولُ : لَوْ أَنَّ لِي مَالاً لَعَمِلْتُ فِيهِ بِعَمَلِ فُلانٍ ، فَهُوَ بِنِيَّتِهِ فَوِزْرُهُمَا سَوَاءٌ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">There are three things that I attest to; I will mention them so remember them. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">1) Charity will never decrease a person’s wealth, </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">2) no servant is wronged and patiently endures that except that Allah will increase him in honor, and </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">3) no servant opens the door of begging except that Allah will open the door of poverty (or he said similarly). </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">And I will mention something else so remember it. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The world is for four types of people: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">1) a person Allah has provided with wealth and knowledge so he is conscientious of his Lord regarding them and thus gains his mercy therewith. He knows Allah has a right upon him with regards to them, and this is the best of the (four) types. </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">2) A person Allah has provided with knowledge but not wealth, yet he is truthful in his intention when he says, “If I had wealth, I would do what so-and-so does (the first type of person).” So he is rewarded for his intention, and the reward is the same for both of them. </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">3) A person Allah has provided wealth but no knowledge so that he aimlessly wastes his wealth without knowledge. He is neither conscientious of his Lord with it nor does he achieve his mercy. He does not even know that Allah has a right upon him regarding it, and this is the worst of the (four) types. </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">4) A person Allah has provided no wealth and no knowledge. But he says, “If I had wealth, I would do what so-and-so does (the third type of person).” So he is also recorded for his intention, and the sin is the same for both of them.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[75] Recorded by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah and al-Albani said it is authentic in “Sahih Sunan al-Tirmidhi” (no. 1894). See page 53 for the full hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[77] Surah al-Anaam, 6:160.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Evidence from the Sunnah of a ten-fold reward for a good deed and only a single recompense for a bad deed is the hadith recorded by Muslim in which the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يقول الله : مَنْ جَاء بالحَسَنَةِ فَلَهُ عَشْرُ أمْثَالِهَا أَوْ أزْيَد ، وَمَنْ جَاءَ بالسَيِّئَةِ فَجَزاءُ سَيِّئَةٍ سَيِّئَةٌ مِثْلُهَا أَوْ أغْفِرُ . وَمَنْ تَقَرَّبَ مِنِّي شِبْرًا تَقَرَّبْتُ </span><span style="color:#000000;">مِنْهُ ذِرَاعًا ، وَمَنْ تَقَرَّبَ مِنِّي ذِرَاعًا تَقَرَّبْتُ مِنْهُ بَاعًا ، وَمَنْ أتَانِي يَمْشِي أتَيْتُهُ هَرْوَلَةً ، وَمَنْ لَقِيني بِقُرَابِ الأرْض خَطِيئةً لا يُشْرِكُ بِي شَيئاً ، </span><span style="color:#000000;">لَقِيتُهُ بِمِثْلِهَا مَغفِرَةً</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Allah says, “Whoever does a good deed will have ten times reward for it or even more. And whoever does a bad deed will have a single bad deed for it or I will forgive it. Whoever comes close to me a hand-span, I will come close to him an arm’s length; and whoever comes close to me an arm’s length, I will come close to him the distance of two outstretched arms. Whoever comes to me walking, I will come to him running. And whoever meets me with the earth full of sins but associated nothing with me in worship, I will meet him with as much forgiveness.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[82] A similar description is used in the Surah al-Waqi’ah, 56:8-9:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَأَصْحَابُ الْمَيْمَنَةِ مَا أَصْحَابُ الْمَيْمَنَةِ وَأَصْحَابُ الْمَشْأَمَةِ مَا أَصْحَابُ الْمَشْأَمَةِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Companions of the Right – what are the Companions of the Right? And the Companions of the Left – what re the Companions of the Left?</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Scales are Placed &amp; Deeds are Weighed</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one of the verses that proves the scales will be setup on the Day of Resurrection, Allah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">فَمَن ثَقُلَتْ مَوَازِينُهُ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And those whose scales are heavy </strong>(with good deeds)<strong>, it is they who will be successful</strong></span>.[Sūrah al-Muminūn, 23:102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The verse contains a conditional clause; the condition is &#8220;<strong>those whose scales are heavy</strong>&#8220;, and if that condition is met, the consequence is &#8220;<strong>it is they who will be successful</strong>.&#8221; By &#8220;<strong>scales are heavy</strong>&#8220;, what is meant is that one’s good deeds outweigh his bad. &#8220;<strong>Successful</strong>&#8221; here describes an individual who achieves what he hopes for and is saved from what he fears. So he is given safety from what he hates and rewarded with what he loves. Allah also says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَنْ خَفَّتْ مَوَازِينُهُ فَأُولَئِكَ الَّذِينَ خَسِرُوا أَنفُسَهُمْ فِي جَهَنَّمَ خَالِدُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>But those whose scales are light, it is they who have lost their souls. In Hell they will abide forever</strong></span>. [Sūrah al-Muminūn, 23:103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who do not believe in Allah will <strong>&#8220;have lost their souls</strong>.&#8221; They will lose themselves, their families, and the possessions they hold dear:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ إِنَّ الْخَاسِرِينَ الَّذِينَ خَسِرُوا أَنفُسَهُمْ وَأَهْلِيهِمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ ۖ أَلا ذَلِكَ هُوَ الْخُسْرَانُ الْمُبِينُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Say: Indeed, the losers are the ones who will lose themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection. Unquestionably, that is the clear loss</span></strong>.[Sūrah al-Zumar, 39:15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for a believer in Allah whose behavior was righteous, he will have succeeded, gaining his soul, his family, and his possessions, having benefited from all of them. People who do not believe in Allah (or disbelieve in Allah’s “oneness”) will lose themselves because they will have not benefited from their very existence in life. In fact such people, despite what they presumably achieve in life, actually achieve no true benefit and gain only harm (in the hereafter). In a sense, they even lose their wealth in life as they gain no real benefit from it. Even when they may share it with others among creation, such charity does not benefit the givers. Allah (تعالى) says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا مَنَعَهُمْ أَن تُقْبَلَ مِنْهُمْ نَفَقَاتُهُمْ إِلَّا أَنَّهُمْ كَفَرُوا بِاللَّهِ وَبِرَسُولِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And nothing prevents their spending from being accepted from them except that they disbelieved in Allah and in his messenger</strong></span>.[Sūrah al-Tawbah, 9:54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They also lose their families because their families will either be in the fire with them, or if their families are in Paradise, such disbelievers will still have lost them because they themselves will be in the fire. Any individual who dies while disbelieving in Allah will never again enjoy the company of his family. Such enjoyment will be locked out from a disbeliever as soon as he is locked in his coffin, and each one will imagine no one else is receiving a harsher punishment than he.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#000000;">whose scales are light</span></strong>&#8220;, this means his bad deeds will outweigh his good or he will have no good deeds whatsoever. This is the meaning if we accept the position that disbelievers will have their deeds weighed which seems apparent from the verse in Sūrah al-Muminūn, 23:103 and others like it. And this position is one of the two held by religious scholars. The other opinion, that disbelievers will not have their deeds weighed, is the second position and it is based on the verses:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ هَلْ نُنَبِّئُكُم بِالْأَخْسَرِينَ أَعْمَالً الَّذِينَ ضَلَّ سَعْيُهُمْ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا وَهُمْ يَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُمْ يُحْسِنُونَ صُنْعًا أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا بِآيَاتِ رَبِّهِمْ وَلِقَائِهِ فَحَبِطَتْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ فَلَا نُقِيمُ لَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ وَزْنًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Say: Shall we inform you of the greatest losers as to (their) deeds? Those whose effort is lost in the worldly life while they thought they were doing good work. Those are the ones who disbelieve in the verses of their Lord and in (their) meeting him. So their deeds have become worthless, and we will not assign to them on the Day of Resurrection any weight.</span></strong> [Sūrah al-Kahf, 18:103-105]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the two positions, whether disbelievers will have their deeds weighed or not, Allah knows best which is correct.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabic word for scales used in some verses, ( مَوَازِيْن <em>mawāzīn</em>), has been reported in other texts in both the singular and plural forms. As for the plural form, Allah (تعالى) says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَنَضَعُ الْمَوَازِينَ الْقِسْطَ لِيَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ فَلَا تُظْلَمُ نَفْسٌ شَيْئًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And we place the scales of justice for the Day of Resurrection, so no soul will be treated unjustly in any way. </strong></span>[Sūrah al-Anbiyā, 21:47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَالْوَزْنُ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْحَقُّ ۚ فَمَن ثَقُلَتْ مَوَازِينُهُ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ وَمَنْ خَفَّتْ مَوَازِينُهُ فَأُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ خَسِرُوا أَنفُسَهُم بِمَا كَانُوا بِآيَاتِنَا يَظْلِمُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">And the weighing (of deeds) that day will be true. So those whose scales are heavy, it is they who will be successful. And those whose scales are light, they will lose themselves for what injustice they were doing toward our verses.</span> </strong>[Sūrah al-‘Arāf, 7:8-9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the singular form, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">كَلِمَتَانِ حَبِيبَتَانِ إِلَى الرَّحْمَنِ خَفِيفَتَانِ عَلَى اللِّسَانِ ثَقِيلَتَانِ فِي الْمِيزَانِ : سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ الْعَظِيمِ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There are two statements beloved to the Most Merciful, light on the tongue but heavy on the scale: “Glorified is Allah and all thanks are for him,” and “Glorified is Allah the greatest.”</strong> </span>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">59</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this ḥadīth, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) mentioned the singular form, ( مِيْزَان <em>mīzān</em>), “scale.” So how do we understand the Quran verses which mention “scales” and this ḥadīth which mentions “scale?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps it is mentioned in the plural form only as a way of speaking about what is weighed – deeds – which is plural. Then it is mentioned in the ḥadīth in singular form because the scale is actually one. It could also be because perhaps there is one scale for each nation or even that the prophet meant “heavy in weight” when he said, “heavy on the scale.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, what is apparent—and Allah knows best—is that the scale is actually one but is mentioned in plural form with regards to what is weighed (i.e., deeds). This linguistic usage can also be seen in the verse:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; فَمَن ثَقُلَتْ مَوَازِينُهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So those whose scales are heavy&#8230;</strong></span>[Sūrah al-A’rāf, 7:8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this verse, it is not actually the scales that are heavy, rather it is a form of Arabic speech in which one word (e.g. scales) is used to mean another word relating to the former (e.g. deeds).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a related issue but one into which people have not delved: Will there be a single scale setup for all nations, all mankind, or will there be one for each nation (e.g., one for Muhammad’s nation, one for Jesus’ nation, one for Moses’, etc.)? This question may be relevant because some texts indicate the rewards for deeds vary for different nations. [<span style="color:#ff0000;">61</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These texts, taken at face value, are apparent in that the scale will be real and tangible as this is exactly how the word “scale” is commonly understood. This is because the principle of understanding religious texts reported in the Quran or Sunnah is that they are to be understood upon the commonly known, real and actual meanings of their words unless there is clear evidence that they should be understood differently (i.e. metaphorically). The commonly understood meaning to all Muslim teachers, writers, and lecturers ever since the Quran was revealed up until today is that the scale is real. However, some misguided sects have differed in understanding. For example, those who incorrectly believe any texts can be figurative, having metaphorical meanings instead of what the words actually mean, they claim that there will not be a real scale setup on the Day of Resurrection. They insist that there is really no need for an actual scale to weigh actions because Allah already knows the deeds of his servants and their worth. Instead, they claim that “scale” is allegorical and it really means Allah’s “fairness” or “justice.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No doubt, the claim of such people is incorrect because it contradicts the outward, apparent meaning of the word and the consensus of all the righteous predecessors who understood the word to mean what the word actually means – scale. If we say the meaning is figurative and it really means fairness or justice, then there is little meaning in the several texts which mention “scale,” they would simply say “justice” (as other texts do) because the characteristics of fairness and justice are closer to and speak more directly to people’s souls than the word “scale” anyway. For this reason, Allah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَأْمُرُ بِالْعَدْلِ وَالْإِحْسَانِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Indeed, Allah orders justice and good conduct.</span></strong>[Sūrah al-Naḥl, 16:90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The correct understanding is to take the word “scale” on its intended, actual meaning. We say that the correct understanding is the same one revealed – scale. The “<strong>Ḥadīth of the Card</strong>” (to be mentioned soon) also proves that it is a real, actual scale with weighing pans. This ḥadīth mentions that scrolls of bad deeds placed in one pan will be lighter than a single card placed in the other pan which will be heavier. So it is clear, what is correct is what was revealed – the scale is real.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The actions of the servants will then be weighed. And with that, there are two points of discussion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first point is this:</strong> How will deeds be weighed when it is known that a deed is simply a description or action of the one who performed it, and a deed has no physical form? The answer is that Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) will make these deeds into actual, physical forms. This should not be unbelievably strange when considering the capability of Allah (عزّ وجل). As an analogy, death will be made into the form of a ram on the Day of Judgment and it will be slaughtered between Paradise and Hell [<span style="color:#ff0000;">63</span>] while death now is simply a concept and not a physical form. And to clarify a side-note, the Angel of Death is not the one slaughtered here; it is actually death that Allah (تعالى) will make into a physical form everyone will witness and see. Similarly, Allah (عزّ وجل)جلwill turn deeds into actual forms that will be actually weighed with this actual scale.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second point:</strong> Deeds will actually be weighed, both good and bad. This is the apparent understanding as Allah (تعالى) says in the Quran:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">يَوْمَئِذٍ يَصْدُرُ النَّاسُ أَشْتَاتًا لِّيُرَوْا أَعْمَالَهُمْ  فَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ خَيْرًا يَرَهُ وَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ شَرًّا يَرَهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>That day, people will depart, separated (into categories) to be shown their deeds. So whoever does an atom’s weight of good will see it, and whoever does an atom’s weight of evil will see it.</strong></span> [Sūrah al-Zalzalah, 99:6-8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is clear that deeds will really be weighed whether they are good or bad. Also, as has previously been mentioned, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)said, “There are two statements beloved to the Most Merciful, light on the tongue but heavy on the scale&#8230;” This ḥadīth is also clear, even explicit, in that actions will actually be given form and weight and then weighed, and there are several other texts that prove this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, there are other reliable texts that indicate that it may not be the actual deeds weighed but rather the records of deeds. An example of this type is the “Ḥadīth of the Card” in which the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« إِنَّ اللَّهَ سَيُخَلِّصُ رَجُلاً مِنْ أُمَّتِي عَلَى رُءُوسِ الْخَلائِقِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فَيَنْشُرُ عَلَيْهِ </span><span style="color:#000000;">تِسْعَةً وَتِسْعِينَ سِجِلاًّ كُلُّ سِجِلٍّ مِثْلُ مَدِّ الْبَصَرِ ثُمَّ يَقُولُ.: أَتُنْكِرُ مِنْ هَذَا شَيْئًا ؟ </span><span style="color:#000000;">أَظَلَمَكَ كَتَبَتِي الْحَافِظُونَ ؟ فَيَقُولُ : لا يَا رَبِّ ، فَيَقُولُ : أَفَلَكَ عُذْرٌ ؟ فَيَقُولُ : لا يَا </span><span style="color:#000000;">رَبِّ ، فَيَقُولُ : بَلَى إِنَّ لَكَ عِنْدَنَا حَسَنَةً فَإِنَّهُ لا ظُلْمَ عَلَيْكَ الْيَوْمَ ، فَتَخْرُجُ بِطَاقَةٌ فِيهَا </span><span style="color:#000000;">أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لا إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ ، فَيَقُولُ : احْضُرْ وَزْنَكَ ، </span><span style="color:#000000;">فَيَقُولُ : يَا رَبِّ مَا هَذِهِ الْبِطَاقَةُ مَعَ هَذِهِ السِّجِلاَّتِ ؟ فَقَالَ : إِنَّكَ لا تُظْلَمُ ، قَالَ : </span><span style="color:#000000;">فَتُوضَعُ السِّجِلاَّتُ فِي كَفَّةٍ وَالْبِطَاقَةُ فِي كَفَّةٍ فَطَاشَتْ السِّجِلاَّتُ وَثَقُلَتْ الْبِطَاقَةُ فَلا </span><span style="color:#000000;">يَثْقُلُ مَعَ اسْمِ اللَّهِ شَيْءٌ »</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allah will single out a man from my nation at the head of all the creations on the Day of Resurrection. Ninety-nine scrolls (of bad deeds) will be spread out before him, each as far as the eye can see. He will be asked, “Do you deny doing any of this? Did my recording, guardian angels wrong you in any way?” The man will answer, “No, my Lord.” He will be asked, “Do you have any excuse?” to which he will again reply, “No, my Lord.” It will then be said, “Rather you certainly do have a good deed with us and there will be no injustice on you today.” A card will then be brought out, written on it: “I testify there is nothing deserving of worship but Allah, and I testify that Muhammad is his servant and messenger.” The man will be told, “Present yourself for your weighing.” He will ask, “My Lord, what is this card compared to all these scrolls (of bad deeds)?” He (Allah) will tell him, “You will certainly not be wronged.” So the scrolls will be placed in one pan (of the scale) and the card in the other, and the scrolls will be lighter and the card heavier as nothing is heavier than the name of Allah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Recorded by al-Tirmidhī, Ibn Mājah, and Aḥmad. al-Albānī said it is authentic in his “Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan al-Tirmidhī” (no.2127)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this ḥadīth, it is apparent that it is the written records of deeds weighed instead of the deeds themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are other texts that indicate what is weighed is the person who does the deeds. For example, Allah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا بِآيَاتِ رَبِّهِمْ وَلِقَائِهِ فَحَبِطَتْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ فَلَا نُقِيمُ لَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ وَزْنًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Those are the ones who disbelieve in the verses of their Lord and in </strong>(their)<strong> meeting with him, so their deeds have become worthless. And we will not assign to them on the Day of Resurrection any weight</strong></span>.[Sūrah al-Kahf, 18:105]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But it has been said that the meaning of &#8220;weight&#8221; in the verse could mean “significance” or “importance” instead of weight. Another indication that it may be the person himself that is weighed is the ḥadīth of Abū Hurayrah ( رضي الله عنه)in which he narrated that the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« إِنَّهُ لَيَأْتِي الرَّجُلُ الْعَظِيمُ السَّمِينُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ لا يَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ »</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>A huge, fat man will be brought on the Day of Resurrection and he will not weigh in the sight of Allah even as much as a gnat’s wing</strong> </span>[Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The understanding that it is the person who will be weighed is also indicated by the ḥadīth of Ibn Mas’ūd ( رضي الله عنه)when he was once trying to break a siwāk branch from a tree. He used to have thin legs and the wind blew and started to move him. Because of this, other companions ( رضي الله عنه)مbegan laughing at him. So the prophet ( صلّى الله ) عليه وسلّمasked them, “What are you laughing at?” They answered, “At the skinniness of his legs.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)then said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ ، لَهُمَا أَثْقَلُ فِي الْمِيزَانِ مِنْ أُحُدٍ »</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>I swear by the one in who hand is my soul (Allah), they (his legs) are both heavier in the scale than Mt. Uḥud.</strong></span> [Recorded by Aḥmad (1/421) and al-Albānī classed its chain of narrators as ḥasan in “Sharḥ al-A’qīdah al-Ṭaḥāwiyyah.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So to conclude, we have texts indicating three things that will be weighed in the scale: the deeds, the records of deeds, and the person who performed the deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some scholars said the way to understand these together is simply that some people will have their deeds weighed, some will have their records of deeds weighed, and others will be weighed themselves. Other scholars said that when texts mention deeds being weighed, what is really meant is the records of deeds, and as for a person being weighed, this is specific to certain individuals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Other scholars have combined these texts with the understanding that in reality only the records of deeds are weighed, but they will be heavy or light based on the merit and greatness of the deeds written in them. So in essence, it is as if the deeds are weighed. But after reflecting on the texts relevant to this issue, we find most of them indicate that it is the deeds that are weighed. Yet some people will be exclusively chosen to have their records of deeds weighed or even the individual himself. As far as the ḥadīth of Ibn Mas’ūd or the “Ḥadīth of the Card,” it could be that these are specific situations for which Allah chooses whomever he wants from his servants.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the scales are placed, people’s deeds are weighed, then the books of deeds are distributed.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">59</span>] Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim. The transliteration of these two statements:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ الْعَظِيمِ</strong></span></h2>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Another ḥadīth which mentions “scale” in the singular form and indicates the greatness of this scale is classified as authentic by al-Albānī in “Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ṣaḥīḥah” (no. 941). In it, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« يُوْضَعُ المِيْزَانُ يَوْمَ القِيَامَةِ فَلَوْ وَزِنَ فِيْهِ السَّمَوَاتِ وَالأَرْضَ لَوَسَعَتْ فَتَقُوْلُ المَلائِكَةُ : يَا رَبّ لِمَنْ يَزِنَ هَذَا ؟ فَيَقُوْلُ اللهُ تَعَالَى : لِمَنْ </span><span style="color:#000000;">شِئْتُ مِنْ خَلْقِي . فَتَقُوْلُ المَلائِكَةُ : سُبْحَانَكَمَا عَبَدْنَاكَ حَقَّ عِبَادَتِكَ . وَيُوْضَعُ الصِّرَاطُ مِثْلَ حَدِّ المُوْسَى فَتَقُوْلُ المَلائِكَةُ : مَنْ تَجِيْزُ عَلَى </span><span style="color:#000000;">هَذَا ؟ فَيَقُوْلُ : مَنْ شِئْتُ مِنْ خَلْقِيْ . فَيَقُوْلُوْنَ : سُبْحَانَكَمَا عَبَدْنَاكَ حَقَّ عِبَادَتِكَ »</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">The scale will be set up on the Day of Resurrection, and if the heavens and the earth were to be weighed in it, it would be sufficient to hold them. The angels will ask, “Oh Lord, who is this for?” Allah will reply, “For whomsoever I want among my creations.” The angels will then say, “Glory to you, we have not worshipped you as you rightfully deserve to be worshipped.” And the bridge will be placed (over Hell) and it will be like the edge of a razor. The angels will ask Allah, “Who will be saved from this?” to which Allah will again reply, “Whomsoever I want among my creations.” They will say, “Glory to you, we have not worshipped you as you rightfully deserve to be worshipped.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">61</span>] One example of such texts is the ḥadīth recorded by al-Bukhārī in which the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)said comparing Muslims to Jews and Christians:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« مَثَلُكُمْ وَمَثَلُ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابَيْنِ كَمَثَلِ رَجُلٍ اسْتَأْجَرَ أُجَرَاءَ فَقَالَ : مَنْ يَعْمَلُ لِي مِنْ غُدْوَةَ إِلَى نِصْفِ النَّهَارِ عَلَى قِيرَاطٍ ؟ فَعَمِلَتْ الْيَهُودُ ، ثُمَّ قَالَ : مَنْ يَعْمَلُ لِي مِنْ نِصْفِ النَّهَارِ إِلَى صَلاةِ الْعَصْرِ عَلَى قِيرَاطٍ ؟ فَعَمِلَتْ النَّصَارَى ، ثُمَّ قَالَ : مَنْ يَعْمَلُ لِي مِنْ الْعَصْرِ إِلَى أَنْ تَغِيبَ الشَّمْسُ عَلَى قِيرَاطَيْنِ ؟ فَأَنْتُمْ هُمْ ، فَغَضِبَتْ الْيَهُودُ وَالنَّصَارَى فَقَالُوا : مَا لَنَا أَكْثَرَ عَمَلاً وَأَقَلَّ عَطَاءً ؟ قَالَ : هَلْ نَقَصْتُكُمْ مِنْ حَقِّكُمْ ؟ قَالُوا : لا ، قَالَ : فَذَلِكَ فَضْلِي أُوتِيهِ مَنْ أَشَاءُ »</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Your example compared to those of the two former scriptures can be likened to a man who hires a number of laborers. He asks, “Who will work for me from morning until midday for a certain sum?” The Jews are the ones to work at this time. Then he asks, “Who will work from midday to the late afternoon for the same sum?” The Christians are the ones to work at this time. Then he asks, “Who will work from the late afternoon until sunset for double that sum?” You (Muslims) are these people. This angers the Jews and Christians who ask, “Why did we have to work more only to receive less?” He answers, “Have you been cheated of any of your rights?” They answer, “No.” He then says, “This is my favor that I give to whom I please.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">63</span>] The proof is the ḥadīth recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim in which the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« يُؤْتَى بِالْمَوْتِ كَهَيْئَةِ كَبْشٍ أَمْلَحَ فَيُنَادِي مُنَادٍ : يَا أَهْلَ الْجَنَّةِ ، فَيَشْرَئِبُّونَ وَيَنْظُرُونَ ، فَيَقُولُ : هَلْ تَعْرِفُونَ هَذَا ؟ فَيَقُولُونَ : نَعَمْ هَذَا الْمَوْتُ ، وَكُلُّهُمْ قَدْ رَآهُ ، ثُمَّ يُنَادِي : يَا أَهْلَ النَّارِ ، فَيَشْرَئِبُّونَ وَيَنْظُرُونَ ، فَيَقُولُ : هَلْ تَعْرِفُونَ هَذَا ؟ فَيَقُولُونَ : نَعَمْ هَذَا الْمَوْتُ ، وَكُلُّهُمْ قَدْ رَآهُ ، فَيُذْبَحُ ، ثُمَّ يَقُولُ : يَا أَهْلَ الْجَنَّةِ خُلُودٌ فَلا مَوْتَ وَيَا أَهْلَ النَّارِ خُلُودٌ فَلا مَوْتَ ، ثُمَّ قَرَأَ : &#8220;وَأَنْذِرْهُمْ يَوْمَ الْحَسْرَةِ إِذْ قُضِيَ الأَمْرُ وَهُمْ فِي غَفْلَةٍ &#8220;وَهَؤُلاءِ فِي غَفْلَةٍ أَهْلُ الدُّنْيَا &#8220;وَهُمْ لا يُؤْمِنُونَ »&#8221;</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Death will be brought in the form of a black and white ram and a caller will call out, “Oh people of Paradise!” and they will stretch their necks and look. They will be asked, “Do you know what this is?” to which they will answer, “Yes, that is death,” and each of them will be able to see it. Then it will be called out, “Oh people of Hell!” They will also stretch out their necks and look. They will be asked, “Do you know what this is?” and they too will say, “Yes, it is death,” and each of them will see it. It will then be slaughtered. Then it will be said, “Oh people of Paradise, eternity and no death. Oh people of Hell, eternity and no death.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)recited:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنْذِرْهُمْ يَوْمَ الْحَسْرَةِ إِذْ قُضِيَ الأَمْرُ وَهُمْ فِي غَفْلَةٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">And warn them of the Day of Regret, when the matter will be concluded. And yet they are in heedlessness.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then said, “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And these people are headless, people of this life</strong></span>,” and finished the verse:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And they do not believe</strong></span>. [Sūrah Maryam, 19:39]</p>

<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Exerting Efforts Towards Accomplishing Sincere Righteous Actions</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another cause for the increase and strengthening of eemaan is for the Muslim to exert efforts towards enacting sincere righteous actions for the countenance of Allaah; he should try to do more (good) deeds and to do them on a regular basis.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because for every action that Allaah has legislated, which the Muslim undertakes and with which he makes his intention behind it sincere, it increases him in eemaan, since eemaan increases because of obedience and ample acts of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the servitude that Allaah has enjoined on His slaves and demanded them to enact, the obligatory and voluntary of them, are distributed among the heart, the tongue and the limbs. Each of them has a servitude specific to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Examples of the servitude of the heart that are specific to it are sincerity, love, <em>tawakkul</em>, <em>inaabah</em>, hope, fear, reverence, awe, contentment, patience and other actions of the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Examples of servitude of the tongue that are specific to it are reading the Qur&#8217;aan, <em>takbeer</em>, <em>tasbeeh</em>, <em>tahleel</em>, seeking forgiveness, praising and commending Allaah, sending <em>salaah</em> and salaam upon His Messenger and other actions that can only be done by the tongue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the servitude of the limbs that are specific to it, examples of this are <em>sadaqah</em>, hajj, prayer, ablution, proceeding towards the mosque and other such actions that are only possible with the use of the limbs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, these actions of the heart as well as those of the tongue and the limbs are all from eemaan and are inherently present within the true meaning of the word eemaan. To perform such actions and to increase in them will therefore result in an increase of eemaan and to neglect them and to lessen the performance of them will result in a deficiency of eemaan.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>i. Actions of the Heart</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In reality, actions of the heart are <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>the</strong> <strong>foundation of the religion</strong></span>. They are its uppermost part and the most important of ordinances. In fact, apparent [<span style="color:#999999;">i.e., actions of the limbs and tongue, which are sensed. [t]</span>] actions are not accepted if they are void of any actions of the heart; the reason being that the acceptance of all actions are stipulated by sincerity to Allaah and sincerity is an action of the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why actions of the heart are mandatory upon everyone and the abandonment of such actions can never be deemed praiseworthy under any condition whatsoever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People are of three levels with regard to the accomplishment of these actions, similar to the case with actions of the body: one who oppresses his own self, one who suffices with that which is obligatory and one who chases after the good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consequently, it is imperative of every Muslim that he starts with the purification and rectification of his heart and with having concern for it, before he concentrates with the rectification of his exterior, as no consideration is given to the rectification of the outer whilst the inner is corrupt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, when the Muslim does rectify his heart with purifying actions, sincerity, truthfulness and love for Allaah and His Messenger, his limbs will turn upright as in the hadeeth of an-Nu&#8217;maan Ibn Basheer that is recorded in the two Saheehs. He said: &#8220;I heard the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallallahu alaihe wa-sallam &#8211; say: <i>&#8220;</i><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8230; Indeed, and within the body is a morsel of flesh; if it is sound, then the whole body will be sound and if it is corrupt, then the whole body will be corrupt. Indeed, it is the heart</strong></span><i>.&#8221;</i>&#8221; [Al-Bukhaaree. (1/127 Fath) and Muslim, 3/1220]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth contains the greatest indication that the rectification of the slave&#8217;s outer movements is directly connected to the rectification of the activity of his heart and inner soul.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If his heart is pure, there being only love of Allaah, love of that which Allaah loves, fear of Him and of falling into that which He hates, the movements of his limbs will all become sound. This is in sharp contrast to a corrupt heart which is conquered by a love for desires, chasing lusts and placing the wants of the self first. Whoever is in such a predicament, the movements of his limbs will all be corrupt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For this reason, it is said that <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>the heart is the king of the limbs</strong> </span>and that the rest of the limbs are its soldiers. In addition to this, the limbs are an obedient army to the heart; they race to its obedience and towards the execution of its commands, not opposing it in any matter whatsoever. Thus, if the king is righteous, this army will be a righteous one. If on the other hand, the king is corrupt, the army will, because of this resemblance, also be corrupt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Only the heart that is pure is of benefit before Allaah, as Allaah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">يَوْمَ لَا يَنفَعُ مَالٌ وَلَا بَنُونَ إِلَّا مَنْ أَتَى اللَّهَ بِقَلْبٍ سَلِيمٍ</span> </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#003300;"><span style="color:#000000;">The Day whereon neither wealth nor sons will avail, except for the one who comes to Allaah with a pure heart</span>.</span>&#8220;</b> [Soorah ash-Shu&#8217;araa&#8217; (26):88-89]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The pure heart is the one that is free of all diseases, blights and distasteful matters. It is the heart that contains nothing but love of Allaah, fear of Him and fear of anything that will distance him from Allaah. [<span style="color:#999999;">See Jaami&#8217; al-&#8216;Uloom wa al-Hikam of Ibn Rajab, page 71</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Islaam says: &#8220;<strong>Moreover, the heart is the foundation. If it embodies knowledge and intention, this will take effect on the body without fail. It is not possible for the body to play truant to what the heart desires&#8230; so if the heart is righteous as a result of its knowledge and action on eemaan, this absolutely necessitates the rectification of the body in apparent speech and action in accordance with complete eemaan</strong>.&#8221; [al-Fataawaa, 7/187]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consequently, for one to endeavor to fully fight his self in rectifying his heart and to fill it with love of Allaah and of statements and actions that Allaah loves, is one of the most formidable ways in which one increases his outer and inner eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Rajab says: &#8220;<strong>&#8230;the heart cannot be rectified unless there settles within it knowledge of Allaah, His greatness, love of Him, fear and awe of Him, hope and <em>tawakkul</em> in Him and for it to be overflowing with this. This is the reality of tawheed and the meaning of&#8217; none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah</strong>.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there can be no question for the rectification of the hearts until its deity, which it worships, knows, loves and fears is one deity, having no partner. If there were in the heavens and the earth a deity being worshipped other than Allaah, the heavens and earth would as a result become corrupt, as Allaah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَوْ كَانَ فِيهِمَا آلِهَةٌ إِلَّا اللَّهُ لَفَسَدَتَا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;">Had there been therein </span></b><span style="color:#000000;">(i.e., the heavens and earth) </span><b><span style="color:#000000;">deities besides Allaah, then for sure both would have been ruined&#8230;</span>&#8220;</b> [Soorah al-Anbiyaa&#8217; (21):22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One concludes from this that righteousness cannot be attained by the celestial and earthly worlds until the activity of its inhabitants are made all for Allaah. The movement of the body is dependent on the activity of the heart and its intention. If therefore, the heart&#8217;s movement and desire are for Allaah alone, it will become sound and all the movements of the body will become sound. If, however, the movement and intent of the heart are for other than Allaah, it will become corrupt and the activity of the body will also become corrupt in accordance to the (level of) corruption within the activity of the heart.&#8221; [Jaami&#8217; al-&#8216;Uloom wa al-Hikam, page 71. See al-Waabil as-Sayyib of Ibn al-Qayyim, page 12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been authenticated on the Prophet that he said: <i>&#8220;</i><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Whoever loves for Allaah, hates for Allaah, gives for Allaah and withholds for Allaah has indeed perfected eemaan</strong></span><i>.&#8221;</i> [Related by Aboo Daawood, 4/220, at-Tabaraanee in al-Kabeer, number 7737, Ibn Battah in al-Ibaanah, 2/658 and others. Al-Albaanee declared it saheeh, see as-Silsilah as-Saheehah, 1/658]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;The meaning of this is that with all the motions of the heart and limbs, if they are all for Allaah, the eemaan of the servant, both the interior and exterior, will be complete and the goodness of the activity of the heart necessitate goodness of the activity of the limbs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, if the heart is good, there being only desire of Allaah and of that which He desires, the limbs will only proceed towards that which Allaah desires. Consequently, the limbs hasten towards that which incurs the pleasure of Allaah, they refrain from what Allaah dislikes or what is feared that would be disliked by Allaah even if it is not sure of that.&#8217; [Jaami&#8217; al &#8216;Uloom wa al-Hikam, page 72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever the hearts become righteous with eemaan, truthfulness, sincerity and love and no desire for other than Allaah is left in the heart, all the limbs will attain righteousness and they will not move except for Allaah and only in areas that His pleasure will be attained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the heart is always occupied in thought, either about its essential afterlife and its betterment, or about the welfare of its worldly life and living, or its thoughts center on misgivings, false aspirations and hypothetical circumstances.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sum and substance of the rectification of the heart is that you occupy it with thoughts on that which constitute its welfare and true and actual success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, in the area of knowledge and conceptions, one occupies it with knowledge of what binds one of <em>Tawheed</em> and its rights, of death and what leads on from it up until entering Paradise and Hellfire and of the ill actions and the ways to protect oneself from committing them. In the area of intentions and resolutions, one occupies it with desires of that which will cause one benefit and to reject desires that which will bring harm upon him. [See al-Fawaa&#8217;id of ibn al-Qayyim, page 310 and 311]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, of immense assistance to the servant in this regard is to increase the beneficial observations, which are enacted in the heart, so that his attachment with Allaah strengthens, as the existence of righteous actions is associated to the establishment and great number of these observations in the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Ibn al-Qayyim</strong></span>, may Allaah have mercy upon him, said: &#8220;We will by the aid and tawfeeq granted by Allaah, point out these observations in a manner that will make known the reality of this matter:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The first observation of the traveler to Allaah and the home of the hereafter</strong></span>, is that there exists in his heart an observation of this world and its insignificance, its trivial fulfillment, extensive futility, vile participants and rapid demise&#8230; Thus, if the servant undertakes this observation of the world, his heart will migrate from this world and it will travel to seek the home of the hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At this moment, an observation of the hereafter and its continuity is enacted in his heart. That it is in all truth, <b>the real life</b>. Its inhabitants will never migrate or depart from it. Rather, it is the place of settling, the last stopping point of all travelers and the end of the journey&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereafter, <strong><span style="color:#000000;">an observation of the Fire is made in his heart</span></strong>, of its combustion, blaze and the depth of its pit; its intense heat and the immense torment of its inhabitants. He observes them as they are brought forth to it with blackened faces, blue eyed with iron chains and fetters around their necks. When they reach the fire, its doors will be opened in front of their faces and they will witness that abominable sight, whereupon their hearts will be become severed out of regret and sorrow&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consequently, if this observation is accomplished in the heart of the servant, he will be stripped of sins, disobedience and of following desires and will instead don the guise of fear and caution&#8230; How distant he will actually be from disobedience and violations is dependent on the strength of this observation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This observation will melt away, roast through and expel the destructive remnants and elements within his heart and thereupon, the heart will find the sweetness of well being and its pleasure.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereafter, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>an observation of Paradise is established in the heart</strong></span> and of what Allaah has prepared in it for its inhabitants: things that no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard and no imagination of has ever been made within the heart of a person. This is besides the detailed types of bliss Allaah has portrayed to His servants upon the tongue of His Messenger, guaranteeing the loftiest types of pleasure concerning foods, drink, clothes, palaces, delight and happiness. So, enacted in his heart is an observation of an abode, within which Allaah has placed everlasting bliss in its entirety.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Its ground is musk and its pebbles are pearls. Its structure is made up of bricks of gold and silver and of pearly embroidery. Its drink is sweeter than honey, possesses a fragrance more pleasant than musk, is cooler than camphor and tastier than ginger. In relation to its women, if the face of one of them were to be revealed to this world, it would overpower the radiance of the sun. The clothes of the inhabitants are made of the silk of sarsenet and brocades. Their servants are youths looking like scattered pearls. Their fruit will be everlasting, whose season is not limited and supply not cut off Therein are thrones raised high. Their food is the flesh of the fowls they desire. They will have drink of wine, there being no harmful effect within it and they will not suffer intoxication. Their vegetation is the fruit that they desire. Their view will be of fair females possessing wide lovely eyes like preserved pearls. They will be reclining upon thrones and in that Garden being made happy. In it are what the souls covet, what gratifies the eyes and they will abide in it forever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one adds to this observation, <strong><span style="color:#000000;">the observation of the day of Mazeed</span></strong> &#8220;&#8230; looking at the face of the Lord and listening to His speech without an intermediary&#8230; If this observation is attached to the ones before it, there and then, will the heart race towards its Lord faster than the procession of the wind moving in its direction and the heart will not on its way bother to glance, neither left nor right&#8230;&#8221; [Madaarij as-Saalikeen, 3/250-252]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, if such observations are manifested in the heart of the servant and he contemplates over them, it will be of great help towards the purification of his heart and its eradication of denounced characteristics and ignoble desires and towards the evacuation of any attachment to other than Allaah. Furthermore, it will be a great motive for worship, love, fear, repentance and of feeling in need of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The intent here is to highlight that one of the greatest incentives for eemaan, one of its most beneficial consolidators and most important reasons for its increase and development is the rectification of the heart through eemaan, love of Allaah, His Messenger, of that which Allaah and His Messenger love and to purify it from anything that opposes or nullifies this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is the one who grants tawfeeq.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> &#8230; لِّلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُوا الْحُسْنَىٰ وَزِيَادَةٌ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* i.e., the day of increase. Allaah says in the Qur&#8217;aan: <b>&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;">For those who do righteousness is al-Husnaa and more &#8230;</span>&#8220;</b> [Soorah Yoonus (10):26]</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">لَهُم مَّا يَشَاءُونَ فِيهَا وَلَدَيْنَا مَزِيدٌ</span> </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also says, <b>&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;">There </span></b><span style="color:#000000;">(i.e., Jannah)</span><b><span style="color:#000000;">, they will have all that they desire, and We have more</span>&#8220;</b> [Soorah Qaaf (50):35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Husnaa</em> has been explained to mean <em>Jannah</em> and &#8216;more&#8217; to mean seeing Allaah. This is attested to by the hadeeth recorded in Saheeh Muslim and Sunan at-Tirmidhee and related by Suhayb ar-Roomee, may Allaah be pleased with him, in which the Prophet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;</i><strong><span style="color:#000000;">When the people of <em>Jannah</em> enter <em>Jannah</em>, Allaah will say ‘Would you like something I con increase you with?’ They will reply, ‘Have you not whitened our faces? Have you not admitted us into <em>jannah</em> and saved us from the Fire?’</span></strong><i>&#8220;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet then said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Then the veil will be lifted and they will not have been given anything more beloved to them than seeing their Lord.&#8221;</strong></span> In a similar narration, the end reads: &#8220;The Prophet then recited this aayah: <span style="color:#000000;"><b>&#8220;For those who do righteousness is al-Husnaa and more&#8230;&#8221;</b></span> [t]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>ii. Actions of the Tongue</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for actions of the tongue like the remembrance of Allaah, praising and commending Him, reading His Book, sending <em>salaah</em> and salaam upon His Messenger, ordering the good, forbidding the evil, <em>tasbeeh</em>, seeking forgiveness, supplication and other actions that are performed by use of the tongue, without doubt, performing such actions, on a regular basis and often is one of the greatest causes for the increase of eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ibn as-Sa&#8217;dee, may Allaah have mercy upon him, says: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>One of the causes that procures eemaan is to greater the remembrance of Allaah at all times and to also supplicate much, which is the core of worship</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Remembrance of Allaah implants the tree of eemaan in the heart. It nourishes and develops it. The more the servant increases in his remembrance of Allaah, the stronger his eemaan will become.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as eemaan calls to much remembrance, whoever loves Allaah will mention Him much. [As the saying goes: &#8220;Whoever loves something, increases in his mention of it&#8221; [t]] Indeed, love of Allaah is eemaan, or rather, it is its spirit.&#8221; [Al-Tawdeeh wa al-Bayaan, pg. 32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim mentions in his book al-Waabil as-Sayyib that remembrance has a hundred benefits. He listed seventy-three of these benefits [See al-Waabil as-Sayyib, pg. 84 and onwards], such as that remembrance repels Shaytaan. It pleases the Most Beneficent, causes depression and anxiety to disappear and brings joy and happiness. It strengthens the heart and body, illuminates the face and heart, brings about sustenance and many other tremendous benefits that he mentioned, may Allaah have mercy upon him, which are attained because of the remembrance of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Undoubtedly, the greatest and most beneficial benefit in the remembrance of Allaah is the fact that it increases eemaan, strengthens it and stabilizes it. Accordingly, a number of texts are related &#8216;in the Book and Sunnah, which command and encourage the remembrance of Allaah. They beckon for its increase and show its excellence and importance. Allaah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَاذْكُرُوا اللَّهَ كَثِيرًا لَّعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ ..</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; and remember Allaah much so that you may succeed</span>.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Jumu&#8217;ah (62):10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَالذَّاكِرِينَ اللَّهَ كَثِيرًا وَالذَّاكِرَاتِ أَعَدَّ اللَّهُ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةً وَأَجْرًا عَظِيمًا ..</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; and (for) men and women who remember Allaah much, Allaah has prepared for them forgiveness and a great reward.</span>&#8220;</b> [Soorah al-Ahzaab (33):35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8230; إِنَّمَا الْمُؤْمِنُونَ الَّذِينَ إِذَا ذُكِرَ اللَّهُ وَجِلَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;">Indeed, the believers are none other than those whom when Allaah is mentioned, their hearts tremble with fear…</span>&#8220;</b> [Soorah al-Anfaal (8):2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>أَلَا بِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ تَطْمَئِنُّ الْقُلُوبُ&#8230;</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; Verily, it is in the remembrance of Allaah that the hearts (truly) attain tranquility</span>&#8220;</b> [Soorah ar-Ra&#8217;d (13):28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As recorded in Saheeh Muslim, Aboo Hurayrah, may Allaah be pleased with him, reports: &#8220;The Messenger of Allaah was on his way to Makkah when he passed by a mountain known as jumdaan. He said, <i>&#8216;Travel through, this is Jumdaan: the mufarridoon have excelled.’ </i>Someone asked, &#8216;Who are the mufarridoon O Messenger of Allaah?&#8217; He replied, <i>&#8216;Men and women who remember Allaah much.&#8217;</i>&#8221; [Muslim, 4/2062]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Dardaa&#8217;, may Allaah be pleased with him, relates the Prophet saying: <i>&#8220;Should I not inform you of the best of your deeds, the most sanctifying of them before your Lord and which does more to raise your status with Him. (A deed,) that is better for you than the disbursement of gold and money, or battle with the enemy whereby you strike at their necks and they strike at yours?&#8221;</i> They said: &#8220;What is it O Messenger of Allaah?&#8221; He replied: <i>&#8220;Remembrance of Allaah.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Related by Ahmad, 5/195; Ibn Maajah, 2/1245; at-Tirmidhee, 5/459; at-Tabaraanee in ad-Du&#8217;aa&#8217;, 3/1636; al-Haakim, 1/496; Aboo Nu&#8217;aym in al-Hilya, 2/12; al-Baghawee in Sharh as-Sunnah, 5/10 and al-Mundhiree mentioned it in at-Targheeb wa at-Tarheeb, 2/395 via many chains from Ziyaad Ibn Abee Ziyaad from Abee Bahriyyah from Aboo Dardaa&#8217; from the Prophet. Al-Haakim declared: &#8220;This hadeeth has a chain of narration that is saheeh and it has not been related by al-Bukhaaree or Muslim.&#8221; Adh-Dhahabee agreed. Ibn &#8216;Abdil-Barr states: &#8220;This is related with a connection to the Prophet via chains that are good,&#8221; Al-Baghawee and al-Mundharee declared its chain of narration to be hasan.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah Ibn Busr mentioned that a man said to the Prophet : &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah, the rites of eemaan are much for me, so tell me of something that I might hold fast to.&#8221; He answered: <i>&#8220;</i><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Let not your tongue cease from the remembrance of Allaah</strong></span><i>.&#8221;</i>[Related by Ibn Abee Shaybah, 10/301 &amp; 13/458; at-Tirmidhee, 5/458; Ibn Maajah, 2/1246 and al-Haakim, 1/495. At-Tirmidhee declared: &#8220;The hadeeth is hasan ghareeb.&#8221; Al-Haakim said: &#8220;This hadeeth has a chain of narration that is saheeh and it has not been related by al-Bukhaaree or Muslim.&#8221; Adh-Dhahabee agreed. Al-Albaanee mentioned in his checking of al-Kalim at-Tayyib, page 25: &#8220;Its chain of narration is Saheeh&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Recorded in the Saheehayn is the hadeeth of Aboo Hurayrah, may Allaah be pleased with him, in which he reports the Messenger of Allaah as saying: <i>&#8220;</i><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allaah says, ‘Indeed I am as My servant presumes Me to be and I am with him when he remembers Me. So if he remembers Me to himself I remember him to Myself and if he remembers Me amongst a company, I remember him amongst a company that is better than them &#8230;</strong></span><i>&#8220;</i> [Al-Bukhaaree, (13/384 with Fath) and Muslim, 4/2061] Many other texts are likewise indicative of the excellence and importance of remembrance and of the virtue of engaging in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consequently, if a person turns away from all of this and does not engage his tongue with remembrance of Allaah, his tongue will be engrossed with matters besides it such as backbiting, slander, mockery, lies and obscene language. This is because the slave cannot but speak. Thus, if he does not speak with the remembrance of Allaah and of His commands, he will speak of these things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim says: &#8220;For the tongue does not keep quiet at all. It is either a tongue that remembers or a tongue that is frivolous and it has to be one of these two.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the (nature of the) soul; if you do not preoccupy it with truth, it will occupy you with falsehood. It is the (nature of the) heart; if you do not accommodate it with love of Allaah, it will dwell with love of creation and this is a certain reality. It is the (nature of the) tongue, if you do not preoccupy it with remembrance, it will most definitely occupy you with frivolity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, choose for your own self one of the two courses and confer upon it one of the two standings.&#8221; [Al-Waabil as-Sayyib, pages 166- 167 and also see page 87]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>iii. Actions of the Limbs</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the actions of the heart like prayer, fasting, hajj, sadaqah, jihaad and other acts of obedience, they are also reasons for the increase of eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To exert efforts therefore, towards enacting acts of obedience, which Allaah has made incumbent upon His slaves and performing acts that achieve nearness (to Allaah), which Allaah has recommended His servants to undertake and to accomplish these acts in a proficient and complete manner, is one of the most tremendous causes behind the strengthening and increase of eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>قَدْ أَفْلَحَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>الَّذِينَ هُمْ فِي صَلَاتِهِمْ خَاشِعُونَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ عَنِ اللَّغْوِ مُعْرِضُونَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ لِلزَّكَاةِ فَاعِلُونَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ لِفُرُوجِهِمْ حَافِظُونَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِلَّا عَلَىٰ أَزْوَاجِهِمْ أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ غَيْرُ مَلُومِينَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>فَمَنِ ابْتَغَىٰ وَرَاءَ ذَٰلِكَ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْعَادُونَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ لِأَمَانَاتِهِمْ وَعَهْدِهِمْ رَاعُونَ  </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ عَلَىٰ صَلَوَاتِهِمْ يُحَافِظُونَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>أُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْوَارِثُونَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>الَّذِينَ يَرِثُونَ الْفِرْدَوْسَ هُمْ فِيهَا خَالِدُونَ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><b>&#8220;Successful indeed are the believers: those who offer their prayers with all solemnity and full submissiveness; who turn away from al-Laghw; who pay the zakaah; who guard their chastity, except from their wives or those that their right hands possess, for them, they are free from blame. However, whoever seeks beyond that, then they are the transgressors; those who are faithfully true to their amaanaat and covenants and those who strictly guard their prayers. These are indeed the inheritors, who shall inherit Firdaws. They shall abide therein forever.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah al-Mu&#8217;minoon (23):1-11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These precious qualities, each one of them profits and develops eemaan. They are also characteristics of eemaan and fall under its explanation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the attendance of the heart in prayer and the event of the praying person striving with his self to call to mind and heart what he is saying and doing, such as recitation, remembrance, supplication, standing, sitting, bowing and prostration, are reasons for the increase and development of eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah named prayer &#8216;eemaan&#8217; when He said:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8230; وَمَا كَانَ اللَّهُ لِيُضِيعَ إِيمَانَكُمْ &#8230;</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; and Allaah would never cause your eemaan</span></b><span style="color:#000000;"> [<span style="color:#999999;">i.e., the prayers that were performed towards the direction of Jerusalem, before the commandment of changing the qiblah to the Ka&#8217;bah in Makkah. [t]</span>]</span><b><span style="color:#000000;"> to be lost &#8230;</span>&#8220;</b>[Soorah al-Baqarah (2):143]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, concerning the statement of Allaah:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> &#8230; إِنَّ الصَّلَاةَ تَنْهَىٰ عَنِ الْفَحْشَاءِ وَالْمُنكَرِ ۗ وَلَذِكْرُ اللَّهِ أَكْبَرُ &#8230;</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; and establish the prayer. Verily, the prayer prevents from all obscenities and evil deeds. And the remembrance of Allaah is greater &#8230;</span>&#8220;</b> [Soorah al-Ankaboot (29):45]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Prayer is the greatest obstructer of every obscene and evil deed that negates eemaan. In addition, prayer also embodies the remembrance of Allaah, which nourishes and develops eemaan because of His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; And the remembrance of Allaah is greater &#8230;</span>&#8220;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, <em>zakaah</em> also nurtures and increases eemaan, (both) the obligatory type of <em>zakaah</em> and its recommended type, as the Prophet has said, <i>&#8220;… and sadaqah is proof.&#8221;</i> i.e., a proof for the eemaan of its giver. Hence, it is evidence of eemaan and it nourishes and develops it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further, to avert from <em>al-Laghw</em>, which is any speech or action that is void of good. Instead they (i.e., the believers) speak and do well, and abandon evil in both speech and action. This is without doubt, from eemaan and eemaan increases and profits from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why whenever the Companions, may Allaah be pleased with them, and those after them sensed heedlessness or their eemaan was in disarray, they would say to each other, ‘Sit with us so that we may have eemaan for an hour’. So they would remember Allaah and remember his religious and worldly favors causing their eemaan to renew itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Again, abstaining from forbidden and indecent acts, especially, the obscenity of fornication, this is definitely a great sign for eemaan. The believer, because of the fear he has concerning his standing in front of his Lord, he:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">نَهَى النَّفْسَ عَنِ الْهَوَىٰ &#8230;</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; restrained himself from impure evil desires and lusts.</span>&#8220;</b> [Soorah an-Naazi&#8217;aat (79):40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">… in response to the necessity of eemaan and to nourish what he already possesses of eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, observing trusts and contracts and preserving them is from the signs of eemaan and related in a hadeeth: <i>&#8220;… and there is no eemaan for the one who is not trustworthy.&#8221;</i> [Related by Ahmad, 3/135; Ibn Abee Shaybah in both his Musannaf, 11/11 and al-Eemaan, pg.5; Ibn Hibbaan in his Saheeh, (1/208 al-Ihsaan) and al-Baghawee in Sharh as-Sunnah, 1 /75. Al-Baghawee declared, &#8220;This is a hasan hadeeth&#8221; It was declared saheeh by al-Albaanee in his tahqeeq of al-Eemaan by Ibn Abee Shaybah]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you would like to know of the eemaan and religion of a slave, then inspect his condition: does he fulfill all of his trusts and contracts, the verbal and financial or trusts concerning rights? Does he observe the rights, covenants and oaths, the ones between himself and Allaah or those between himself and his fellow servants? If the answer is in the positive then he is a person of religion and eemaan. If however that is not the case, his religion and eemaan will be deficient in accordance to the level of his infringement of these obligations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah ended these <em>aayaat</em> with the issue of safeguarding the prayers with respect to their limits, rights and times. This is because preservation of this, is of similar standing to the water that flows around the garden of eemaan. So it irrigates it, nurtures it and produces its crop upon every occasion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tree of eemaan is in need of constant irrigation at all times; this irrigation is the maintenance of acts of obedience and worship of the day and night. It also demands the obliteration of anything that harms it, such as alien and harmful rocks and growths; this is in reference to the abstention from unlawful matters in both speech and action. Whenever these undertakings are accomplished, this garden will witness its geese and it will produce its assorted crop.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In light of this clarification, the strong effect of righteous actions on the increase of eemaan has become clear to us. It is also clear that the performance and increase of these acts are a tremendous cause for the increase of eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Islaam says: &#8220;The perfection of eemaan is in enacting the commands of Allaah and His Messenger and refraining from the prohibitions of Allaah and His Messenger. Consequently, if one does not perform certain commandments and replaces them by embarking on certain prohibitions; this will result in a proportional decrease of eemaan.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, prayer is eemaan, hajj is eemaan, sadaqah is eemaan, jihaad is eemaan and all the actions that Allaah has ordered His slaves with are eemaan. If the servant does these acts his eemaan will increase and the performance of these actions will be a cause for the increase of his eemaan, on the condition of sincerity and adherence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad al-&#8216;Uthaymeen, may Allaah preserve him, states: &#8220;The increase of eemaan has causes, some of these are: performing acts of obedience because eemaan increases in proportion to the fineness, type and abundance of the action. Thus the finer the action the greater will be the increase of eemaan; the fine aspect of the action is determined by the degree of sincerity and adherence. As for the type of action, the obligatory type is better than the recommended and some forms of worship are more emphasized and virtuous than others; the more virtuous the act of obedience is the greater will be the resultant increase in eemaan. As for the abundance of the action, then eemaan increases as a result of it because action is from eemaan, so it is not surprising that eemaan increases because of an increase of the action.&#8221; [Fath Rabb al-Bariyyah, pg. 65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, other great righteous actions that increase eemaan, which have not yet been mentioned are da&#8217;wah to Allaah and keeping company with virtuous people. Because of the importance and great benefit of these two matters in the increase of eemaan, its discussion is imperative.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for da&#8217;wah to Allaah and to His religion, consulting each other with the truth and patience, calling to the fundamentals of the religion, to the adherence of its laws by way of ordering the good and forbidding the evil and sincerely advising the Muslims, this is all from the incentives and causes for eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With this, the servant perfects himself and others, as Allaah has sworn by time, [Refer to Soorah al-&#8216;Asr (103). [t]] that the whole genus of humans are in a state of loss except for the one who is categorized with four qualities: eemaan and righteous actions, which both constitute the perfection of the self (thirdly) mutual consultation with the truth, which is beneficial knowledge, righteous action and the true religion and (fourthly) mutual consultation with patience in all of this, and with these (last) two, others are perfected.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because da&#8217;wah to Allaah itself and advising His servants are amongst the greatest fortifiers of eemaan. The person involved in da&#8217;wah has to work to aid this da&#8217;wah and establish the proofs and evidences for its realization. He has to undertake matters from their proper channels and approach issues from their rightful paths. These issues are from the ways and channels of eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Islaam states: &#8220;The reason for the presence of eemaan and its constituents sometimes traces back to the servant (himself) and at other times back to others, for example, one is destined to interact with someone who invites him to eemaan, orders him with good and forbids him from evil. He explains to him the signs of the religion, its proofs and evidences. He shows him what to consider, what befalls him, what to take heed from. In addition (to this), there are many other reasons.&#8221; [Al-Fataawa, 7/650]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the reward is always from the same class as the action. So, just as the person strives to perfect his fellow servants, advises them, consults them with truth and to be patience in all this, Allaah will most definitely compensate him with rewards similar to his actions. Allaah will assist him with a light and spirit from Him and with strength of eemaan and tawakkul.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Eemaan and strong tawakkul on Allaah bring about victory over the enemies of the devils of men and jinn as Allaah has said:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّهُ لَيْسَ لَهُ سُلْطَانٌ عَلَى الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><b>&#8220;Verily, he </b>(i.e., Shaytaan)<b> has no power over those who have eemaan and put their trust solely on their Lord.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah an-Nahl (16):99]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, this person is also occupied with aiding the truth and whoever turns to undertake something, then he will most definitely be granted certain triumphs in knowledge and eemaan according to his truthfulness and sincerity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One who commands the good and forbids the evil must therefore remain adherent to truthfulness and sincerity when commanding and forbidding in order for it to bear fruit and produce pure eemaan in him as well as those whom he is propagating to. He must also observe wisdom and leniency when inviting, be patient with those whom he is calling and to have knowledge of that which he is calling them to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If these features are realized within him, his da’wah will bear fruit and benefit by the will of Allaah and it will be a cause for the strengthening of his eemaan and of those whom he is calling.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for keeping company with virtuous people, clinging to them, accompanying them and coveting to benefit from them, this is a great cause for the increase of eemaan. The reason being that these type of gatherings embody reminder of Allaah, fear of Him and His punishment, targheeb, tarheeb and other matters, which are of the greatest of causes towards the increase of eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Allaah says:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">وَذَكِّرْ فَإِنَّ الذِّكْرَىٰ تَنفَعُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><b>&#8220;And remind, for indeed, reminding benefits the believers&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah adh-Dhaariyaat (51):55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>فَذَكِّرْ إِن نَّفَعَتِ الذِّكْرَىٰ سَيَذَّكَّرُ مَن يَخْشَىٰ وَيَتَجَنَّبُهَا الْأَشْقَى</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><b>&#8220;Therefore, remind, in case the reminder benefits; those who fear will remember and the wretched will avoid it.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah al-A&#8217;laa (87):9-11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This shows that possessors of believing hearts benefit greatly from reminders and from being in congregations of remembrance. It provokes activity and resolution within them and obligates profit and elevation. This is in stark contrast to gatherings of frivolity and foolishness, for these are immense reasons for the decrease and fading away of eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To this effect, our righteous predecessors were the most concerned with gatherings of remembrance and the most distant from meetings of frivolity and foolishness. Many of their statements that indicate this have preceded, like the accounts of &#8216;Umayr Ibn Habeeb al-Khatmee and Mu&#8217;aadh Ibn Jabal, may Allaah be pleased with them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is another cause, with which I will end the discussion on these causes, which one must pay attention to and not neglect. The Muslim has to train and adapt himself to fight everything that causes a decrease, weakness or disappearance of eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Since, in relation to eemaan, just as one must enact all the causes that strengthen and develop eemaan, then likewise, in addition to this, one must repel the preventive matters and obstacles (towards the attainment and increase of eemaan). Repelling these are accomplished by the abandonment of disobedience; being repentant of the disobedience one does commit; safeguarding the limbs from the unlawful issues and opposing the trials and afflictions of misconceptions that weaken the desires of eemaan, which are in essence, the desire and love for good. Endeavoring after this can only be accomplished by abandoning desires that (would otherwise) negate those desires (of eemaan), such as desire of the soul for evil and by opposing the soul that constantly commands evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the servant preserves himself from falling into the trials and tribulations of misconceptions and desires, his eemaan will become complete and his certainty will become strong.&#8221; [At-Tawdeeh wa al-Bayaan of Ibn as-Sa&#8217;dee, page 37]</p>

So if you, O servant of Allah, with to cure your heart then it is upon you to be truthful with regards to seeking refuge with Allah and putting your trust in Him, to pray a great deal of superogatory prayers, to perform the actions of obedience to Allah frequently, to pray the night prayer while the people are sleeping, and to treat your heart by making it continuously stick to the remembrances and by befriending only the righteous … and to frequently recite the Qur’an. And Allah will indeed allow all of this to be preserved by him.”</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Ar-Rajaa’</em></strong><strong> (hope and longing) and its Proof</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof for <em>ar-Rajaa’</em> (hope and longing) is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَمَن كَانَ يَرْجُو لِقَاءَ رَبِّهِ فَلْيَعْمَلْ عَمَلًا صَالِحًا وَلَا يُشْرِكْ بِعِبَادَةِ رَبِّهِ أَحَدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So whoever has hope in the meeting with his Lord and in His reward then let him perform righteous actions and not associate anyone in worship with his Lord </strong></span>[18:110]<strong> <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>16</sup></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>16</strong></span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High, “<strong><em>man kaana yarjoo</em></strong>”: meaning he has hope for the reward of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and in seeing Him openly on the Day of Resurrection, whoever has hope in seeing Allaah openly with his eyes on the day of resurrection, then let him perform righteous deeds, he should carry out the means which will enable him to attain this goal, which is the reward of entry into Paradise and of being saved from the Fire and of looking upon the Face of Allaah – this necessarily follows on, because whoever enters Paradise, then he will see Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَمَن كَانَ يَرْجُو لِقَاءَ رَبِّهِ فَلْيَعْمَلْ عَمَلًا صَالِحًا وَلَا يُشْرِكْ بِعِبَادَةِ رَبِّهِ أَحَدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So whoever has hope in the meeting with his Lord and in His reward then let him perform righteous actions</span> </strong>[18:110]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This shows that hope alone is not sufficient, rather there must be action, as for your just having hope in Allaah, but you do not act, then this is to abandon the use of the means. So praiseworthy hope is that which occurs along with righteous action. As for hoping which is not praiseworthy, then it hope which does not have righteous action along with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And righteous action is that which fulfills <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>two conditions</strong></span>:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first</strong>: is that it is done purely and sincerely for Him, the Mighty and Majestic.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second</strong>: is that it is done following the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So an action will not be righteous unless it fulfills these two conditions: that it is done purely and sincerely seeking the Face of Allaah, it does not contain any <em>shirk</em>, and that it should be a correct action, done upon the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>, not containing innovation. So if the two conditions are met then it will be a righteous action, and if any condition is missing, then it will be a corrupt action, it will not benefit the person who does it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So action which contains shirk will be rejected for the person, and likewise action which contains innovation, it will be rejected for the person. He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<span style="color:#808000;">Whoever does an action which is not in accordance with our affair, then it will be rejected</span>” </strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this aayah contains <em>ar-Rajaa’</em> (hope and longing), and that it is an act of worship to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. And it shows that hope will not be correct except along with righteous action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree in disconnected form straight after <u>h</u>adeeth 7350, and reported by Muslim as <u>h</u>adeeth 1718/17 from a <u>h</u>adeeth of ‘Aa’ishah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhaa. </em>And also reported by al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree in connected form as <u>h</u>adeeth 2697 and Muslim as <u>h</u>adeeth 1718/17 from ‘Aa’ishah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhaa, </em>that she said, Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu’ alaihi wa sallam </em>said, “Whoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it will have it rejected”.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh-ul-Usool-ith-Thalaathah : Lesson 06 &#8211; Part A </strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F426074724&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/knowledge-comes-before-speech-and-action" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<h3>:وَقَالَ البُخَارِيُّ رَحِمَهُ اللهُ: بَابٌ: العِلْمُ قَبْلَ القَوْلِ وَالعَمَلِ. وَالدَّلِيلُ قَوْلُهُ تَعَالَى</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And al-Bukhaaree <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaahuta‘aalaa</em> said: “Chapter: Knowledge comes before speech and action; and the proof is:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَاعْلَمْ أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَاسْتَغْفِرْ لِذَنبِكَ وَلِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَاتِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Then know that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and seek forgiveness for your sin and for the believers.</span> </strong>[47:19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong>So He began with knowledge”, before speech and action.<sup>13</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13]: S<strong>haykh Salih Al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhaaree: he was the Imaam Mu<u>h</u>ammad ibn Ismaa‘eel ibn Ibraaheem al-Bukhaaree. Al-Bukhaaree is an ascription to Bukhaaraa, a town in the East. He was the Imaam of the people of <em><u>H</u>adeeth</em>, and a mountain of memorization, may Allaah have mercy upon him, he was the compiler of the <em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em>, which is the most authentic of books after the Book of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “Knowledge comes before speech and action”: because action will not benefit unless it is built upon knowledge. As for action which is built upon ignorance, then it will not benefit the person rather it will be an affliction and misguidance for him on the Day of Resurrection, so precedence must be given to learning knowledge before action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “And the proof”: meaning for this heading is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَاعْلَمْ أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَاسْتَغْفِرْ لِذَنبِكَ وَلِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَاتِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then know that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and seek forgiveness for your sin </strong></span>[47:19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since He began with knowledge, and His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَاسْتَغْفِرْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And seek forgiveness … </strong></span>[47:19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is action. So He the Perfect began with knowledge before action, because action if it is built upon ignorance then it will not benefit the person, so a person should begin with knowledge first and then act upon what he has learnt, this is the foundation.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Proof is He the Most High’s saying:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَالْعَصْرِ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الْإِنسَانَ لَفِي خُسْرٍ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">إِلَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالْحَقِّ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالصَّبْرِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">By Time. Mankind is certainly in loss. Except for those who have <em>eemaan</em> (those who truly believe) and perform righteous deeds, and enjoin one another with the truth and enjoin one another with patience.</span> [103:1-3]</strong><sup style="text-align:justify;">11</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory that you learn these four matters in detail – is there any proof for what the Shaikh has said? That it is obligatory upon us to learn these four matters, and he has promised us that he will not say anything except with a proof, so where is the proof? The proof upon that is His saying, He the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Bismillaahirra<u>h</u>maanirra<u>h</u>eem</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">By Time. Mankind is certainly in loss. Except for those who have <em>eemaan</em> </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(those who truly believe)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> and perform righteous deeds, and enjoin one another with the truth and enjoin one another with patience.</span> </strong>[103:1-3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Except for those who have <em>eemaan</em>”, <strong>this is the first matter</strong>: knowledge, because <em>eemaan</em> cannot be except through knowledge, which is awareness of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, awareness of His Prophet and awareness of the religion of Islaam with the proofs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second matter: </strong>“And they perform the righteous deeds”, this is action upon the knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third matter: </strong>“And they enjoin each other with the truth”, this is calling to the knowledge and action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The fourth matter:</strong> “And they enjoin each other with patience”, upon harm in the path of calling to knowledge and action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying, He the One free of all imperfections:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَالْعَصْرِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">By Time.</span> </strong>[103:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The, “<em>Waw</em>”, is the <em>waw-ul-qasm</em> (the <em>‘waw’</em> of an oath). And <em>Al-‘A<u>s</u>r </em>is a noun upon which an oath is sworn and it is <em>majroor</em>, and the sign that it is <em>majroor</em> is that it has a <em>kasrah</em> upon it. And what is meant is Time and a time period.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, swears by a time period and by Time, and it is something created. And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, swears by whatever He wishes from the creation, but the creation may not swear an oath except by Allaah. And Allaah does not swear an oath except by something which has importance, and which contains a Sign from His Signs, He the Perfect and Most High. So this Time, contains a lesson and has importance, and therefore Allaah swore an oath by Time, and He swore by the night when it covers, and He swore an oath by the daytime brightness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for the creation, then he may not swear an oath except by Allaah. And it is not permissible for us to swear an oath by other than Allaah. He <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu’ alaihi wa sallam </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Whoever swears an oath by other than Allaah, then he has committed unbelief or he has committed shirk.”</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said:<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Whoever is going to swear an oath, then let him swear by Allaah or let him keep silent.”</strong><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah swears by whatever he wishes and he does not swear except by something which has importance and which contains a lesson, so what is the lesson here in this Time? The lessons are tremendous, the succession of the night and the day, and how they interchange and take from each other, this one taking from that one, and that one taking from this one, and they succeed each other in this amazing ordered manner which does not vary or alter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a proof for the Ability of Allaah the Perfect and Most High. And then, whatever occurs within this Time from events and catastrophies and calamities and from favours and blessings and good things, and whatever occurs within this Time, this is from the lessons. And likewise because night and day are an arena for righteous action to be performed in. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> .. وَهُوَ الَّذِي جَعَلَ اللَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَارَ خِلْفَةً </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He </strong>(Allaah)<strong> is the One who made the night and the day to follow each other in succession …</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning they follow each other in succession, this one follows on from this one.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> لِّمَنْ أَرَادَ أَن يَذَّكَّرَ أَوْ أَرَادَ شُكُورًا ..</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">… for whoever wants to be reminded of Allaah or whoever wants to give thanks for Allaah’s favours.</span> </strong>[25:62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in some of the recitations of this <em>aayah, </em>it occurs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">… for the one who wants to remember Allaah …</span> </strong>[25:62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the night and the day are a tremendous bounty to be earned for a person who utilizes them in obedience to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and the arena for action is the night and the day, you have nothing else besides the night and the day, they are the arena for action and for good and pure earning for this world and the hereafter. So in the night and the day there are lessons and there are benefits, so therefore Allaah swore an oath by Time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is this oath sworn upon? It is His saying:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الْإِنسَانَ لَفِي خُسْرٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Mankind is certainly in loss.</span> </strong>[103:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It (Mankind) means all of the descendants of Aadam, He did not exclude anyone, neither the kings nor the leaders, nor the rich people nor the poor people, nor the free people nor the slaves, nor the males nor the females. So, “<em>Al-</em>”, in, “<em>Al-Insaan</em>”, is for <em>istighraaq</em> – to make the word all-inclusive. All of the descendants of Aadam are in loss, meaning they will be in loss and destruction if they waste this precious Time, and they utilize it in disobedience to Allaah and in doing that which will harm them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this Time which is very cheap with many people, time seems prolonged for them, they become weary and bored, and they say, “<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>We want to kill some time</strong></span>”. So they bring amusements, or they travel abroad to spend a holiday and just to spend some time somewhere, or they laugh and joke to use up time. So those people, they use it up and waste it – then it will be loss and regret upon them on the Day of Resurrection. And it could be the source of their true happiness, if only they took care of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So all of the descendants of Aadam are in loss and destruction, except for those who have the <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">four qualities</span></strong> which are: knowledge and action and calling to Allaah and having patience upon any harm which the person meets. So whoever has these four qualities will be saved from this loss.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And having <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah is not possible except through having knowledge, which is knowledge and awareness of Allaah.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"> وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they perform the righteous and correct deeds</span> </strong>[103:3]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning they perform the righteous deeds from the obligatory duties and the recommended duties. So they utilize their time in performing the righteous deeds in that which will benefit them in their religion and in their worldly life, for even worldly action contains good and can contain reward if it is done with the intention of using it as an aid upon obedience. So how about action for the hereafter. So what is important is that you do not waste the time, rather you use it in something which will be to your advantage and benefit you.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالْحَقِّ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they enjoin each other with the truth</span> </strong>[103:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They command the good and they forbid the evil and they call to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and they teach beneficial knowledge and they propagate knowledge and good amongst the people. They become callers to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"> وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالصَّبْرِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they enjoin each other with having patience.</span> </strong>[103:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They have patience upon whatever strikes them. <span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>abr</em></strong></span> in the language means <strong>restraining</strong>, and what is meant by it here is restraining oneself upon obedience to Allaah. And it is of three types:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first one is: </strong>Patience upon obedience to Allaah.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second one is: </strong>Patience in keeping away from those things which Allaah has forbidden.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third one is:</strong> Having patience with those things which Allaah has Pre-decreed to occur.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So the first:</strong> patience upon obedience to Allaah, because the person’s soul desires laziness and desires relaxation, so therefore a person must force it to have patience upon obedience and upon the prayer and upon fasting and upon <em>jihaad</em> in Allaah’s cause even though it may dislike these matters, he should cause it to have patience and he should restrain it on obedience to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And the second: </strong>patience in keeping away from those things Allaah has made forbidden. The soul desires forbidden things and desires. It inclines towards them and is attracted to them, so therefore the person must bind it and restrain it away from the forbidden things, and this requires patience, and it is not easy to prevent the soul from desires and forbidden things. Whoever does not have patience, then his soul will overcome him and incline towards forbidden things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third is: </strong>having patience with the painful things which Allaah has decreed, the calamities which strike a person, from the death of a close relative or loss of wealth or illness which befalls a person, he must have patience upon the pre-ordainment and pre-decree of Allaah and he should not become vexed and he should not become angry, rather he should restrain the tongue from wailing and forbidden lamenting and from displaying anger and he should withhold himself from vexation and he should withhold his limbs from striking the cheeks and from tearing the front-opening of the garments. This is patience upon calamities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for faults, then he should not have patience upon them, rather he should repent to Allaah and flee away from them. However, with regard to calamities which are not something which you yourself have done, rather they are from Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, He has decreed that they will occur to you as a test and a trial or as a punishment for you for sins which you have committed just as there occurs in His saying the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا أَصَابَكُم مِّن مُّصِيبَةٍ فَبِمَا كَسَبَتْ أَيْدِيكُمْ وَيَعْفُو عَن كَثِيرٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whatever calamity strikes you then it is on account of the sins which your hands have committed and Allaah pardons and does not punish, a great deal.</span> </strong>[42:30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a calamity strikes the Muslim in his self or in his wealth or in his children or his close relative or one of his brothers from the Muslims, then it is upon him to have patience and to await reward. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِينَ إِذَا أَصَابَتْهُم مُّصِيبَةٌ قَالُوا<span style="color:#008000;"> إِنَّا لِلَّهِ وَإِنَّا إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُونَ</span></span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أُولَٰئِكَ عَلَيْهِمْ صَلَوَاتٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ وَرَحْمَةٌ ۖ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُهْتَدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Those who, when a calamity strikes them they say, “Indeed we belong to Allaah and we will certainly be returning to Him”. Those people, upon them is praise from their Lord and mercy, and they are the ones who are guided.</span> [2:156-157]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is patience, and from that is having patience upon harm which comes in calling to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, for that is from the calamities. So it is upon you to have patience upon whatever you meet from harm upon the path of good. And do not turn away from doing good, because some people wish to do good, however, if something which he dislikes faces him he then says, “It is not obligatory upon me to enter myself into these matters”. Then he abandons teaching if he is a teacher, he abandons calling to Allaah, he abandons giving the <em>khu<u>t</u>bah</em> if he is a <em>kha<u>t</u>eeb</em> (one who gives the <em>khu<u>t</u>bah</em> in a mosque), he abandons leading the prayer in the mosque, he abandons commanding the good and forbidding the evil – this person has not had patience upon the harm which came to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if you are upon error, then it is upon you to turn back to the truth and to correctness, but if you are upon  something true and you have not erred, then it is upon you to have patience and to await and expect reward and to be aware and to feel that this is in the cause of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and that you will receive reward for it, and that you remember the harm which occurred to the Prophets <em>‘alaihimu<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam </em>and how they had patience and how they strove and fought in Allaah’s cause, until Allaah the Mighty and Majestic gave them victory.</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قَالَ الشَّافِعِيُّ رَحِمَهُ اللهُ:<span style="color:#808000;"> لَوْ مَا أَنْزَلَ اللهُ حُجَّةً عَلَى خَلْقِهِ إِلاَّ هَذِهِ السُّوْرَةَ لَكَفَتْهُمْ</span></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ash-Shaafi‘ee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said: “<strong>If Allaah had not sent down any proof upon his creation except this <em>soorah</em>, then that would have sufficed for them</strong>.”<sup>12</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “Ash-Shaafi‘ee”: He is the Imaam Mu<u>h</u>ammad ibn Idrees Ash-Shaafi‘ee and Ash-Shaafi‘ee is an ascription to his great great grandfather who was called Shaafi‘, and he was from Quraish from Banul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib. He died in the year 204 H, and he was one of the four Imaams. And he said this saying, because Allaah has made clear in this <em>soorah</em> the reasons for wretchedness and the means for true happiness and success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the means for true happiness and success is that the person has these four characteristics: knowledge, and action, and calling, and having patience upon harm in the cause of Allaah the Most High. So Allaah’s proof is established upon His creation through this <em>soorah</em>. Allaah the Perfect says to them &#8211; I have made clear to you the means for true happiness in this short and brief <em>soorah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Qur’aan, all of it, and the Sunnah are details for these four matters. However, this <em>soorah</em> has made clear the means to true happiness and success in general terms, through it the proof has been established upon the creation, and the texts of the Qur’aan and the Sunnah give the details and clarify these four matters. And the speech of Ash-Shaafi‘ee does not mean that this <em>soorah</em> is sufficient for mankind, even if Allaah had not sent down anything else. But rather it has established the proof upon them, because Allaah has made clear in it the means to true happiness and the reasons for total wretchedness, so on the Day of Resurrection no-one can say, “I did not know the means to true happiness and I did not know the reasons leading to total wretchedness”, when he has read this brief and short <em>soorah</em>.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> </strong>الثَّانِيَةُ: العَمَلُ بِهِ  <sup> </sup></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The second: Action upon it.<sup>8</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “Action upon it”: meaning upon the knowledge, since it is not sufficient that a person teaches and learns, rather he must act upon his knowledge. So knowledge without action is just a proof against the person, so knowledge will not be beneficial except with action. As for the person who has knowledge, and he does not act upon it, then he is one upon whom is Anger, because he knows the truth, but he abandons it upon knowledge and insight.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the poet says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>The scholar who does not act upon his knowledge,<br />
</em><em>                        Will be punished before the worshippers of idols</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is mentioned in the noble hadeeth:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إن من أول من تسعر ﺑﻬم النار يوم القيامة ، عالم لم يعمل بعلمه<em> </em></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“That from the first of those for whom the Fire will be made to blaze on the Day of Resurrection will be a scholar who does not act upon his knowledge”.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowledge is joined to action, and action is the fruit of knowledge, so knowledge without action is like a tree without fruit, there is no benefit in it, and knowledge was sent down to bring about action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as action without knowledge will be an affliction and misguidance for its person. If a person acts without knowledge, then his action will be affliction and a burden upon the person. He <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ’alaihi wasallam </em>said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">من عمل عملا ليس عليه أمرنا فهو رد</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Whoever does an action which our affair is not in accordance with, then it will be rejected”.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore we read in <em>Al-Faati<u>h</u>ah</em> in every <em>rak’ah:</em></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">اهْدِنَا الصِّرَاطَ الْمُسْتَقِيمَ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">صِرَاطَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا الضَّالِّينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Guide us upon the straight path, the path of those whom You have favoured, not those upon whom is Your Anger, nor those who are astray.</span> [1:6-7]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah called those people who act without knowledge those who are astray; and those people who have knowledge, but do not act upon it as being those upon whom is Anger. So let us be attentive to that, because it is very important.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a>  A similar <u>h</u>adeeth is reported by At-Tirmidhee, and it is part of a long <u>h</u>adeeth, and it contains the wording, “<strong>Those three people will be  the first of the creation for whom Allaah will make the Fire blaze on the Day of Resurrection</strong>”, from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu ‘anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[However the wording of the <u>h</u>adeeth mentions three men, who will be the first for whom the Fire will blaze – “<strong>So the first of these men will be a person who gathered the Qur’aan…</strong>”.

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 41 : Point 65</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that no-one will enter Paradise except by the mercy of Allaah. And that Allaah will not punish anyone except according to the degree of his sins. And if He were to punish all the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth; the righteous and the wicked amongst them, then He will be punishing them without being unjust to them. And it is not permissible to say about Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, that He is unjust since the unjust is the one who takes something that is not his to take, whereas creation and decree is for Allaah. The creation is His creation and the world is His world. He is not to be questioned about what He does but they will be questioned. And it is not to be said, &#8216;Why?&#8217; and &#8216;How?&#8217; And no-one can enter between Allaah and His creation. </strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/know-that-no-one-will-enter-paradise-except-by-the-mercy-of-allaah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And you should know that no-one will enter Paradise except by the mercy of Allaah,” </strong><em>Al-Jannah</em> (Paradise) is expensive and exalted and it cannot be reached through deeds, no matter how much a person works and even if he does all the acts of obedience then his deeds will not meet up to the favours that have been bestowed upon him. So, if he were to be brought to account for those favours then no deed would remain for him. This is from one aspect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second aspect</strong> is that Paradise is expensive and it does not have a price that can be assessed in terms of deeds or wealth or other than that, no-one knows how tremendous it is except for Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. However, Allaah enters the believers into Paradise by His <em>ra<u>h</u>mah</em> (mercy) by means of their deeds. So, deeds are just a <em>sabab</em> (means) towards entry into Paradise but they do not necessitate entry into Paradise nor are they the price for Paradise. And therefore, he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“No-one from amongst you will enter into Paradise through his deeds.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is in order that a person should not become amazed and complacent at his own deeds. It is not stated so that he should abandon performing deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p><strong> ادْخُلُوا الْجَنَّةَ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Enter into Paradise on account of that which you used to do.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratun-Na<u>h</u>l (16), <em>aayah</em> 32)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Baa here does not show compensation or the price. Rather, the Baa here, <strong>“Bimaa Kuntum Ta’maloon”</strong> is to show a cause or a means, meaning by means of that which he used to do as is shown by the <u>h</u>adeeth that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“None of you will enter into Paradise through his deeds.” So, they said, “Not even you Oh Messenger of Allaah?” So, he said, “Nor even me unless Allaah covers me with His mercy.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, a person should not become amazed at his own deeds. However, a person will not enter into Paradise except by means of deeds. So, if a person did not perform any deeds, he will not enter Paradise because he has not carried out the means.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And Allaah does not punish anyone except in accordance with the degree of his sins,” </strong>Paradise is <em>fa<u>d</u>l</em> (a favour) from Allaah, the Majestic and Most High and is through the mercy of Allaah and deeds are a means for entry into it and the People of the Fire will not be punished except in accordance with their sins. They will not be punished because of the sins of other people and they will not be punished whilst not having any sins. So, this is from `<em>adl</em> (justice). So, Paradise is from <em>al-fa<u>d</u>l</em> (favour) and the Fire is from <em>al-`adl</em> (justice).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And if He were to punish the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth, the righteous ones of them and the wicked ones of them then He will be punishing them without being unjust to them.” </strong>This is just as has preceded that a person no matter how many deeds he performs then his deeds will not match up to even a part of the favours of Allaah upon him. If Allaah were to punish him that would be justice because of his falling short in giving thanks for the favours of Allaah upon him. And this speech which he mentioned is the text of a <u>h</u>adeeth from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“If Allaah were to punish the inhabitants of His heavens and the people of His earth then He would punish them and He would not be unjust to them. And if He were to be merciful to them then His mercy would be better than their deeds deserved.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because He would punish the evildoer on account of his evil acts and He would be punishing the righteous person because of the fact that his deeds did not qualify him for entry into Paradise because he did not match the favours of Allaah upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“It is not permissible to say about Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, that He is unjust,” </strong>Allaah, the Majestic and Most High has declared Himself free of <em><u>dh</u>ulm</em> (oppression, injustice).</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا رَبُّكَ بِظَلَّامٍ لِّلْعَبِيدِ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord is not unjust to the servants.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah Fu<u>ss</u>illat (41), <em>aayah </em>46)</p>
<p><strong>لَا ظُلْمَ الْيَوْمَ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ سَرِيعُ الْحِسَابِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There will be no injustice on this day. Allaah is quick in reckoning.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah Ghaafir (40), <em>aayah</em> 17)</p>
<p><strong>وَلَا يَظْلِمُ رَبُّكَ أَحَدًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord does not wrong anyone.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Kahf (18), <em>aayah </em>49)</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا ظَلَمْنَاهُمْ وَلَٰكِن كَانُوا هُمُ الظَّالِمِينَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">We did not oppress them. However, they were the wrongdoers.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Zukhruf (43), <em>aayah </em>76)</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا ظَلَمْنَاهُمْ وَلَٰكِن كَانُوا أَنفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We did not oppress them but rather they oppressed their own souls.</span> </strong>(Soorah Na<u>h</u>l (16), <em>aayah </em>118)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> reported the words of his Lord, He the Most High that He said: (Hadeeth Qudsi)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“O My servants I have made oppression forbidden for Myself and I have made it forbidden for you to oppress one another so do not commit oppression.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, is a just judge and oppression (<em><u>dh</u>ulm</em>) does not befit Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And oppression is only one taking that which is not His to take whereas creation and decree is for Allaah.” </strong><em>A<u>dh</u>&#8211;<u>dh</u>ulm</em> (oppression) is to wrongfully take the right of the people. And do the people have any right over Allaah? They have no right upon Allaah and no-one can make anything binding upon Allaah. Rather, the right of the servants with Allaah is that He should not punish one who does not associate anything with Him. <span style="color:#800080;">This is a right which He, the Perfect, has given as a favour</span>. And oppression (<em><u>dh</u>ulm)</em> is to put something in other than its due place. So, Allaah does not put punishment upon those who deserve bliss and He does not give bliss to those who deserve punishment. Rather, He gives bliss to those who deserve it and He gives punishment to those who deserve it and this is <em>al-`adl</em> (justice) but as for the opposite then that would be oppression. If He were to punish the people of <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) and bestow honour to the people of disbelief, this would be oppression and Allaah is free of that. It is not possible that He will punish the people of <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) and bestow honour upon the people of disbelief and that He will enter the disbelievers into Paradise and enter the believers into the Fire. This does not befit Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And Allaah; creation and decree are for Him and the creation is His creation and the world is His world.” </strong>Allaah, the Most High said:</p>
<p><strong>أَلَا لَهُ الْخَلْقُ وَالْأَمْرُ ۗ تَبَارَكَ اللَّهُ رَبُّ الْعَالَمِينَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Is not creating and commanding His? Exalted is Allaah, the Lord and nurturer of the whole of creation.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Alaa lahul- khalq,” </strong>Is creating not His?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is to bring things into existence from non-existence. So, all the created being were created by Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, no-one can create along with Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>اللَّهُ خَالِقُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah is the Creator of everything.</span><br />
</strong><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratuz-Zumar (39), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah </em><span style="font-size:1rem;">62)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>أَمْ جَعَلُوا لِلَّهِ شُرَكَاءَ خَلَقُوا كَخَلْقِهِ فَتَشَابَهَ الْخَلْقُ عَلَيْهِمْ ۚ قُلِ اللَّهُ خَالِقُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَهُوَ الْوَاحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Or do they set up partners for Allaah who they claim create with the like of His creation such that the creation is confused for them? Say, Allaah is the Creator of everything and He is the One, the Overpowering Subduer. </span> </strong>(Sooratur-Ra`d (13), <em>aayah </em>16)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Or do they set up partners for Allaah who create with the like of His creation such that the creation would be confused for them?”</strong> Such that that created by the servant resembles that created by Allaah, this is impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Say, “Allaah is the Creator of everything and He is the One, the Overpowering Subduer.”’</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُم مَّا تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَرُونِي مَاذَا خَلَقُوا مِنَ الْأَرْضِ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “Do you see that which you call upon besides Allaah? Show me what they have created upon the earth.”</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Ahqaaf (46), <em>aayah </em>4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“<em>al-khalq</em>,” creating is for Allaah alone, <em>w`al-amar,</em>” and the decree and the command is for Him,” </strong><em>al-amar</em> (command/decree) is legislating and sending down legislation. So, the Creator, He is the one who commands and forbids and legislates for His servants whatever is beneficial for them and He it is Who forbids whatever is harmful for them and it is not for anyone to command or forbid or to obligate an act of worship or to prohibit anything without a proof.</p>
<p><strong>أَمْ لَهُمْ شُرَكَاءُ شَرَعُوا لَهُم مِّنَ الدِّينِ مَا لَمْ يَأْذَن بِهِ اللَّهُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Or do they have partners who legislate things from the religion for them that Allaah has not given permission for.</span> </strong>(Soorah ash-Shooraa (42), <em>aayah</em> 21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the <em>amar</em> (decree/command) is for Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, the command relating to what occurs in creation and relating to what is pre-decreed, <em>w’al amrush-shar`ee</em> (and the command relating to what is legislated), He commands and He prohibits, He, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p><strong>أَلَا لَهُ الْخَلْقُ وَالْأَمْرُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Is not the creating and the command for Him?</span><br />
</strong><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah </em><span style="font-size:1rem;">54)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He made a distinction between <em>khalq</em> (creating) and <em>al-amar</em> (commanding). So, this shows the command is not something created and this contains a refutation of the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>; those who said that the Qur·aan is created and that the speech of Allaah is created. So, Allaah had made a distinction between the creating and between the command. The command is from His speech and His legislation and Allaah has made a distinction between the creation and between the command. So, this proves that the speech of Allaah is not created.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And the world is His world, He, the Majestic and Most High.” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the abodes are three;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly,</strong> <em>daarud-duniya</em> (the abode of this world),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second,</strong> <em>wa daarul-barzakh</em> (intermediate period in the grave),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And the third one,</strong> <em>wa daarul-qaraar wahiyaa al-aakhirah</em> (the abode of permanent residence and it is the Hereafter).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of them belong to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And He will not be asked about what He does but they will be asked,” </strong>He cannot be asked about what He does, He, the Perfect and Most High because His actions contain no deficiency and there is no shortcoming in them. So, they are perfect and precise and they never suffer from any deficiency or any shortcoming and questions are only to be asked about one who has deficiencies or shortcomings in his actions. So, Allaah cannot be asked about what He does because His actions are perfect and complete.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second reason;</strong> it is not just on account of His overpowering and His Lordship as is said by those who say it that He cannot be asked because of His tremendousness, He, the Perfect and Most High and because of His Majesty. However, it is not this alone, rather, He is not to be asked also because His actions are perfect and precise. They do not suffer from any deficiency at all or any flaws, contrary to the created being for he will be asked about his actions because he commits errors and his deeds are deficient and observations are to be made concerning him. So, he will be questioned because he is deficient from every aspect except for those who are rendered complete and aided and supported by Allaah. And therefore, he said, <strong>“But rather they will be questioned.”</strong> This is the difference between the Creator and the created being that Allah is not to be questioned whereas, the created being will be questioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“</strong><strong>And it is not to be said, &#8216;Why?&#8217; and &#8216;How?&#8217; And no-one can enter between Allaah and His creation.</strong><strong>” </strong>No objection is to be raised about Allaah such that it is said, “Why did Allaah create such and such and How did Allaah create these things?” This is not permissible with respect to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. Rather, it is upon us to submit and to comply and to believe that the actions of Allaah are perfect and complete and do not suffer any deficiency or shortcoming. So, even if some of the points of wisdom or the underlying reasons remain hidden to us then still we do not ask about them, rather, we submit. So, if we understand the wisdom and the underlying reason then this is fine but if we do not understand it then we submit and we do not raise objections to Allaah or withhold from action until we know the wisdom or the underlying reason.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lessons 38 : Point 52</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to make one’s deeds purely and sincerely for Allaah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F376132877&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Making one’s deeds purely and sincerely for Allaah such that there is no <em>shirk</em> in it for Allaah will not accept any action except that which is done purely and sincerely for His Face, having no <em>shirk</em> in it nor association of others along with Him in it. And this is one of the <strong>two conditions</strong> for an action to be acceptable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <strong>second condition</strong> is <em>al-mutaaba`ah</em> (following the example of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in doing that action) and acting upon the Sunnah such that the action is in conformity with the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> such that it does not contain <em>bid`ah</em> (innovation) because Allaah does not accept innovation. Rather, He punishes for them even if a person exhausted himself in doing deeds. If he did not make the deeds purely and sincerely for Allaah, then they will be scattered dust. And if a person exhausted himself in doing a deed which is not in conformity with the Sunnah then it will be rejected. And it will not be accepted except along with these two conditions that it is done purely and sincerely for Allaah alone and it’s done in conformity with the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>وَقَالُوا لَن يَدْخُلَ الْجَنَّةَ إِلَّا مَن كَانَ هُودًا أَوْ نَصَارَىٰ ۗ تِلْكَ أَمَانِيُّهُمْ ۗ قُلْ هَاتُوا بُرْهَانَكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ</strong> &#8211; 2:111</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong style="font-size:1rem;">And they (the People of the Book) said no-one will enter Paradise except for one who is a Jew or a Christian. That is their false hope. Say, “Bring your proof if you are speaking the truth.” </strong></span><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah </em><span style="font-size:1rem;">111)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, this is to refute what they are negating.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>بَلَىٰ مَنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ لِلَّهِ وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌ فَلَهُ أَجْرُهُ عِندَ رَبِّهِ وَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ</strong> &#8211; 2:112</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Rather it will be entered by whoever submits his face to Allaah and he is a doer of good then his reward will be with his Lord and there will be no fear upon them nor will they grieve.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>112)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Whoever submits his face to Allaah,” </strong>meaning he makes his deeds purely and sincerely for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“He is a doer of good,” </strong>meaning one who is following the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and this applies to everyone, the Jews and the Christians and the rest of the world, it must be with these two conditions; with purity and sincerity for Allaah and with following the Messenger.</p>

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong> The Explanation – Point [89]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And deeds will be in accordance with conclusions</strong>: So a person should not allow himself to be fooled by his own deeds, even if he is the most righteous of the righteous people. Rather, he should fear that he may have an evil end (conclusion). And judgment is not passed upon anyone that he is from the people of the Fire based upon his actions because the person does not know what he will be given as is concluding deeds. And this is clarified by a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, from a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Ibn Mas`ood (<em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em>, that the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إن أحدكم يجمع خلقه في بطن أمه أربعين يوماً نطفةً، ثم يكون علقة مثل ذلك، ثم يكون مضغةً مثل ذلك، ثم يرسل إليه الملك، فينفخ فيه الروح، ويؤمر بأربع كلمات‏:‏ بكتب رزقه، وأجله، وعمله، وشقي أو سعيد‏.‏ وإن أحدكم ليعمل بعمل أهل الجنة حتى ما يكون بينه وبينها إلا ذراع، فيسبق عليه الكتاب، فيعمل بعمل أهل النار فيدخلها، وإن أحدكم ليعمل بعلم أهل النار حتى ما يكون بينه وبينها إلا ذراع، فيعمل بعمل أهل الجنة فيدخلها‏</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“The creation of each one of you is brought together in his mother’s womb for forty days as a drop of fluid; then he becomes a clot for a similar period; then a piece of flesh for a similar period; and then the angel is sent to him and the soul is breathed into him.  And he (the angel) is commanded to write four things: to write his provision and his life span and his actions and whether he would be a wretched person (a person of the Hellfire) or a fortunate person (a person of Paradise). And one of you performs the actions of the people of Paradise until there is nothing between him and it except a cubit and then the writing overcomes him and he acts with the actions of the people of the Hellfire and so he enters it.  And one of you may act with the actions of the people of the Fire until there is nothing between him and it except for a cubit (a forearm’s span) and then he acts with the actions of the people of Paradise, and so he enters it.”</span></em> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, therefore, a person fears having an evil end (conclusion). And judgment of having an evil conclusion is not passed upon someone since the person does not know the conclusion that will be given to him, because <em>tawbah</em> (repentance) wipes away whatever came before it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Say to the unbelievers, “If they desist (from their unbelief), then whatever came before will be forgiven for them.”</span></em> (Sooratul-Anfaal (8), <em>aayah </em>38)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, actions are in accordance with their conclusions (that which is final from them).  However, from the subtle kindness of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, towards His servants, is that <strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">whoever lives upon good, then He gives him a good conclusion; and whoever lives upon evil, then He gives him an evil conclusion</span></strong>. So therefore, a person should act and apply the necessary means and should have good thoughts concerning Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And some people say, “<strong>I will repent before I die</strong>.” Then we say to him, “<strong>And do you know when you are going to die?</strong>” It is possible that you could die in a sudden moment such that you are not able to repent; and also, you do not know whether your repentance will be acceptable or not because repentance has conditions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [89][2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Footnotes :</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] <em><u>H</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree (no. 3208) and by Muslim (no. 2643). Reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree in the book: At the beginning of Creation and also in the book of <em>Al-Qadr</em> (Pre-decree), and by Muslim in the book of Pre-decree.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Translator’s Side Point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) said in his notes to A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>a<u>h</u>aawiyyah with regard to this point: “This phrase is part of a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Sahl ibn Sa`ad as-Saa`idee, reported by A<u>h</u>mad and Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree.” He mentions that he has verified it in his checking of the book As-Sunnah of Ibn Abee `Aa<u>s</u>im. The wording of this <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> in Bu<u>kh</u>aaree (no. 6493) is part of a longer <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>; and the relevant wording here is that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إِنَّ الْعَبْدَ لَيَعْمَلُ فِيمَا يَرَى النَّاسُ عَمَلَ أَهْل الْجَنَّةِ، وَإِنَّهُ لَمِنْ أَهْلِ النَّارِ، وَيَعْمَلُ فِيمَا يَرَى النَّاسُ عَمَلَ أَهْل النَّارِ وَهْوَ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، وَإِنَّمَا الأَعْمَالُ بِخَوَاتِيمِهَا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“A servant may act with regard to what the people see with the actions of the people of Paradise, but in reality he is from the people of the Fire; and he may act with regard to what the people see with the actions of the people of the Fire, when he is actually from the people of Paradise. And indeed, actions are in accordance with their conclusions.”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In an earlier lesson, we mentioned that this was an explanation given by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Ibn `U<u>th</u>aymeen <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah,</em> to the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u> </em>of Ibn Mas`ood that we had before.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Righteous Deeds ascend to Allah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(To Him ascend the good words,)</span> means, words of remembrance, recitation of Qur&#8217;an, and supplications. This was the view of more than one of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jarir recorded that Al-Mukhariq bin Sulaym said that &#8220;`Abdullah bin Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, said to them, &#8220;If we tell you a Hadith, we will bring you proof of it from the Book of Allah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>When the Muslim servants says, `Glory and praise be to Allah, there is no god worthy of worship except Allah, Allah is Most Great and blessed be Allah,&#8217; an angel takes these words and puts them under his wing, then he ascends with them to the heaven. He does not take them past any group of angels but they seek forgiveness for the one who said them, until he brings them before Allah, may He be glorified.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, recited:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">(To Him ascend the good words, and the righteous deeds exalt it).&#8221;</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that An-Nu`man bin Bashir, may Allah be pleased with him, said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>(Those who remember Allah and glory Allah by saying, `Glory be to Allah, Allah is most Great, all praise is due to Allah and La ilaha illallah, these words go around the Throne buzzing like bees, mentioning those who said them. Would one of you not like to have something with Allah mentioning him)&#8221;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was also recorded by Ibn Majah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(and the righteous deeds exalt it).</span> Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The good word is the remembrance of Allah, may He be exalted, which is taken up to Allah, and the righteous deed is the performance of obligatory duties. Whoever remembers Allah when doing an obligatory duty, his deed carries his remembrance of Allah and takes it up to Allah, may He be exalted. Whoever remembers Allah and does not perform the obligatory duties, his words will be rejected, as will his deed.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>[The below is the Text from the Book]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Chapter 26 : You Will Not Enter Paradise By Your Deeds Alone</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[131] The People of Hadeeth believe and testify that no one is entitled to Paradise, even if he had performed good deeds and his worship was the most sincere, or his obedience was the purest obedience and his way was a pleasing one, unless Allaah favours him, thereby granting it to him, through His Blessings and Graciousness. Since the good deeds which the person performed was not made easy for him except by the facilitation of Allaah, Mighty is His Name. So if He had not facilitated it for him, the person would not have been able to accomplish this deed and (similarly) if He did not guide him to it he would never have accomplished it out of his own effort and exhoflation. Allaah, The Most Mighty and The Most Majestic says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَلَوْلَا فَضْلُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُ مَا زَكَىٰ مِنكُم مِّنْ أَحَدٍ أَبَدًا وَلَٰكِنَّ اللَّهَ يُزَكِّي مَن يَشَاءُ ۗ وَاللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And had it not been for the Grace of Allah and His Mercy on you, not one of you would ever have been pure from sins. But Allah purifies (guides to Islam) whom He wills, and Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower.&#8221;</span> (An-Nur 24:21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَقَالُوا الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِي هَدَانَا لِهَٰذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لِنَهْتَدِيَ لَوْلَا أَنْ هَدَانَا اللَّهُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And they will say, &#8220;Praise to Allah , who has guided us to this; and we would never have been guided if Allah had not guided us.&#8221;</span> (Al-A&#8217;raf 7:43)</p>

Video Courtesy : Brother Bilal Nahim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(What is) the way to strive against the soul [Inside] that is ever commanding [One] to do Evil?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh &#8216;Abdullah Al-Bukhaaree:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Strive against It.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And those who strive for Our sake [from the Messenger sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam, his companions, and those who followed their way], We will most certainly show them our paths. [Al-&#8216;Ankabut 69]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every person is such that it is a must that he strive against himself. It is well known that the Nafs al-Ammarah bi-l-Su&#8217; [the soul inside that is ever commanding one to do evil] takes him here and there. So it is upon him to remember that Allah, Majestic and All-High, sees him and has full knowledge of him. He knows the eyes that betray trusts and that which the chests keep hidden. And that He, Majestic and All-High [is such that] nothing at all escapes Him. So it is upon him to keep bringing to his mind at all times that Allah sees him and has full knowledge of him; that he fear Him; that he repent to Allah; that he push his soul to do good, always and ever; and that he strive his utmost against it to do acts of obedience [to Allah] and make it remain upon acts of obedience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he hears the call [to prayer], he gets up and aims to beat others to the mosque; and he prays, if it&#8217;s the time for performing one of known routine [Sunnah prayers] or the like of that; he prays [general] voluntary [prayers]; he recites Qur&#8217;an; he is ready in the first line [of the congregation], and in this manner, he strives against his soul. And he recites the Qur&#8217;an, memorizes from it what he is able to, and shows eagerness to gain [Islamic] knowledge- he strives his utmost against his soul. If he were to tame it just a little, the soul would get tamed: It&#8217;s over, it would give in to him. But it needs to be checked on always, on an ongoing basis. Always, and on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And let him not feel secure from Allah’s long plan [that sinners enjoy for a time but finally get the punishment they deserve]. And let him not feel secure from Allah&#8217;s long plan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah Al-Aiim [the Exalted], Lord of the Great Throne, that He make us and you from those who listen to a speech and follow the best of it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">From Khuraym ibn Faatik al-Asadee -radiyallaahu `anhu- that the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;The people are four, and the deeds are six.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the people are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[i] one granted plenty in this world and in the Hereafter, and</strong><br />
<strong> [ii] one granted plenty in this world, poor in the Hereafter and,</strong><br />
<strong> [iii] one poor in this world, granted plenty in the Hereafter and,</strong><br />
<strong> [iv] one wretched in this world and in the Hereafter;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and the deeds are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[i &amp; ii] The two which are binding, and</strong><br />
<strong> [iii &amp; iv] like for like, and</strong><br />
<strong> [v] ten times more, and</strong><br />
<strong> [vi] seven hundred times more:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[i &amp; ii] So the two which are binding are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever dies as a Muslim, a Believer, not associating anything with Allaah &#8211; then Paradise is binding for him; and whoever dies as a Disbeliever &#8211; then the Fire is binding for him; and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[iii &amp; iv] Whoever intends an evil deed but does not do it, and Allaah knows that his heart felt it and he desired it, then it is written as a good deed for him; and whoever intended an evil deed then it is not written against him; and whoever did it then it is written as one, and it is not multiplied for him, and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[v] whoever did a good deed &#8211; then ten times its like is written for him, and [vi] whoever spends something in Allaah&#8217;s cause, then it is multiplied for him seven hundred times over. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">Reported by Ahmad (4/345), Ibn Hibbaan (no.31), and Ibn Abee Shaybah in his &#8216;Musnad&#8217; (2/38/2).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaanee declared its chain of narration to be &#8216;Saheeh&#8217;.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Advising the one who says &#8220;Taqwa is here&#8221; and he continues to Sin</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>A Doubt and its Rebuttle</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 15:</strong> <span style="color:#993300;">What lead to this question is that nowadays there is a group of people when they are called to worship Allaah they say: “Allaah is the Rabb of the hearts.” We would like also that you comment on this response?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong> We say that Allaah is indeed the Rabb of the hearts as well as the tongues. He is not the Rabb of the hearts only; and if the hearts become good then the limbs become good, because the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, there is a piece of flesh in the body, if it becomes good [reformed], the whole of the body becomes good but if it gets spoilt the whole body gets spoilt and that is the heart.</span> [29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Hadeeth renders the futile and false the claim by some, who when you advise him in regard to certain things with which he disobeys Allaah, he says: “at-Taqwaa [30] is right here,” and he points towards his chest.[31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His is a word of truth intended to imply something futile. In fact a word may be true in its general sense, but the speaker intends to imply by it a futile meaning. Indeed think of the Saying of Allaah, The Most High, concerning the Mushriks:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Mushriks will say: “If Allaah had willed, we would have not committed Shirk, nor would our fathers, and we would not have forbidden anything [against His Will]!</span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-An’aam (6): 148].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, they said: “If Allaah had willed, we would have not committed Shirk,” and they were truthful in that which they said. Because if Allaah had willed, they would have not committed Shirk. They, however, did not intend the truth by using this word. Rather, they wanted to justify their staying on their Shirk and the lifting of punishment from upon them. This is why Allaah, The Most High, Said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Likewise belied those who were before them, [they argued falsely with Allaah’s Messengers], till they tasted of Our Wrath.</span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-An’aam (6): 148].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, of no avail to them was the use of al-Qadar [32] [Allaah’s Pre-decree] as a plea when they intended it to be a justification for continuing on their Shirk, and an excuse for lifting the blame and punishment from upon themselves. [33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The actual fact, however, is exactly as they have put it: “If Allaah had not willed, they would not have committed Shirk,” as Allaah, The Most High, said to His Messenger:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Follow what has been inspired to you [O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم] from your Rabb, Laa Ilaaha Illaa Huwa [none has the right to be worshipped but He] and turn aside from the Mushriks. Had Allaah willed, they would have not committed Shirk.</span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-An’aam (6): 106-107].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is, however, a difference between the two cases. In the latter case, Allaah Said to His Prophet (what means): “Had Allaah willed, they would have not committed Shirk,” in order to clarify that their Shirk occurs by His Will, and that He, The One free of all imperfections, The Most High, has a Wisdom as to the committing of Shirk by them; and in order to comfort His Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) that this action of theirs (Shirk) takes place by His, The Exalted and Most High’s, Will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the important thing is that the person who says when you give him advice: “at-Taqwaa is here [i.e. in his heart],” has said a true word indeed. However, he intended by it something futile and false, because the one who said: “at- Taqwaa is here&#8230;” is the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم, the same one who also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Verily, there is a piece of flesh in the body, if it becomes good [reformed], the whole of the body becomes good&#8230;”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If there is Taqwaa in the heart, then it is imperative that there is Taqwaa in the limbs, and the outward actions are a sign of the inward actions of the heart.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[29] An agreed upon hadeeth. See Saheeh al-Bukhaaree, vol.1, no. 49.<br />
[30] The true meaning of at-Taqwaa is fearing Allaah and hoping for His Mercy by executing His Commands and staying away from all that He has forbidden.<br />
[31] The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) in the authentic hadeeth reported by Muslim said: <span style="color:#008000;">“A Muslim is the brother of a Muslim. He neither oppresses him nor humiliates him nor looks down upon him. The Taqwaa is here [and while saying so] he pointed towards his chest thrice.”</span> See Saheeh Muslim, vol. 4, no.6219.<br />
[32] Al-Qadar: Allaah’s Pre-ordainment of the creation in accordance with His Foreknowledge, and in accordance with His Wisdom.<br />
[33] In his book Sharh al-Usool ath-Thalaathah, Shaykh Muhammd Bin ‘Uthaymeen, may Allaah’s Mercy be upon him, said:<span style="color:#008000;"> “If there had been any excuse for them in al-Qadar then Allaah would not have sent down His Punishment upon them.”</span> See Sharh al-Usool ath-Thalaathah [English Translation by brother Daawood Burbank], p.186, Daar al- Hidaayah Publishing, Birmingham, U.K.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">How to Overpower One’s Own Soul to Do Good &#8211; Shaykh ʿAlī al-Ḥaddādī حفظه الله<br />
Translated by Mikail ibn Mahboob Ariff حفظه الله<br />
Video Courtesy: Brother Bilal Nahim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ʿAlī ibn Yaḥyá al-Ḥaddādī said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong>The question] says:</strong> “How can I fight my [own] soul in [making myself] love acts of obedience, seeking knowledge, learning knowledge, and praying in congregation?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How do you fight against your soul…. This means you compel it. Compel your soul. Your soul says, “No, don’t attend the lesson.” Tell it: “Rather, I will attend the lesson.” Start your car and head off to the lesson.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>This is the solution.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You hear the call [to the prayer] while your soul is feeling sluggish, loving sleep. Tell it: “No, there’s no [more] sleep; there’s prayer.” Get up, perform ablution, and walk to the mosque.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once, twice, three times, it’s over. [Your soul] will become compliant. Your soul will become compliant and give in to you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if you pamper it—every time it tells you, “Don’t do it,” you say, “Hearing and obeying”—it will overpower you. You will not be able to direct it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So then the issue, after Allāh gives one true success and [one] puts [his] trust in Allāh, is one of your overpowering your soul and compelling it, and it will become compliant for you after one, two or three times, if Allāh wills.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And the heavens and the earth wept not for them, nor were they given respite)</strong> &#8212; <strong>do the heavens and the earth weep for anybody</strong>&#8216; He, may Allah be pleased with him, said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>`Yes, there is no one who does not have a gate in the heavens through which his provision comes down and his good deeds ascend. When the believer dies, that gate is closed; it misses him and weeps for him, and the place of prayer on earth where he used to pray and remember Allah also weeps for him. </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But the people of Fir`awn left no trace of righteousness on the earth and they had no good deeds that ascended to Allah, so the heavens and the earth did not weep for them</p>

<p><strong>Explanation of Good Life as mentioned in 16:97</strong></p>



<p><strong>مَنْ عَمِلَ صَالِحًا مِّن ذَكَرٍ أَوْ أُنثَىٰ وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَلَنُحْيِيَنَّهُ حَيَاةً طَيِّبَةً ۖ وَلَنَجْزِيَنَّهُمْ أَجْرَهُم بِأَحْسَنِ مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ</strong> &#8211; 16:97</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-black-color">Whoever works righteousness &#8211; whether male or female &#8211; while being a true believer verily, to him We will give a good life, and We shall certainly reward them in proportion to the best of what they used to do.</span></strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color:#a43a1c;" class="has-inline-color"><strong>From Tafsir ibn Kathir</strong> (Darussalam english Publication)</span></p>



<p><strong>Righteous Deeds and their Reward</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">This is a <strong>promise from Allah</strong> to those Children of Adam, male or female, who do righteous deeds &#8211; deeds in accordance with the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Prophet, with a heart that believes in Allah and His Messenger , while believing that these deeds are commanded and enjoined by Allah. Allah promises that He will give them a good life in this world and that He will reward them according to the best of their deeds in the Hereafter. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>The good life includes feeling tranquility in all aspects of life</strong>. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">It has been reported that Ibn `Abbas and a group (of scholars) interpreted it to mean <strong>good, lawful provisions</strong>. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">It was reported that `Ali bin Abi Talib interpreted as <strong>contentment</strong>. This was also the opinion of Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah and Wahb bin Munabbih. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">`Ali bin Abi Talhah recorded from Ibn `Abbas that it meant <strong>happiness</strong>. Al-Hasan, Mujahid and Qatadah said: &#8220;<strong>None gets (this﴾ good life ﴿mentioned) except in Paradise</strong>.&#8221; </p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Ad-Dahhak said: &#8220;It means lawful provisions and worship in this life&#8221;. Ad-Dahhak also said: &#8220;<strong>It means working to obey Allah and finding joy in that</strong>.&#8221; The correct view is that a good life includes all of these things. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">As found in the Hadith recorded by Imam Ahmad from `Abdullah bin `Amr that the Messenger of Allah said:<br />« قَدْ أَفْلَحَ مَنْ أَسْلَمَ، وَرُزِقَ كَفَافًا، وَقَنَّعَهُ اللهُ بِمَا آتَاه »</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">(<strong>He who submits (becomes a Muslim) has succeeded, is given sufficient provisions, and is content with Allah for what he is given</strong>.) </p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">It was also recorded by Muslim.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah<br />
Taken from ‘Miftah dar as-Sa’ada’ (key to the land of happiness)<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The saying of Allaah Ta’ala :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>((By <em>Al-‘Asr</em> (the time). Verily! Man is in loss, except those who believe and do righteous good deeds, and recommend one another to the truth and recommend one another to patience.))</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ash-Shafiee – may Allaah be pleased with him – said: ‘If all the people reflected over this <em>Soorah</em> it would be sufficient for them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The explanation of this is that this <em>Soorah</em> has four levels, and by completing these, a person can achieve the highest goal in being complete.</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>The first is: Knowing the truth.</li>
<li>The second: his acting upon the truth.</li>
<li>The third: Him teaching the one who is deficient in the truth.</li>
<li>The fourth: Being patient in learning the truth, and acting upon it, and teaching it.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> mentioned these four levels in this <em>Soorah</em>, and Allaah<em>Subhanahu</em> testified in this <em>Soorah</em> by al-Asr (the time) that everyone is in loss, except those who believe and do righteous, good deeds and they are those who knew the truth, and they testified to the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the above is a level.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They did righteous, good deeds and they are those who performed worship with what they knew about the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a level.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They advise with the truth; they advise one another, teaching and guiding each other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the third level.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They advise with patience; they were patient with the truth, and they advised each other with patience upon the truth, and to be steadfast.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is the fourth level.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the end of completeness; indeed completeness is that a person is complete in himself, and completes others.  His completeness is by correcting his two strengths, the strength of knowledge and the strength of actions.  Correction of the strength of knowledge is with <em>Emaan</em>, and correction of the strength of actions is by doing righteous deeds, and by completing people other than himself, and by learning this knowledge, and being patient upon it, and his recommending with patience upon knowledge and action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this <em>Soorah</em>, even though it is brief, is one of the most collective soorahs of the Qur’aan for goodness from all its different angles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allaah Who has made the Qur’aan sufficient for everything, a cure from every disease, a guidance to all that is good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 align="Center"><a href="#">Imam Al-Nawawi&#8217;s Riyad-us-Saliheen</a><br />
Chapter 19<br />
Heretics doing desirable or undesirable deeds</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And those who say: `Our Rubb! Bestow on us from our wives and our offspring the comfort of our eyes, and make us leaders of the Muttaqun (the pious)&#8221;.</b></span><b> (25:74)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And We made them leaders, guiding (mankind) by Our Command&#8221;.</b></span><b> (21:73)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>171.</b> Jarir bin `Abdullah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: We were with Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) shortly after dawn when there came to him some people clad in woollen rags, or covered with sleeveless blankets; and with swords hanging down from their necks. Most of them rather, all of them, belonged to the Mudar tribe. The face of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) changed when he saw them starving. Then he went into his house and came out; then he commanded Bilal (May Allah be pleased with him) to proclaim Adhan (call to prayers). So he proclaimed Adhan and recited Iqamah and the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) led the Salat. Then he delivered a Khutbah saying,<span style="color:#ff0000;"> &#8220;O mankind! Be dutiful to your Rubb, Who created you from a single person (Adam), and from him (Adam) He created his wife (Eve), and from them both He created many men and women; and fear Allah through Whom you demand your (natural) rights, and do not sever the relations of kinship. Surely, Allah is Ever an All-Watcher over you.&#8221;</span> (4:1) He also recited the Ayah which is in the end of Surat Al-Hashr:<span style="color:#ff0000;"> &#8220;O you who believe! Fear Allah and keep your duty to Him. And let every one look what he has sent forth for the tomorrow&#8221;.</span> (59:18). Thereafter, every man gave in charity Dinar, Dirham, clothes, measure-fulls of wheat and measure-fulls of dates till he said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;(Give in charity) be it half a date&#8221;</span>. Then a man of the Ansar came with a bag which was difficult for him to hold in his hand. Thereafter, the people came successively (with charity) till I saw two heaps of food and clothes. I noticed that the face of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was glowing like that of the bright moon or glittering gold. Then he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Whosoever introduces a good practice in Islam, there is for him its reward and the reward of those who act upon it after him without anything being diminished from their rewards. And whosoever introduces an evil practice in Islam, will shoulder its sin and the sins of all those who will act upon it, without diminishing in any way their burden&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>172.</b> Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The first son of Adam* takes a share of the guilt of every one who murders another wrongfully because he was the initiator of committing murder&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* The son of Adam in the Hadith is said to be Qabil. Allah tells us about his story in Surat Al-Ma&#8217;idah (The Table spread with Food). Verses 27-31.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 align="Center"><a href="#">Imam Al-Nawawi&#8217;s Riyad-us-Saliheen</a><br />
Chapter 49<br />
Making Judgment of people keeping in view their evident actions and leaving<br />
their hidden Actions to Allah (swt)</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;But if they repent and perform As-Salat (Iqamat-As-Salat), and give Zakat, then leave their way free. Verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221;</b></span><b> (9:5)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>390.</b> `Abdullah bin `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;I have been commanded (by Allah) to fight people until they testify that there is no true god except Allah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and perform Salat and pay Zakat. If they do so, they will have protection of their blood and property from me except when justified by Islam, and then account is left to Allah&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>391.</b> Abu Abdullah bin Tariq bin Ashyam (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He who professes La ilaha illallah (There is no true god except Allah), and denies of everything which the people worship besides Allah, his property and blood become inviolable, and it is for Allah to call him to account&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>392.</b> Al-Miqdad bin Al-Aswad (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I said, &#8220;Tell me, O Messenger of Allah, if I meet an infidel, and we fight together, and he cuts off my hands with his sword, then hides from me behind a tree and (then) says he has submitted himself to Allah. Shall I kill him after he has said it?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Do not kill him.&#8221; I submitted</span>, &#8220;But O Messenger of Allah, he cut off one of my hands and only then he said it.&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) then replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Do not kill him, for if you do so, he will be in the position in which you were before you killed him (i.e., he will be considered a Muslim and thus his life will be inviolable), and you will be in the position in which he was before he made his testimony (i.e., your life will not be inviolable, for his heirs can ask for Qisas)&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>393.</b> Usamah bin Zaid (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) sent us to Huraqat, a tribe of Juhainah. We attacked that tribe early in the morning and defeated them,<span style="color:#800000;"> (then)</span> a man from the Ansar and I caught hold of a man (of the defeated tribe). When we overcame him, he said: `La ilaha illallah (There is no true god except Allah).&#8217; At that moment, the Ansari spared him, but I attacked him with my spear and killed him. By the time we went back to Al-Madinah, news had already reached Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). He said to me, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">O Usamah, did you kill him after he professed La ilaha illallah (There is no true god except Allah)?&#8217;</span>&#8216; I said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! He professed it only to save his life.&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) repeated,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Did you kill him after he had professed La ilaha illallah?</span>&#8221; He went on repeating this to me until I wished I had not embraced Islam before that day (so that I would have not committed this sin).<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Did you kill him in spite of his professing La ilaha illallah?&#8221;</span> I said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! He said out of fear of our arms.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Why did you not cut his heart open to find out whether he had done so sincerely or not?</span>&#8221; He continued repeating it until I wished that I had embraced Islam only that day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>394.</b> Jundub bin `Abdullah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) dispatched a contingent of the Muslims to a tribe of the polytheists. The two sides met (in combat) at one place. A man among the polytheists was so dashing that, whenever he intended to kill a man from Muslims, he killed him. Amongst the Muslims, too, was a man looking forward to (an opportunity of) his (polytheist&#8217;s) unmindfulness. He (the narrator) said: We talked that he was Usamah bin Zaid (May Allah be pleased with him). When he raised his sword, he (the soldier of the polytheists) uttered: &#8220;La ilaha illallah (There is no true god except Allah).&#8221; But he (Usamah bin Zaid) killed him. When the good news of victory reached Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) he asked him (about the events of the battle), and he informed him about the man (Usamah) and what he had done. He (Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) sent for him and asked him why he had killed him. He (Usamah) said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, he struck the Muslims and killed such and such of them.&#8221; And he named some of them. (He continued): &#8220;I attacked him and when he saw the sword he said: `La ilaha illallah.&#8221;&#8217; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Did you kill him?</span>&#8221; He (Usamah) replied in the affirmative. The Messenger of Allah then remarked,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;What would you do with regard to (the utterance): La ilaha illallah, when it comes (before you) on the Day of Resurrection?&#8221;</span> He (Usamah) said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Beg forgiveness for me&#8221;<span style="color:#008000;">.</span> He (the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;What would you do with regard to (the utterance): La ilaha illallah, when it comes (before you) on the Day of Resurrection?&#8221;</span> He (Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) added nothing to it but kept repeating,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;What would you do with regard to (the utterance): La ilaha illallah, when it comes (before you) on the Day of Resurrection?&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>395.</b> `Abdullah bin `Utbah bin Mas`ud reported: I heard `Umar bin Al-Khattab (May Allah be pleased with him) reported saying:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;In the lifetime of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) some people were called to account through Revelation. Now Revelation has discontinued and we shall judge you by your apparent acts. Whoever displays to us good, we shall grant him peace and security, and treat him as a near one. We have nothing to do with his insight. Allah will call him to account for that. But whosoever shows evil to us, we shall not grant him security nor shall we believe him, even if he professed that his intention is good.&#8221;</span><br />

Chapter 12<br />
Urging towards increasing Good<br />
Actions in later part of Life</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Did We not give you lives long enough, so that whosoever would receive admonition, &#8211; could receive it? And the warner came to you.&#8221;</b></span><b> (35:37)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn `Abbas and others said that &#8220;long enough&#8221; in the Verse means sixty years. The Hadith which follows supports this. Others said it means eighteen years; Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Al-Kalbi and Masruq said it means forty years, it has also been reported by Ibn Abbas and others that whenever the people of Al-Madinah turned forty years of age, they would devote themselves completely to worship. &#8220;<span style="color:#800000;">Long enough</span>&#8221; in the Verse has also been interpreted to mean the age of puberty. Ibn `Abbas and the majority of Muslim scholars said that the &#8220;<span style="color:#800000;">warner</span>&#8221; in the Verse refers to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). `Ikrimah bin `Umaiyyah and others interpreted this word as the grayness or whiteness of hair&#8221;. Allah knows better.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>112.</b>  Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah excuses and grants forgiveness to a person until he attains the age of sixty years&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>113.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) said:<span style="color:#008000;"> `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) used to make me sit with the noble elderly men who had participated in the battle of Badr. Some of them disliked it and said to `Umar: </span>&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">Why do you bring in this boy to sit with us when we have sons like him</span>?&#8221; `Umar replied: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Because of the status he has, which you already know about (i.e., belongs to the source of knowledge and the house of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam))</span>.&#8221; One day, `Umar called me and seated me in the gathering of those people; and I think that he called me just to show them (of my religious knowledge). `Umar then questioned them (in my presence). <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;How do you interpret the ayah of Allah</span>:<span style="color:#ff0000;"> `When there comes the Help of Allah (to you, O Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) against your enemies) and the Conquest (of Makkah).&#8221;</span>&#8216; Someone said that when Allah&#8217;s Help and the Conquest (of Makkah) came to us, we were called upon to celebrate the Praise of Allah and ask for His forgiveness. Some others remained silent and did not utter a word. Thereupon `Umar asked me: &#8220;Ibn `Abbas! <span style="color:#008000;">Do you say the same</span>.&#8221; I replied: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;No&#8221;</span>. He said:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;What do you say then?&#8221;</span> I replied: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;That is the sign of the Prophet&#8217;s death about which he had been informed. Allah, the Exalted, says</span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;<span style="color:#ff0000;">When there comes the help of Allah (to you, O Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) against your enemies) and the Conquest (of Makkah)&#8217;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So declare the remoteness of your Rubb from every imperfection, and ask for His forgiveness. Verily, He is the One Who accepts the repentance and Who forgives&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On that `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) said: &#8220;I do not know anything about it other than what you have said&#8221;.<br />
[Al-Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>114</b>.  &#8216; Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) said: After the revelation of (the Surah)<span style="color:#ff0000;"> &#8220;When the Help of Allah comes (to you, O Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) against your enemies) and the Conquest (of Makkah)&#8221;</span> (110:1), Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to recite in every prayer:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Subhanaka Rabbana wa bihamdika, Allahum-maghfir li (Far removed You are from every imperfection, our Rubb, and all praise is for You, forgive me, O Allah)&#8221;</span>.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) recited frequently in bowing and prostration:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Subhanaka Rabbana wa bihamdika, Allahum-maghfir li</span>.<span style="color:#0000ff;"> (Far removed You are from every imperfection, our Rubb, and all praise is for You, forgive me, O Allah)&#8221;</span>. He elucidated that it has been commanded in the Noble Qur&#8217;an to recite:<span style="color:#ff0000;"> &#8220;So glorify the Praises of your Rubb, and ask for His forgiveness. Verily, He is the One Who accepts the repentance and Who forgives&#8221;.</span> (V.110:1) And he (the Messenger of Allah) acted upon it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to the narration in Muslim, Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) frequently recited these words just before he passed away:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Subhanaka Rabbana wa bihamdika. Astaghfiruka wa atubu ilaika.&#8221;</span> I (`Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) asked him: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! What are these new words which I hear from you repeatedly.&#8221; He replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;A sign has been appointed for me relating to my people that I should repeat these words at the sight of that sign&#8221;</span>. Then he recited Surat An-Nasr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration in Muslim related from `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) is: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) often recited, &#8220;Glory be to Allah and praise be to Him; I seek forgiveness of Allah and turn to Him in repentance.&#8221; I said to him: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, I hear you recite frequently: `O Allah, You are free from every imperfection our Rubb and all praise is for You; I seek forgiveness of Allah and turn to Him in repentance.&#8221;&#8217; He replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;My Rubb has informed me that I would soon see a sign regarding my people, whenever I see it, I repeat this statement more often (of His Glorification and Praise and beg pardon of Him and turn to Him). Now I have witnessed the sign. The revelation of Surat An-Nasr and the victory is the conquest of Makkah.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">&#8220;When there comes the Help of Allah (to you, O Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) against your enemies) and the Conquest (of Makkah). And you see that the people enter Allah&#8217;s religion (Islam) in crowds. So glorify the Praises of your Rubb, and ask His forgiveness. Verily, He is the One Who accepts the repentance and Who forgives.&#8221;</span> (110:1-3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>115.</b>  Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said:<span style="color:#008000;"> Allah the Rubb of honour and glory sent Revelation to His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) more frequently before his death than at any other time.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>116.</b>  Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Every one will be raised in the condition in which he dies&#8221;.</span><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 align="Center"><a href="#">Imam Al-Nawawi&#8217;s Riyad-us-Saliheen</a><br />
Chapter 10<br />
Hastening to do Good Deeds</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;So hasten towards all that is good&#8221;.</b></span><b> (2:148)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And march forth in the way (which leads to) forgiveness from your Rubb, and for Jannah as wide as are the heavens and the earth, prepared for Al-Muttaqun (the pious)&#8221;.</b></span><b> (3:133)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>87.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Be prompt in doing good deeds (before you are overtaken) by turbulence which would be like a part of the dark night. A man would be a believer in the morning and turn to disbelief in the evening, or he would be a believer in the evening and turn disbeliever in the morning, and would sell his Faith for worldly goods.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>88.</b> `Uqbah bin Al-Harith (May Allah be pleased with him) said: Once I performed the &#8216;Asr prayer in Al-Madinah behind the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) got up quickly after finishing the prayer with Taslim, and stepping over the people, went to one of the rooms of his wives. The people were startled at his haste, and when he came out and saw their astonishment at his urgency he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;I recalled that there was left with me some gold which was meant for charity; I did not like to keep it any longer, so I gave orders that it should be distributed&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">    In another narration, Messenger of Allah said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;I had left some gold for Sadaqah in the house, and did not wish to keep it overnight&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>89.</b> Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> A man, said to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) during the battle of Uhud: &#8220;Tell me where I shall be if I am killed&#8221;. When he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied that he would be in Jannah, the man threw away some dates which he had in his hand and fought until he was killed</span>.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>90.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: There came a man to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, which charity is the most rewardable?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;That you should give charity (in a state when you are) healthy and stingy and fear poverty, hoping to become rich (charity in such a state of health and mind is the best). And you must not defer (charity to such a length) that you are about to die and would be saying: &#8216;This is for so-and-so, and this for so-and-so.&#8217; Lo! It has already come into (the possession of) so-and-so&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>91.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) took up a sword on the day of the battle of Uhud and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Who will take this sword from me?&#8221;</span> Everyone stretched forth his hand saying: &#8220;I will take it; I will take it&#8221;. He (the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Who will take it with its full responsibility (i.e., to use it to fight Allah&#8217;s enemies with it)</span>?&#8221; The Companions hesitated. Abu Dujanah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: &#8220;I shall take it;&#8221; and with it he cracked the skulls of the pagans.<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>92.</b> Az-Zubair bin `Adi said:<span style="color:#008000;"> We went to Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) and complained to him of suffering at the hands of Al-Hajjaj. He replied: &#8220;Show endurance, for no time will come but will be followed by one worse (than the present one) till you meet your Rubb. I heard this from your Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)</span>&#8220;.<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>93.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Hasten to do good deeds before you are overtaken by one of the seven afflictions.&#8221; Then (giving a warning) he said, &#8220;Are you waiting for such poverty which will make you unmindful of devotion; or prosperity which will make you corrupt, or disease as will disable you, or such senility as will make you mentally unstable, or sudden death, or Ad-Dajjal who is the worst expected absent, or the Hour, and the Hour will be most grievous and most bitter&#8221;.</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>94.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: On the day of the battle of Khaibar, Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;I shall hand over this banner to one who loves Allah and His Messenger, and Allah will give us victory through him.&#8221;</span> `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) said: &#8220;I had never longed for leadership but that day I expected that I might be called for. However, Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) called `Ali bin Abu Talib (May Allah be pleased with him) and handed the banner to him and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Go forth and do not turn around till Allah bestows victory upon you&#8221;.</span> (On hearing this) `Ali proceeded a little and then halted and without turning around inquired in a loud voice: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, for what shall I fight them?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Go on fighting till they affirm that none has the right to be worshiped but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. If they admit that, their lives and their properties will be secured, subject to their obligations according to Islam, and they will be answerable to Allah&#8221;.</span><br />

Chapter 1<br />
Sincerity and Significance of Intentions and all Actions, Apparent and Hidden</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allah, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him), and perform As-Salat (Iqamat-as-Salat) and give Zakat, and that is the right religion.&#8221;</b></span><b> (98:5)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah, but it is piety from you that reaches Him.&#8221;</b></span><b> (22:37)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Say (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) ): Whether you hide what is in your breasts or reveal it, Allah knows it</b></span><b>&#8220;. (3:29)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1</b>. Narrated &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab (May Allah be pleased with him), reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The deeds are considered by the intentions, and a person will get the reward according to his intention. So whoever emigrated for Allah and His Messenger, his emigration will be for Allah and His Messenger; and whoever emigrated for worldly benefits or for a woman to marry, his emigration would be for what he emigrated for</span>&#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>2</b>. Narrated &#8216;A`ishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;An army will raid the Ka`bah and when it reaches a desert land, all of them will be swallowed up by the earth.&#8221;</span> She asked<span style="color:#0000ff;">;</span> &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Why all of them?&#8221; He answered, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">All of them will be swallowed by the earth but they will be raised for Judgement according to their intentions.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>3.</b> A`ishah  (May Allah be pleased with her) narrated that the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;There is no emigration after the conquest (of Makkah) but only Jihad [(striving and fighting in the cause of Allah) will continue] and good intention.* So if you are summoned to fight, go forth.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">*. Intention according to An-Nawawi: It means that goodness which ceased to continue by the cessation of emigration can still be obtained by Jihad and by intending accomplishing good deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>4.  </b>Jabir bin Abdullah Al-Ansari (May Allah be pleasedwith them) reported: We accompanied the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) in an expedition when he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;There are some men in Al-Madinah who are with you wherever you march and whichever valley you cross. They have not joined you in person because of their illness.&#8221;</span> In another version he said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;They share the reward with you.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Bukhari from Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him): We were coming back from the battle of Tabuk with the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) when he remarked,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;There are people whom we left behind in Al-Madinah who accompanied us in spirit in every pass and valley we crossed. They remained behind for a valid excuse.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>5.</b>  Ma`n bin Yazid bin Akhnas (May Allah be pleased with them) (he, his father and his grandfather, all were Companions) reported: My father set aside some dinars for charity and gave them to a man in the mosque. I went to that man and took back those dinars. He said: &#8220;I had not intended you to be given.&#8221; So we went to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), and put forth the matter before him. He said to my father,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Yazid, you have been rewarded for what you intended.&#8221;</span> And he said to me,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Ma`n, you are entitled to what you have taken.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>6.</b> Abu Ishaq Sa`d bin Abu Waqqas (May Allah be pleased with him) (one of the ten who had been given the glad tidings of entry into Jannah) narrated: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) visited me in my illness which became severe in the year of Hajjat-ul-Wada` (Farewell Pilgrimage). I said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, you can see the pain which I am suffering and I am a man of means and there is none to inherit from me except one daughter. Should I give two-thirds of my property in charity?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;No&#8221;.</span> I asked him, &#8220;Then half?&#8221; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;No&#8221;.</span> Then I asked, &#8220;Can I give away one-third&#8221;. He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Give away one-third, and that is still too much. It is better to leave your heirs well-off than to leave them poor, begging people. You will not expend a thing in charity for the sake of Allah, but you will be rewarded for it; even the morsel of food which you feed your wife&#8221;.</span> I said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, would I survive my companions?&#8221; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;If you survive others and accomplish a thing for the sake of Allah, you would gain higher ranking and standing. You will survive them &#8230; your survival will be beneficial to people (the Muslim) and harmful to others (the enemies of Islam). You will survive others till the people will derive benefit from you, and others would be harmed by you.&#8221;</span> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) further said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O Allah, complete for my Companions their emigration and do not cause them to retract.&#8221;</span> Sa`d bin Khaulah was unfortunate<span style="color:#0000ff;">.</span> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) lamented his death as he died in Makkah.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>7.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) narrated: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah does not look at your figures, nor at your attire but He looks at your hearts and accomplishments&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>8.</b> Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that Messenger of Allah  (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was asked about who fights in the  battlefield out of valour, or out of  zeal, or out of  hypocrisy, which of this is considered as fighting in the cause of Allah? He said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He who fights in order that the Word of Allah remains the supreme, is considered as fighting in the cause of Allah&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>9.</b> Abu Bakrah Ath-Thaqafi (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;When two Muslims are engaged in a combat against each other with their sword&#8217;s and one is killed, both are doomed to Hell&#8221;.</span> I said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! As to the one who kills, it is understandable, but why the slain one?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He was eager to kill his opponent&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>10.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The reward for Salat performed by a person in congregation is more than 20 times greater than that of the Salat performed in one&#8217;s house or shop. When one performs Wudu&#8217; perfectly and then proceeds to the mosque with the sole intention of performing Salat, then for every step he takes towards the mosque, he is upgraded one degree in reward and one of his sins is eliminated until he enters the mosque, and when he enters the mosque, he is considered as performing Salat as long as it is the Salat which prevents him (from leaving the mosque); and the angels keep on supplicating Allah for him as long as he remains in his place of prayer. They say: &#8216;O Allah! have mercy on him; O Allah! forgive his sins; O Allah! accept his repentance&#8217;. This will carry on as long as he does not pass wind</span>&#8220;.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>11.</b> `Abdullah bin `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported:  Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said that Allah, the Glorious, said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Verily, Allah (SWT) has ordered that the good and the bad deeds be written down. Then He explained it clearly how (to write): He who intends to do a good deed but he does not do it, then Allah records it for him as a full good deed, but if  he carries out his intention, then Allah the Exalted, writes it down for him as from ten to seven hundred folds, and even more. But if he intends to do an evil act and has not done it, then Allah writes it down with Him as a full good deed, but if he intends it and has done it, Allah writes it down as one bad deed&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>12.</b> `Abdullah bin `Umar bin Al-Khattab (May Allah be pleased with them) narrated that: He heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) as saying:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Three men, amongst those who came before you, set out until night came and they reached a cave, so they entered it. A rock fell down from the mountain and blocked the entrance of the cave. They said: `Nothing will save you from this unless you supplicate to Allah by virtue of a righteous deed you have done.&#8217; Thereupon, one of them said: `O Allah! I had parents who were old, and I used to offer them milk before any of my children or slaves. One day, I went far away in search of grazing and could not come back until they had slept. When I milked as usual and brought the drink I found them both asleep. I hated to disturb them and also disliked to give milk to my children before them. My children were crying out of hunger at my feet but I awaited with the bowl in my hand for them to wake up. When they awoke at dawn, they drank milk. O Allah! If  I did so to seek Your Pleasure, then deliver us from the distress caused by the rock&#8217;. The rock moved slightly but they were unable to escape. The next said: `O Allah! I had a cousin whom I loved more than any one else (in another version he said: as a man can love a woman). I wanted to have sexual intercourse with her but she refused. Hard pressed in a year of famine, she approached me. I gave her one hundred and twenty dinars on condition that she would yield herself to me. She agreed and when we got together (for sexual intercourse), she said: Fear Allah and do not break the seal unlawfully. I moved away from her in spite of the fact that I loved her most passionately; and I let her keep the money I had given her. O Allah! If I did that to seek Your Pleasure, then, remove the distress in which we are.&#8217; The rock moved aside a bit further but they were still unable to get out. The third one said: `O Allah! I hired some labourers and paid them their wages except one of them departed without taking his due. I invested his money in business and the business prospered greatly. After a long time, he came to me and said: O slave of Allah! Pay me my dues. I said: All that you see is yours &#8211; camels, cattle, goats and slaves. He said: O slave of Allah! Do not mock at me. I assured him that I was not joking. So he took all the things and went away. He spared nothing. O Allah! If  I did so seeking Your Pleasure, then relieve us of our distress.&#8217; The rock slipped aside and they got out walking freely&#8221;.</span><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Ibn Umar who said: ‘A man came to the Prophet sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: ‘</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Messenger of Allaah! Which of the people are the most beloved to Allaah and which of the actions are most beloved to Allaah?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The most beloved of the people to Allaah are the most beneficial for the people. The most beloved of actions to Allaah –Azza wa Jal- are to cause happiness to reach a Muslim, to relieve him from a hardship, to settle a debt for a Muslim or to repel hunger from him. For me to walk with a brother in order to assist him is more beloved to me than to make &#8216;Itikaf in this Masjid (Masjid al-Madeenah) for a month.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever holds back his anger then Allaah hides his mistakes. Whoever suppresses his anger – even though he is not scared to show it, but withholds due to the truth &#8211; Allaah fills his heart with hope on the day of Judgement. Whoever walks with his brother to assist him with a need until he has helped him completely, then Allaah plants his feet firmly on the day people will not stand firmly. Indeed bad behaviour spoils good actions, just as vinegar spoils honey.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Nasirud-Din al-Albani<span style="line-height:1.5em;"> &#8211; al-Hijra magazine (vol.4 no.2)<br />
</span>Al-Ibaanah Magazine Issue No.1 &#8211; Dhul-Qa’dah 1415H / April 1995</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>What Benefits the Dead</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abû Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> “The likeness of wealth, family and the actions of the son of Âdam is of a man who has three companions. One of the man’s companions says: I am with you as long as you live; when you die, you have taken your share of yourself and you have taken your share of me &#8211; this is his wealth. The second companion says: I am with you until you reach that tree; you have had your share of yourself and your share of me &#8211; this is his family. The third companion says: I am with you in life and in death.”</i> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above authentic hadîth is in fact like the following hadîth in meaning and in subject matter. Anas said that the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> “The dead person is followed (to his grave) by three: His family, his wealth and his actions. Two of them return and only one remains. His family and wealth return, but his actions remain.”</i> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These two ahâdîth show that actions alone endure and enter the grave with their doers. Both these ahâdîth also affirm the fact that anything other than actions &#8211; such as wealth, servants or relatives &#8211; are of no benefit at all. Rather, they all return (to this world). His wealth becomes the property of his inheritor, whilst his relatives and family do not grant him anything from Allâh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These ahâdîth intend to direct Muslims to be concerned with actions which will stay with them forever; and not to strive for wealth and position for the sake of relatives, family and servants. Apparently, the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> wanted to show us the value of good actions when he related these ahâdîth to us, (which can be found) in the books of <i>Zuhd</i> (renouncement of the world). He pointed out to us that because actions will last rather than wealth, you have to make your actions righteous. Part of making ones actions righteous is through good wealth that is earned lawfully and spent in a good manner. Then one gains the rewards of <i>’amalus-sâlih</i> (a righteous action).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Acceptable Action</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, in these ahâdîth, the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> encouraged us to make our actions righteous, whether gaining wealth or other things. However, we must remember a certain fact about this action, a fact that many people neglect. The explanation of this fact should actually be a complete lesson in itself; and it is that only a <i>righteous action</i> is beneficial, not just any action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what are the conditions that a Muslim must fulfill in order for the action to be righteous? This is shown in the statement of Allâh &#8211; <i>the Exalted and Sublime</i>: <b>“Say (O Muhammad): Verily I am only a man like yourselves, but revelation has been revealed to me that the One whom you should worship is only One Deity. And whoever hopes to meet his Lord, let him do righteous actions; and in the worship of your Lord, do not associate anyone along with Him.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Two Important Conditions</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Scholars of <i>Tafsîr</i> have said that the end of this verse is an indication that there are two conditions for an action to be righteous and acceptable: [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>Firstly</i></b>: That the action must be in accordance with the Sunnah. Therefore, if the action is done as an act of worship, but is not in accordance with the Sunnah, it is not a righteous action. The reason is that compliance with the Sunnah is one of the conditions for the action’s righteousness. The proofs of this are many, but it is enough to state one: The hadîth of the Prophet <i>sallallâhu </i> <i>’alayhi wa sallam</i> in which he said: <i> “Whoever innovates in this matter of ours what is not upon it, it shall be rejected.” </i>[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, any action that was not part of Islâm when Allâh revealed it upon the heart of the Prophet Muhammad <i>sallallâhu </i> <i>’alayhi wa sallam</i> is not a righteous action. About this, Allâh &#8211; the Most High &#8211; says: <b> “This day I have perfected your Dîn for you and completed My favour upon you and I have chosen Islâm as your Dîn.”</b> [7] It must be remembered that <i>Bid’ah</i> (innovation) [8] is not divided into five categories, as some Scholars say. A proof for this is that the Prophet <i>sallallâhu </i> <i>’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> “Every innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance is in the Hellfire.”</i> [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>Secondly</i></b>: That after being in accordance with the Sunnah, the action has to be sincere, purely seeking the Face of Allâh &#8211; <i>the Most High</i> &#8211; because Allâh says at the end of the aforementioned verse: <b> “And in the worship of your Lord, do not associate anyone along with Him.”</b> This means that the person seeks, by his righteous action, only the Face of Allâh &#8211; <i> the Exalted and Sublime</i>. However, if he seeks other than Allâh, then he has setup partners with Allâh (made shirk with Allâh), therefore his action is rejected.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is confirmed by Allâh in an authentic hadîth Qudsî: <i>“I am so self-sufficient that I am in no need of having any partners. Thus, whosoever does an action for the sake of someone else as well as Me, will have that action rejected by Me, to him whom he associated with Me.” </i>[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consequently, if the action is righteous but not sincere for the sake of Allâh’s Face, it is rejected. Moreover, if the action is purely for the sake of Allâh’s Face, but not in accordance with the Sunnah, it is likewise not accepted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Worthless and Sinful Action</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these arc the two conditions for every action to be a righteous action. If one of these conditions is not present, the action does not become a righteous action, rather, it becomes an evil one. Had the person not done this action, it would have been better for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a man prays two <i> rak’ât </i> of prayer at night, while others sleep, then even if he prays them according to the Sunnah &#8211; without addition or deletion &#8211; but he does this so that people may talk about him and say: “This Person is a righteous man. He prays at night when the people are asleep,” then his action becomes <i> bâtil</i> (null and void), since he did not sincerely seek the Face of Allâh alone, but rather he sought the praises of people, thus becoming sinful by associating partners with Allâh in his action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if his action only became null and void, then the following hadîth would apply to him; and he would not be punished for this action: <i>“How many fasting people obtain nothing from their fasting except hunger and thirst. And how many people who stay up at night (praying), obtain nothing from their being awake except sleeplessness and tiredness.”</i> [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But this is not the case, for this person’s action has changed into a sin. The two <i> rak’ât</i> that this person performed without intending to seek only the Face of Allâh &#8211; <i>the Exalted and Sublime</i> &#8211; are the same as if he had disobeyed Him, that is to say: He will be punished for these two <i> rak’ât </i> because he associated others along with Allâh &#8211; <i> the Exalted and Sublime</i> &#8211; in his action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a man prays eleven <i> rak’ât</i> at night with the intention, in this worship, that his brothers would say about him: “This man is correctly following the Prophet; he does not add to the Sunnah,” his action becomes null and void; and his action changes to a sin against him. Rather, he must pray according to the Sunnah but sincerely seeking only the Face of Allâh &#8211; the Most High. He must be absolutely free of seeking the pleasure of others along with Him in this worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This has been but a summary about the action that does not leave the person but enters the grave with him &#8211; whether the action was good or bad &#8211; and that what is of benefit is the person’s righteous action. What is a righteous action and what are its conditions? The two conditions are:- <i><b>Muwwâfaqah</b></i> (compliance) with the Sunnah; and <i><b>Ikhlâs</b></i> (sincerity and purity of intention) to Allâh. Therefore, one must remember these two conditions and act upon them so that one may become righteous and pious.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Safeguarding against Insincerity</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many people unfortunately neglect the first condition (complying with the Sunnah) because they are astray and believe that <i> bid’ah</i> (innovation) is good in the religion.[12] But there are those upon whom Allâh has granted His favour, by guiding them to the Sunnah of the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>. They are those who know the reality of this condition and adhere to it the best they can. Yet they must pay attention to the second condition, which either group may fail to fulfill, and that is <i>riyâ’</i> (insincerity and showing-off). No one is exempt from <i>riyâ’</i> and all people are susceptible to it in their actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This matter is a very serious one and must be stressed here, so that we may know that we are in need of making our actions correct and purely for the Face of Allâh &#8211; <i> the Exalted and Sublime</i>. Part of this is that we are tested even while making <i> Da’wah</i> to the Qur‘ân and the Sunnah, for trials are not only in evil matters, but also in the good matters:<b> “And We test you with evil and good, by way of <i>fitnah</i> (trial).”</b> [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <i>da’wah</i> has been neglected by Muslims throughout the world so that the <i>du’ât</i> (the callers) have become strangers. Not only are they strangers in foreign countries, but they are strangers even in their own countries; amongst their relatives and brothers. This makes them praiseworthy, but they must not stand up to be praised for this <i>da’wah</i>. This is the reality, for the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>“Verily Islâm started as something strange and it will return as something strange, so Tûbâ is for the Strangers.”</i> [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Tûbâ and the Strangers</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of <i>Tûbâ</i> in the Arabic language is: “Praise and thanks.” The meaning according to the <i>Sharî’ah</i> refers to a tree in Paradise, which would take a rider a hundred years to traverse its shade. [15] This hadîth gives glad tidings to the newcomers of Paradise in which there is: <i>“What no eye has never seen, no ear has ever heard, and no heart has ever imagined.”</i> [16] This tree is mentioned in the Qur’ân in the statement of Allâh: <b>“<i>Tûbâ</i> is for them, and the best abode.”</b> [17] Therefore, <i>Tûbâ</i> is for the Ghurabâ (the Strangers), but who are they? The answer to this is in the reply of the Prophet: <i>“Those who correct [themselves and others], when the people have become corrupt.”</i> [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Need for Care</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These Strangers call the people to the revival of the Sunnah and eradication of all that differs from it. However, they must still pay attention to the second condition of the righteous action: To be sincere in their <i>da’wah</i>. They must neither seek fame, pride, nor arguments from their <i>da’wah</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They must not seek anything that <i>an-Nafs ul-Amârata bis-Sû’</i> (the soul that calls them to evil) orders them to do. Whatever they call to is as a result of Allâh &#8211; <i>the Most High </i> &#8211; having ordered them to make <i> da’wah</i> to the Qur’ân and the Sunnah and to make<i> da’wah</i> to what the Muslims have neglected. They must take care of this <i>da’wah</i>. However, they stand in danger. It can happen that one may say a word seeking only to have fingers of praise pointed at him, not sincerely advising the people and desiring to guide them. Rather, to do that for fame.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here we mention a saying of some <i>Sûfîs</i>, who have some wise sayings that can not be denied: “The love of fame breaks backs.” Therefore, I insist, that we who make <i> Da’wah</i> to the Sunnah be sincere in our actions so that when our actions enter the grave with us, it will help us to answer correctly when we are asked: “Who is your Lord? Who is your Prophet? What is your religion?” If the deed is evil, when the person enters the grave, he will deny it. His deed will come to him in the worst of forms. He will ask it: “Who are you?” It will say: “I am your deed.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Wealth &#8211; its Reality and Purpose</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The next Hadîth is also authentic. Abû Hurayrah said that the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>“The servant says: My wealth! My wealth! However, he gets from his wealth three things: What he eats and finishes. What he wears and makes shabby; and what he gives away and pleases others with. Whatever else is besides this, goes and is left for the people.”</i> [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Hadîth also emphasises the subject of the previous ahâdîth. It shows us the care taken by people in amassing wealth. Allâh pointed this out in the Qur‘ân by His statement: <b>“And for the love of good he is strong.”</b> [20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet depicted the nature of mankind for us in his saying: <i>“The servant says: My wealth! My wealth!”</i> Nevertheless, what is the amount that remains left over for him from his wealth? Is all his wealth for him? No! He gains from his wealth only the examples that the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> specified. The first is defined by the Prophet’s statement: <i>“What he eats and finishes.”</i> From his wealth is that which is necessary for him to survive and that which enables him to accomplish the rights of Allâh. These rights are the rights of His <i> Tawhîd</i> (singling out Allâh alone for worship), as Allâh said: <b> “And I have not created the jinn and mankind except to worship Me.”</b> [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second is what a person wears until it becomes shabby. Add to this that which he volunteers and does good with, which is mentioned in the statement of the Prophet: <i>“Or what he gives away and pleases others with.”</i> He got rid of his wealth by giving it away to another in charity. Therefore, the wealth that is for the servant is the amount that he eats and the amount that he wears in order to survive. However this is not an end in itself. Rather, one exists solely to accomplish the obligation of worship, as we pointed out previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third kind of wealth that returns with a benefit is not only the obligatory charity, but it also includes non-obligatory charities. Then the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> explained what is left after these categories. He said: <i>“And other than that is gone, and is left, for the people.”</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The relation of this Hadîth with the previous one is: Why do people exhaust themselves in amassing wealth, when this is the reality of wealth? They do not benefit from there wealth except the amount that they eat, drink and with which they help other people. All else will be left and it will remain for the people who inherit it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following Hadîth is also <i>Sahîh</i> (authentic). Abdullâh ibn ash-Shikhkhîr said: I came to the Prophet whilst he was reciting: <b>“Seeking increase diverted you.” </b> The Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said:<i> “The son of Âdam say My wealth! My wealth! What do you obtain, O son of Âdam, from your wealth except that which you eat and consume, or wear until it becomes shabby, or what you give as charity and accomplish.”</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadîth is also similar in meaning to the previous one, though some of its words are different; and was recorded by Muslim, at-Tirmidhî and an-Nasâ‘î. This hadîth is clear in its wording, however, the statement of the Prophet at the end of the hadîth: <i>“or what you give as charity and accomplish.”</i> may not be clear to some people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Generosity and Miserliness</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This statement aims at drawing one’s attention to the fact that what is intended for charity is that which he actually gives away. It is not sufficient that a person should just make out a will, that he should give such and such to the poor, or such and such for a specific masjid. However, the Prophet calls our attention to the fact that benefit is in that wealth which a person actually gave away during his lifetime, since he did not really know what would happen with his wealth after he died, if he had made a will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">with this word, the Prophet points to a hadîth in the <i> Sahîh</i> of al-Bukhârî &#8211; the meaning of which is that the miser is one who when death comes to him makes a will and says: “Give so and so such amount and for so and so such and such amount.” The Prophet said: <i>“This was already for so and so and so and so.”</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> meant was that the deceased did not own anything anymore. He had left this <i>dunya</i> (life of this world ) and had entered into the <i>Âkhirah</i> (the Hereafter) and his inheritance will remain for those people who are still alive. Then should not the person have made his will earlier? Should he not have given charity whilst he was strong, hoping to be rich and fearing poverty?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the nature of the people today, they say: “Hoard your white Dirham for your black day.” They hoard this money for themselves for when they become old. They are covetous of this wealth. The generous person is the one who gives away his own wealth when his own soul is attached to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who is on the brink of death and who says: “Give so and so such and such amount,” he is a miser and is not generous. Rather, a truly generous person is one who gives charity whilst he holds onto his life and also whilst he loves this wealth very much.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Insignificance of this World</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The next hadîth is narrated by Jâbir ibn ’Abdullâh: The Messenger of Allâh <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> passed by the market place coming from the direction of ‘Âliyah and people were around him. He passed by a dead kid goat (i.e. a baby goat) which had very short ears. He held it by its ears and said: <i>“Who amongst you would like to have this for a dirham?”</i> They (the Companions) said: We would not want it even for less than that! What can we do with it? He said: <i>“Do you wish to have it (for any price)?”</i> They said: By Allâh, even if it were alive it (we would not want it), as it has very short ears, let alone now when it is also dead! The Messenger of Allâh <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> “By Allâh, this world is more insignificant to Allâh than this (goat) is to you all.”</i> [23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let us return to the hadîth. He passed by the market place <i> “and the people were around him.”</i> Here I would like to pause a little in order to remind people about some of the guidance of the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> that most of the Shaykhs of today have neglected.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykhs of today walk with their students behind them. This was not the way of the Messenger of Allâh <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>. The ahâdîth describing this are many and the following is from them: “He used to walk side by side with Abû Bakr and side by side with Abû Hurayrah; and they all walked with each other.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, it is authentically proven that the Messenger of Allâh <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> used to say to his Companions <i>radiallâhu ’anhum</i>, when he used to walk with them: <i> “Walk in<br />
front of me and leave my back for the angels.”</i> [24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here he highlights two matters from one saying. People do not see angels, they see only people. Therefore, if anyone saw the Messenger <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> walking, they would only see people walking in front of him. The Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said in the authentic hadîth: <i> “He who humbles himself for the sake of Allâh, Allâh will raise him.” </i>[25] His humbleness raised him to a degree whereby the angels walked behind him. Therefore, is a noble person one behind whom people &#8211; good or bad &#8211; walk; or is he the one who is followed by those described by Allâh in the following verse: <b> “They do not disobey what Allâh ordered them to do and do precisely what they are commanded.”</b> The nobility of the Prophet manifested itself in a visible and an invisible side. The visible side is that the Companions used to walk in front of the Prophet and not behind him. The invisible side is that the angels walked behind him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Of course, the first phenomenon is the one in which we are ordered not to act proudly with our companions and our brothers in faith, even those who may be less than us in knowledge, morals, worship and righteousness. This is enough for us, because Allâh says: “Do not sanctify yourself. He knows best the ones who are pious.” [26] It is sufficient for us at least, to walk with people side by side. Whosoever intentionally goes against this Sunnah, without doubt, does not truly love the Messenger of Allâh <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>. This is because one’s degree of love from him, is based upon following him. This is established in the Qur’ân by the statement of Allâh: <b> “Say (O Muhammad): If you do love Allâh then follow me; Allâh will love you and forgive you your sins.”</b> [27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if this was the case with the Prophet who was infallible and protected from the whispering of the <i>Shaytân</i> and this was an indication of the level with his Companions, then what can we say about ourselves? We are not infallible and are not protected from the <i>Shaytân</i>. We must adhere to this Sunnah as if it were obligatory. It is better for us to walk with people around us than to walk looking with our eyes at the backs of their shoulders. The statement of the Prophet, at the end of the hadîth: <i>“By Allâh, this world is more insignificant to Allâh than this (goat) is to you all,”</i> is to be reflected upon by people of intellect!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The next authentic hadîth is similar to the previous hadîth. Ibn ’Abbâs said: The Prophet passed by a dead goat that had been thrown away by its owners. He said: <i>“By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, this world is more insignificant to Allâh than this is to its owner.”</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sahl ibn Sa’d said that the Messenger of Allâh <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>“If this world was worth as much to Allâh as the wing of a mosquito, He would not have given a disbeliever even a sip of water.” </i>[28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Salmân said: Some people came to the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> and he asked them: <i>“Do you have food?”</i> They said: Yes. He asked: <i>“Do you have drink?”</i> They said: Yes. He said: <i>“Verily their outcome is like the outcome of this world, one of you stands behind his house holding his nose from their bad smell.”</i> This is the similitude of this world. What is the eventual outcome of food and drink? They change to stool and urine. Therefore, a person hates the smell for himself. This is the similitude of the outcome of this World.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following hadîth has the same meaning. Ubayy ibn Ka’b said that the Messenger of Allâh <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>“Indeed the food of the son of Âdam is like the example of the world. Even if he puts spices and season into it, see what becomes of it.” </i>[29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is the eventual outcome of spices and seasoning in his food? Look at what it becomes! Likewise, this world becomes a similar thing except that which is for Allâh. The next hadîth explains this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abû Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> “The world and all that it contains is cursed, except for the remembrance of Allâh and what supports it; or a Scholar and a student.” </i>[30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>In Conclusion</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the reality of this world in the <i> Sharî’ah</i>, it has no value. The similitude of this world is like good food and drink: its outcome is decay. The exceptions arc those things which are done for Allâh whether remembrance of Allâh, knowledge or even food because it helps to support the worship of Allâh. These things are among the deeds of man that endure in this fleeting life. The goal behind these <i> ahâdîth</i> is that a person should not be overly concerned about this world, except with which is sufficient to keep him alive and strong; and sufficient enough to be able to accomplish the worship of his Lord. For if his wealth is greater than this, it will only benefit him by the amount of good that he does by helping others; otherwise, he is going to leave this wealth behind and it will not benefit him at all. However, what will benefit him are the righteous actions that he has done.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allâh not to put love of this world in our hearts, but to guide us to earn in this life what helps us to worship and obey Him. And all praise is for Allâh, Lord of the Worlds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From Al-Istiqaamah Magazine , Issue No.7 , Rabee&#8217; ul-Awwal 1418H / July 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal. Repel evil with that which is better; then indeed, he between whom and you there was enmity, will become as though he was a close friend.&#8221; </b>[Soorah Fussilat 41:34].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam as-Sa&#8217;dee (d. 1376H)- <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Not equal are acts of goodness and obedience, which are done to earn the pleasure of Allaah; and acts of evil and disobedience, that bring about the anger of Allaah, and not His good pleasure. Likewise. not equal are those acts of goodness and kindness that are done towards the creation, and those acts of evil done against them &#8211; neither in their nature, their characteristics, nor in their rewards: <b>&#8220;Is not the reward for good acts, goodness.&#8221;</b> Then, a particular, but important act of <i>ihsaan</i> (goodness and kindness) is commanded, which is: showing <i>ihsaan</i> towards the one who has ill-treated you; because Allaah commanded to repel evil with that which is better. This means that whenever you are ill-treated by anyone from amongst the creation &#8211; in particular those that have great rights over you; such as relatives, friends, and their like &#8211; then return their ill-treatment of you with acts of kindness and goodness towards them. Thus, if you have been cut-off from then seek to join the ties of relation; if you have been oppressed, then be forgiving; if you have been spoken ill of, either in your presence or behind your back, then do not retaliate, but rather be forgiving and speak to them with mild and soft words; if you have been boycotted and abandoned, then continue speaking to those who have done so, with good words, and continue giving them the greetings of <i>salaam</i>. So if you return acts of evil with acts of <i>ihsaan</i> (goodness and kindness), then you will indeed acquire a tremendous benefit.&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consider also, the following incident.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Aaishah <i>radiallaahu&#8217;anhaa</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>: O Allaah&#8217;s Messenger, has there ever been a day more severe upon you than the day of Uhud? So he said: <i>&#8220;Your tribe troubled me</i> <i>greatly, and the most troublesome thing which I experienced from them was on the day of &#8216;Aqabah when I presented myself to Ibn &#8216;Abd Yaaleel ibn &#8216;Abd Kulaal, and he did not respond to my Message as I had hoped. So I returned overwhelmed with grief and sorrow, and did not recover until I reached Qarnuth-Tha&#8217;aalib. I raised my head and saw a cloud shading me. Then I looked and saw (the Angel) Jibreel in it, and he called me saying. Allaah has heard what your people have said to you, and their reply. And Allaah has sent the Angel of the mountains to you to do whatever you wish. So the Angel of the mountains called me, greeted me with Salaam; and then said. O Muhammad. Allaah has heard what your people said to you, and I am the Angel of the mountains. My Lord has sent me to you, that you may order me as you wish. So what do you wish? If you should so wish, I will crush them beneath the two mountains.&#8221;</i> So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;No, rather hope that from their offspring will come who will worship Allaah alone, and not worship anything else along with Him.&#8221;</i>2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abee Haatim (d.328H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I entered Damascus and came upon the students of <i>hadeeth</i>, and I passed by the circle of Qaasim al-Joo&#8217;ee (d.248H). I found a group sitting around him and he was speaking. Their appearance amazed me; and I heard him saying: &#8220;Seize the benefit of five things from the people of your time: when you are present, you are not known; when you are absent, you are not missed; when you are seen, your advice is not sought; when you say something, your saying is not accepted; and when you have some knowledge, you are not given anything for it. I also advise you with five matters: when you are treated unjustly, do not behave unjustly; when you are praised, do not become happy; when you are criticised, do not become upset; when you are not believed, do not become angry; and if people act deceitfully towards you, do not act deceitfully towards them.&#8221; Ibn Abee Haatim said: So I took that as my benefit from Damascus.&#8221;3</p>

</a></p>
<p>Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah -Rahimullaah- mentions in his explanation of the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">ادعوا ربَّكم تضرُّعًا وخُفيةً إنه لايحبُّ المعتدين…</h4>
<p style="text-align:center;">Invoke your Lord with humility and in secret. <strong>[al-Aaraaf: 55]</strong></p>
<p>there are ten benefits of hiding your Dua’, and from amongst these benefits he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed the greatest of blessings is turning to Allaah and worshipping Him. Every blessing has the equivalent of it being envied by an envious person, whether openly or secretly. There is no greater blessing than of turning to Allaah and worshipping Him [making Dua&#8217;], indeed the souls of the envious are attached to that blessing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing more secure for the person who is envied than hiding his blessing from the envious person. Indeed Yaqoob said to Yusuf -alayhi as-Sallam:</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">قَالَ يَا بُنَيَّ لاَ تَقْصُصْ رُؤْيَاكَ عَلَى إِخْوَتِكَ فَيَكِيدُواْ لَكَ كَيْدًا</h4>
<p style="text-align:center;">&lt; &lt; O my son! Relate not your vision to your brothers, lest they arrange a plot against you &gt; &gt;</p>
<p>till the end of the Ayaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How many of the people who have hearts, a connection and status with Allaah Ta’ala may perhaps have spoken about it, and informed people about it, and the envious one tried to plunder him over these blessings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why the righteous and elderly are advised to keep their secrets with Allaah Ta’ala, and not to allow anyone to be acquainted with them.<br />
This issue of hiding the blessing is of great benefit, its people know is benefits. Therefore, if it is commanded to do so in your Dua’/supplications, then this also includes the Dua’ for requesting this, and the Dua’ of praising Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Living and turning to Allaah Ta’ala is from the great treasures which has a right to be hidden from the eyes of the envious.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[From: &#8216;Majmoo al-Fatawa&#8217; 15/18-19]</strong></p>

<strong>By Shaykh Rabia’ ibn Haadee al-Madkhalee</strong><br />
<strong>Compiled &amp; translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Published by Miraath Publications</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Listen Audio Excerpt: <a title="Day 14: Knowledge &amp; Actions" href="http://www.miraathpublications.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Miraath-Publications-BiteSize-Ramadhaan-1434-Articles-Day-14.mp3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Miraath Publications – BiteSize Ramadhaan 1434 Articles – Day 14</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1 – Shaykh Rabia’ said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Learning knowledge should be <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>for the sake of Allaah’s Face, and also for acting upon that knowledge</strong></span>, otherwise knowledge will have an evil consequence, so the person remains between two illnesses, either the illness of ignorance or the illness of knowledge which is not beneficial, but rather harmful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The knowledge which Muhammad -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- came with is in itself beneficial. However, if a person does not act upon it then it becomes an evil consequence for him, and harmful for him, and perhaps it could harm others.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2 – Shaykh Rabia’ said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘What is required from learning knowledge, is acting upon it, and action cannot come except after knowledge. As Allaah Tabaraka wa Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">فَاعْلَمْ أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَاسْتَغْفِرْ لِذَنْبِكَ وَلِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَاتِ</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">-So know that Lâ ilâha ill-Allaah (none has the right to be worshipped but Allaah), and ask forgiveness for your sin, and also for (the sin of) believing men and believing women.-  [Muhammad: 19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari wrote a chapter heading <span style="color:#008000;">‘Chapter: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Knowledge comes before Statements and Actions</strong></span>’</span> because it is obligatory upon us not to act except with knowledge, and not worship Allaah except with knowledge, so we do not worship Allaah Subhanahu – with ignorance or following desires.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3 – Shaykh Rabia’ said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The way of those misguided from the people of the Book who learnt knowledge but did not act upon it, is that their <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>hearts became hard</strong></span>, and most of them became evil…. . .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this hardness afflicts the heart then it destroys it. . . . .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it does not accept the truth, and does not act with knowledge and refuge is sought with Allaah, and it leads to hiding knowledge and acting in opposition to knowledge. . .. .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It leads to following whims and rejection of the truth, which is clear like the sun. . . . . ’</p>
</blockquote>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahab al-Wasaabee explaining the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah, may Allaah be pleased with him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَنْظُرُ إِلَى صُوَرِكُمْ وَأَمْوَالِكُمْ وَلَكِنْ يَنْظُرُ إِلَى قُلُوبِكُمْ وَأَعْمَالِكُمْ<br />
&#8220;Verily, Allah does not look at your appearance or wealth, but rather He looks at your hearts and actions.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The 2 conditions are:<br />
<strong>1) al-Ikhlaas</strong><br />
<strong>2) al-Mutabaa&#8217;a</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one of the two, or even both are missing the action of the servant of Allaah becomes corrupt. May Allaah make our actions sincere for Allaah alone in accordance with the Sunnah of our beloved messenger Muhammad, sallAllaahu alahyi wa sallam.</p>

<p>Allah, the Exalted, says:  <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;So hasten towards all that is good&#8221;</strong></span>. (2:148)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:small;"> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;font-size:small;">&#8220;Be prompt in doing good deeds (before you are overtaken) by turbulence which would be like a part of the dark night. A man would be a believer in the morning and turn to disbelief in the evening, or he would be a believer in the evening and turn disbeliever in the morning, and would sell his Faith for worldly goods.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:small;">[Muslim].</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullah Ibn &#8216;Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported:Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alayhi wassallam) said that Allah, the Glorious, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily, Allah (subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala) has ordered that the good and the bad deeds be written down. Then He explained it clearly how (to write): He who intends to do a good deed but he does not do it, then Allah records it for him as a full good deed, but if he carries out his intention, then Allah the Exalted, writes it down for him as from ten to seven hundred folds, and even more. But if he intends to do an evil act and has not done it, then Allah writes it down with Him as a full good deed, but if he intends it and has done it, Allah writes it down as one bad deed&#8221;.</span></p>

<em>asaheeha translations<br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~ Explanation of the <em>hadeeth</em>: ‘Actions are only judged by intentions’ [Saheeh al-Bukhaari #1] ~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaani (rahimahullaah):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This <em>hadeeth</em> means that<strong> righteous actions are only (sound/accepted/rewarded) by sincere intentions</strong>,<em><strong> not</strong></em> <strong>that actions opposing the Legislation turn into righteous legislated actions due to coupling them with righteous intentions.</strong> No one will say that except someone ignorant or pursuing his own interests!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many people know this <em>hadeeth</em> in wording but don’t understand its meaning. Why? Because oftentimes we turn (to some people) and say: ‘<em>Yaa akhi</em>, this action that you are doing, or this statement that you are uttering, is not a righteous action.’ What is the answer? ‘<em>Yaa akhi</em>, the Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: ‘Actions are only judged by intentions’ and my intention is good! My intention is righteous!’</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is the meaning of the <em>hadeeth</em>? Does the <em>hadeeth</em> mean that evil actions are only (sound/accepted/rewarded) by righteous intentions? Or does it mean that righteous actions are only (sound/accepted/rewarded) by righteous intentions? This latter statement is the meaning. As for if one’s actions are not righteous but intention is righteous – this is not enough. Likewise it is also not enough if it is vice versa: i.e. if one’s actions are righteous but intention is not righteous. So the <em>hadeeth</em> gives us two opposites: just like it is a condition for righteous action that there be righteous intention,<strong> it is likewise a condition for righteous intention that there be righteous action</strong>. So either one is not enough without the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You hear many people nowadays swearing by their fathers for example, saying: ‘.’ Sometimes you may find a person coming to a grave and praying there – a grave of a prophet or righteous person or the like – then when they are prohibited from that, he tells you: ‘My intention is not to worship him, my intention is to seek nearness to Allaah (<em>tawassul</em>) through him.’ Ok, your coming to this grave – granted that the intention is righteous – is an action, so is this a righteous action? The answer is no, because the Messenger (<em>‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) used to say: ‘Don’t sit on the graves nor pray toward them.’ And <em>du’aa</em> is part of prayer, in fact <em>du’aa</em> is worship as he (<em>‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) said. Hence turning to the grave with <em>du’aa</em> is like turning to it with prayer: it is an action that is not righteous, and this unrighteous action is not justified by the intention being righteous, <em>if</em> we grant that the intention is righteous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, <strong>for our actions to be righteous, they must be in agreement with the Legislation</strong>. This is what our Lord (<em>‘azza wa jal</em>) pointed to with His Statement in the Noble Qur’aan: {<span style="color:#008000;">whoever hopes for the meeting with his Lord, let him do righteous work and not associate any partner in the worship of his Lord</span>}.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Purity and Ostentation</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Many times a person thinks about doing a good deed and then Satan comes to him and whispers to him, saying, &#8220;You are doing that ostentatiously, to be seen of men and for a good reputation.&#8221; Therefore, he makes us go away from the good deed. How can one remain free of such occurrences?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Response: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One can remain free of such occurrences by seeking refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan, as well as by continually performing good deeds. He should not pay attention to such whisperings that make him stop doing good deeds. If he turns away from such whisperings and seeks refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan, such whisperings will stop by the permission of Allah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">source: <em>alkhawf wa rrajaa</em> – fear and hope (of Allaah) – tape no. 1 <strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Abu Huraira </em>(<em>radi Allaahu ‘anhu</em>) said that the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “Whoever fears (Allaah) sets out at nightfall,[1] and whoever sets out at nightfall will reach the goal. Indeed, the goods of Allaah are expensive; indeed, the goods of Allaah is Paradise.”[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh al-Albaani</em> (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) comments:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The meaning of this is that there is a price for entering Paradise and that entering it does not happen by feeling safe (from the plan of Allaah) and <em>at-tawaakul</em> (not taking any means and saying ‘Allaah will provide for me’), but rather it happens by (doing) righteous deeds and <em>at-tawakkul</em> (taking the means and putting one’s trust) in Allaah, the Blessed and Most High; as Allaah, the Might and Majestic, said: ‘And say (O Muhammad (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>)) ‘Do deeds! Allaah will see your deeds, and (so will) His Messenger [<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>].’’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in this <em>hadeeth</em>, there is an indication of the noble <em>aayah</em> that says: ‘<strong>This is the Paradise which you have been made to inherit because of your deeds which you used to do (in the life of the world)</strong>,’[4] and in the other <em>aayah</em>: ‘<strong>Enter you Paradise because of that (the good) which you used to do (in the world)</strong>.’[5] And here, it occurs to many students who have some participation in studying the<em>Sunnah</em>, as they read or at least hear the statement of the Messenger (of Allaah) (<em>‘alayhi ssalaat wa ssalaam</em>) which is established in the <em>saheehayn</em>[6] that he [<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>] said:  “‘<strong>None of you will enter Paradise by his (good) deeds, but rather by the Favor of Allaah and His Mercy</strong>.’ They said, ‘Not even you O Messenger of Allaah?’ He [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>] said, ‘Not even myself, unless Allaah encompasses me with His Favor and His Mercy.’”[7] So it seems that there is a contradiction between this <em>hadeeth</em> and the previous<em>aayah</em> along with our <em>hadeeth </em>in this book of ours where (the Prophet) <em>(‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) said: ‘Indeed, the goods of Allaah are expensive; indeed, the goods of Allaah is Paradise.’ Hence, there is a price (that one must pay) for Paradise and the two previous <em>aayaat</em> indicate that the price of Paradise is righteous deeds, and there is no doubt that good deeds do not benefit the one who does them at all except if he is truly a believer in Allaah and His Messenger [<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>]. So therefore, the price of Paradise is <em>eemaan</em> (faith) and righteous deeds. Then how does one reconcile between these three texts – this reality that we learned from our <em>hadeeth</em> tonight, ‘Indeed, the goods of Allaah are expensive’ and from the two previous <em>aayaat</em> – and between this <em>hadeeth</em>: ‘None of you will enter Paradise by his (good) deeds, but rather by the Favor of Allaah and His Mercy’?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reconciliation between (these two) is that… that which is negated in the last<em>hadeeth</em> ‘None of you will enter Paradise by his (good) deeds’ is one thing and that which is confirmed in the <em>aayah</em> ‘Enter you Paradise because of that (the good) which you used to do (in the world)’ is something else.<strong> That which is established in the <em>aayah</em> and the like is merely the entrance (into Paradise)</strong>, i.e., the key to Paradise, as mentioned in some narrations from <em>Wahb bin Munabbih</em> in <em>Saheeh al-Bukhaari</em>: ‘…the key to Paradise is <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> (none has the right to be worshiped but Allaah).’[8]<strong> So the key to Paradise is this <em>eemaan</em> (faith) and righteous deeds. But, if this Muslim enters Paradise and he enjoys in it, </strong>as mentioned in some authentic narrations, that which ‘no eye has seen, no ear has heard and (that which) has not come to the mind of a human being,’[9] <strong>then this type of enjoyment is not by means of a price that this enjoyer presented, but rather (it is) by the Favor of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and His Mercy.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the price of merely entering (into Paradise) is<em> eemaan</em> (faith) and righteous deeds. As for, part of the specific nature of enjoyment in Paradise which we pointed to previously – there is in it what ‘no eye has seen, no ear has heard and (what) has not come to the mind of a human being’ – then there is no price for this; it is impossible for a price to be determined for it. Why?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been mentioned in <em>Saheeh Muslim</em> from the <em>hadeeth</em> of <em>‘Abdullaah bin Mas’ood</em> (<em>radi Allaahu ‘anhu</em>) that the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) said:[10] ‘Indeed, I know the last man to come out from the Fire and the last man to enter Paradise. A man will come out of the Fire crawling.’ The meaning of this is that he comes out of the Fire being the most punished in it from the Muslims,and he comes out destroyed, exhausted (and) fatigued. Therefore, he is not able to walk straight as Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, created him. But rather, he crawls until his life returns to him and his limbs are energetic and active. So he walks in this manner until Allaah, the Blessed and Most High, shows him a very great tree from far such that he is captivated by its beauty and splendor. And he wished for the Favor of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and His Mercy after He saved him from the His severe punishment. Thus, he says: ‘O my Lord! Bring me to this tree so that I may be shaded by its shade, eat from its fruit[11] and drink from its water.’ Then Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, says, while having more knowledge of His slave: ‘Would you ask me for other than it?’ (The man) says: ‘No O Lord, I will not ask you for other than it.’ So Allaah, the Blessed and Most High, brings him to that tree such that he is shaded by its shade, eats from its fruit and drinks from its water. Then, he continues on his way toward Paradise. Meanwhile, another tree appears to him which is more radiant, more beautiful and greater than the first one. So he hopes again and wishes more and more for the Favor of Allaah, so he asks Him and says: ‘O my Lord! Bring me to this tree’- and repeats the previous saying, then he is shaded by its shade and so on. Then Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, says: ‘Would you ask me for other than it?’ (The man) says: ‘I will not ask you for other than it,’ while (Allaah) is more knowledgeable of him; our Lord knows that he will wish and wish until he enters Paradise. So He brings him to that tree such that he is shaded by its shade, eats from its fruit[12] and drinks from its water. Then, he continues on his way until he comes near the door of Paradise such that part of its refreshment, scent and joy come to him and he hears the voices of the people of Paradise. Thus, he says: ‘O my Lord! Let me enter Paradise,’ and maybe he says ‘Let me enter past the door of Paradise.’ So Allaah, the Blessed and Most High, says: ‘Enter Paradise, and there is for you the like of the world and ten times as much.’ So, the slave – almost not believing in the like of this divine favor when (Allaah) says to him ‘there is for you in Paradise the like of the world and ten times as much’ – says: ‘Are you mocking me while you are the Lord?’ And here, the narrator of the <em>hadeeth</em> laughed, who was <em>‘Abdullaah bin Mas’ood</em> as we mentioned. So he was asked by the one to whom he was narrating this <em>hadeeth</em>: ‘Why did you laugh?’ He said: ‘Because when the Messenger (of Allaah) (<em>‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) narrated the statement of the slave to His Lord ‘Are you mocking me while you are the Lord,’ he <em>(‘alayhi ssalaat was salaam</em>) had also laughed.’ They had asked the Messenger (of Allaah) (<em>‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) himself (about his reason for laughing), so he [<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>] said: ‘Because Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, laughed at His slave when he said ‘Are you mocking me while you are the Lord.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is clear from the <em>hadeeth</em> is that this person is the last to come out from the Fire and the last to enter Paradise, and he will have the like of the world and ten times as much. So does this destroyed person, who was the last to come out of the Fire, deserve this vast dominion in Paradise for his (good) deeds? No, this is by the Favor of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and His Mercy…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, if we regard this detailed explanation, the contradiction disappears between this <em>hadeeth</em> and the two <em>aayaat</em>. And this is one of the many examples in which some contradiction appears to some people, even the sincere ones amongst them, between some texts, whether from the <em>Qur’aan </em>and <em>Sunnah </em>or from each of them individually. So, the Muslim must not be hasty and he must reflect on both texts, and if the way for reconciling between the two is not possible for him, he (should) ask the one who is above him, as our Lord, the Blessed and Most High, said: ‘So ask the people of the Reminder if you do not know.’”[13]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Question posed to Shaykh Ibn Baaz, rahimahullah:</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">Q. Are the deeds of a child who has not yet reached the age of puberty such as prayer, Hajj and the reading of the Qur&#8217;aan attributed to his parents or are they attributed to him?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A.  The good deeds of a child who has not yet reached the age of puberty and their rewards are for him and not for his parents or anyone else.  His parents are rewarded for having taught him to perform these deeds, for directing him to do good and for helping him in them.  This is indicated by the hadeeth in Saheeh Muslim, narrated by Ibn Abbaas, that a woman lifted a child to the Prophet, salallahu &#8216;alayhi wa salam, during his farewell Hajj and said:  &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, is there Hajj for him?&#8221;  He, salallahu &#8216;alayhi wa salam, replied:  &#8220;Yes, and there is reward for you.&#8221;The Prophet, salallahu &#8216;alayhi wa salam, informed us that the Hajj is for the child, and that his mother is rewarded for her Hajj with him.  Similarly, there is reward for others besides the child&#8217;s parents, for the good they do such as teaching orphans, relatives, servants and others, due to the Prophet&#8217;s, salallahu &#8216;alayhi wa salam, saying:  &#8220;For the one who guides to good, a reward similar to that of the one who performs it.&#8221;  Narrated in Saheeh Muslim.  This is because it is from the assisting one another in virtue and fearfulness of Allah and that He, Glory be to Him, rewards for this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: alkhawf wa rrajaa &#8211; fear and hope (of Allaah) &#8211; tape no. 1, asaheeha translations</p>
<p><strong>shaykh al-albaani (rahimahullaah)</strong> begins with the khutbat ul-haajah maa shaa Allaah, and the first part of his talk revolves around the meaning of the hadeeth below:</p>
<p>Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><em><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Allaah says [to the angels], &#8216;If My slave intends to do a bad deed then do not write it against him until he does it; if he does it, then write it as it is, but if he leaves it for My sake, then write it as a good deed for him. And if he intends to go a good deed, but does not do it, then write it as a good deed for him; and if he does it, then write it for him as ten good deeds up to seven-hundred times as much up to many more times&#8221;</span></em> &#8211; [Saheeh al-Bukhaari]</p>
<p>The shaykh comments and speaks on the many favors of Allaah upon His believing slave:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;&#8230;First, if he does a good deed it [the count of the deeds] is multiplied &#8211; as for a bad deed, then it [the count of the deeds] is not multiplied.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Second, if he did not do a bad deed, and had intended to do it, nothing is written against him, as opposed to [gaining a] good deed: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">if he intended to do (a bad deed), then did not do it, a good deed is written for him. Why? &#8211; because he left it fearing Allaah &#8216;azza wa jal. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">And the [understanding of] this is that if he intends to do a bad deed, then leaves it and does not act upon it for some reason, and it is not (because of) his fear of Allaah, the Blessed and Most High, then nothing is written upon him, neither a bad deed nor a good deed.</span> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">As for if his motive for leaving this bad deed was his fear of Allaah &#8216;azza wa jal, then this bad deed, because of his leaving it, turns into a good deed. Hence, fearing Allaah &#8216;azza wa jal pushes its possessor (the possessor of the quality of fearing Allaah) to have many good deeds. Every time he intends to do a bad deed and he leaves it fearing Allaah, the bad intention turns into a good deed.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Let&#8217;s strive to be close to Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let&#8217;s long for the dwelling of peace wherein there is no toil, stress or weariness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The easiest way is to consider the fact that you are passing a period that lies between two other periods, namely your current life, which is the present one and it is between your past and your future.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The past can be set aright through repentance, regret and asking the forgiveness of Allah, and this is a way, which affords you no toil, weariness or hard work, as it is concerned with the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The future can be set aright by abstaining from misdeeds, and this is a means of comfort and relief for you, for it is not a difficult act, but it is an intention that relieves your body, heart, and your mind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In brief, your past is set aright through repentance; your future is set aright through abstention, determination and intention, which have nothing to do with overburdening the body.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, our concern here is with the present time as it stands between the two other periods. If you waste it, then you are wasting your happiness and salvation. On the contrary, if you maintain it through setting your past and present aright, indeed you will attain success, salvation, relief, and pleasure.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Improving your present state is much more difficult than setting your past and your future aright, because it means that you should abide by the most deserving and beneficial deeds to achieve happiness. There are great differences between people in this regard. This is your chance to take the provision for your Hereafter, either Paradise or Hellfire. So, if you take this path to your Lord, you will attain glorious happiness and great success during this short period of time which has no value compared with eternity. However, if you prefer vain desires, idleness, play and amusement, the period would pass quickly, followed by a permanent and great pain, the suffering of which is much more severe than the suffering of patience, the patience required to obey Allah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Faith has both apparent and hidden aspects. Its apparent aspect is when it is related by the tongue and acted upon by the body. The hidden aspect is the acknowledgment of the heart, and its submission and love. Therefore, the apparent aspect of faith will be of no use for someone who does not have the hidden aspect, though his blood is spared and his wealth and children are preserved by it. And no hidden aspect will be of any use, unless there is no fear that it will be weakened, coerced or in fear of being ruined. Therefore, the failure of apparent deeds without the existence of any real prevention, means the corruption of the hidden aspect and lack of faith. Its deficiency refers to its deficiency of faith and intensity refers to its intensity of faith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, faith is the heart and core of Islam, and certainty is the heart and core of faith.<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> Any piece of knowledge or deed that does not make faith and certainty stronger is abnormal, and any faith that does not urge one to perform good deeds is abnormal.</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The religious scholars who prefer and Love this worldly life shall surely speak other than the truth concerning their judgments and religious verdicts. Verily, the judgments of Allah usually contradict the desires of people especially the rulers and those who follow their whims, as their aims cannot be attained except by opposing the truth.</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, if the ruler and the religious scholar seek position and power and follow their desires, indeed they will not be able to fulfill their aims except by deviating from the truth, especially if there is a doubtful matter involved. The doubtful matter will agree with the desires of man, and vanity will prevail. As a result, righteousness will disappear, and truth will vanish.</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, there is no doubtful matter in the truth, so how can wrong doers dare to oppose it openly, assuming that they will be able to repent afterwards. Such behavior is mentioned in a Qur&#8217;anic verse in which Allah says, which means,</p>
<div style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Then, there has succeeded them a posterity who have given up As-Salat (the prayers) [i.e. made their Salat (prayers) to be lost, either by not offering them or by not offering them perfectly or by not offering them at their proper fixed times, etc.] and have followed lusts.&#8221;</span> (Mariam, 19:59)</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They were also mentioned in another verse, in which Allah says,which means,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Then after them succeeded an (evil) generation, which inherited the Book, but they chose (for themselves) the goods of this low life (evil pleasures of this world) saying (as an excuse): &#8220;(Everything) will be forgiven to us. And if (again) the offer of the like (evil pleasures of this world) came their way, they would (again) seize them (would commit those sins). Was not the covenant of the Book taken from them that they would not say about Allah anything but the truth? And they have studied what is in it (the Book). And the home of the Hereafter is better for those who are AI-Muttaqun (the pious). Do not you then understand?&#8217;</span>1 (Al-A&#8217;raf, 7:169)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, informs us that those wrong doers have chosen the goods of this low life (the evil pleasures of this world) despite being aware of its unlawfulness. Moreover, they say, as an excuse, &#8220;(Everything) will be forgiven to us.And if (again) the offer of the like (evil pleasures of this world) came their way, they would (again) seize them (would commit those sins), so they are insistent upon that, and that is the reason why they dare to utter falsehood against Allah, assuming that the judgment and the religion of Allah are implied therein.Either they know the fact that the religion and the judgment of Allah contradict their claims, or they do not know. The result is that sometimes they utter falsehood against Allah, or else they say what is unlawful.On the other hand, the pious know quite well that the Hereafter is better than this worldly life, so loving leadership and following one&#8217;s desires would not be a temptation to them, so they would never prefer this worldly life to the Hereafter. They have only one path, which is abiding by the Glorious Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah. Besides, they seek help in patience and prayer, think deeply about this worldly life, its transient nature and its inferiority, and they compare it with the Hereafter, its greatness and the fact that it is eternal.Following one&#8217;s desires can blind the heart in a way that makes it confused between the Sunnah and innovation in religion. Sometimes, one may be confused whether or not an action is based on the Sunnah or on an innovation in religion. In fact, when misunderstandings like this occur, it is the fault of religious scholars as they prefer this worldly life and follow the rulers, and their vain desires.They are mentioned in these verses in which Allah says,which means,</p>
<div style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And recite (O Muhammad Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam)) to them the story of him to whom We gave Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), but he threw them away, so Shaitan (Satan) followed him up, and he became of those who went astray. And had We willed, We would surely have elevated him therewith but he clung to the earth and followed his own vain desire. So his description is the description of a dog: if you drive him away, he lolls his tongue out, or it you leave him alone, he (still) lolls his tongue out&#8221;</span> (Al-A&#8217;raf, 7: 175¬176)</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this is the likeness of the devious scholar of religion whose deeds contradict his knowledge.The previous verses dispraised this behavior as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>One</strong>: He has gone astray after having been knowledgeable, and he has knowingly chosen disbelief over faith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Two</strong>: He abandoned faith entirely with no return, so, he threw away the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), like the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">serpent which throws away its skin</span>.So, if there was any remnant thereof, he could not throw it away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Three</strong>: Satan controlled him and so he tempted and seduced him, and that is why Allah says, &#8220;Satan followed him up, and He did not say, pursue him&#8221;, because following up means reaching and attaining him, which is much more eloquent than saying, &#8220;pursue him,&#8221; as far as meaning and expression are concerned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Four</strong>: He has erred after having been guided, which means that he has gone astray in knowledge and in intention, which is related to the corruption of his intention and deeds. Going astray is related to the corruption of knowledge and belief, and the corruption of one side entails the corruption of the other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Five</strong>: If Allah, the Exalted, had so willed, He could have elevated him with knowledge, which would have prevented his destruction. In other words, if he was not knowledgeable, it would have been much better for him, and would have meant a lesser torment for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Six</strong>: Allah, the Exalted, informed us about his wicked intention, mentioning that he has preferred inferiority rather than the most honorable and the most righteous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Seven</strong>: His inferior choice was not chosen because of an idea that crossed his mind, on the contrary, it was chosen due to his desire to cling  to the earth. Clinging means permanent adherence, as if it was said, &#8220;He is sticking to the earth.&#8221; The Qur&#8217;anic expression described his inclination to this worldly life by referring to his clinging to the earth, because the worldly life is the earth, and those who are living therein, and everything that can be extracted thereof, either for adornment or enjoyment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Eight</strong>: He deviated from the right path following his vain desires, so his own desire resembles a leader who should be followed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Nine</strong>: He, the Almighty compared him to a dog, which is the most low amongst creatures, because of its greed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ten</strong>: He compares his <span style="text-decoration:underline;">covetousness </span>to this worldly life and his <span style="text-decoration:underline;">impatience </span>thereto and his grief of being deprived thereof by the lolling out of the dog&#8217;s tongue, whether it is left alone or driven away. Accordingly, if that person is left alone, then he will be covetous of this worldly life, and if he is advised he will still be covetous. of this worldly life. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">He clings to covetousness like the dog with its tongue lolling out</span>. Ibn Qutaibiyah said, &#8220;Surely everyone pants because they are exhausted or thirsty, except dogs, for it is their habit to pant while lolling their tongues out in all cases, whether they are exhausted or not, and whether they are thirsty or not, and that is why the Qur&#8217;anic expression compared it to the disbeliever, asserting that he has gone astray whether he is advised or left on his own. This is like the dog whether it is left alone or driven away.</p>

Say (O Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam): &#8220;O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians): Come to a word that is just between us and you, that we worship none but Allaah, and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take others as lords besides Allaah.&#8221; Then, if they turn away, say: &#8220;Bear witness that we are Muslims.&#8221; (Aali Imraan 3:64)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (ta’aalaa) said: And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. (Al-Israa’ 17:23)<br />
And this is the meaning of: (I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah) [Ash-hadu an-laa Ilaaha illa-Allaah].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And The Second (ath-Thaanee):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That we do not worship Him except by what He legislated in His Book or in the Sunnah of His Messenger Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam), without innovations and desires [An-laa Na’budahu illaa bimaa Shara’ fee Kitaabihi aw fee Sunnati Rasoolihi Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) laa bil-Bida’i wal-Ahwaa’].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (ta’aalaa) said:<br />
[Say (O Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) to these idolaters (pagan ‘Arabs) of your folk:] Follow what has been sent down unto you from your Lord (the Qur’aan and Prophet Muhammad&#8217;s Sunnah), and follow not any Awliyaa&#8217; (protectors and helpers, etc. who order you to associate partners in worship with Allaah), besides Him (Allaah). Little do you remember! (Al-A&#8217;raaf 7:3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (ta’aalaa) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) gives you, take it, and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it), and fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is Severe in punishment. (Al-Hashr 59:7) And this is the meaning of: (I bear witness that Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) is the Messenger of Allaah) [Ash-hadu anna Muhammadar-Rasool-ullaah].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah) said in his valuable book ((Iqtidaa’ as- Siraatul-Mustaqeem Mukhaalifat Ashaab al-Jaheem)) [The Requirements of the Straight Path in Opposing the Companions of the Fire] page 451:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">( And these two fundamentals: are the essence of the religion (Jimaa’ ad-Deen): That we do not worship anyone except Allaah and that we do not worship Him except with what He has legislated, and we do not worship Him with innovations … and these two fundamentals, they are the realization and the perfection of the two testimonies (ash-Shahaadatayn), which are the head of al- Islaam … ). End of quote. And see at-Tahqeeq wal-‘Eedaah of ash-Shaykh Ibn Baaz (rahimahullaah) page: 63.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>EXPLANATION OF THE TEXT BY SHAYKH AHMED AL-WASAABEE (HAFIDHAHULLAAH):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the first fundamental principle, which is the Tawheed of Allaah, the Shaykh mentioned that in the Kitaab of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger we find many Aayaat and Ahaadeeth that point to this great fundamental principle. And it was for this cause that Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa) sent His Messengers, and He ordered them to call the people first and foremost to this fundamental principle, which is the Tawheed of Allaah, and the oneness of Allaah in His worship (Tawheed al-Ulooheeyah), and the oneness of Allaah in His Names and Attributes (Tawheed al- Asmaa was-Sifaat), and the oneness of Allaah in His Lordship (Tawheed ar-Ruboobeeyah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa) said:<br />
And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): &#8220;Worship Allaah (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from) Taaghoot (all false deities, etc. i.e. do not worship Taaghoot besides Allaah).&#8221; (An-Nahl 16:36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (ta’aalaa) said:<br />
And We did not send any Messenger before you (O Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam)) but We inspired him (saying): Laa Ilaaha Illaa Ana [none has the right to be worshipped but I (Allaah)], so worship Me (Alone and none else).&#8221; (Al-Anbiyaa’ 21:25)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a person worships Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa) and obeys these commands of Allaah, then this is the realization of Tawheed, and this is the first fundamental which this religion of al-Islaam is based upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the second fundamental principle, and it is that we do not worship Allaah except by what He has legislated in His Book or in the Sunnah of His Messenger Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam), and that we do not worship Him with innovations and desires. The Shaykh mentioned that those who beautify and make beautiful to themselves innovations and desires, and from the innovations is celebrating the Mawlid (birthday) of the Prophet (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam), which is an innovation of the Soofiyyah, and the Shaykh mentioned that this is not allowable in our religion and it is not legislated, and the people who perform this, they are under a severe threat. Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa) has issued a severe warning against those who oppose and go against the commandments of the Messenger:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And let those who oppose the Messenger&#8217;s (Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam)) commandment (i.e. his Sunnah legal ways, orders, acts of worship, statements, etc.) (among the sects) beware, lest some Fitnah (disbelief, trials, afflictions, earthquakes, killing, overpowered by a tyrant, etc.) befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them. (An-Noor 24:63)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have been ordered to be followers and we have been ordered to take firm hold of the Sunnah. So that which the Prophet (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) has given us, then it is upon to take it and firmly hold on to it, and that which he prohibited us from then it is upon us to prohibit ourselves from it. And the one who goes against the clear orders of the Messenger (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) is in opposition to the Messenger, and he is on a great level of jeopardy, and if Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa) does not give him the Tawfeeq to repent, and he dies upon this, then he is in a dangerous state. And many of the people in this day and age have fallen into numerous types of innovations, such as the Soofiyyah and the Raafidhah, and other than them. And they have not prohibited themselves from that which the Prophet (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) has prohibited them from, and they have not enjoined upon themselves that which the Prophet (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) has enjoined upon them and ordered them with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the valuable book of Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah is the warning to the Believers of following the path of the people whose destination is the Fire, the people of the Book, the Jews and the Christians. And in this day and age we find many of the Muslims following the Kuffaar in all levels of life. And verily we have been ordered to oppose the Kuffaar in all actions and in all levels of life, such as our speech, and our character, and in our dress, and in our actions of worship, so much so that even in the prayer, as the Prophet (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) has said: ((Pray in your shoes, for verily the Jews do not pray in their shoes)). A Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And many of the Muslims have invented various holidays following in the footsteps of the Kuffaar, such as labor day, and workers holiday, and mothers day, and other holidays like this, all of which are alien to al-Islaam and all of which are innovations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Principle of Permissibility</strong></p>
<p>Source : Islamic Principles #1: The Principle of Permissibility , Al-Istiqaamah Issue No.5 &#8211; Ramadân 1417H / January 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The principle regarding acts of worship is one of prohibition, except if the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> (Divinely Prescribed Law) relates a prescription for it. And the principle regarding customary behaviour is permissibility, except when the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> relates a prohibition for it.&#8221; (<em><strong>Al-aslu fil-&#8216;ibaadat al-hadhru illaa ma waradah &#8216;anish-shar&#8217;ee tashree&#8217;ahu. Wal-aslu fil-&#8216;aadaat al-ibaahah illaa ma waradah &#8216;anish-shar&#8217;ee tahreemahu</strong></em>).1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above principle is an important principle that Islaam teaches. Thus, with regards to matters of <em>&#8216;aadaat</em> (day-to-day actions), such as eating, drinking and wearing clothes, then everything is allowed in this regard, except if there is a clear and authentic evidence restricting or prohibiting its allowance. However, when it comes to <em>&#8216;ibaadaat</em> (acts of worship), then the opposite is the true. Here, nothing can be established as an act of worship, except if there is a clear and authentic text to allow it. So the basic principle for <em>&#8216;aadaat</em> is <em>ibaahah</em> (permissibility), whereas the basic principle for <em>&#8216;ibaadaat</em> is <em>tahreem</em> (prohibition).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H)- <em>rahimahullaah</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Peoples&#8217; sayings and actions are of two kinds: <em>&#8216;ibaadaat</em> (acts of worship) by which their Religion is established, and <em>&#8216;aadaat</em> (customary practices) which are required for day-to-day living. From the principles of the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> (Divinely Prescribed Islaamic Law) we know that acts of worship are those acts which have been prescribed by Allaah or approved by Him; nothing is to be affirmed here, except through the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em>. However, as far as worldly activities of people are concerned, they are necessary for everyday life. Here the principle is freedom of action; nothing may be restricted in this regard except what Allaah &#8211; the Mort Perfect &#8211; has restricted. This is the case because commanding and prohibiting are both in Allaah&#8217;s Hands. As far as worship is concerned, there has to be a command from Him concerning it. Thus, when it requires a command from Allaah to establish something, how can we say that something is restricted without His command? This is why Ahmad bin Hanbal (d.241H) and other jurists who base their judgements upon <em>ahaadeeth</em> (Prophetic narrations) say: In relation to acts of worship, then the principle is tawqeef (limitation); that is to lay, nothing can be legislated in this regard except what Allaah legislates. To do otherwise is to incur the risk of being included in the meaning of the <em>Aayah</em> (verse):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Do they have partners with Allaah who prescribe for them in the Religion that for which Allaah has not given any permission.&#8221;</strong> [Soorah ash-Shooraa 42:21].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, as far as living habits are concerned, the principle here is freedom, because nothing can be restricted in this regard except what Allaah has prohibited. To do otherwise is to be included in the meaning of His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Say: Do you see what Allaah has sent down to you for sustenance? Yet you have made some part of it <em>halaal</em> (lawful) and some part <em>haraam</em> (prohibited).&#8221;</strong> [Soorah Yoonus 10:59].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a great and beneficial principle, on the basis of which we can say that buying, selling, leasing, giving gifts, and other such matters are necessary activities for people, as are eating, drinking and the wearing of clothes. Thus, if the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> (Divinely Prescribed Islaamic Law) says something about these day-to-day matters, it is in order to teach good behaviour. Accordingly, it has prohibited whatever leads to corruption, has made obligatory that which is essential, has disapproved of that which is superfluous, and has approved of that which is beneficial. All this has been done with due consideration of the magnitude and properties of the various types of activities involved. Since this is the position of the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em>, people are free to buy, sell and to lease just as they wish, just as they are free to eat and drink what they like &#8211; as long as it is not <em>haraam</em> (unlawful). Even though some of these things may be disapproved, they are still free in this regard, since the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> does not go to the extent of prohibiting them &#8211; and thus the original principle (of permissibility) remains.&#8221;2</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning Allaah’s statement (what means): <strong>And those who give that (their charity) which they give (and also do other good deeds) with their hearts full of fear (whether their alms and charities, etc., have been accepted or not), because they are sure to return to their Lord (for reckoning).</strong> (Al-Mu’minun 23:60)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And those who give that which they give with their hearts full of fear, because they are sure to return to their Lord.) means, they give in charity, fearing that it may not be accepted from them because of some shortcoming or failure to meet the required conditions of giving. This has to do with fear and taking precautions, as Imam Ahmad recorded from `A&#8217;ishah: I said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah,</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic" style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">﴿وَالَّذِينَ يُؤْتُونَ مَآ ءاتَواْ وَّقُلُوبُهُمْ وَجِلَةٌ﴾</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And those who give that which they give with their hearts full of fear&#8230;) Are these the ones who steal and commit Zina and drink alcohol while fearing Allah&#8221; The Messenger of Allah replied:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic" style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">«لَا، يَا بِنْتَ أَبِي بَكْرٍ يَا بِنْتَ الصِّدِّيقِ، وَلَكِنَّهُ الَّذِي يُصَلِّي وَيَصُومُ وَيَتَصَدَّقُ وَهُوَ يَخَافُ اللهَ عَزَّ وَجَل»</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(No, O daughter of Abu Bakr. O daughter of As-Siddiq, the one who prays, fast and gives in charity, fearing Allah.) This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi, and Ibn Abi Hatim recorded something similar in which the Prophet said:</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic" style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">«لَا يَا بِنْتَ الصِّدِّيقِ، وَلَكِنَّهُمُ الَّذِينَ يُصَلُّونَ وَيَصُومُونَ وَيَتَصَدَّقُونَ وَهُمْ يَخَافُونَ أَلَّا يُقْبَلَ مِنْهُمْ:</span></p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="AyahArabic" style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">﴿أُوْلَـئِكَ يُسَـرِعُونَ فِى الْخَيْرَتِ﴾»</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(No, O daughter of As-Siddiq, they are the ones who pray and fast and give in charity while fearing that it will not be accepted from them, (It is these who hasten in the good deeds.)) This is also how Ibn `Abbas, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi and Al-Hasan Al-Basri interpreted this Ayah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the peace and blessings be upon His Messenger Muhammad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is legislated for all the Muslims to strive hard in the various types of worship during this noble month.</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>They should strive to <strong>pray voluntary prayers</strong> and</li>
<li><strong>recite the Qur`an</strong> with reflection and thinking.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">They should increase the <strong>glorification of Allaah</strong> [saying &#8220;SubhanAllaah&#8221;], declaring Allaah&#8217;s right to be worshiped alone [saying &#8220;La illaaha il Allaah&#8221;], praising Him [saying &#8220;Al-Hamdulillaah&#8221;], declaring His greatness [saying &#8220;Allaahu Akbar&#8221;] and seeking His forgiveness.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>They should</strong></p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>say legislated supplications,</li>
<li>command the good, forbid the evil,</li>
<li>invite to Allaah,</li>
<li>be generous to the poor and needy,</li>
<li>strive to be kind to parents,</li>
<li>keep good family ties,</li>
<li>honor the neighbor,</li>
<li>visit the sick, and</li>
<li>other types of good deeds.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is due to the Prophet&#8217;s (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000080;">&#8220;Allaah looks at your competing for good works during it and He proudly tells the angels about you all. Therefore, show Allaah goodness from yourselves. For verily, the wretched person is the one who is deprived of Allaah&#8217;s Mercy during it (Ramadaan).&#8221;</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; Majma &#8216;uz-Zawa&#8217;id 3:142; Kanzul-&#8216;Ummal no. 23692.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is also due to what is reported from him (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever draws near to Allaah during it (Ramadaan) with a single characteristic from the characteristics of (voluntary) goodness, he is like whoever performs an obligatory act in other times. And whoever performs an obligatory act during it, he is like whoever performed seventy obligatory acts in other times.&#8221; &#8211; Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah, no. 1887.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is also due to his (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) statement in the authentic hadith:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>&#8220;An &#8216;Umrah performed during Ramadaan is equal to a performance of Hajj &#8211; or he said &#8211; a Hajj with me.&#8221;</strong> </span>&#8211; Al-Bukhari (no. 1863) and Muslim (no. 1256).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ahadith and narrations that prove the sanctioning of competing, and being aggressive in performing the various acts of goodness in this noble month are numerous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is the one Who is asked to help us and the rest of the Muslims to do all that contains His Pleasure and to accept our fast and standing for night prayer. We ask Him to correct our situations and protect us all from the deviations of trials and temptations. Likewise, we ask Him to make the leaders of the Muslims righteous, and unite their word upon the truth. Verily, Allaah is the Guardian of that, and He is capable of doing it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Source</strong> :Class 42 from <a title="‘al-Qawl-ul- Mufeed Fee Adillatit-Tawhid’ [Beneficial Speech in Establishing the Evidences of Tawhid] – Shaykh Muhammad al-Wasabi" href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2014/01/17/tawheed-lessons-wasabi/">Lessons on Tawhid &#8211; Approximately 50 Classes</a> &#8211; from Dar-ul-Hadith, Dammaj, Yemen new</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>These were lessons conducted on the book &#8216;al-Qawl-ul- Mufeed Fee Adillatit-Tawhid&#8217; [Beneficial Speech in Establishing the Evidences of Tawhid] written by one of the major scholars of the Sunnah in Yemen, Shaikh Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhab al-Wasabi (may Allah preserve him).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Qisam al-Awwal (The First Category): </strong></p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>They do not want by this from the people a recompense or thankfulness, and nor do they seek a high position with them, and they do not seek praise and position in their heart, and they are not fleeing from their rebuke. Verily, they see the people [who are alive] in the position of the people of the grave, those who do not control for them harm or benefit, or life or death, or resurrection. So actions for the people, and seeking a position with them,and hoping in harm or benefit from them [i.e. the general people], is not from them [i.e. these category of people]. Verily, it is from those who are ignorant of the situation and ignorant of their Lord. And whoever knows the people and puts them in their proper places, and knows Allaah, is sincere in his actions and his statements and his givings and his forgivings and his love and his hatred. So no one does actions and deeds for the creation other than Allaah except that he is ignorant of Allaah and ignorant of the creation. For verily, the one who knows Allaah and knows the people prefers actions and deeds for Allaah over actions and deeds for the people.</li>
<li>So their actions, all of them, are for Allaah, and all of their statements are for Allaah, and their giving and their forgiving is for Allaah, and their love is for Allaah and their hatred is for Allaah, and their actions, both in the apparent and the hidden, are for the face of Allaah alone.</li>
<li>Those who have gathered between Ikhlaas (sincerity) and Mutaabi’ah (following the guidance of the Prophet).</li>
<li>And like this their actions, all of them, and their worship is in agreement with the command of Allaah, and with what He loves and what He is Pleased with. And Allaah does not accept from the people any action except this. And Allaah has tested His servants with life and death, so He said: Who has created death and life, that He may test you which of you is best in deed. (Al-Mulk 67:2)</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He has made that which is upon the earth as a beauty for them upon the earth so that He may test them which of them are best in actions and deeds. al-Fudayl ibn ‘Iyyaad said: A beautiful action (al-‘Amal al-Hasan) is that which is sincere (Akhlasuh) and that which is correct (Aswabuh).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: Oh Abaa ‘Alee, what is sincere and what is correct? He said: Verily, if the action is sincere (Khaalis) but it is not correct (Sawaab): it is not accepted (Lam Yuqbal), and if it is correct but it is not sincere: it is not accepted, until it is sincere and correct. And a sincere [action] is: that which is for Allaah, and a correct [action] is: that which is upon the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is mentioned in His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord. (Al-Kahf 18:110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in His (ta’aalaa) statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And who can be better in religion than one who submits his face (himself) to Allaah (i.e. follows Allaah&#8217;s Religion of Islaamic Monotheism); and he is a Muhsin (a good-doer). And follows the religion of Ibraaheem (Abraham) Haneefaa (Islaamic Monotheism &#8211; to worship none but Allaah Alone). (An-Nisaa’ 4:125)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah does not accept from the actions except that which is done sincerely seeking His Face, and that which is in agreement with His Order, and other than this is not accepted, rather it is repelled back on the person who does it at a time when he is in most need of it, and it is turned intoscattered ashes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in as-Saheehayn [i.e. al-Bukhaaree and Muslim] from the narration of ‘Aa’ishah (radiyAllaahu ‘anhaa) who narrated from the Prophet (Peace be Upon him), that he said: ((Whoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it will have it rejected)). And in the narration from Muslim: ((Whoever does a deed that is not ordered by us will have it rejected)).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So every action that is not in agreement [with the Sunnah], then it does not increase its doer except in distance away from Allaah, for verily Allaah (ta’aalaa) is only worshipped with what He has ordered to be worshipped with, not with opinions (Aaraa’) and desires (Ahwaa’).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Qisam ath-Thaanee (The Second Category): </strong></p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Those who have no sincerity and have no adherence to the Sunnah,so their actions and deeds are not in agreement with the legislation, and they are not sincere to the One who is worshipped.</li>
<li>They are like the ones who beautify themselvesto the people, showing-off to them with that which Allaah has not decreed and that which the Messenger has not informed the people of. And they are the evilest of creation (Shiraarul-Khalq).</li>
<li>And they are the most disliked and the most hated of people to Allaah (‘azza wa jall), and they havethe biggest portion of His (ta’aalaa) statement: Think not that those who rejoice in what they have done (or brought about), and love to be praised for what they have not done,- think not you that they are rescued from the torment, and for them is a painful torment. (Aali Imraan3:188)</li>
<li>They are happy with what they do from innovation (Bid’ah) and misguidance (Dalaalah) and association (Shirk), and they love that they be praised as they are the followers of the Sunnah and the people of sincerity – and they are not from the people of the Sunnah or sincerity (Ahlus-Sunnati wal-Ikhlaas) –</li>
<li>And this category of people are numerous, from the people who have gone astray from the ones who are alienated from the people of knowledge (‘Ilm), and poverty (Faqr), and worship (‘Ibaadah), from the Straight Path (Siraatul-Mustaqeem).</li>
<li>For verily they do actions of innovation and misguidance to show-off and to be heard-off, and they love to be praised for that which they have not done from the following of the Sunnah, and possessing sincerity and knowledge. So they are the people of hatred and misguidance (Ahlul-Ghadabi wad-Dalaal).</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Qisam ath-Thaalith (The Third Category)</strong>:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>The one who is sincere in his actions and deeds,but his actions and deeds are not in agreement with the order of Allaah.</li>
<li>And they are like the ignorant worshippers and the ones who are from the path of abstinence (Zuhud) and poverty (Faqr).</li>
<li>And they are the ones who worship Allaah with other than what He has decreed and legislated, and they believe that their worship is bringing them close to Allaah.</li>
<li>And they believe that listening to clapping and whistling is bringing them close to Allaah, and being isolated and leaving off the Jumu’ah [i.e. the Friday prayer] and the Jama’ah [i.e. the mandatory prayers] is also being close to Allaah, and continuing the fast until the night is also being close to Allaah, and fasting the two holidays (Siyaam al-‘Eedayn) of al-Islaam is also a way of being close to Allaah.</li>
<li>And they try to get close to Allaah with actions of innovation (Bid’ah) and disobedience (Ma’aasee).</li>
<li>So the sincerity of a person in this state does not benefit him because these actions that he does are from the actions of innovation. And the actions of the innovator are not accepted, and the proof being in the Hadeeth of Umm-ul-Mu’mineen ‘Aa’ishah (radiyAllaahu ‘anhaa), raised to the saying of the Prophet (Peace be upon him): ((Whoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it will have it rejected)). Agreed Upon [i.e. reported by al-Bukhaaree and Muslim].</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Qisam ar-Raabi’ (The Fourth Category):</strong></p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>The one whose actions are in accordance with the Sunnah, but they are for the sake of other than Allaah.</li>
<li>Such as obedience of the ones who show-off, and like the ones who fight to show-off, and because of great pride and great courageousness. And he does the Hajj so that it may be said that he has performed the Hajj.</li>
<li>And he reads the Qur’aan so that it may be said that he reads the Qur’aan.</li>
<li>And the actions of these people, from the apparent they seem righteous, but they are not righteous since they are performed for other than the sake of Allaah, so they are not accepted. Allaah (ta’aalaa) said: And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allaah, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him). (Al-Baiyinah 98:5)</li>
<li>So they have not been ordered except that they worship Allaah with that which He has legislated and with sincerity to Him in all their worship.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the people of sincerity and adherence (Ahlul-Ikhlaas wal-Mutaabi’ah), they are the people of:You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything). (Al-Faatihah 1:5)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Al-Fu<span style="text-decoration:underline;">d</span>ayl b. ‘Ayyâ<span style="text-decoration:underline;">d</span> [187H] – Allah have mercy on him – said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allah ‘azza wa jalla accepts only those deeds which are both correct and sincere (pure). If the deed is done correctly but not sincerely, it will not be accepted. And if it is sincere but not correct, it will not be accepted.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was asked, “Abû ‘Alî! What is the sincere and correct deed?” He replied,<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">“The sincere deed is one that is done only for Allah ‘azza wa jall. And the correct deed is one done according to the Sunnah.”</span></p>
