<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The First Hadeeth</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After this introduction, the first hadeeth concerns the intention. This is the hadeeth of ‘Umar ibn al Khataab (<em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu</em>), the leader of the believers and the second khalifah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ameerul-Mu’mineen, Abi Hafs (may Allaah be pleased with him) said that: “The Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(The value of)<strong> an action depends on the intention behind it. A man will be rewarded only for what he intended. The emigration of one who emigrates for the sake of Allaah and His Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) is for the sake of Allaah and His Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>) ; and the emigration of one who emigrates for gaining a worldly advantage or for marrying a woman is for what he has emigrated.”</strong></span> [Sahih Muslim, Book 020, Number 4692]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Narrator</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Umar ibn al Khataab (<em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu</em>), the second khalifah, was from the notables of Quraysh. He accepted Islaam in the fifth or sixth year after the advent of Prophet Muhammad’s (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam</em>) message, and in his acceptance of Islaam there was a might for the Muslims. He attended all the battlefields and took the line after Abu Bakr’s (<em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu</em>) covenant to him and he established the Khilafah in the best way after Abu Bakr. In the 23rd year (after Hijrah), four nights before the end of the month of Dhul Hijjah, he was stabbed by a magian after he made the <em>takbeer</em> for Salaatul-Fajr. He was carried to his home and he died three nights later. He was buried with the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam</em>), and Abu Bakr in the apartment of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her). And his Khilafah lasted ten years six months and a few days. May Allaah be pleased with him and with all the companions.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Subject and Overall Explanation</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The subject of the hadeeth is making clear the rank of the intention vis-a-vis the actions. This is a great and comprehensive hadeeth, making clear that the intention is comprehensive, covering all actions such that there is no action without intention. And therefore, the actions correctness or corruption, the reward upon it or the punishment, is dependent upon the intention. And each person shall have but that which he intended, whether it is a noble objective or a lowly, despicable one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam</em>), made that clear in order to incite the doer to aim high in his intention seeking Allaah’s Face and the Final Abode and to keep away from the lowly intentions and base ranks. So if the intention is correct, intending the Face of Allaah (<em>subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa</em>), then it is acceptable and if otherwise then it will not be (acceptable) because Allaah (<em>subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa</em>) is Most Sufficient and in no need of partners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam</em>) gave a similitude in migration so that it may be reference for the rest of actions. So those who migrate have different intentions and thus the reward will vary to a great extent, even though the action is one (and that is the migration). So whoever migrates to Allaah and His Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam</em>), seeking the reward of Allaah and the victory for the Deen and giving help to the Deen then he is the sincere <em>Muhaajir</em> (immigrant), who attained in his intention the highest and most noble objectives. And whoever migrates seeking this lowly life and its vanishing enjoyments is the one who went base in his intention and therefore of the Hereafter he shall have no share. The one who migrates from the land of shirk seeking the reward of Allaah and the protection of His Deen and the support of the Deen and seeking to learn the Shari’ah, so his <em>hijrah</em> (migration) is <em>fee sabeelillaah</em> and Allaah will keep him steadfast on that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the intention distinguishes the worship from the habit. Take for example <em>al-ghusl</em> (taking a bath): If it is done intending to lift the <em>janabah</em> (the sexual defilement) then it is ‘<em>Ibaadah</em> (worship). And if it is done for cleansing or to cool off then it is <em>&#8216;aadah</em> (a habit).</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>From the Benefits of this Hadeeth</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Emphasizing the importance of the <em>Niyyah</em> (intention) concerning the actions. And that the correctness of deeds and the recompense is in accordance with the intention.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Inciting to have sincerity in the intention and making clear the merit of that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Warning from seeking and intending this lowly life in our actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Showing that people differ concerning their intentions and that each will have that which is in accordance with his own intention. (A man will be rewarded only for what he intended.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. <em>At-Taharatu minal `amal</em> (purification is from actions), and therefore it cannot be established without a <em>Niyyah</em> (intention). Everyone who performs the purification, then his purification is in accordance with his intention (and this is the point of evidence in this hadeeth which fell under the chapter of purification).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. The excellence in teaching by the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam</em>), and his perfect eloquence and clarification where he mentions the foundations and the principles foundations then he explains them by examples.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth is evidence for the intentions place is the heart and utterance of it is an innovation. Also, it is a must to be careful concerning <em>ar-Riyaa</em> (showoff and seeking fame for the sake of this life). And that the <em>hijrah</em> (the migration) from the land of shirk to the land of Islam is from the most meritorious of deeds if the Face of Allaah is intended in that. This is in summary the points relevant to this matter.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">The Questions for this Hadeeth</span></strong></h3>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">What is intended by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/hijrah"><em>hijrah</em> </a>(migration) in this hadeeth?</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">How is the manner of migration to the Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam</em>), after his death? What does it mean?</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Why did the author (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) chose this hadeeth of ‘Umar in this chapter of purification? What is the point of relevance?</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">When did ‘Umar accept Islaam?</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">What is the Islaamic meaning of <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/tahara-purification/"><em>Taharah</em> </a>(purification)?</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 18 :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>A man wants to make hijrah, but he has parents who need his assistance, so what does he do?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Answer :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He must strive to convince them to make <em>hijrah</em> if they are Muslims and use wit and artful means with them in order to leave, and likewise if they are disbelievers, he must strive to call them to Islaam and save them from the state they are in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if he is very afraid for himself and they refuse to leave with him, then it is upon him to save himself and flee with his <em>deen</em> and distance himself from the tribulations, and <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>he must not be like the candle which burns itself to shed light on others</strong></span>, for verily before everything else, he is commanded to save himself and he is commanded to be upright on the <em>deen</em> of Allah,عز و جل, as our Lord,سبحانه و تعالى, has said :</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> فاستقم كما أمرت </strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8221; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So be upright as you were commanded</strong></span>.&#8221;(Hud:112)</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>Hijrah</em></strong><strong> to al-Madeenah</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وبعدها أمر بالهجرة إلى المدينة</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">After that, he was commanded to perform <em>hijrah</em> to al-Madeenah.</span></strong><sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">62</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">62</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>): «<strong>After that, he was commanded to perform <em>hijrah</em> to al-Madeenah</strong>»: When the harm from the Quray<u>sh</u> became severe and their evil increased on account of their blocking (people) from Allaah’s path, persecuting the Muslims and torturing those who had no group of people to defend them from the Muslims, who were in a state of weakness – then Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, gave permission for the Muslims to make <em>hijrah</em> to Abyssinia &#8211; the first <em>hijrah</em>, because there was a king with whom no one would be oppressed. He was a Christian, however he was just, so a large group of them migrated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Quray<u>sh</u> came to know of their migration to Abyssinia, they sent two representatives from the wise men of Quray<u>sh</u> to seek (that they be brought back). One of them was `Amr ibn al-`Aas. They had with them gifts for an-Najaa<u>sh</u>ee (the ruler of Abyssinia). They said: &#8220;These people have run away from us and they are relatives of ours. We want them to return to us &#8211; and they are evil doers – so that they do not cause corruption in your land,&#8221; to the end (of what they said). They gave him the gifts that they had with them in order to change his mind, however, he (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) called the <em>muhaajireen</em> and listened to what they had to say and he gave them a choice, so they chose to remain in Abyssinia. Therefore, the two representatives went back frustrated. And the <em>muhaajiroon</em> in Abyssinia remained there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, Allaah favoured an-Najaa<u>sh</u>ee and he accepted <em>Islaam</em> and made his <em>Islaam</em> good. When he died, the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and his Companions prayed the funeral prayer for him with the prayer of one whose body is absent. So in migrating to him there was good for him as well; by means of them, Allaah guided him, so he entered into <em>Islaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> met a group from the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em> (the Muslims from al-Madeenah) in <em>Minaa</em> during the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em>; and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi was allam</em> used to present himself to the tribes during the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em>. He would go to the different camping places of the Arabs in <em>Minaa</em> and call them to Allaah. And it happened that he met some men from the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em>, so he called them to Allaah and he explained his call to them. They accepted the call from the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and gave him a pledge upon <em>Islaam</em>. They went back to their people from the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> and called them to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. Then in the next pilgrimage, a larger number came than those who were in the first. Some men from the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em> came and gave the pledge to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi was allam</em>, the second pledge of <em>al-`Aqabah</em>, meaning: at the stoning place of <em>al-`Aqabah</em>. They gave a pledge upon the basis of <em>Islaam</em> and upon the basis of aiding him if he made the migration to them and that they would defend him just as they defended themselves and their (own) children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So then, after this &#8211; meaning, after this blessed pledge &#8211; the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> commanded those Muslims who were in Makkah to perform <em>hijrah</em> (migration) to al-Madeenah; and whoever migrated, migrated to al-Madeenah. And the Messenger and some of his Companions remained. Then Allaah permitted His Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> to migrate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Quray<u>sh</u> became aware of the migration of his Companions to al-Madeenah and they knew of the pledge that had occurred between him and the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em>, they feared that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> would join up with his Companions in al-Madeenah and would therefore, attain power and gain strength.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On this night, when the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> wanted to depart to make <em>hijrah</em>, they came and surrounded his house. They stood outside the door with their weapons, intending to attack Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>. So, Allaah informed His Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> (and) the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> commanded `Alee to sleep upon his bed so that the people of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> could see him and think that he was the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>. So `Alee <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu `anhu</em> slept upon the bed of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and covered himself with the blanket of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the <em>mu<u>sh</u>riks</em> were waiting for him to come out, thinking that he was the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> when in actuality, the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> had already come out between them and they were unaware. Allaah blinded their sight from him, and he took some dust and scattered it upon their heads, and departed from amongst them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He went to Aboo Bakr <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu `anhu</em> and the two of them departed and went to the Cave of <u>Th</u>awr and hid there for three days. The Quray<u>sh</u> were asking the people to catch him by whatever means; alive or dead. So, when they despaired of finding him after looking and searching, they offered rewards for whoever could bring him <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> alive or dead. When they had totally despaired, Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and his Companion left the cave and rode their riding camels and went to al-Madeenah.<em> </em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">والهجرة : الانتقال من بلد الشرك إلى بلد الإسلام </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Hijrah</em> is to move from the land of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> to the land of <em>Islaam</em></strong></span>.<sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">63</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">63</span>] :<strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>al-Hijrah</em> in the (Arabic) language means &#8220;<strong>to abandon something</strong>.&#8221; As for <em>hijrah</em> in the legislation, then it is just as the <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> defined it: &#8220;<strong>to depart from the land of <em>kufr</em> and go to the land of <em>Islaam</em></strong>.&#8221; This is <em>hijrah</em> in the legislation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em>hijrah</em> is a tremendous deed; Allaah has joined it along with <em>jihaad</em> in many <em>aayaat</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> made the <em>hijrah</em> to al-Madeenah, the <em>Muhaajiroon</em>, who had been in Abyssinia, then came to al-Madeenah and the Muslims gathered in al-Madeenah &#8211; and all praise is for Allaah. A state was formed for the Muslims in al-Madeenah, comprising the <em>muhaajiroon</em> and the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em>; and whoever had accepted Islaam would come to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, Allaah legislated the remaining duties of the religion, so He made the fasting obligatory upon His Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>, and the <em>Zakaat</em> in the second year after the <em>hijrah</em> and He made obligatory upon him the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> in the ninth year after the <em>Hijrah</em> according the correct saying. With that, the pillars of <em>Islaam</em> were completed, the first of them being the two testimonies and the last of them being the <em>Hajj</em> to Allaah’s Sacred House.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in summary, we know from this that <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> is the first requirement in calling to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and that the caller begins with it before he begins with the prayer, the fasting, the <em>zakaat</em> or the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em>, because the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> remained for ten years calling to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and forbidding <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>. He was not commanded with prayer and he was not commanded with <em>zakaat</em> nor pilgrimage nor fasting. Rather these obligatory duties were made obligatory after <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> was established.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when he would send out callers, the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> would command them to call the people with the first thing they would call to being <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, just as occurs in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Mu`aadh:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">» إنك تأتي قوما من أهل الكتاب ، فليكن أول ما تدعوهم إليه  شهادة أن لا إله إلا الله وأن محمدا رسول الله ، فإن هم أجابوا لذلك فأعلمهم أن الله افترض عليهم خمس صلوات «<strong> </strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>You are going to a people from the People of the Book. So let the first thing that you call them to be the testimony that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah. If they accept that from you, then inform them that Allaah has made five prayers obligatory upon them&#8230;» </strong>to the end of the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>.</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Reported by al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree no. 1395 and Muslim no. 19 from a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Abdullaah ibn `Abbaas, <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu `anhumaa</em>.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this proves that a person is not commanded with the prayer nor with the <em>zakaat</em> nor with fasting until <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> is established and <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> is present – and that whoever begins with other than <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, then his call will fail and his methodology is contrary to the methodology of the Messengers, all of them <em>`alaihumassalaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of the Messengers began by calling to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and to the correction of <em>`aqeedah</em>. It is important for those who proceed to be aware of this methodology, for there are many people today, who confuse this methodology and change this methodology and choose a different methodology for themselves from their own ideas or from other people who are ignorant. There must be a return to the methodology of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>. This is the benefit of having awareness of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and his <em>seerah</em> and of making this one of the three fundamental principles. You know how he called the people and what was his <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> methodology in calling them, so you can proceed upon it because he <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasalaam</em> is the example to be followed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 19:</strong> Leaving the lands of disbelief for knowledge but not for hijrah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“Some brothers, when they leave from France or other lands of disbelief, they leave with the intention of seeking knowledge and they don’t attach importance to making hijrah, and when he is asked, ‘Are you a Muhaajir?’ he replies with the statement: ‘I want to seek knowledge, as for hijrah, I will look into it later, Allaah willing.’ And at the same time it is possible that he could return to the land of disbelief at anytime, so what do you have to say about this?”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most important thing is that he leaves from those disbelieving lands so he can escape with his deen, and it is upon him that he be firmly determined not to reside in the lands of disbelief, whichever ones exist. If he were to do that then, verily, he would be free from the sin, by Allaah’s permission, and he would be safeguarding his deen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the question: “<strong>Does he intend with this departure hijrah or merely fleeing with the deen from the tribulations without the intention of hijrah?</strong>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of our Mashaayikh (<em>Rahimahullaah Ta’ala</em>) used to advise to leave, to flee with the deen without making the intention of hijrah, for the fear that he will arrive at the Islaamic lands and he will not be able to remain there, so when that happens he will be able to return to the land he left, contrary to if he were to leave with the intention of hijrah, for verily he will not be able to return.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the reason for this position due to the many obstacles that are well-known and have been placed in front of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second position that is well-known in this issue is that it is better to have the intention of hijrah because the Prophet (<em>Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam</em>) and his Companions (<em>Radhillaahu ‘Anhum</em>) made hijrah from the most beloved of places to Allaah (<em>‘Azza Wa Jall</em>); from Makkah. And no doubt, this position appears to be closer and more correct. Also, as has preceded, verily he who relies on Allaah (<em>‘Azza Wa Jall</em>) and thinks good of Allaah and is sincere in his intention of escaping with his deen from the tribulations, Allaah (<em>Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala</em>) is more generous than to leave this slave to perish and have him rely on the people and abandon him. He is glorified and exalted (above that). Also, Allaah (<em>‘Azza Wa Jall</em>) has promised him help, and victory, and to make things easy, and facilitate things for him, even if whoever is on earth were to plot against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In not intending hijrah when leaving, there is a clear cause for bad to happen to the Muslim because for the least difficulty that occurs to him he will pack up his belongings and return to the land of disbelief. So what we advise our brothers with is that they leave with the intention of hijrah and that they use as a lesson their brothers who have left before them. Has Allaah (<em>Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala</em>) left them to perish?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer: No, rather, with praise to Allaah, they live in the lands of Islaam in honor and respect and happiness, and they have been granted knowledge and implementation of the knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we ask Allaah (<em>Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala</em>) that He grant us and you all the success to obey Him and obey His Messenger (<em>Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa ‘Alaa Aalihi Wa Sallam</em>). We ask Allaah (<em>‘Azza Wa Jall</em>) for forgiveness and good health and well-being in the deen, and in this life and in the hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah (<em>Tabarak Wa Ta’ala</em>) to make us and you all from those who direct with the truth and establish justice therewith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is due to Allaah, Lord of all that exists, and may the peace and blessings of Allaah be upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his Family and his Companions, all of them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 15:</strong> Not making hijrah due to being upon welfare and fearing poverty</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“Taking money from the disbelievers (welfare) has made many of the Muslims lazy from making hijrah, and that is because they, if they work they fall into forbidden acts, and if they make hijrah they fear poverty. Also, they claim that with this money they are able to live at ease and perform their deen. So what is your advice for these people, and is hijrah from the means for provision and what is the proof for that, and are the rituals that the Salafees do over there considered to be performing the deen?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (<em>‘Azza Wa Jall</em>), the treasures of the heavens and the earth are in His hand, and He has guaranteed provision for His slaves as He (<em>‘Azza Wa Jall</em>) said in His Book:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا مِن دَابَّةٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ إِلَّا عَلَى اللَّهِ رِزْقُهَا وَيَعْلَمُ مُسْتَقَرَّهَا وَمُسْتَوْدَعَهَا ۚ كُلٌّ فِي كِتَابٍ مُّبِينٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And no living creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allaah. And He knows its dwelling place and its deposit. All is in a Clear Book.”</strong></span> &#8211; Hud (11):6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as He (<em>Subhaanahu</em>) said:</p>
<p><strong>وَكَأَيِّن مِّن دَابَّةٍ لَّا تَحْمِلُ رِزْقَهَا اللَّهُ يَرْزُقُهَا وَإِيَّاكُمْ ۚ وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And so many a living creature there is that carries not its own provision. Allaah provides for it and for you. And He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.”</strong> </span>&#8211; Al-Ankaboot (29):60</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah (<em>‘Azza Wa Jall</em>) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ</strong><br />
<strong>مَا أُرِيدُ مِنْهُم مِّن رِّزْقٍ وَمَا أُرِيدُ أَن يُطْعِمُونِ</strong><br />
<strong>إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الرَّزَّاقُ ذُو الْقُوَّةِ الْمَتِينُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And I created not the jinns and mankind except they should worship Me. I seek not any provision from them nor do I ask that they should feed Me. Verily, Allaah is the Provider, Possessor of power, the Most Strong.”</strong></span> &#8211; AdhDhaariyaat (51):56-58</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is upon every Muslim to know that his provision has already been determined and has been written for him in a book with Allaah (<em>Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala</em>) fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth, and that was also written while he was in his mother’s womb; his provision was written, and his life-span, and his deeds, and whether he would be miserable or happy. Also, the Prophet (<em>Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam</em>), he is the one who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Verily the spirit of purity (Jibreel) has inspired me that no soul will die except that it has fulfilled its provision and its life-span, so fear Allaah and do that which is good in seeking provision</strong></span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the only provision that will come to the slave is that which has been written for him, so it is only upon him that he strive to be righteous and he hasten to do acts of obedience, and it is not permissible for him to think that his righteousness and his performance of that which Allaah has ordered is going to decrease his provision, and that his laxity and negligence and his unstableness in his deen is going to be a reason for his provision to increase.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is upon all of us to know that hijrah for Allaah’s sake is one of the great means of provision as He (<em>Ta’ala</em>) said in His Noble Book:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَن يُهَاجِرْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ يَجِدْ فِي الْأَرْضِ مُرَاغَمًا كَثِيرًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“He who emigrates in the cause of Allaah will find on earth many dwelling places and plenty of provision.”</strong></span> &#8211; An-Nisaa (4):100</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever makes hijrah for Allaah’s sake seeking the pleasure of Allaah (<em>‘Azza Wa Jall</em>), Allaah has promised him the good promise, provision and ease and comfort, that which will be a means to infuriate his enemies. So it is upon every Muslim to ask Allaah for a portion of His bounty, and rely upon Him, and see Him to be sufficient for him, and be modest because if he sees Allaah to be sufficient for him, then Allaah will be sufficient for him, and if he strives to be modest, then Allaah will enable him to be modest.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the question, <span style="color:#993300;">“Are the rituals that the Salafees do over there considered to be performing the deen.”</span> The answer is that the discussion about residing in the lands of the disbelievers and its ruling has preceded, so you, after examining what has preceded, will be able, Allaah (<em>Ta’ala</em>) willing, to give the ruling of our brothers over there.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 8:</strong> Travelling to the lands of disbelief for tourism, business, da’wah, and marriage</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“There are some travels to the lands of disbelief that don’t include residing nor settling there, like traveling for vacation, and tourism, and traveling for business, and traveling for da’wah, or for someone who made hijrah to go get married over there.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regards to traveling for vacation and tourism we say; traveling to the lands of disbelief for those matters of daroorah (extreme necessity), like seeking treatment and such, there is no problem with this as has preceded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for that which is for the purpose of vacation, or tourism, or roaming around or recreation, this travel is not a travel of extreme necessity because it is possible for him to go to the Islaamic lands whose people are conservative Muslims and take vacation there, and it will be less expensive, and he will feel safe in his journey for his deen, although the advice we give is that the Muslim focus on that which benefits him, as the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) said, “<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Focus on that which benefits you</strong></span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for traveling to the land of disbelief and shirk for the purpose of tourism and recreation, no doubt, there is great danger in that and trial on the deen of the Muslim and on his character because of what has been mentioned. Also, in that great sums of money are wasted in these types of journeys to the lands of disbelief, and over there the temptations are intense. How often has a righteous person traveled to those lands then returned corrupted. Rather, how often has a Muslim traveled there and returned as a disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in brief, it is not permissible to travel to the land of disbelief for tourism, and roaming around and recreation. That is so the (person’s) deen can be protected, and so he can be saved from the means of trial, and so he can distance himself from the dangers and the evil consequences, especially since the traveler travels and searches in his journey for everything that delights him and everything that entertains him, and you know the laxity that exists in those lands for sins like drinking alcoholic beverages, and fornication, and nudity, and decadence, and the many types of abominations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, those disbelievers have prepared their lands for these purposes and compete with one another in that. And, all praises are due to Allaah, the people of knowledge have given the legal verdict that it is forbidden to go to the land of the disbelievers for tourism and roaming around.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for traveling for the purpose of business, some of the people of knowledge allow that, and some of the people of knowledge see that to be forbidden and don’t allow that because of the severe danger which the Muslim is subject to over there. Whatever the case may be, our advice is that the Muslim beware of going to the lands of disbelief for the purpose of business as much as possible because of the danger in that on the deen and on the character, and because of the great evils which have already been mentioned, especially since the one who wants to do business, he brings with him on his journey large sums of money, and you know that the abomination is at hands reach, we ask Allaah for safety and wellbeing. However, if he is going to travel for his business to one of the remote lands of the disbelievers with trustworthy company in a short time-period, in this instance it could be said to be permissible. As for most of the lands of disbelief, there is great danger in that on the deen of the Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Muhaajir traveling only to get married, it appears that it is not permissible because it is not an extreme necessity, rather, he is able to marry a righteous woman over there, if one can be found, over the telephone or by the different means of communication without having to travel there because in the Muslim traveling there, as you have heard, there is danger for him, and perhaps if he goes to those lands after making hijrah from them he could long for staying there and employ different types of tricks to stay there with the argument that he is still trying to find the right wife, or with the argument that he is working for a little while so he can save money to suffice the requirements of the marriage and the journey with his family to the lands of Islaam, or with the argument that there are obstacles making it difficult to return to the land of Islaam, or because he needs some treatment or things like that, and Allaah is the one whose help is sought. So we advise that he doesn’t go for this purpose.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for traveling to those lands for the purpose of calling to Allaah, it is well known the many proofs from the Book and the Sunnah mentioning the virtue of calling to Allaah. Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) said in His Book:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ قَوْلًا مِّمَّن دَعَا إِلَى اللَّهِ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحًا وَقَالَ إِنَّنِي مِنَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And who is better in speech than he who invites (men) to Allaah, and does righteous deeds, and says: ‘I am one of the Muslims.’”</strong></span> &#8211; Fussilat (41):33</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) says:</p>
<p><strong>قُلْ هَٰذِهِ سَبِيلِي أَدْعُو إِلَى اللَّهِ ۚ عَلَىٰ بَصِيرَةٍ أَنَا وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَنِي ۖ وَسُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَمَا أَنَا مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Say (O Muhammad): ‘This is my way; I invite unto Allaah with sure knowledge, I and whosoever follows me with sure knowledge. And Glorified and Exalted be Allaah. And I am not of the Mushrikoon (polytheists, pagans, idolaters and disbelievers).’”</span></strong> &#8211; Yusuf (12):108</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (Subhaanahu) says:</p>
<p><strong>ادْعُ إِلَىٰ سَبِيلِ رَبِّكَ بِالْحِكْمَةِ وَالْمَوْعِظَةِ الْحَسَنَةِ ۖ وَجَادِلْهُم بِالَّتِي هِيَ أَحْسَنُ ۚ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِمَن ضَلَّ عَن سَبِيلِهِ ۖ وَهُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِالْمُهْتَدِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Invite (mankind, O Muhammad) to the Way of your Lord with wisdom and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better.”</strong></span> &#8211; An-Nahl (16):125</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So traveling to the lands of disbelief for the purpose of da’wah is considered to be a type of Jihaad, and it is fard kifaayah (obligatory on a part of the nation) upon he who is able to do that. So calling to Allaah, and instructing the people, and conveying Allaah’s message to His slaves, and removing the people from the types of darkness to the light, and explaining the good qualities of Islaam to the disbelievers, and educating the Muslims over there about the rulings of the deen, and enlightening them, and instructing them, and encouraging them to leave there and go to the lands of Islaam, no doubt, these are important matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The disbelievers are in need of someone to call them, especially since Islaam in the lands of disbelief has been distorted. So many of the disbelievers don’t know anything about true Islaam because of the cover-up, and misguidance, and distortion, and deterrence, and false allegations against the religion of Islaam, that it is a religion of barbarity, and savageness and backwardness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in brief, calling to Allaah in those lands is a matter of extreme importance because of what results because of it from benefit and guidance for the creation, in particular when sincerity, and truthfulness, and patience exists in the callers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No doubt, by Allaah’s permission, good outcomes will occur. However, it is a must that this caller to Allaah, his da’wah must have some effect and influence, and this only happens to a man who has with him knowledge and insight; a man who knows his deen with its evidences, and he has the ability to call to it and refute the specious arguments that he comes across, along with the ability to perform that which Allaah (Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala) has made obligatory upon him, and all of this, meaning the permissibility of going there for the purpose of da’wah, is under the condition that the caller to Allaah feels safe for himself from tribulation, for if he fears tribulation for his deen, or fears for himself falling into that which Allaah has forbidden, it is not allowed for him to travel there even if it is for the purpose of da’wah.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 13:</strong> Restricting hijrah to certain lands from the lands of Islaam</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Some brothers, ash-Shaytaan has deceived them, they only see hijrah to be to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, or they only wish to make hijrah to it despite the well-known hardship it takes to do that, so what is your advice to these people?”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What we advise our brothers with is that they fear Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) and that they rush to flee with their deen from the tribulations. No doubt, Saudi Arabia is from the best lands of Islaam due to the much good there, and the existence of the Scholars and the scarceness of open abominations, however, it is a mistake for the Muslim to delay leaving the land of disbelief and delay escaping with his deen with the argument that he is still proceeding and following up so he can enter Saudi Arabia and reside there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This excuse is not accepted because the lands of Islaam in which evil is scarce and less intense in comparison to the other lands of disbelief, no doubt, these Islaamic lands are wide, and vast and many, and Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) says in His Book:</p>
<p><strong>يَا عِبَادِيَ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِنَّ أَرْضِي وَاسِعَةٌ فَإِيَّايَ فَاعْبُدُونِ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“O My slaves who believe! Certainly, spacious is My earth. Therefore worship Me (Alone).”</span></strong> &#8211; [Al-Ankaboot (29):56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) says:</p>
<p><strong>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ تَوَفَّاهُمُ الْمَلَائِكَةُ ظَالِمِي أَنفُسِهِمْ قَالُوا فِيمَ كُنتُمْ ۖ قَالُوا كُنَّا مُسْتَضْعَفِينَ فِي الْأَرْضِ ۚ قَالُوا أَلَمْ تَكُنْ أَرْضُ اللَّهِ وَاسِعَةً فَتُهَاجِرُوا فِيهَا ۚ فَأُولَٰئِكَ مَأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ ۖ وَسَاءَتْ مَصِيرًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Verily! As for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves (as they stayed among the disbelievers even though emigration was obligatory for them), they (angels) say (to them): ‘In what (condition) were you?’ They reply: ‘We were weak and oppressed on earth.’ They (angels) say: ‘Was not the earth of Allaah spacious enough for you to emigrate therein?’ Such men will find their abode in Hell &#8211; What an evil destination!”</span></strong> &#8211; [An Nisaa (4):97]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is upon the Muslim to, first and foremost, rush to leave the lands of disbelief to go to the lands of Islaam that are easy to get to, then after that it is alright for him to strive to take permanent residence in the best of places and the one that has the less evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saudi Arabia has much good in it, and likewise Yemen, especially in its rural areas and villages, there is much good. Also, the other Islaamic countries, despite the great affliction that exists in them, there is no doubt that there is no comparison between them and the other countries of disbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So it is upon the Muslim to rush to escape with his deen, for today he has the correct intention and is eager but what will make him realize that perhaps afterwards he will slacken in this determination even if entering Saudi Arabia became possible for him, for the hearts are between two fingers from the fingers of Ar-Rahmaan (The Most Merciful).</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So does the person over there feel safe for himself that he will stay upon what he is on until the next morning? Today he is healthy but what will make him realize that perhaps something will happen to him tomorrow. Today he possesses some money to help him make hijrah and travel but what will make him realize how his situation will be days after. Today he is able to travel to many of the lands of Islaam without any obstacles but he does not know what will happen to him days later. So Rush! Rush! Escape! Escape! Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) says in His Book:</p>
<p><strong>فَاسْتَبِقُوا الْخَيْرَاتِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“So hasten towards all that is good.”</span></strong> &#8211; Al-Baqarah (2):148</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam), he is the one who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Hasten to do good deeds before the occurrence of tribulations that are like the parts of the dark night; a man will enter the morning as a believer then enter the evening as a disbeliever, or he will enter the evening as a believer then enter the morning as a disbeliever, he will sell his deen for a commodity of the dunyaa.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Imaam) Muslim has transmitted it from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is what we advise our brothers with, and Allaah is the one whose help is sought.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 16:</strong> Advice for the one who studied in Yemen and Saudi Arabia and then returned to the land of disbelief</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“Some of the students of knowledge who benefited from studying in Yemen and Saudi Arabia with Ahlus-Sunnah walJamaa&#8217;ah have returned to the lands of the disbelievers, however, there actions show that they are out for the money. So what is your advice to these people?”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that calling to Allaah (Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala) has a significant status and is deemed to be an honor for the Muslim, for he who is sincere to Allaah in doing it, for verily an abundant reward and a great recompense is anticipated for him, and it is upon the caller to Allaah (Subhaanahu) that he does not exchange that which is better for that which is worse, and it is upon him to know that his mistake is not like someone else’s mistake, for verily he who knows is not like he who doesn’t know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he who Allaah has honored with knowledge then does something blameworthy, his punishment is not like the punishment of that ignorant person who perhaps if he knew similar to what this student or caller knew, perhaps he wouldn’t do this forbidden act.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) has said in His Noble Book threatening His Prophet Muhammad (‘Alayhis Salaatu Was Salaam), that if he were to lean towards the disbelievers and sway towards them, and he (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) is far above doing that, then Allaah would double his punishment as He (Subhaanahu) said:</p>
<p><strong>وَإِن كَادُوا لَيَفْتِنُونَكَ عَنِ الَّذِي أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ لِتَفْتَرِيَ عَلَيْنَا غَيْرَهُ ۖ وَإِذًا لَّاتَّخَذُوكَ خَلِيلًا &#8211; 17:73</strong></p>
<p><strong>وَلَوْلَا أَن ثَبَّتْنَاكَ لَقَدْ كِدتَّ تَرْكَنُ إِلَيْهِمْ شَيْئًا قَلِيلًا &#8211; 17:74</strong></p>
<p><strong>إِذًا لَّأَذَقْنَاكَ ضِعْفَ الْحَيَاةِ وَضِعْفَ الْمَمَاتِ ثُمَّ لَا تَجِدُ لَكَ عَلَيْنَا نَصِيرًا &#8211; 17:75</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Verily, they were about to tempt you away from that which We have revealed to you, to fabricate something other than it against Us, and then they would certainly have taken you as a friend. And had We not made you stand firm, you would nearly have inclined to them a little. In that case, We would have made you taste a double portion of punishment in this life and a double portion of punishment after death. And then you would have found none to help you against Us.”</span></strong> &#8211; Al-Israa (17):73-75</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is upon these people to fear Allaah and know that Allaah (Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala) knows that which is secret and that which is most hidden, and Allaah (Ta’ala) knows what is in the breasts, and that Allaah (Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala) knows the deceitful eyes and that which the breasts conceal. So if they have gone over there with the pretext of calling to Allaah while in reality there goal is to collect money and enjoy the pleasures of this life, they must know that they are only fooling themselves and that they are only harming themselves. Also, we remind them of the statement of Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall):</p>
<p><strong>يَسْتَخْفُونَ مِنَ النَّاسِ وَلَا يَسْتَخْفُونَ مِنَ اللَّهِ وَهُوَ مَعَهُمْ إِذْ يُبَيِّتُونَ مَا لَا يَرْضَىٰ مِنَ الْقَوْلِ ۚ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ مُحِيطًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“They may hide from the people, but they cannot hide from Allaah, for He is with them when they plot by night in words that He does not approve, and Allaah ever encompasses what they do.”</strong></span> &#8211; An-Nisaa (4):108</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we advise them to fear Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) and to make their deeds sincerely for Allaah, and that they either stay over there for the purpose of calling to Allaah and be sincere in doing that and strive hard to convey it, or if not, they must leave those lands and return to the lands of Islaam, and by doing that they will be, Allaah (Ta’ala) willing, a good example for their brothers, and if not, if they don’t do that, then we, by Allaah, we fear for them tribulation in their deen, and we fear that Allaah will not bless them in their knowledge nor in the wealth they gathered because of their turning away from the truth after knowing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is upon us all to beware of that which our Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) has warned us, and he has warned us of the temptation of the dunyaa and the temptation of wealth, for verily the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) he is the one who said as can be found in at-Tirmidhee from the hadeeth of Ka’b Ibn Maalik,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Two hungry wolves released into a flock of sheep are not more destructive than the destruction that a person’s desire for wealth and status has on his deen.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a saheeh hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, in at-Tirmidhee with a chain that is hasan from the hadeeth of Ka’b Ibn Iyaad, he said, “I heard the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘Indeed, for every nation there is a fitnah (trial), and the fitnah of my nation is wealth.’”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we advise them to have contentment, and to strive to implement what they know, and to beware of having greed for the dunyaa and competing with one another for it, for verily, if they were granted small provision in the lands of Islaam along with Allaah granting them the success to obtain knowledge and implement it and stand firm on the deen, then they, by Allaah, would be in prosperity and success as the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa ‘Alaa Aalihi Wa Sallam) informed of in his statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“He has prospered, he who embraces Islaam and his provision is just sufficient means for living and Allaah has made him satisfied with what comes to him.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim has transmitted it from the hadeeth of ‘Abdullah Ibn Amr Ibn al- ‘Aas. So our advice to these people is that they fear Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this previous advice of ours is only for he who is truly like that, he who has focused on gathering money, and he has focused on remaining in the lands of disbelief for that reason while at the same time he pretends as if he only wanted to go to those lands for the purpose of da’wah. Also, we advise all of the brothers to think good of their brothers and to beware of thinking bad of the callers and the students of knowledge for nothing other than doubts and notions without a distinct clear proof and clear signs which show that this is what they intend because Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) says in His Noble Book:</p>
<p><strong>يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اجْتَنِبُوا كَثِيرًا مِّنَ الظَّنِّ إِنَّ بَعْضَ الظَّنِّ إِثْمٌ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“O you who believe, avoid much suspicion, indeed some suspicion is sin.” </strong></span>&#8211; Al-Hujuraat (49):12</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) says as has come in the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Ta’ala ‘Anhu) transmitted by the two Shaykhs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Beware of suspicion, for verily suspicion is the most false of speech.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we ask Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) for safety and well-being, and we seek refuge in Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) from every act that our Lord does not love and is not pleased with.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 4: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“When was <em>Al-Hijrah</em> (Migration) legislated, and what were the types of hijrah in the era of the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa Sallam)?”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>hijrah</em> of the Muslims from Makkah to Al-Habasha (in Ethiopia), which is the first <em>hijrah</em>, took place in the month of Rajab five years after the <em>mab’ath</em> (the time when the Prophet (<em>Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa ‘Alaa Aalihi Wa Sallam</em>) was sent with Islaam) as the historians mention. As for the <em>hijrah</em> of the Prophet (<em>Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam</em>) from Makkah to Madeenah, it took place in the month of Rabee’ Al-Awwal thirteen years after being sent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the types of <em>hijrah</em> which existed in the era of the Prophet (<em>Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam</em>), a group of Scholars have mentioned various types of hijrahs to the point that some of them mentioned eight types, however, some of these types are not accepted as being called <em>hijrah</em>, rather they are delegations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whatever the case may be, the hijrahs that occurred in Islaam and have the right to be called hijrah are of two forms:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Moving from the land of fear to the land of safety, as occurred in the two hijrahs to Al-Habasha, for verily Al-Habasha was a land of disbelief, but it was safe and secure for the Muslims in comparison to Makkah, and likewise in the beginning of the hijrah from Makkah to Madeenah, for verily Madeenah at first was a land of disbelief, but it was safe and secure for the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The <em>hijrah</em> from the land of disbelief to the land of belief. That occurred after the Prophet (<em>Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam</em>) took residence in Madeenah, and those Muslims who were able to, made <em>hijrah</em> to it. <em>Al-Hijrah</em> at that time was only relevant to moving to Madeenah, until Makkah was conquered. The specific ruling then ceased, while the general ruling of leaving the land of disbelief for whoever was able to do so remained.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 3: The types of hijrah and their rulings</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“What are the types of hijrah, and what is the ruling of each one?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are numerous divisions for the types of hijrah which the people of knowledge have mentioned. From these divisions is that which Ibn Hajar has mentioned in ‘Al-Fath’ (his explanation of Saheeh al-Bukhaaree) under the hadeeth: “The Muhaajir is he who leaves that which Allaah has prohibited” He said, “&#8230;and this hijrah is of two types, outer and inner. The inner is to leave that which the soul which commands evil and the Shaytaan call to, and the outer is to flee with the deen from tribulations.” Some of them phrase this as hijrah of the place and hijrah of the deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hijrah of the place, its proofs have preceded. As for hijrah of the deeds, it is that the Muslim leave, that which Allaah has prohibited from disobedient acts and the different types of sins and transgressions. This type is as Ibnul-Mulaqqin (Rahimahullaahu Ta’ala) has said, “Some of the later Maalikee scholars have said it is the greatest hijrah in which all of the divisions fall under.” This division of hijrah, hijrah of deeds or hijrah of sins, its proof is what the two Shaykhs have transmitted on ‘Abdullaah Ibn ‘Amr Ibn al-‘Aas on the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) that he said, “The Muslim is he who the Muslims are safe from his tongue and his hand, and the Muhaajir is he who leaves that which Allaah has prohibited.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, An-Nasaa&#8217;ee has transmitted with a chain that is saheeh on ‘Abdullaah Ibn ‘Amr Ibn al-‘Aas that he said, “A man said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah. What hijrah is best?’” He said, “That you leave that which your Lord (‘Azza Wa Jall) dislikes.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Ibn Maajah has transmitted with a chain that is hasan on Fudaalah Ibn ‘Ubayd on the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) that he said, “The believer is he who the people trust him with their wealth and their own selves, and the Muhaajir is he who leaves off crimes and sins.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hajar (Rahimahullaahu Ta’ala) has said under the previous passage, under the hadeeth: “The Muhaajir is he who leaves that which Allaah has prohibited,” he said, “It is as if the Muhaajiroon were addressed with that in order that they don’t rely solely upon the migration from their land, and in order that they act according to the commands and prohibitions of the legislation, or it is possible that was said after the hijrah had ceased, when Makkah was conquered, to soothe the hearts of those who did not attain that, however, the essence of hijrah is obtained by he who leaves that which Allaah has prohibited.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hajar (Rahimahullaahu Ta’ala) derived and summarized this from the statement of Ibnul-Mulaqqin in his explanation of the book ‘Al-‘Umdah’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also another division of Al-Hijrah, that Al-Hijrah is divided into general and specific. The specific hijrah being the hijrah from Makkah to Madeenah, and it is well known that hijrah to Madeenah before the conquest of Makkah was obligatory upon the Muslims, and that it was obligatory upon the Muslims in Makkah and elsewhere to reside in Madeenah in order to help the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) and assist him with person and wealth and other than that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala) emphasized that before the conquest of Makkah in numerous verses to the point where He cut the ties of guardianship between whoever made hijrah and whoever did not make hijrah. Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>And as to those who believed but did not emigrate (to you O Muhammad), you owe no duty of protection to them until they emigrate&#8230;</strong>” &#8211; Al-Anfaal (8):72</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this specific hijrah is the one which its ruling of being obligatory was abolished by his (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa ‘Alaa Aalihi Wa Sallam) statement: “There is no hijrah after the conquest, rather Jihaad and intention.” So when Makkah was conquered and it became a land of Islaam, the ruling of making hijrah to it (Madeenah) was abolished. (Imaam) alBukhaaree (Rahimahullaahu Ta’ala) has transmitted in his Saheeh from the chain of Ataa Ibn Abee Rabaah that he said, “I along with ‘Ubayd Ibn Umar al-Laithee visited ‘Aishah and we asked her about Al-Hijrah, so she said, ‘There is no hijrah today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It used to be that the believers, one of them would flee with his deen to Allaah (Ta’ala) and His Messenger (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa ‘Alaa Aalihi Wa Sallam) out of fear of being tortured because of it (his deen). As for today, Allaah has made Islaam victorious, and today the person can worship his Lord wherever he pleases, however, there is Jihaad and intention.’” What ‘Aishah means by her statement “today” is after the conquest of Makkah. So this is the specific hijrah for which its ruling of being obligatory has been abolished.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the general hijrah, which is the migration from the land of shirk to the land of Islaam, this remains until the Final Hour as the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) has stated for he who is not able to perform his deen and openly perform its rituals in the land which is not the land of Islaam. How long has there continued to exist, lands of disbelief and enemies that fight the people of the Religion of Islaam, so hijrah continues to be a prescribed practice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also another division of hijrah, that hijrah is of two types: The hijrah from the land of shirk to the land of Islaam which has previously been discussed and its ruling &#8211; when is it obligatory and when is it mustahab (highly recommended) &#8211; has also preceded, and Allaah (Ta’ala) willing, the discussion about the rule defining the land of shirk will come in the answer to the fifth question. The second type is to leave and make hijrah from the land in which innovations and sins have become widespread to the land where that is few and less intense.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So with regards to leaving and making hijrah from the land in which misguiding innovations are many and widespread, and the man on the Sunnah is not able to openly perform the Sunnah and defend it and wage war against those innovations, this type of hijrah has been mentioned by a group of Scholars, among them is Ibnul-‘Arabee (Rahimahullaah) in his book ‘Ahkaam AlQur&#8217;aan’. He said, “Ibnul-Qaasim said, ‘I heard Maalik say, ‘It is not permissible for anyone to reside in a land where the Salaf are reviled therein.’’” (Imaam) al-Qurtubee added that he also said, “and falsehood is practiced therein.” Ibnul-‘Arabee commented on this statement of Maalik saying, “This is true, for verily the munkar (abomination), if you are not able to change it then get away from it.” Allaah (Ta’ala) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And when you (Muhammad) see those who engage in a false conversation about Our Verses (of the Qur&#8217;aan) by mocking at them, stay away from them till they turn to another topic. And if Shaytaan (Satan) causes you to forget, then after the remembrance sit not you in the company of those people who are the wrong-doers.” &#8211; Al-An’aam (6):68</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So due to that, there are many Scholars who have mentioned this type of hijrah, leaving the land in which innovations are many, and the people of innovation are out in the open, and the Sunan are hidden. Many Scholars from the Maalikee Scholars, and the Shaafi’ee Scholars, and Scholars from some of the other madhaahib amongst them, the Hanbalee Scholars, take the position of leaving (such a land), for he has said in the book ‘AlMuntahaa’, “…or the land of the oppressors or misguiding innovations like Rafd [1] or I’tizaal [2]. It is obligatory that he leave there and go to the land of the people of the Sunnah if he is not able to openly perform the methodology of the people of the Sunnah therein.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, others such as al-Baghawee in his tafseer, and al-Qurtubee, and Ibn Hajar in ‘Al-Fath’, and ashShawkaanee, may Allaah have mercy upon them all, have mentioned this type of hijrah, while (on the other hand) some Scholars remained in the lands where innovations were many and widespread thinking they would be able to confront these innovations and abominations and establish, for Allaah’s (‘Azza Wa Jall) sake, the proof against the slaves of Allaah, so they would defend (the truth) and combat and reduce the evils.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibnul-‘Arabee mentioned in his book ‘Ahkaam Al-Qur&#8217;aan’ that he requested from his Shaykh Abu Bakr al-Fihree that he leave the land of Misr (Egypt) and go somewhere else because of the innovation and forbidden acts that existed there. So his Shaykh gave as an excuse that there is good in him staying there, from spreading the guidance, and directing the people, and spreading Tawheed, and warning from false beliefs, and calling to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereafter, the dispute between them became severe over the issue. Ibnul-‘Arabee said, “…to the point that the dispute between he and I grew extremely intense,” or a statement similar to that (Rahimahullaahu Ta’ala). Many Scholars have mentioned this type of hijrah to be obligatory, from the Maalikee Scholars, and the Shaafi’ee Scholars, and the Hanbalee Scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, leaving the land in which sins and different types of crimes and disobedient acts are many, and the Muslim there is not able to enjoin the good and forbid the evil and reduce the evil, rather he is scared for himself, and for his family, and for those whom Allaah (Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala) has made him responsible for. A group of Scholars from the Maalikee Scholars, and the Shaafi’ee Scholars, and the Hanbalee Scholars have also mentioned this, and that it is upon the Muslim to make hijrah. However, some Scholars dispute it being obligatory, they dispute it being obligatory to make the hijrah of this type. They have reported on a group of Scholars of Fiqh, from the Hanbalee Scholars of Fiqh, that hijrah from the land in which sins are many and widespread is mustahab (highly recommended) and it is not obligatory because of the statement of the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam): “Whoever amongst you sees an evil, let him change it with his hand.” Likewise, Imaam ash-Shawkaanee (Rahimahullaahu Ta’ala) in his book ‘Nail AlAwtaar’ disputed the obligation of leaving the land of sins, rather he saw that to be highly recommended. However, in his book ‘As-Sail Al-Jarraar’ he took that back and declared it to be obligatory. A group (from the people of knowledge) has mentioned it to be highly recommended, while others see this type of hijrah to be similar to the previous type of hijrah, hijrah from the land of innovations and desires. They see leaving the land in which sins are widespread, and the Muslim therein is not able to combat that and suppress that, and he does not feel safe for himself there, they see this type to also be obligatory. Whatever the case may be, this is a division from the divisions of hijrah that the people of knowledge have mentioned. The proof the people of knowledge use for this type of hijrah, hijrah from the land of sins and hijrah from the land of innovations, is the statement of Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily! As for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves (as they stayed among the disbelievers even though emigration was obligatory for them), they (angels) say (to them): ‘In what (condition) were you?’ They reply: ‘We were weak and oppressed on earth.’”</strong> &#8211; An-Nisaa (4):97</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They have reported on Sa’eed Ibn Jubair that he extracted from this verse that it is obligatory to make hijrah from the land in which sins are many, and they similarly reported that on ‘Ataa, and similarly a group of the people of knowledge have used this as a proof. So in brief, the hijrah from the land in which sins are many and widespread, a group of Scholars of Fiqh, as you have heard, declare it to be obligatory, and some of them say it is highly recommended. As for the first type, making hijrah from the land of innovations, many people of knowledge see it to be obligatory to leave this type of land.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] This is the belief and practice of the Raafidhah. They are more commonly known as the Shee’ah who have exceeded in their love and honor for the family of the Prophet (Salallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are called the Raafidhah because they rejected the leadership of Zayd Ibn ‘Ali Iibn alHusayn, and also when they asked him about Abu Bakr and ‘Umar and he praised them. So they said: “They are the ministers of my grandfather”, then they departed and as a result rejected (the statement and leadership of Zayd ibn ‘Ali).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] This is the belief and practice of the Mu’tazilah. The doctrine of i&#8217;tizal is the belief that there exists state of existence between eemaan and kufr. They also believe that the Qur’aan is created. From the main proponents of this deviant ideology was the ‘Abbasid khaleefah <strong>al-Ma’moon</strong> and his brother<strong> al-Mu’tasim</strong>. The belief of this group was strongly opposed and refuted by Imaam Ahmed Ibn Hanbal (Rahimahullaah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The name Mu’tazilah is derived from a schism which took place in the circle of al-Hasan alBasree. After laying down their deviant ideology <strong>Wasil Ibn ‘Ataa</strong> and <strong>‘Amr Ibn ‘Ubayd</strong> are said to have separated (i‘tazala) from al-Hasan al-Basree’s circle to establish an independent school.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 6: Are there any exceptions to residing in the lands of disbelief?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“After we have come to know the ruling of hijrah, and <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/09/25/the-rule-defining-the-land-in-which-it-is-obligatory-to-make-hijrah-migration-from/">the rule defining the land from which hijrah is made</a>, are there any circumstances considered exceptions to this, and if so, what is the condition on this resident?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (Ta’ala) says in His Noble Book:</p>
<p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ تَوَفَّاهُمُ الْمَلَائِكَةُ ظَالِمِي أَنفُسِهِمْ قَالُوا فِيمَ كُنتُمْ ۖ قَالُوا كُنَّا مُسْتَضْعَفِينَ فِي الْأَرْضِ ۚ قَالُوا أَلَمْ تَكُنْ أَرْضُ اللَّهِ وَاسِعَةً فَتُهَاجِرُوا فِيهَا ۚ فَأُولَٰئِكَ مَأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ ۖ وَسَاءَتْ مَصِيرًا &#8211; 4:97</p>
<p>إِلَّا الْمُسْتَضْعَفِينَ مِنَ الرِّجَالِ وَالنِّسَاءِ وَالْوِلْدَانِ لَا يَسْتَطِيعُونَ حِيلَةً وَلَا يَهْتَدُونَ سَبِيلًا &#8211; 4:98</p>
<p>فَأُولَٰئِكَ عَسَى اللَّهُ أَن يَعْفُوَ عَنْهُمْ ۚ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ عَفُوًّا غَفُورًا &#8211; 4:99</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Verily! As for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves (as they stayed among the disbelievers even though emigration was obligatory for them), they (angels) say (to them): ‘In what (condition) were you?’ They reply: ‘We were weak and oppressed on earth.’ They (angels) say: ‘Was not the earth of Allaah spacious enough for you to emigrate therein?’ Such men will find their abode in Hell &#8211; What an evil destination! Except the weak ones among men, women and children who cannot devise a plan, nor are they able to direct their way. For these there is hope that Allaah will forgive them, and Allaah is Ever Oft Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving.”</span></strong> &#8211; An-Nisaa (4):97-99</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So those who are excused for not making hijrah when it is obligatory upon them, they are these people, the people who have excuses, those who are in no way able to make hijrah. So these people, they are the ones in which an exception is made, and this incapability is under certain circumstances:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. It could be <strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">because of an illness</span></strong>. Either because he is sick with an illness that forces him to stay in bed, and with this illness he is not able to mount any means of transportation required to leave the land he is in, this person is then excused, or likewise if he has an illness that he can’t find treatment to stay alive except in the land of disbelief which he is in, this person is also excused.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Or this incapability could be <strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">because of compulsion</span></strong>, like a prisoner for example, or likewise some countries prevent its citizens from leaving to go somewhere else except under extremely difficult measures as we saw and witnessed in the south of Yemen in the days of Communism.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Or it could be <strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">because of weakness as is the case of the women and children</span></strong> who are unable to travel from one land to another because of their weakness and lack of experience. So these also are from those for whom an exception is made.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if there exists from the women one who is rational, and resolute, and possesses insight and comprehension, and is able to travel and leave the land of disbelief to go to the land of Islaam, and she feels safe for herself from fitnah (tribulation), then this woman, it is obligatory upon her to leave and make hijrah when she is in the circumstance where it is obligatory upon her, and <strong>it is not a condition that she have a mahram</strong> (a guardian who, because of ties, she is never able to marry) because of the statement of Allaah (Ta’ala):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“O you who believe! When believing women come to you as emigrants, examine them”</span></strong> &#8211; Al-Mumtahanah (60):10</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For verily Umm Kulthoom Bint ‘Uqbah Ibn Abee Mu’ait justify, and also Zainab the daughter of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) justify, they both justify without a mahram, and likewise many women justify from Makkah to Madeenah without mahaarim, so the ahadeeth which mention the <strong>condition of having a mahram for a woman to travel don’t apply in the particular case of hijrah</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Or this incapability could be because of the obstacles which have been put in place today, from <span style="color:#ff6600;"><strong>the visas and things similar to that</strong></span>, thus if he is not able to enter the lands of Islaam because of the likes of these obstacles, and this is rare that all of the Islaamic lands shut their doors on he who comes from Europe, and America, and other lands of disbelief, however, whatever the case may be, if something like that were to happen to a Muslim, then it would be an excuse for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Also, there are some extremely rare cases where the person has <span style="color:#ff6600;"><strong>fled from an oppressive Muslim ruler</strong></span> who wants to kill him, or he wants to do something to him that he can’t handle, and he could not find a land where he is safe from the evil of this oppressor other than a land of disbelief. This is a rare case, otherwise, the Islaamic countries are many, however, sadly you find many of these people who flee from their oppressive rulers choose the countries of disbelief over the Muslim countries without necessity. They only desire easy living and luxury, and Allaah is the one whose help is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whatever the case may be, it is upon these people who are excused to avoid falsehood and the people of falsehood, and stay far away from the tribulations as much as they are able to do so, and it is upon them to hold firm to the truth and the Sunnah in those lands which they were forced to stay in. And we ask Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) for grace.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, it is upon the Muslims to help their brothers who are not able to make hijrah, while they are in the circumstance where it is obligatory, with everything they can, so they can rescue them from the situation they are in. Allaah (Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala) says in His Noble Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Help you one another in righteousness and piety; but do not help one another in sin and transgression.”</span></strong> &#8211; Al-Maaidah (5):2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) is the one who said, <strong>“One of you doesn’t believe until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself.”</strong> (This hadeeth is) agreed upon (by al-Bukhaaree and Muslim) from the hadeeth of Anas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, in Muslim from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah on the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> “Whoever relieves a believer of an anxiety from the anxieties of this life, Allaah will relieve him of an anxiety from the anxieties of the day of resurrection, and whoever makes things easy for the mu’sir (the one who is in financial straights and is not able to repay his debt), Allaah will make things easy for him in this life and the next, and Allaah supports the slave when the slave supports his brother.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the condition on the one residing in those lands, it is that he have the ability to openly perform his deen, and perform the rituals of his deen, and openly profess it without hindrance. The second condition is that he feels safe for his deen, whereas he has enough knowledge and insight and strength of faith and contentment and conviction and firmness and composure that will help him to stand firm on his deen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regards to the first condition, it is the one the Muslims focus on in order to justify them residing in the lands of disbelief, and most of their questions are about that while they are negligent when it comes to fulfilling the second condition, and at the same time the first condition, which is to be able to openly perform the deen in a manner which frees you from guilt, most of the people residing over there, this condition is not possible for them. For example, the Adhaan, to call it publicly out loud is prohibited over there as is well known, and it is from the important rituals of our deen. The Permanent Committee of Scholars (in Saudi Arabia) gave a legal verdict that: “<strong>Whoever is not able to call the Adhaan out loud then he has failed to openly perform the rituals of the deen, and it is upon him to make hijrah</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, the second condition, which is that, the resident feels safe for his deen, do we truly believe that there is anyone over there who is able to feel safe for his deen, and stand firm upon it with all those tremendous causes of corruption that exist over there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">In brief, in residing in the lands of disbelief there is tremendous danger for the belief of the Muslim and for his deen and for his character</span>. Over there the causes of disbelief and sin are strong and many and of various kinds, and add to that the weakness the Muslims over there have in adhering to their deen. Look how he and his family are brought up amongst the disbelievers and how they then acquire their despicable character and their evil habits. Rather, at times they get affected by them in beliefs and types of worship. So he who lives in those corruptive, bestial societies, he does not take interest in his deen, nor does he take it into account, nor does he pay attention to its commands and its good manners. How sad it is!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can his soul feel at ease about residing in the land of disbelief in which the rituals of disbelief are publicized, and the unlawful things and despicable things are considered lawful, and in which every wicked person is deemed good, and in which every forbidden act is performed, and in which every secret thing is brought out into the open, and over there every evil and abomination is at hands reach. How can the soul of the Muslim feel at ease about being in a land in which the rule is for other than Allaah and His Messenger (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa ‘Alaa Aalihi Wa Sallam). He hears that, and witnesses it, and touches it, and then he persists to remain there with his children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is upon the Muslims to beware of the plots, and conspiracies, and plans, and schemes of the enemies of Islaam which aim to turn the Muslims away from their deen and weaken their adherence to it. We must be alert, and we must also ask ourselves: <strong>Why did the enemies of Islaam open their lands to the Muslims?</strong> So they can reside there, and work there, and study there, and amuse themselves and stroll about there? Did they do that because of their love for the Muslims? Did they do that out of desire for their wealth or for their need for laborers?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer: No! By Allaah! They didn’t do that because of their love for the Muslims, for verily they harbor in their hearts hatred and enmity. Also, they opened up their lands to the poor Muslims and the weak Muslims, so this shows us they are not ambitious for their wealth. Also, it is well known that they have unemployment, so they are not in need of laborers. Rather, the goal from that is to attempt to turn the Muslims away from their deen, and to corrupt the Muslims, and wipe out the Muslims’ identity over there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By Allaah, O my brothers in Allaah’s deen, they envy us because of this deen, and because of this good that we live in, and they are extremely eager for us to become like them in disbelief and misguidance and decadence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) says in His Noble Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“They wish that you disbelieve, as they have disbelieved, so you all become equal.”</span></strong> &#8211; An-Nisaa (4):89</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (Subhaanahu) is the one who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“The Jews and the Christians will not be pleased with you until you follow their religion.”</span></strong> &#8211; Al-Baqarah (2):120</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (Subhaanahu) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“&#8230; and they will not cease fighting you until they turn you back from your religion if they can.”</span></strong> &#8211; Al-Baqarah (2):217</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they are bent on making evil and discomfort reach the Muslims. They are saddened by the good that reaches the Muslims, and they rejoice at the calamity that befalls them. Allaah (Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala) has exposed them in His Book, and He has disclosed that which they conceal in their hearts. He (‘Azza Wa Jall) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“O you who believe, take not as your advisors those outside your religion since they will not fail to do their best to corrupt you. They desire to harm you severely. Hatred has already appeared from their mouths, but what their breasts conceal is far worse. Indeed, We have made plain to you the proofs if you understand.” </span></strong>&#8211; Aal Imraan (3):118</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) says in His Noble Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Should they gain the upper hand over you, they would behave to you as enemies, and stretch forth their hands and their tongues against you with evil, and they desire that you disbelieve.”</span></strong> &#8211; Al-Mumtahanah (60):2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they, O my brothers in Allaah’s deen, they have not justify the Muslims alone in their (the Muslims’) own lands and inside their own houses, so how much more with someone who lives amongst them, and with someone who goes to them? No doubt, they will not leave off any means or path that leads to diverting him from his deen except that they will implement that. They have plots for that, and tricks, and secret means, and apparent means. There is a war against Islaam and the Muslims, and there are plots, day and night. So because of that they aspire to carry out these schemes on the Muslims with all the might they have and they spend large amounts of money and take great efforts to achieve that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, they have plans to convert people to Christianity in their lands and in the Muslim lands. They have revealed those plans in many Muslim lands like Indonesia, and the Philippines, and Sudan, and Bangladesh, and Uganda, and other Islaamic lands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They use as a means to do that giving charity to the weak Muslims by building schools and hospitals, and also by forming what are called organizations for humanity, and there goal is not to benefit the Muslims, nor develop the Muslim societies, there goal in that is only to destroy the Muslims’ character and destroy the Muslims’ intellect and break the relationship the Muslims have with their Lord, Allaah (Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala) and give free rein to their desires. So we must beware of these plans.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In brief, residing in the land of disbelief has evil consequences, and it has bad effects on the Muslim’s deen, and this deen is the capital wealth of the righteous slave in this life. So I ask you by Allaah, is there anyone residing in the lands of disbelief who has realized At-Taqwaa (piety and fear of Allaah), and has become from the Muttaqeen (the devout ones who fear Allaah), and thus has performed the commands, and has stayed away from the prohibitions in his eating, and drinking, and in his clothing, and in his house, and in his street, and in his market, and in his school, and in his job.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is rare that you find someone who has realized At-Taqwaa and has truly become from the Muttaqeen, those who hasten to carry out the commands and stay away from the prohibitions. Rather, how many are the sins which the Muslims over there live in, and infatuation and love of the dunyaa (worldly pleasures), and being attached to it, and putting it before obedience to Allaah and His Messenger, for the disbelievers, as is well known, the splendor of this life has been granted to them, however, it is a small pleasure, and a short lived pleasure designed for tribulation, and test, and trial. Allaah (Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Let not the free disposal (and affluence) of the disbelievers throughout the land deceive you. A brief enjoyment; then, there ultimate abode is hell, and worst indeed is that place for rest.”</span></strong> &#8211; Aal Imraan (3):196-197</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (Subhaanahu) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Do they think that We enlarge them in wealth and children. We hasten unto them with good things (in this life so that they will have no share of good things in the Hereafter). Nay, but they perceive not.”</span></strong> &#8211; Al-Mu&#8217;minoon (23):55-56</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (Ta’ala) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“We shall gradually seize them with punishment in ways they perceive not. And I respite them; certainly My plan is strong.”</span></strong> &#8211; Al-A’raaf (7):182-183 and Al-Qalam (68):44-45</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslim over there gets amazed and dazzled by the civilization of the disbelievers and by the material goods of the disbelievers which leads to glorifying them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, (there is) the temptation of the women. It is well known the nudity, and the decadence, and the lack of morals, and the lack of values in those bestial societies. They have no deen, no shame, no morals, no obstacles, nothing preventing them from the forbidden things, and the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam), he is the one who said as has been transmitted in the two Saheehs from the hadeeth of ‘Usaamah, “<strong>I have not justify a fitnah (trial) more harmful on the men than the women.</strong>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed on the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) which has been transmitted by Imaam Muslim,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily, the dunyaa (this life) is sweet and succulent, and indeed Allaah has made you successors to one another in it, so beware of the dunyaa, and beware of the women, for verily the first fitnah (trial/temptation) for the children of Israa&#8217;eel was in the women.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“I have not seen from the females who are deficient in their intellect and deen she who has more power to take away the heart of the prudent man than one of you.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The highlight is that the Muslim over there is in serious danger, he, and his family, and his children. It has to amaze you how can the Muslim feel safe for his children, boys and girls, in those societies, in the schools, and in the streets, and in the different sections of town, and in the roads, everywhere! These little ones who are like moths, they don’t distinguish between that which is beneficial and that which is harmful, nor between guidance and misguidance, nor between what is permissible and what is forbidden. Rather, whoever directs them to the path of good, they follow it by the success granted by Allaah, and likewise, whoever directs them to the path of evil, they, in most cases, rush to it, except for he who Allaah protects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the infant over there from his infancy is being led to that which has evil in it, and that which has corruption in it, and to decadence, and to being detached from the deen, and from morals, and from modesty. From kindergarten to the highest grades; while it is incumbent upon those in charge of their affairs to fear Allaah (Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala) in dealing with these offspring and these families, and they must take care of the responsibility facing their children and their families, and they must show them the path to paradise and help them follow that path, and it is also upon them to warn them from the path to the fire, and warn them from these paths, and help them to leave alone these paths, and help them to stay far away from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also upon them to raise their children a righteous upbringing, and bring them up in a good way, and order them to observe the Islaamic rituals and codes of behavior, and it is also upon them to forbid them from despicable forms of behavior and the forbidden things and all means which lead to that, and that is not possible except by keeping them far away from evil companions, and far away from criminal groups and places of corruption. It is also upon them to implant in them outstanding character. All of that must be done in compliance with the statement of Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“O you who believe! Ward off from yourselves and your families a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones.”</span></strong> &#8211; AtTahreem (66):6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam), he is the one who said, <strong>“Each one of you is a herdsman, and each one of you is responsible for his flock.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I ask you, by Allaah, is the one who resides over there able to do that with his family and his children, or is it the reality that the Muslim over there is subject to the systems of the disbelievers and to the laws of the disbelievers?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Over there he does not have true authority over them (his family). Rather, how often are the incidents of rebellion, and dispute, and quarrel between the man and his family, for verily if he does not respond to their demands, the disbelieving police force is the judge, and because of that you notice that he sees the abomination and the indecency in his family, and he is not able to do anything about it. O how distressing it is! O how sad it is!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, from the dangers is the existence of complete social intercourse with the disbelievers which causes him and them to come closer together, and brings about love through the perception that he is a fellow citizen, and this is a dangerous matter because it is incumbent upon the Muslim to hate the disbelievers because they are the enemies of Allaah, and the enemies of His Messenger, and the enemies of Islaam and the Muslims. Allaah has ordered that, and He has warned against loving them and befriending them. He (‘Azza Wa Jall) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“You (O Muhammad) will not find any people who believe in Allaah and the Last Day, making friendship with those who oppose Allaah and His Messenger (Muhammad), even though they were their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, or their kindred (people). For such He has written Faith in their hearts, and strengthened them with Rooh (proofs, light and true guidance) from Himself.”</span></strong> &#8211; AlMujaadilah (58):22</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (‘Azza Wa Jall) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Let not the believers take the disbelievers as Auliyaa (supporters, helpers, etc.) instead of the believers, and whoever does that will never be helped by Allaah in any way, except if you indeed fear a danger from them. And Allaah warns you against Himself (His Punishment), and to Allaah is the final return.”</span></strong> &#8211; Aal Imraan (3):28</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“O you who believe! Take not as (your) Bitaanah (advisors, consultants, protectors, helpers, friends, etc.) those outside your religion (pagans, Jews, Christians, and hypocrites) since they will not fail to do their best to corrupt you. They desire to harm you severely.”</span></strong> &#8211; Aal Imraan (3):118</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (Subhaanahu) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Auliyaa (friends, protectors, helpers, etc.), they are but Auliyaa to one another. And if any amongst you takes them as Auliyaa, then surely he is one of them. Verily, Allaah guides not those people who are the wrong-doers.”</span> </strong>&#8211; AlMaa&#8217;idah (5):51</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And our Lord (Subhaanahu) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“You see many of them taking the disbelievers as their Auliyaa (protectors and helpers). Evil indeed is that which their ownselves have sent forward before them, for that (reason) Allaah’s Wrath fell upon them and in torment they will abide.”</span></strong> &#8211; Al-Maa&#8217;idah (5):80</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And our Lord (Subhaanahu) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibraaheem (Abraham) and those with him, when they said to their people: ‘Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allaah, we have rejected you, and there has started between us and you, hostility and hatred for ever, until you believe in Allaah Alone.’”</span></strong> &#8211; Al-Mumtahanah (60):4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when he (the Muslim) loves them, then, no doubt, he will agree with them, and follow in their footsteps, and blindly follow them and imitate them, while the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam), he is the one who said, “<strong>Whoever imitates a people then he is from them</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, from the evils of residing in the lands of the disbelievers is, in doing so, their masses are increased, and their societies are stimulated, and it also strengthens their economy, while we are ordered to irritate them, and show enmity to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In brief, it is almost impossible for the Muslim to feel safe for his deen in most lands of disbelief. Add to that, the enemies of Islaam over there who are eager to make the Muslim doubt about his deen, and his creed, and his faith in his Lord and His Messenger. And it is known that faith does not accept doubt, rather, it is the certain belief. So if the Muslim becomes doubtful, and uncertain, and irresolute about that which it is incumbent upon him to be firmly convinced about, then he, and Allaah’s refuge is sought, becomes a disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They spread their specious arguments, and their falsehood, and their ways of skepticism everywhere, and with every means, and because of that, it is from the conditions of the one residing in those lands that he feel safe for his deen, and this does not happen except if he learns his deen with its proofs, and evidences and arguments, so he will be able to defend it, and so he can refute the specious arguments of the disbelievers which they have spread everywhere. Yes, it is upon him to have knowledge of the legislation and know that which will enable him to distinguish between truth and falsehood, so he won’t be deceived by the falsehood and the people of falsehood, and so the truth won’t be made obscure to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is a must that the Muslim have knowledge to protect himself from the specious arguments, and so he can use it to protect himself from disbelief and disobedience. It is well known that the hearts are weak, and the specious arguments are strong and grabbing, and when it was the case that most of the people going and residing over there were not strong in deen, and were lacking in knowledge and insight, many of them returned to us with something different from what he went with. He would return deviant in his deen, and in his manners and behavior. He would return as a sinful person, far astray, rather, some of them would return, and Allaah’s refuge is sought, as an apostate disbelieving in his deen, the deen of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, he would also disbelieve in the rest of the religions whereas he would be upon total disbelief, and he would mock the people of Islaam. He would return imitating the destructive ideology of the disbelievers, and he would follow their way in lifestyle, and in clothing, and in appearance, and in all of their affairs, and they would become spokesmen for the enemies of Islaam in the lands of the Muslims. So it is upon every Muslim to strive to reside in the lands of Islaam in which the abominations are few in comparison to the lands of disbelief. Indeed, in that is good for him, and security and protection for his deen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nevertheless, we would like to point out, it is possible that there exists remote lands of disbelief in which the Muslim is able to openly perform his deen, and openly perform the rituals while feeling safe for himself from tribulations, so if there are lands of disbelief out there upon this description, then Al-Hijrah from it is mustahab (highly recommended) for the Muslim, and residing there is makrooh (disliked). However, as is well known, most of the lands of disbelief in the east and the west are not like that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 17:</strong> Moving from one land of disbelief to another land of disbelief where there is less tribulation</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“Some of the Salafees travel from one land of disbelief to another land of disbelief with the argument that the Salafee da’wah there is stronger, like those who go from France to Britian, and they don’t make hijrah to an Islaamic land. So is this practice permissible according to the legislation, and what is your advice to these people?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer (by Shaykh ‘Abdur Rahmaan al-‘Adanee) :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If these people who do that are able to make hijrah to the land of Islaam then this act of theirs does them no benefit and this doesn’t remove them from the disobedient act and the sin. As for, if they are not able to make hijrah to the land of Islaam and they are from the people who have excuses, those who were previously mentioned in the <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/questions-and-answers-concerning-al-hijrah-shaykh-abdur-rahmaan-al-adanee.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>answer to the sixth question</strong></a>, then this act is alright and it is a good thing, and it has a basis in the Sunnah as some of the Muslims made hijrah from Makkah by the order of the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) to the lands of Al-Habasha. So in this act of theirs, moving from a land of shirk to a land of shirk that has less evil and less danger on the Muslim, it is said: “With evil there is a choice”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and as the poet said):<br />
Have mercy, for some evil is lesser than others</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is if in reality the land of Britian has less evil and less danger on the Muslim than France, otherwise, this act of theirs is just a burden on one’s self by crossing long distances and the burden of moving, and Allaah is the one whose help is sought. This, as you have heard, is if they are not able to make hijrah to the lands of Islaam.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Question 5: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The rule defining which land it is obligatory to make hijrah from</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“What is the rule defining the land in which it is obligatory to make hijrah from?”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has already preceded that <em>hijrah</em> is made from the land of disbelief to the land of Islaam, so if what is meant by this question, is an explanation and clarification of the rule defining the land of <em>shirk</em> or disbelief then the Scholars have many interpretations defining that rule.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most famous rule amongst the Scholars defining the land of <em>shirk</em> and the land of disbelief is: ‘The land in which <em>shirk</em> or disbelief is in the open and predominant,’ as has been mentioned in ‘<em>Sharh Al-Iqnaa</em>’ by al-Buhootee, and in the <em>fataawa</em> (legal verdicts) of Ash-Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Ibraaheem, and in the <em>fataawa</em> of Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, may Allaah have mercy upon all of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ash-Shawkaanee (<em>Rahimahullaahu Ta’ala</em>) has also mentioned in his book ‘<em>AsSail Al-Jarraar</em>’ a rule defining the land of disbelief, and the land of shirk, and also the land of Islaam. He (<em>Rahimahullaahu Ta’ala</em>) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“What is considered is, who’s word is predominant. If the commands and prohibitions in the land belong to the people of Islaam, then it is a land of Islaam, and that ruling is not impaired by the appearance of certain traits of disbelief because they didn’t appear by means of the might and force of the disbelievers as is witnessed in <em>Ahl Adh-Dhimmah</em> (those disbelievers who pay a tax to live in the Muslim lands) from the Jews and Christians, and in the <em>Muaahadoon</em> (those who have a pact with the Muslims) who reside in the Islaamic cities, and if the situation is opposite to that, the land takes the opposite ruling.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, there is a nice discussion by Ash-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (Rahimahullaahu Ta’ala) in his explanation to ‘Al-Usool AthThalaathah’. He (Rahimahullaah) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“And the land of shirk is the one in which the rituals of disbelief are performed and the rituals of Islaam, such as the Adhaan (call to prayer), and the Salaah (prayer) in congregation, and the ‘Eed prayers, and Jumu’ah (Friday prayers) are not performed in a general universal manner.” </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“We only said: ‘in a general universal manner’ in order to exclude those places in which these rituals are performed in a limited way like the lands of the disbelievers that have Muslim minorities, for verily they don’t become the lands of Islaam by the Islamic rituals that the Muslim minorities perform therein. As for the lands of Islaam, they are the lands in which these rituals are performed in a general universal manner.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This statement of Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (Rahimahullaahu Ta’ala), could be used to refute that which al-Maawardee mentioned. He is a Shaafi&#8217;ee Scholar who said, “<em>If he is able to openly perform the deen in a land from the lands of disbelief, then that land has become a land of Islaam, and therefore, residing in it is better than leaving it because of the hope that others will enter Islaam</em>.” Ibn Hajar (Rahimahullaah) reported that on him. So the statement of Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (Rahimahullaah) could be used as a refutation against what al-Maawardee (Rahimahullaahu Ta’ala) mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the rule defining the land of shirk and the land of disbelief from which hijrah is obligatory upon whoever is not able to openly perform his deen, nor perform the rituals therein.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Question 7</strong>: <strong>The ruling on working and studying in the lands of disbelief</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“Is residing in the lands of disbelief for work and study from the exceptions to this?”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regards to working and gathering money, the discussion about the danger of the Muslim staying in the land of disbelief has already preceded, so it is upon the Muslim to strive to save himself, and protect his deen and guard himself against the tribulations, for that, by Allaah, is better than the dunyaa and what is in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, it is upon the Muslim to strive to remain in the lands of Islaam, even if the income there is small. Rather, it is upon him to rely on Allaah, and think good of Allaah, and ask Allaah to bless that which He provides him, for indeed blessing is from Allaah. How many people, their incomes are limited, however, they are at ease, and in a state of peacefulness, and happiness and blessing, while on the contrary, how many people have gone to the lands of disbelief to gather money and to compete with the people of the dunyaa in their dunyaa, then you find them in a state of loss and need, even if they possess millions, and build buildings, and buy fancy cars. You find them in a state of misery and unhappiness. This is the norm for the one who strives to compete for dunyaa, that he (will) be in a state of grief, and sorrow, and fatigue, and misery and distress.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Maajah has transmitted the hadeeth of Zaid Ibn Thaabit on the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Whoever has the dunyaa be his main concern, Allaah will make his affair fall apart, and He will put poverty before his eyes, and only that which has been written for him from the dunyaa will come to him, and whoever has the next life as his determination, Allaah will put together for him his affair, and He will put wealth in his heart, and the dunyaa will be forced to come to him.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hadeeth is saheeh, and we benefit from this hadeeth that Allaah (Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala) punishes he who strives to obtain dunyaa and gather it even if it costs him his deen. Allaah makes his affair fall apart, and puts Him in disarray and in fear of want and poverty despite the fact that he works morning and evening, and toils night and day. Some of them neglect the rights of his wife and children, rather, he is also negligent in his forms of worship and religious obligations, and at the same time, the only provision from the dunyaa that will come to him is that which Allaah has decreed for him, not what he himself wants.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>مَّن كَانَ يُرِيدُ الْعَاجِلَةَ عَجَّلْنَا لَهُ فِيهَا مَا نَشَاءُ لِمَن نُّرِيدُ ثُمَّ جَعَلْنَا لَهُ جَهَنَّمَ يَصْلَاهَا مَذْمُومًا مَّدْحُورًا</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Whoever wishes for the quick-passing (transitory enjoyment of this world), We readily grant him what We will for whom We like. Then, afterwards, We have appointed for him Hell, he will burn therein disgraced and rejected, (far away from Allaah’s Mercy).”</strong> </span>&#8211; Al-Israa (17):18</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he will only get from the dunyaa, that which Allaah wants and wills for him, not what that person wants, and decides, and desires and wishes for. So it is upon the slave to strive to obey Allaah and His Messenger, and stay away from the tribulations, and occupy himself with worship, and exert himself wholeheartedly for Allaah, for verily if he does that, then Allaah (Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala) will bless him in his provision, and He will put satisfaction in his heart, and if not, if he does contrary to that, then let him expect the opposite of that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haakim has transmitted with a saheeh chain on Ma’qil Ibn Yasaar on the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Your Lord (Tabarak Wa Ta’ala) says: ‘O son of Adam, devote yourself to worshipping Me, I will fill your heart with wealth (satisfaction), and I will fill your hands with provision. O son of Adam, don’t move away from Me, (if you do so) I will fill your heart with poverty, and I will fill your hands with work.’”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So every Muslim must beware of subjecting his deen to tribulation because of some limited amount of money that he gathers. A group of the people of knowledge has mentioned that remaining in the lands of the disbelievers for the purpose of working is from those things which are forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for going to the lands of disbelief to study, it has preceded that from the conditions for the one residing over there is that he is able to perform his deen, and openly perform it, and also that he feel safe for his deen and for himself, and this, in reality, is not being fulfilled with most of the students.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In studying with them there is great danger for the deen and character of the students, while most of the students are negligent when it comes to learning their deen, and they have weakness in differentiating between good and bad, and between that which is beneficial and that which is harmful, and between right and wrong, and between misguidance and guidance and between that which is meager and that which is stout, so over there they are prey for the enemies of Islaam because they are under the supervision of the disbelievers, and under the instruction and education of the disbelievers, so what do we expect after that?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, in most cases the student looks up to his teacher and respects him, and his heart leans toward him, and when that happens he copies his ideas and follows him in his character and his behavior, thus he does not return to his country except that he has abandoned his deen. It is rare that the student over there escapes sins, and disobedient acts, and the different types of abominations and sins and disobedience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a very important point that the Muslims must be aware of, and those who want to go over there must beware of. Is it perceivable that there exists education in those lands far free from having acts forbidden by the Islamic legislation like intermingling (of men and women) and other things?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So due to this, it is upon the Muslim to strive to study in the land of Islaam so he can feel safe in the lands of Islaam for his deen and his character. Also, there exists in the lands of Islaam different types of studies which suffices having to go to the lands of the disbelievers, although we point out that the places of education that contain acts forbidden by the Islamic legislation, like intermingling and other things, it is not permissible to enroll in them, whether they are in the land of disbelief or in the land of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">If someone were to say, “What if the field of study is something that is needed, and it does not exist in the lands of Islaam, is it permissible to go to the lands of disbelief?”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer: this is not permissible, going to their lands, even if the type of knowledge is something needed and it does not exist in the lands of the Muslims because in that there is danger for the students as you have heard, and also, if we were to refrain from studying this matter that the Muslims need, is straying from the truth going to occur because of that? Or is the worst that will occur is deprivation and some extra effort, contrary to the Muslims need for knowledge of the Islamic legislation and the beneficial knowledge, for verily if they were to leave that, straying from the truth would befall them as the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) has informed of as is mentioned in the two Saheehs from the hadeeth of ‘Abdullaah Ibn ‘Amr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Verily, Allaah does not seize the knowledge by snatching it from the breasts of men, rather He seizes the knowledge by the death of the Scholars, then when He doesn’t let a Scholar remain, the people will take ignorant people as their leaders, so they will be asked, and they will give legal verdicts without knowledge, so they will go astray and they will lead others astray.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus if the knowledge of the legislation does not exist, then straying and misguidance occurs in the Muslim societies. As for the knowledge of worldly affairs, the worst that could happen to them is some extra effort, although, as we have mentioned, the types of knowledge which the Muslims need exist in the lands of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, look at the evil consequences that have occurred in the ranks of the Muslims because of them sending their children to go study with the disbelievers, and that could be because of a legal opinion of some of the people of knowledge, however, look at the tremendous evils. What have the Muslims benefited from their children going to the lands of disbelief? If we were to look at the evil consequences we would find them to be many and tremendous.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>How to fight the Eastern and Western cultural invasion [1]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allah Alone, and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah, his family and Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that the gravest danger that Muslim societies are facing nowadays is the so-called cultural invasion with its different weapons, including all media means, printed and broadcast alike. Invaders have realized in the modern age that the old ways have become ineffective. Nations fight courageously to defend their religion, homelands and their heritage. Usurping by violence and terrorism is an inherently refused concept, especially in modern times after the spread of awareness among the people. The world has become like a small village and many organizations were established to defend the rights of nations, refuse political invasion, and claim the right to self-determination. Every nation has the right to have sovereignty over its own territory, invest its resources, and rule its territories according to its own standards. Nations also adopt different beliefs, creeds and ruling systems, which made invaders leave these countries after fierce, bloody wars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, before leaving those countries, the invaders thought of many ways and prepared many plots based on thorough investigation, full awareness of the aims and effectiveness of those plans, and the ways that should be followed to accomplish them. Their aims revolved around designing highly deceiving curriculums of weak ties with religion, focusing on spreading their culture and instilling in the souls of most of the people the admiration of their material achievements in different aspects of life. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>When people, especially teenagers and young students, are impressed by this superficial brilliant achievements and inventions in the world, some of them who are totally impressed choose to complete their education in European and American universities</strong></span>. There they are surrounded with doubts and sorts of lusts systematically presented by orientalists and atheists, using well-organized, perverted, cunning schemes, where they face the Western lifestyle with all its corruption, dissolution and obscenity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rarely does a person remain safe from these weapons, being accompanied with enticement and lack of religion or authority. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>After completing their study and returning to their countries, those people assume important posts and become agents for the colonialists and apply their demands and implement their plots precisely, even with harsher means than those used by the colonialists themselves</strong></span>. This has taken place, indeed, in many countries that were occupied by invaders. The way to safety from this danger lies in establishing universities and institutes in different specializations, in order to limit the missions abroad and teach all forms of knowledge in all universities and institutes. This should be accompanied with paying attention to Islamic subjects and culture, in order to keep the `Aqidah (creed) of the students intact, and protect their morals and future, so that they take part in building their society on a Shari`ah (Islamic law) basis and according to the needs of the Islamic Ummah (nation). We should restrict educational missions abroad to certain forms of knowledge that are not available at home.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah guide us to all what benefits the people and the countries, and protects the Muslims against anything that might harm them in their `Aqidah and morals. He is the Most Generous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, <strong>we need to take more care of curricula, add a perfect Islamic touch to them, and establish more scientific institutions to help the people study at home instead of traveling abroad</strong>. <strong>We should also choose teachers and managers perfectly; all of them should be of good morals, sound `Aqidah, reputation, jealousy on Islam, power and honesty.</strong> Whoever enjoys these traits is guaranteed and will most probably do their best to explain information to the students in a correct way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if it is a necessity to send some students to learn abroad due to the lack of some professional institutions, especially in the field of industry, an objective committee should be formed to choose the most suitable students in terms of religion and morals and who are well-versed in Islamic culture and have an Islamic spirit. The committee can also choose a knowledgeable, righteous supervisor, who is active in practicing Da`wah (calling to Islam), to accompany the mission, practices Da`wah there, supervises and guides the students, and refutes any doubts they may come across.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>They should be given even a short course before traveling to be aware of all the problems they might encounter abroad</strong>, and clarify the Shari`ah viewpoint and wisdom behind such issues according to the Qur&#8217;an, the Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet), and the opinions of scholars. This includes, for instance, the rulings on slavery, polygyny in general, polygyny of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in particular, Talaq (divorce pronounced by a husband), the wisdom behind both offensive and defensive Jihad (fighting in the Cause of Allah), and such doubts that are mentioned by the enemies of Allah to Muslim youths, so that they would be fully ready to refute any such issues.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for facing the invasion of print and broadcast media, which have afflicted the Muslim Ummah in the modern age and have come to occupy most of the time of Muslims in spite of the deadly poison and the misleading promotion they usually contain, it is one of the most important tasks to protect Islam and the Islamic culture from its evil plotting. We should make sure that the Du`ah (callers to Islam) dedicate themselves to writing useful researches, periodicals and articles; practicing Da`wah, replying to different forms of cultural invasion and exposing their falsehood. The enemies have dedicated all their resources and potentials, founded many organizations and applied different means to deceive Muslims. Their misconceptions should be refuted and Islamic `Aqidah, legislation, rulings and morals should be clarified and explained in a nice, attractive way using suitable modern ways; wisdom and good discourse of preaching, arguing in a gentle way via all mass media as much as possible. Islam is the perfect religion that encompasses all goodness, guarantees happiness to all people, good progress, sound development, peace, security, prosperous life and winning in this world and in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslims are afflicted by all this as they do not stick to their religion as they should have, with most of the people not understanding its reality, because of being not interested; ignorant of it; negligent of many scholars in clarifying its advantages, wisdoms and secrets; lack of honesty and patience in inviting others to it; and not bearing harm and using the modern ways. Thus, discrepancy took place. Most of the people have become ignorant of the Islamic rulings. They have become deluded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is known that the last generation of this Ummah will not succeed except with what brought success to the first generation &#8211; that is, to follow the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) to these idolaters (pagan Arabs) of your folk:] </strong><strong>Follow what has been sent down unto you from your Lord (the Qur’ân and Prophet Muhammad’s Sunnah), and follow not any Auliyâ’ (protectors and helpers who order you to associate partners in worship with Allâh), besides Him (Allâh). Little do you remember! </strong>[Surah Al-A`raf, 7: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And verily, this </strong>(i.e. Allâh’s Commandments mentioned in the above two Verses 151 and 152)<strong> is My Straight Path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His Path. This He has ordained for you that you may become Al-Muttaqûn </strong>(the pious &#8211; see V.2:2)<strong>.&#8221; </strong>[Surah Al-An`am, 6: 153]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: <strong>And this is a blessed Book (the Qur’ân) which We have sent down, so follow it and fear Allâh (i.e. do not disobey His Orders), that you may receive mercy (i.e. be saved from the torment of Hell). </strong>[Surah Al-An`am, 6: 155]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He), Who is the Most Truthful, has promised us a great victory and successful outcome in return for this in His Statement: &#8230;and<strong> (as for) the believers, it was incumbent upon Us to help (them). </strong>[Surah Al­Rum, 30: 47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>But if you remain patient and become Al-Muttaqûn [the pious &#8211; See V.2:2], not the least harm will their cunning do to you. Surely, Allâh surrounds all that they do. </strong>[Surah Al-`Imran, 3: 120]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: <strong>Allâh has promised those among you who believe and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers) in the land, as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practise their religion which He has chosen for them (i.e. Islâm). And He will surely give them in exchange a safe security after their fear (provided) they (believers) worship Me and do not associate anything (in worship) with Me. But whoever disbelieves after this, they are the Fâsiqûn (rebellious, disobedient to Allâh).</strong>[Surah Al-Nur, 24: 55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: <strong>O you who believe! If you help (in the cause of) Allâh, He will help you, and make your foothold firm</strong>.[Surah Muhammad, 47: 7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) in this regard. When the Salaf (righteous predecessors) applied these noble Ayahs, whether in words, actions, or beliefs, Allah granted them victory over their enemies, made them rulers of the world, spread justice through them, and made them leaders of the Ummah and Imams of guidance. When the latter generations faltered in this (Allah&#8217;s Orders) their conditions declined, according to Allah&#8217;s Statement: <strong>Verily, Allâh will not change the (good) condition of a people as long as they do not change their state (of goodness) themselves (by committing sins and by being ungrateful and disobedient to Allâh).</strong>[Surah Al-Ra`d, 13: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah make the Muslims, whether people or governments, return to their faith in a proper way; grant them comprehension of it, cause them to apply it, make them unanimous on Al-Haqq (the Truth), guide them to cooperation in righteousness and piety, and enjoining each other to Al-Haqq and persevering upon it. He is the All-Hearing, Ever Near. May Allah&#8217;s peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Bismillah wa -Alhamdulillah wa Salaatu wa Salaam &#8216;alaa Rasulillah &#8216;amma ba&#8217;d</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On Friday 30th January, <i>Muwahhideen</i> Publications in conjunction with<i>Islam.tt </i>and <i>Imam-Malik.net</i> hosted a LIVE tele-lecture with <i>Shaykh Yahyaa al-Jaabiree</i> (May <b>Allah</b> Preserve Him) entitled, “The Types of <i>Hijrah</i>” as part of the webinar, “The Obligation of The <i>Muslims</i> Towards The Non-<i>Muslims</i>in The West”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>This lecture event was translated LIVE into English.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Allah</b> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>&#8220;And as for those who emigrated for the Cause of Allah, after suffering oppression, We will certainly give them goodly residence in this world, but indeed the reward of the Hereafter will be greater, if they but knew!&#8221; </i></b>[Soorah an-Nahl 16:41]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• The Prophet (<i>sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <i>“Hijrah will not cease until repentance ceases, and repentance will not cease until the sun rises from the West.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• He (<i>sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) likewise stated:<i> “There is no Hijrah after the Conquest (of Makkah), but instead Jihaad and (good) intention.”</i> i.e. Hijrah from Makkah to Madeenah, because Makkah had become a land of Islaam and this is a glad tiding that it will remain as such until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• <i>Hijrah </i>is an obligation upon those who have the ability to do so. If they are unable an exception is made for them. <b>Allah</b> mentions in His Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>&#8220;Except the weak ones among men, women and children who cannot devise a plan, nor are they able to direct their way. For these there is hope that Allah will forgive them, and Allah is Ever Oft Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving.&#8221; </i></b>[Soorah an-Nisaa 4:98-99]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• Whoever finds a <i>Muslim </i>land that will accept him, then it is obligatory for him to emigrate. And whoever does not find a place that would allow him to live there, he should remain in his country and practice his <i>Deen </i>to the best of his ability and treat the people in the best way and not cause the disbelievers to have any animosity towards the <i>Muslims </i>due to his bad actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Lord (<i>Subhaanahu wa Ta’aalaa</i>) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>&#8220;And say to My slaves that they should (only) say those words that are the best. (Because) Shaytaan verily, sows disagreements among them Surely, Shaytaan is to man a plain enemy.&#8221; </i></b>[Soorah al-Israa` 17:53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>“And (remember) when We took a covenant from the Children of Israel, (saying): Worship none but Allah (Alone) and be dutiful and good to parents, and to kindred, and to orphans and al-Masaakeen (the poor), and speak good to people”</i></b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is not because we have some special love for the non-<i>Muslims </i>because of their <i>Deen</i>, but in hope that they will be guided to <i>Islaam </i>and hope that some harm will be repelled form the <i>Muslims</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• From the types of <i>Hijrah </i>are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Leaving a land of bid&#8217;ah to a land of <i>Sunnah</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Leaving a land of sin and disobedience to a land where the people are righteous and obedient to <b>Allah</b>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Leaving alone that which <b>Allah </b>has prohibited, as is found in the <i>hadeeth</i>of <i>‘Abdullah Ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas</i> (<i>radhiyAllahu ‘anhu</i>) that the Messenger (<i>sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <i>“The Muslim is one from whose tongue and hand the Muslims are safe. And a Muhaajir is the one who abandons all that Allah has forbidden.”</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• It is befitting for the <i>Muslim </i>to abandon the places where <i>shirk</i>, sin and<i>bid’ah </i>are committed and to stay away from the people who commit those sins because they cause a deficiency in his <i>Deen</i>. And he should not take any knowledge from the people of <i>bid’ah</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• Regarding the third type of leaving alone something &#8211; which is the origin of the word &#8211; can be applied to shunning people. This can be done to <i>Muslims</i>if they have committed a sin and it would benefit them and cause them to recognise their sin and repent from it. The Prophet (<i>sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) did this with <i>Ka’b Ibn Maalik </i>(<i>radhiyAllahu ‘anhu</i>) and others who stayed behind for the Battle of <i>Tabook</i>. The Prophet (<i>sallAllahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) did not speak to them for 50 nights, so they would realise the severity of their sin until <b>Allah </b>revealed that He had accepted their repentance and forgiven them. <b>Allah </b>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>“Allah has forgiven the Prophet, the Muhaajiroon (Muslim emigrants who left their homes and came to al-Madeenah) and the Ansaar (Muslims of al-Madeenah) who followed him (Muhammad sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) in the time of distress (Tabook expedition, etc.), after the hearts of a party of them had nearly deviated (from the Right Path), but He accepted their repentance. Certainly, He is unto them full of Kindness, Most Merciful. And (He did forgive also) the three [who did not join the Tabooûk expedition (whom the Prophet sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)] left (i.e. he did not give his judgement in their case, and their case was suspended for Allah&#8217;s Decision) till for them the earth, vast as it is, was straitened and their ownselves were straitened to them, and they perceived that there is no fleeing from Allah, and no refuge but with Him. Then, He accepted their repentance, that they might repent (unto Him). Verily, Allah is the One Who accepts repentance, Most Merciful.” </i></b>[Soorah at-Tawbah 9:117-118]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• There were other people at that time that likewise stayed behind and they pretended to have a valid excuse when they did not and the Prophet accepted that at face value from them and did not rebuke them from it like the Companions who admitted they did not have an excuse; and <b>Allah</b>exposed those who were hypocrites. This type of <i>hijrah </i>(of shunning) applied to them and remained for 50 nights until <b>Allah </b>accepted their repentance. They benefited from this type of <i>hijrah</i>. They would walk around the market places full of people and no one would pay attention to them. When <b>Allah </b>revealed that He had accepted their repentance the Prophet (<i>sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said to <i>Ka’b</i>: <i>“Receive glad tidings of the best day upon you since your mother gave birth to you.”</i> <i>Ka’b </i>asked: “O Messenger of <b>Allah</b>, is this from you or from <b>Allah</b>?” to which the Messenger (<i>sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) informed him that it was from<b>Allah</b>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• However, this type of refusing to talk to people is only applied if they would recognise their sin because of this. If shunning them would only cause them to go further away from the <i>Muslims </i>and go deeper into their sins and break away from the <i>jamaa’ah</i>, it is not to be done.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• The Prophet (<i>sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) applied this to some people and to others he did not, which was based on their circumstances and if they would benefit from it or not.</p>

Video Courtesy: Brother Bilal Nahim</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">My son travels abroad to attend football (soccer) matches in the lands of the unbelievers; what is your advice for me and for him regarding this matter?</span></p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Salih Fawzan:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[My advice] is that he is to have <strong>Taqwa</strong> of Allah and not to follow this game that has no benefit, rather it is harmful, and that he not travel for its sake to the lands of the unbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong> [football] is useless. and <strong>secondly</strong>, travelling to the lands of the unbelievers is not permitted except for a necessity, for medical treatment, to learn something special only they have and which we need, or for trade, this is alright.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwa no: 29</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Category: Fatwas about Aqîda (Creed) and Tauhîd (monotheism)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><strong>The Question:</strong></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b><strong>I am an Algerian young man; religiously upright (If Allah </strong></b><b><strong>سبحانه wills). I have lived in Canada for a long time and I try to leave it as soon as possible. But I do not have a residence to settle down in my country.</strong></b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">So, is it permissible to get the Canadian passport (with some conditions I will mention later on) since it enables me to leave this country and enter the Gulf States and try to settle there?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And here are the conditions:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b><strong>First:</strong></b> Indeed getting the Canadian passport will not invalidate my Algerian nationality but it will be the original one, this is confirmed by their laws and the Algerian country accepts plurality of nationalities.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b><strong>Second:</strong></b> I am able to renounce this passport whenever I want, without having problems. This is also confirmed by their laws.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b><strong>Third:</strong></b> I can avoid the oath of respecting the Queen, her children and the King as long as I sit in the back of the room without uttering a word.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">May you be helpful for us (by your answer) and May Allah bless you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><strong>The answer:</strong></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds. Peace and blessing be upon whom Allah sent as a mercy to the Worlds, upon his Family, his Companions and his Brothers till The Day of Resurrection.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is not allowed to acquire the disbelievers’ nationality even with keeping the original one, because of the negative aspects which affect the Muslim’s religion and creed. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is enough to know what results from implicit contentment in applying the disbelievers’ customs and laws of that country, besides referring to them as judges and showing pride in being a Canadian citizen and all that engenders; in terms of allegiance and friendship toward them and imitating them in their words and deeds.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This contradicts the completeness of faith or nullifies it, according to the situation. Allah تعالى said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>﴿لاَ تَجِدُ قوْمًا يُؤْمِنُوْنَ بِاللهِ وَاليَوْمِ الآخِرِ يُوَادُّونَ مَنْ حَادَّ اللهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَلَوْ كَانُوا آباءَهُمْ أَوْ أَبْنَاءَهُمْ أَوْ إِخْوَانَهُمْ أَوْ عَشِيرَتَهُمْ…﴾</b>[المجادلة: 22].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of the meaning of the verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>﴾</b><b>You (O Mohammad </b><b>صلَّى الله عليه وسلَّم</b><b>) will not find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day, making friendship with those who oppose Allah and His Messenger (Mohammad </b><b>صلَّى الله عليه وسلَّم</b><b>), even though they were their fathers or their sons or their kindred (people)…</b><b>﴿</b></span> [Al-Mujâdilah (The Woman Who Disputes): 22].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the Muslim is called to complete his religion and increase his faith in calling to Allah تعالى and showing Islam.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And among the conditions of traveling to the country of disbelief is to manifest the religion and reveal its rites in a complete way without any opposition to any of them; with the capacity of being loyal to the Muslims and disavowal to the disbelievers. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And those who are not able to do so are obliged to go back to the place they came from and try hard to look for a job and get satisfied with littleness and ask Allah for success. He is the Best Helper and the Best Provider.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The perfect knowledge belongs to Allah. Our last prayer is all praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds. Peace and blessing be upon our Prophet, his Family, his Companions and Brothers till the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Ali Ferkous<br />

<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">والهجرة فريضة على هذه الأمة من بلد الشرك إلى بلد الإسلام ، وهي باقية إلى أن تقوم الساعة</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Hijrah</em>, from the land of shirk to the land of <em>Islaam</em>, is an obligation upon this nation and it continues until the Hour is established</strong></span>.<sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">64</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">64</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Hijrah</em> is joined along with <em>jihaad</em> in Allaah&#8217;s cause and it is an obligation which remains, it is not being abrogated. It is obligatory upon every Muslim who needs to perform <em>Hijrah</em> that he should perform <em>Hijrah</em>. And it is not permissible for the Muslim to remain in the lands of <em>kufr</em> when he is not able to make his religion apparent; so then it is obligatory upon him to migrate to the lands of the Muslims. So it is an obligation which remains, because of his <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> saying:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لا تنقطع الهجرة حتى تنقطع التوبة ، ولا تنقطع التوبة حتى تخرج الشمس من مغرﺑﻬا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Hijrah will not be cut off until repentance is cut off and repentance will not be cut off until the sun rises from its place of setting</strong></span>.»<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">I<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a><strong>maam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof is His Saying, the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ تَوَفَّاهُمُ الْمَلَائِكَةُ ظَالِمِي أَنفُسِهِمْ قَالُوا فِيمَ كُنتُمْ ۖ قَالُوا كُنَّا مُسْتَضْعَفِينَ فِي الْأَرْضِ ۚ قَالُوا أَلَمْ تَكُنْ أَرْضُ اللَّهِ وَاسِعَةً فَتُهَاجِرُوا فِيهَا ۚ فَأُولَٰئِكَ مَأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ ۖ وَسَاءَتْ مَصِيرًا</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِلَّا الْمُسْتَضْعَفِينَ مِنَ الرِّجَالِ وَالنِّسَاءِ وَالْوِلْدَانِ لَا يَسْتَطِيعُونَ حِيلَةً وَلَا يَهْتَدُونَ سَبِيلًا</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَأُولَٰئِكَ عَسَى اللَّهُ أَن يَعْفُوَ عَنْهُمْ ۚ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ عَفُوًّا غَفُورًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>As for those whose souls the angels take in a state of having earned Allaah&#8217;s anger, the angels will say to them:  &#8216;In what condition were you?&#8217; They will say: We were weakened </strong>(by the great numbers and strength of the people of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>)<strong> in our land.&#8217; They will reply: &#8216;Was not Allaah&#8217;s earth spacious so that you could make <em>hijrah</em> therein? These people will find their abode in Hell and what an evil destination that is.  </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Except for those who were rendered weak from the men, women and children who were unable to migrate or find a way to do so.  </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>As for such people, Allaah will certainly pardon them and Allaah is ever One who pardons and forgives the sins of His servants</strong>.</span>» [4:97-99] <sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">65</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Shaykh Fawzan quoted the 100th ayah as well :</strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يُهَاجِرْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ يَجِدْ فِي الْأَرْضِ مُرَاغَمًا كَثِيرًا وَسَعَةً ۚ وَمَن يَخْرُجْ مِن بَيْتِهِ مُهَاجِرًا إِلَى اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ ثُمَّ يُدْرِكْهُ الْمَوْتُ فَقَدْ وَقَعَ أَجْرُهُ عَلَى اللَّهِ ۗ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">He who emigrates </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(from his home)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> in the Cause of Allah, will find on earth many dwelling places and plenty to live by. And whosoever leaves his home as an emigrant unto Allah and His Messenger, and death overtakes him, his reward is then surely incumbent upon Allah. And Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. </span></strong>[4:100]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">65</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These two <em>aayaat</em> contain a threat against abandoning performing the <em>hijrah</em> when the person is able to perform it &#8211; and that his abode will be the Hellfire &#8211; what an evil destination. Even though he does not exit from Islaam – this is from the<strong><em> nu<u>s</u>oo<u>s</u> al-wa`eed</em></strong> (the texts which contain a threat). So, if he abandons the <em>hijrah</em>, then he has abandoned something obligatory and he will be sinful. However, he does not exit from <em>Islaam</em> through abandonment of the <em>hijrah</em>, but there is a severe threat upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, Allaah explains in the <em>aayah</em> after it, the excuse by which the obligation of the <em>hijrah</em> falls away. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِلَّا الْمُسْتَضْعَفِينَ مِنَ الرِّجَالِ وَالنِّسَاءِ وَالْوِلْدَانِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Except for those who were rendered weak from the men, the women and <em>wildaan</em></strong> (children)</span>.» [4:98]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>wildaan</em> </span>Meaning: the children.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَا يَسْتَطِيعُونَ حِيلَةً</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Who were unable to migrate</strong></span>» [4:98]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They do not possess the ability.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَا يَهْتَدُونَ سَبِيلًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Or find a way to do so</strong></span>» [4:98]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: they do not know the way to the land – the city – because <em>hijrah</em> requires (a person) to make a journey, otherwise (it may be the case) that a person dies during the journey if he does not know the way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore their excuse is in two matters:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: Those who were not able to carry it out.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: Those who do not know the way.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So even if they have the financial capability, but do not have awareness of the way that they could follow, someone to guide them upon the way – this is the correct excuse. As for the person who has the capability and knows the way, then there is no excuse for him.</p>
<hr />
<p>I<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></a><strong>maam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And His saying, He the Most High:</span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا عِبَادِيَ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِنَّ أَرْضِي وَاسِعَةٌ فَإِيَّايَ فَاعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O My servants who believe! Indeed My earth is spacious, so worship Me alone</strong></span>.» [29:56]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قال البغوي رحمه الله : سبب نزول هذه الآية في المسلمين الذين بمكة ولم يهاجروا ، ناداهم الله باسم الإيمان</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">al-Ba<u>gh</u>awee (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said: </span><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;<strong>The reason for the sending down of this <em>aayah</em> concerns the Muslims who were in Makkah and did not migrate; Allaah addressed them with the title of <em>eemaan</em></strong>.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">: والدليل على الهجرة من السنة قوله صلى الله عليه وسلم</span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">» لا تنقطع الهجرة حتى تنقطع  التوبة ، ولا تنقطع التوبة حتى تطلع الشمس من مغرﺑﻬا «</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The proof for the <em>hijrah</em> found in the <em>Sunnah</em> is his <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> saying: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">«<strong><em>Hijrah</em> will not be discontinued until repentance is discontinued, and repentance will not be discontinued until the sun rises from its place of setting</strong>.</span>»<sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">66</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">66</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>aayah</em> is from <em>Soorah al-`Ankaboot</em>. It contains a command to migrate and that the earth of Allaah is spacious. So, if you are in a land where you are not able to make your religion apparent, in that case Allaah’s earth is spacious, so move away from it. Do not remain in the bad part; rather leave it and go somewhere in Allaah&#8217;s spacious earth. Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, has made the earth spacious. The proof for the <em>hijrah</em> found in the <em>Sunnah</em> is his <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> saying:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">»لا تنقطع الهجرة حتى تنقطع  التوبة ، ولا تنقطع التوبة حتى تطلع الشمس من مغرﺑﻬ ا «</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong><em>Hijrah</em> will not be discontinued until repentance is discontinued, and repentance will not be discontinued until the sun rises from its place of setting</strong>.»<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>&#8216;s saying:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">» لا هجرة بعد الفتح «</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>There is no migrating after the conquest </strong>(of Makkah).»<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is apparent from the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> is that the migrating came to an end after the conquest of Makkah. Some people think that there is a contradiction between the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> and between his <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> saying:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">»لا تنقطع الهجرة حتى تنقطع  التوبة ، ولا تنقطع التوبة حتى تطلع الشمس من مغرﺑﻬا«</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong><em>Hijrah</em> will not be discontinued until repentance is discontinued, and repentance will not be discontinued until the sun rises from its place of setting</strong>.»<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the people of knowledge respond to his <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> (by saying) that what is meant by «<strong>there is no migrating after the conquest</strong>» is (no migrating) from Makkah, since through the conquest, it became an abode of Islaam. The people thought that migrating remained from Makkah after the conquest so they wished to attain the reward of migrating. As for migrating from the land of disbelief, then it remains until the Hour is established. The proof is the previous <em>aayaat</em> and the previous prophetic <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>. This is the response to this difficulty.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Warning against traveling to non-Muslim countries and outlining its dangers</b><b>on `Aqidah and manners</b><b> [1]</b></p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allah, Alone. May peace and blessings be upon whom no Prophet shall come after, our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family, Companions, and followers till the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Allah (Exalted be He) has blessed the Muslim nation with many favors, distinguished it with unique characteristics, and made it the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind when it enjoins what is good and forbids what is evil and believes in Allah (Exalted be He). Indeed, the best thing Allah (Exalted be He) bestowed upon it is the Religion of Islam. Allah (Exalted be He) chose Islam as the Shari`ah (revealed teachings and laws) and way of life for His Slaves and completed His Favor upon His Slaves and perfected the religion by Islam. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">He (Exalted be He) says, </span><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5: 3" target="_blank" name="Forbiddentoyou(forfood)are:"></a><em><span style="color:#008000;">This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islâm as your religion</span></em>.</span><span style="color:#000000;"> <span style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-Ma&#8217;idah, 5: 3</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">However, the enemies of Islam feel envy towards Muslims owing to this great favor and are filled with spite and rage as well as enmity and hatred toward Muslims and Islam. They wish to deprive Muslims of this favor as Allah (Exalted be He) says describing what occurs in their psyches: </span><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Nisa', 4: 89" target="_blank" name="TheywishthatyourejectFaith,"></a><em><span style="color:#008000;">They wish that you reject Faith, as they have rejected Faith, and thus that you all become equal (like one another)</span></em>.</span><span style="color:#000000;"> <span style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-Nisa&#8217;, 4: 89</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Allah (Exalted be He) also says: </span><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-&#096;Imran, 3: 118" target="_blank" name="Oyouwhobelieve!Takenotas"></a><span style="color:#008000;"><em>O you who believe! Take not as (your) Bitânah (advisors, consultants, protectors, helpers, friends) those outside your religion (pagans, Jews, Christians, and hypocrites) since they will not fail to do their best to corrupt you. They desire to harm you severely. Hatred has already appeared from their mouths, but what their breasts conceal is far worse. Indeed We have made plain to you the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses) if you understand</em></span>.</span><span style="color:#000000;"> <span class="webkit-html-attribute-value" style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-`Imran, 3: 118</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Allah (Exalted be He) also says: </span><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Mumtahanah, 60: 2" target="_blank" name="Shouldtheygaintheupperhand"></a><em><span style="color:#008000;">Should they gain the upper hand over you, they would behave to you as enemies, and stretch forth their hands and their tongues against you with evil, and they desire that you should disbelieve. </span></em><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-Mumtahanah, 60: 2</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says: </span><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 217" target="_blank" name="Theyaskyouconcerningfighting"></a><em><span style="color:#008000;">And they will never cease fighting you until they turn you back from your religion (Islâmic Monotheism) if they can. </span></em><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 217</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) that speak about the enmity of disbelievers towards Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">However, what I want to refer to here is that the disbelievers exert effort and search every way in order to realize their purposes to damage Muslims. They use numerous ways and many concealed and apparent means in order to reach their evil purposes. Among their ways is what some travel institutions do from time to time such as distributing publications which promote people in this country <strong>to spend summer holidays in</strong></span><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Europe </span><span style="color:#000000;">and</span></strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"><strong> America</strong> </span><span style="color:#000000;">on the pretext of learning English and they offer inclusive programs for the entire time for the one who travels with them. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The following things are always included in their programs:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">1- Choosing a non-Muslim family with which a student will live in spite of the great risks included in this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">2- Attending music parties and shows performed in the city where the student lives.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">3- Going to dance and entertainment clubs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">4- Disco dancing with non-Muslim girls and participating in dance competitions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">5- It is mentioned about the entertainment centers in one of the non-Muslim countries that they include the following things: nightclubs, discos, jazz and rock parties, modern music, theaters, cinemas and bars. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">However, these publications aim at many dangerous purposes, such as:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">1- Working towards deviating the Muslim youth and leading them astray.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">2- Spoiling manners and tempting people to commit adultery by making it obtainable.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">3- Filling Muslims with doubts concerning their doctrine.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">4- Developing in the Muslims who go there a sense of admiration and amazement with the culture of non-Muslim countries.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">5- Promoting Muslim to adopt many of their bad traditions and customs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">6- Urging heedlessness towards religion and its morals and teachings.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">7- Utilizing Muslims who go there so that they call others to travel to non-Muslim countries after returning from these journeys and being filled with the thoughts, customs and traditions of the disbelievers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">There are many other dangerous purposes and objectives that the enemies of Islam strive to achieve like gaining as much power as they could and using various apparent and concealed ways that serve their aims. <strong>These evil-minded people may work under Arabic names and national institutions; conspiring against Muslims, keeping suspicions away from them, and concealing their wicked aims from Islamic countries.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Therefore, I am here to warn my Muslim brothers who are living in this country in particular and in all Muslim countries against being deceived and influenced by these publications and not to respond to them. These publications are nothing but some evil-oriented plans by the enemies of Islam that aim at taking Muslims out of their religion, arousing doubts in them over their doctrine and sowing the seeds of discord among Muslims. Allah (Exalted be He) says about them in His Book, </span><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 120" target="_blank" name="NeverwilltheJewsnortheChristians"></a><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Never will the Jews nor the Christians be pleased with you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) till you follow their religion</em></span>.</span><span style="color:#000000;"> <span style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 120</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Moreover, I direct my <strong>advice to the guardians of students</strong> in particular to take care of their children and not to respond to their requests concerning traveling to non-Muslim countries owing to the expected harms and corruption in religion and manners. Praise be to Allah, we, in our countries, have education in various kinds of sciences which suffice from traveling to foreign countries. There are many places of entertainment in our country that are useful substitutes for theirs. In this way, we can protect our young people from the previously mentioned dangers, troubles, harmful results, and difficulties which are encountered in foreign countries.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">I invoke Allah (Exalted be He) to protect our country and all Muslim countries and our children and Muslims&#8217; children from every evil and harm and to save them from the conspiracies and mischief of our enemies. I supplicate Him to turn their evil plots on them and to guide our rulers and all Muslim rulers to abolish these harmful publications and dangerous reports and to guide them to all that benefits the people and the countries for He is the One Who is Capable of doing so.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">May Allah&#8217;s Peace and blessings be upon His slave and Messenger, our Prophet Muhammad, his family, Companions, and followers till the Day of Judgment.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">His Explanation of &#8220;<i>Thalaathat-ul-Usool</i>&#8221;<br />
Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his explanation (<i>sharh</i>) of Imaam Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdil-Wahhaab&#8217;s treatise <i>Thalaathat-ul-Usool</i>, Shaikh &#8216;Abdur-Rahmaan bin Qaasim [Died 1392H], may Allaah have mercy on him, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author states: “Hijrah means: Moving from a Land of Shirk to a Land of Islaam.” This is in order to preserve one’s religion. The Muhaajireen (migrants) were called by this name because they left behind their lands and homes where they had grown up, for the sake of Allaah, and instead joined a land in which they had no family or wealth. This was the case when they migrated to Madeenah. Therefore, everyone that separates himself from his homeland is a Muhaajir (migrant). The root of the word “Muhaajarah” comes from breaking away, separating oneself and remaining far away from somebody.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author says: “It is obligatory upon this ummah to migrate from a Land of Shirk to a Land of Islaam.” This is affirmed by the Book, the Sunnah and the unanimous consensus of the scholars. The one who abandons Hijrah is threatened with punishment. Several scholars have relayed that there is consensus on the obligation of Hijrah from the Land of Shirk to the Land of Islaam. In fact, Allaah obligated the Hijrah upon His Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) and his Companions before He obligated fasting and Hajj, as is agreed upon in the books of principles and subsidiary issues, and well known from the Religion by necessity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His statement: “And this is everlasting until the (Final) Hour is established” is based on the unanimous agreement of the trustworthy scholars. Shaikh-ul-Islaam (Ibn Taimiyyah) said: “One cannot be safe from Shirk unless he remains far away from its adherents.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author continues: “The proof for this is Allaah’s saying: <b>“Verily, as for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves…”</b> i.e. by residing amidst the disbelievers. This ayah was revealed concerning a group of people from the inhabitants of Makkah who professed Islaam but yet did not migrate. So Allaah says: <b>“Verily, as for those whom the angels take (in death).”</b> He is either referring to the Angel of Death and his supporters or just the Angel of Death alone, since the Arabs would speak to one person using the plural form. “…while they are wronging themselves…” by abandoning Hijrah. <b>“They (angels) will say (to them): ‘In what (condition) were you?’”</b> Meaning: Why did you keep living here and not make Hijrah? This is a rebuking, reprimanding, and scolding type of question. Its meaning is: Why did you continue to live here and not make Hijrah? Which side were you on? This is even though the angels know well what side those who didn’t make Hijrah, after it was obligated on them, were on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s saying: <b>“We were weak and oppressed in the earth&#8221;</b> means: “We were not able to make Hijrah. We did not have the ability to leave our land nor to travel through the earth.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“They (angels) will say: ‘Was not the earth of Allaah spacious enough for you to migrate therein?’”</b> This refers to Madeenah – such that they migrate to it and abandon the people of Shirk. The angels did not accept their excuse. And in a hadeeth, it states: <b>“Whoever commingles with a polytheist and resides with him, then he is indeed like him.”</b> [Reported by Abu Dawood and others in various ahaadeeth]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning Allaah’s statement: <b>“…Such men will find their abode in Hell – what an evil destination”</b>, this means: What an evil path to Hell. This shows that the one who abandons Hijrah after it has been made obligatory on him is committing one of the major sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s saying: <b>“…Except the weak ones among men, and women and children…”</b> refers to those who are unable to perform the Hijrah. The word “children” here refers to both male and female children before the age of puberty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“Who cannot devise a plan”</b> means: To separate themselves from the polytheists. So these types of people cannot devise a plan or do not have monetary means or power to leave. “Nor are they able to direct their way” means: They do not know of any way to leave from Makkah to Madeenah, since it had become a land of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“These are the ones whom Allaah is (most) likely to forgive”</b> meaning: He will pardon those who failed to make Hijrah due to weakness and valid excuses. When Allaah uses “likely” for Himself, it is binding since it is something He desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“And Allaah is Ever Oft-Pardoning, Most Forgiving.”</b> This means that He is Oft-Pardoning, overlooking their trespasses, and Most Forgiving to those who turn to Him in repentance. He does not burden a soul with a responsibility except that He gave it the ability to handle it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Abbaas said: “My mother and I used to be from among the weak ones, and the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) would supplicate for the weak ones while in prayer.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says: <b>“O My servants who believe (in Me)! Verily, My earth is spacious.”</b> Allaah orders His believing servants to migrate from the land in which they are not able to establish the Religion to His vast earth. So He informs us that the earth is not constricted, but rather vast, encompassing all of the creatures. If a person is in a land in which he cannot openly practice his Religion, then indeed Allaah has made the earth vast for him so that he could worship him in it as He has commanded him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hijrah is likewise obligatory upon everyone that resides in a land in which sins are openly committed and he is not able to change that. Allaah then says: <b>“So to Me alone, perform your worship.”</b> This means: “Single Me out in worship in My vast earth, which I created as well as everything upon it for you. And I created you upon it to worship Me.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In a qudsee hadeeth, Allaah says: “Son of Aadam, I created you for My sake (i.e. to worship Me.), and I created all things for your sake.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author states: “Al-Baghawee, may Allaah have mercy on him, said…” His nickname was Muhyee-us-Sunnah, Abu Muhammad Al-Husayn bin Mas’ood Al-Faraa’. He was the author of the Tafseer, Sharh-us-Sunnah and other books. He passed away in 516H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (i.e. Al-Baghawee) said: ‘The reason for the revelation of this ayah was due to some Muslims who had resided in Makkah and did not migrate (to Madeenah). Allaah called out to them using the title of Eemaan (for them).” He reported this on a group amongst the Taabi’een. So he is implying that the one who abandons Hijrah after it has been made obligatory on him is not a disbeliever. Rather, he is sinful and disobedient by having abandoned it. So he is still a believer, but yet has deficient Eemaan. Therefore, he is one of the sinful believers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author (i.e. Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab) continues: “The proof for Hijrah from the Sunnah is…”, i.e. proof for the obligation of performing Hijrah from the Land of Shirk to the Land of Islaam from the Sunnah of Muhammad (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>), which we were ordered to follow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“Hijrah will not cease until repentance ceases…”</b> This means: Migrating from the Land of Shirk to the Land of Islaam will not come to an end until the repentance comes to an end, i.e. until repentance ceases to be accepted from those who repent. This hadeeth shows that so long as repentance is accepted, Hijrah is obligatory due to its presence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas: <b>“There is no (more) Hijrah after the Conquest (of Makkah), but instead Jihaadand (good) intention”</b> then what this means is: “There is no (more) Hijrah after the Conquest of Makkah from Makkah to Madeenah since Makkah had become a Land of Islaam after it was conquered. This was since a group of people wanted to migrate from Makkah to Madeenah thinking that this was something encouraged. So the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) explained to them that he only encouraged this when Makkah was a Land of Disbelief. But as for when it became a Land of Islaam, then it did not apply anymore. So this means: “There is no (more) Hijrah from Makkah to Madeenah.” But as for the establishment and continuity of Hijrah from the Lands of Shirk to the Lands of Islaam, then this is well-known by way of the texts and unanimous agreement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">Translated by Abdullah MacPhee in Daarul-Hadeeth, Dammaaj</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the tape series &#8216;Al-Hudaa wa An-Noor&#8217; tape # 617, Al-Imaam Al-Albaanee was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;Residing in the lands of disbelief, like that is the question, the question is about this matter, and in addition to it the American people who are Muslims, the Americans who are originally Muslims, is it incumbent upon them to make hijrah from there?&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Imaam Al-Albaanee answered: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Is there any doubt about that? Because of these people He said: &#8216;Was not the earth of Allaah spacious enough for you to emigrate therein&#8217; (An-Nisaa: 97)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However before your last question, the first part, what is it? I don&#8217;t know do you still insist on asking it that we answer it?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The questioner): &#8220;I would be grateful if you were to answer.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): &#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The questioner): &#8220;I would be grateful if you were to answer.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): &#8220;I believe the first part of the question would be understood inclusively from answering the second part of it, however, perhaps from that which is best is to explain what has come in the Sunnah from the authentic hadeeths which warn the Muslim from taking the lands of disbelief as a homeland. There is in the science of Fiqh and Usool a Qiyaas called Al-Qiyaas Al-Awlawee. If the people of the land born and hereditarily (from there) when they embrace Islaam it is incumbent upon them to make hijrah to the lands of Islaam then more so the one who is on the opposite of that, being born in the lands of Islaam and raised and brought up, it is not permissible for him to travel, and I don&#8217;t say make hijrah, to the lands of disbelief. This is even more so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, with that I say the hadeeths have come one after the other prohibiting the Muslim from traveling to the lands of disbelief. From that is the hadeeth which Abu Dawud transmitted in his Sunan on the Prophet (peace be upon him); that he said with the best form of expression: &#8216;Whoever is close together with the polytheist then he is like him.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the being close together mentioned is mixing together, meaning living together. And other hadeeths have come emphasizing this meaning with the clearest wording. He (peace be upon him); says: &#8216;The Muslim and the polytheist, their fire is not to appear to one another.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslim and the polytheist, their fire is not to appear to one another. This is an expression meaning that it is incumbent upon the Muslim that his residence be far away from the residence of the polytheist, because the Arabs from their custom is that they light the fire in front of their abodes, in front of their tents, so the fire appears to the one approaching from a distance. So it is as if the Messenger (peace be upon him) is saying to the Muslim; stay far away, stay far away as much as you can from having the disbelieving polytheist see your fire. The Muslim and the polytheist, their fire is not to appear to one another. A third hadeeth also emphasizes this, and it is his (peace be upon him) statement: &#8216;I am free from every Muslim who resides amongst the polytheists.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are very clear texts that emphasize that it is not permissible for the Muslim to reside amongst the polytheists. And the wisdom in that is very clear. Not from the analogical stand point or the intellectual standpoint or experience wise, because this is a secondary matter with regards to the traditional texts. There are some hadeeths which it is possible to use as a basis to use as an answer to a question that could occur to some minds when they hear those hadeeths. What is the secret? What is the purpose? What is the wisdom of the prohibition from the Messenger (peace be upon him) of the Muslim from living together with the polytheist? There are two hadeeths suitable to mention as an answer to this question. The first is his (peace be upon him) statement: &#8216;The example of the righteous sitting companion is like the one who sells misk. Either he gives you some as a gift or you buy from him or you smell from him a good fragrance. And the example of the evil sitting companion is like the ironsmith. Either he is going to burn your clothes or you are going to smell from him an offensive smell.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) bringing forth an example for the sitting on a reduced scale. A reduced scale sitting, you sit with one person. So he is saying to you, if he is righteous then the example of him is like the one who sells misk, to the end of the hadeeth, or if he is evil then he is like the ironsmith. Either he is going to burn your clothes or you are going to smell from him an offensive smell. The second hadeeth which emphasizes the first hadeeth and the reality increases it in emphasis, it is what Al-Imaam Muslim transmitted and perhaps Al-Bukhaaree also in the Saheeh on the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he said: &#8216;A man from those before you killed ninety nine people then afterwards he wanted to make Tawbah (repentance) so he asked about the most knowledge of the people on earth, so he was directed to a Raahib. He then went to him and said to him, &#8216;I have killed ninety nine people so is there any Tawbah for me?&#8217; He said, &#8216;You killed ninety nine people and you ask is there any Tawbah for you! There is no Tawbah for you.&#8217; He then completed with him number one hundred. Then he continued to ask until he was directed to a person of knowledge.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Before hand he was directed to a Raahib, meaning an ignorant person engrossed in worship. So he gave a verdict with his ignorance so his outcome was that he added him to the murdered ones before him. The second time he was directed to a person of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;So he went to him and said to him, &#8216;I have killed one hundred people unjustly, is there any Tawbah for me?&#8217; He said, &#8216;What prevents you from Tawbah? However, you are in an evil land so leave it to such and such town which its people are righteous.&#8217; So he went to go to them, to the end of the hadeeth and it is well known inshaallaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The highlight is that this person of knowledge has an understanding of the Fiqh of this hadeeth or these hadeeths, and this does not declare impossible that these hadeeths the Messenger (peace be upon him) narrated them to us, this does not prevent this from being from the understanding of the Prophets beforehand (peace be upon him) because they all used to draw from one source of light (guidance). So therefore, this person of knowledge understands this reality, that the contaminated atmosphere it can infect the righteous person when he intermixes with it. This is an example from the stand point of diseases, the diseases that are contagious. And because of that it has come for this point the quarantine well known today and the Messenger (peace be upon him) has put in place his principle in the well known hadeeth: &#8216;If a plague occurs in a land and you are in it then don&#8217;t leave it, and if a plague occurs in a land and you are not in it then don&#8217;t enter it.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Like that. Therefore, the Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) when he prohibited the Muslims from taking the lands of disbelief as a homeland, that is only to protect their Aqeedah, their worship, their manners. So because of this he made it incumbent not upon the polytheists, this is an important matter also, rarely have I addressed it when I speak about the likes of this issue, the Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) or the wise legislator, not only made it incumbent upon the polytheists when they embrace Islaam that they make hijrah to the lands of Islaam, rather he made it incumbent upon the Bedouins to make hijrah from their nomadic life to their sedentary life. This, in it is a regard for the same meaning because the Messenger (peace be upon him) says in some of the hadeeths: &#8216;Whoever becomes a Bedouin he becomes harsh.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when the Bedouin lives after being taught Tawheed and learning what is incumbent upon him for correcting his faith and his Islaam then he goes back to his nomadic area and lives there, he could be influenced by the harshness which is from the normal way of the Bedouins. So if the Messenger (peace be upon him) encouraged the Bedouins firstly to return to sedentary life, then he tied into that a legislative ruling, and it is that they don&#8217;t have any right to the spoils of war that the Muslims capture from fighting the disbelievers, then more so and more so and more so he makes it incumbent upon the Muslims to remain in their lands and that they don&#8217;t move to the lands of disbelief and polytheism and misguidance. Especially in these days because you know that the Jews and the Christians, even if they are misguided because of their going astray firstly from Tawheed which has reached them from their Prophets and again because of their denial of our Prophet (peace be upon him) they with that used to be upon something of good manners and good character and so on. And he who is in my age group or close to it, he knows that the women of the Christians in the lands of Islaam, they used to cover with a covering better than many of the Muslim women today. The meaning of this statement is that the people of the book, sinfulness and immorality and nudity was not widespread amongst them the widespread way that the people of intellect, if there are people of intellect amongst them from the disbelievers, complain about in their lands. So because of that how can it be permissible for a Muslim to expose himself to this society contaminated by immorality and this decadence? This is what I have in response to that question.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Later on in the tape Al-Imaam Al-Albaanee said: &#8220;Here is a Shubhah that must be mentioned on this occasion and it is a deceptive Shubhah that many of the youths are deceived by. They say: &#8216;Yaa Sheikh, by Allaah, we here, religious freedom is more than that in our country.&#8217; This from some angles is correct. However, I take them by surprise with the reality that they live in. I say to them: &#8216;Are you able to raise your voices with the Adhaan?&#8217; He says: &#8216;No.&#8217; I say: &#8216;Where is the freedom that you claim?&#8217; Then I remind them of the long term. You, if you are fleeing with your deen, you cling, to the lands of disbelief, is it possible for you to conceive that you will be able to set up an Islamic state where you are in America, in France, and so on, except after centuries and long centuries? Which of the two affairs is more likely, that you return to your countries and work together with your brothers there to establish the Islamic society and the Islamic lifestyle from which springs the establishment of the Islamic state and ruling by Islaam, or is it more likely over there? No, by Allaah, they say, in the lands of Islaam it is more likely. Because changing those lands of disbelief to the likes of what the situation is in the Islamic lands requires centuries. Therefore you are living in delusions. You say: &#8216;We live in freedom greater than the lands of Islaam.&#8217; This is a delusion and this is a fantasy. Yes you pray and you fast and so on, however, most of your fasting, most of your prayer is not in the legislated manner. Furthermore, put this regard aside, you hear from there problems which the youths are exposed to regarding marriage to some of the women of the people of the book, they claim, and having children afterwards, and the disputing when the woman divorces him, he did not divorce her, then his son or daughter remains with her not him and so on; Problems that we are constantly asked about. These don&#8217;t occur in the lands of Islaam. Due to that the reality which there is no doubt about is that it is not permissible for the Muslim today to live in the lands of disbelief. So if he is exiled from his land where he was born, it is allowed for him to move to another land from the lands of Islaam. This is what I recall or what I saw necessary to mention pertaining to examining this issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(A questioner): Yaa Sheikh, concerning this issue they mention something close to what you mentioned, a Shubhah that the lands have become similar in sinfulness and immorality, the lands of Islaam and the lands of disbelief, and the (Islamic) rulings are not being enforced. So what is your opinion?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): We have said beforehand regarding sinfulness and immorality, it is not permissible to compare the lands of Islaam to those lands. As for regarding the rulings, correct, sadly, many of the Islamic rulings have been rendered void and have been abandoned. However, Qiyaas here is Qiyaas with the existence of the distinguishing factor because the lands of Islaam many of the rulings still exist in it upon Islaam and at the very least upon some of the Islamic madhhabs. As for there, only the Qaanoon (the man made law) exists there which has judicial power over all of them. So this also is a distortion. They want by it to justify what they are upon from the residing that opposes the Sharee&#8217;ah. Furthermore I also say, and as it is said: the speech is connected together, our Lord says in the Noble Qur&#8217;aan: &#8216;And whoever amongst you takes them as friends then verily he is one of them.&#8217; (Al-Maa&#8217;idah: 51)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What do you think, the one who lives in a land of disbelief, is he having Muwaalaah (befriending, showing loyalty, supporting etc.) for that land or showing enmity to it? I want to hear the answer from the doctor to loosen up the atmosphere a little bit…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whichever Muslim travels to a land of disbelief, is he having Muwaalaah for this land and its rulers or is he showing enmity?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The doctor): No he is not having Muwaalaah, the land and its rulers and its government he is not having Muwaalaah for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): He is not having Muwaalaah? Is he showing enmity?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The doctor): He is averse, not showing enmity, yes showing enmity, however he perhaps does not do any act of enmity, however he is averse to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): He is averse?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The doctor): Yes</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): Then why does he take it as residence?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The doctor): Because of this need as you have mention.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): Na&#8217;am, in that case we say in response why… (A cut in the tape)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The doctor): Because of the need to resided there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): However the need must prove to be true.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The doctor): No, No. I am saying because of what you mentioned. The answer to your question is what you previously mentioned. The answer to your question is the Muslim who resides in the lands of the disbelievers, is he having Muwaalaah for them or showing enmity to them. If you consider merely residing Muwaalaah this is another matter. If you are asking about the Muwaalaah of the heart, no the Muslim is not having Muwaalaah for them, normally, he resides but he is not having Muwaalaah for them. Meaning he does not love them, pardon me, he is averse to their ways.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): Pardon me, is Muwaalaah in the heart only or outwardly also?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The doctor): In the heart and outwardly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): You intended in the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The doctor): He is not having Muwaalaah for them. He is not pleased with what they are upon. He disapproves of that. He calls to the opposite of it. He does not implement it upon himself. Meaning Muwaalaah is not materialized. I don&#8217;t see it to be materialized. He remaining amongst them is forbidden. This is a matter. As for Muwaalaah, it is not clear that he is having Muwaalaah. It is possible that he reside amongst a people while he is averse to them, averse to what they are upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): Tayyib. He does not assist them, Yaa Ustaadh?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The doctor): Yes he assists in the general way of life in the dunyaa. Is this from Muwaalaah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): Isn&#8217;t he upon their Qawaaneen (man made laws)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The doctor): Yes they rule him by it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): Tayyib. How is Muwaalaah? Muwaalaah is forbidden. How is it done?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The doctor): Even in the lands of the Muslims we rule by un-Islamic laws.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): pardon me, now let us finish with over there then we can come back to the lands of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The doctor): He firstly is residing with them. They themselves have the ability with the rule of law. They implement it, he carries it out. He is not able to avoid it, even if some avoid some things however he carries out most of it. However the laws of disbelief being implemented upon him, it is forced upon him. Is this Muwaalaah? This is a question that applies even to the lands of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): No, No. It does not apply. Baarakallaah feek. However, I don&#8217;t know this jump, is it analogical, from the land of disbelief to the lands of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The doctor): No, it is a jump, the jump Yaa Sheikh is because of an answer to the question. Is merely their laws being applied on them, the laws are applied so he complies with them upon these laws. Is this Muwaalaah? The answer, yes their laws are applied on him. This is the answer to the question. Is this Muwaalaah? You mentioned that this is Muwaalaah. So I say if this is Muwaalaah then all of us in all lands, un-Islamic laws are applied on us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): They are not the same. Baarakallaah feek. I am going to say to you now as long as you continue to use Qiyaas. I say to you there is a very big difference. The Muslim he must have an abode, a place of shelter. He must have that. So he must have a land for this shelter, and this land it must either be a land, I don&#8217;t say Islamic now, let it be more specific than that beforehand, its residents are Muslims or another land its residents are disbelievers. So he chose to reside in the second land not the first, and another chose to reside in the first land. Is the example of the two the same?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The doctor): No they are not the same.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): Baarakallaah feek. That is what was thought. Because of that your Qiyaas of the land of disbelief with the Muslim land does not stand straight. Because the Muslim he must have as I have brought beforehand a place of shelter that he uses for shelter. Therefore, either this place of shelter of his is in a Muslim land or in a land of disbelief. So when he resides in a Muslim land, we say here going along with you, this one is forced to comply with this land in its rulings. However, I have said beforehand there is a difference between the rulings that are applied in the lands of Islaam and the rulings which are applied in the lands of disbelief even if it is five percent, ten percent whatever percentage. What is important is there is a difference. So this one who must have a place of residence and a residency, he is forced to live under these rulings. However, there is another difference. Now I bring forth for you an example for this land and that land. Regarding car insurance, in it as you know there are two types of insurance, compulsory insurance and voluntary insurance. Good, in some land he is forced to have the two types of insurance while in another land he is forced to have one type of insurance. The two lands in good and evil are similar, there is absolutely no difference, to bring the issue closer to comprehension. The Muslim chose the land in which the two types of insurance are forced on him. Is it said that this one is like the first one?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The doctor): No, he is not like that one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): Therefore, Baarakallaah feek, it is necessary that the Muslim always takes into consideration that there is a difference. Let me mention an example, Muwaalaah, there is a difference in Muwaalaah. Muwaalaah is a must, like the Muslim who resides in the lands of Islaam and he pays many, many taxes and sales taxes. This one is excused. Where is he to go? Here it is not said to him: &#8216;Was not the earth of Allaah spacious enough for you to emigrate therein&#8217; (An-Nisaa: 97)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for that person who rules with a Qaanoon from beginning to end, he is a Kaafir, and every day, without exaggeration, at every interval changes enter it because it is from that which man has produced. The Qaanoon in the lands of Islaam is not like this in farness from Islaam. There is a difference in it be it small or large, this is not our subject. Therefore, we go along with you, the Muslim in the land of Islaam is having Muwaalaah, however, he is not able to do anything except this. This Muwaalaah is outward and it is not in the heart. As for there, it is in the heart and outward because he is able to escape from that by living in the lands of Islaam being forced to the likes of this bodily Muwaalaah not Muwaalaah of the heart. I hope that these matters are taken into consideration because the reality helps us to make the Muslims understand the Islamic rulings and so that they return to increasing the masses of their nation inside their land instead of increasing the masses of the disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I put forth a very simple example. The Muslim in the lands of Islaam, Allaahu Akbar&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(I think there was a pause for the Adhaan)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps you recall with me a hadeeth in the Sunan of Abu Dawud and others. A man entered and said: &#8216;As-Salaamu Alaikum.&#8217; So he (peace be upon him) said: &#8216;Ten.&#8217; A second man entered: &#8216;As-Salaamu Alaikum wa Rahmatullah.&#8217; &#8216;Twenty.&#8217; A third man entered. He said: &#8216;As-Salaamu Alaikum wa Rahmatullah wa Barakaatuh.&#8217; He said: &#8216;Thirty.&#8217; They said: &#8216;O Messenger of Allaah, so and so entered so you said ten,&#8217; to the end. He said: &#8216;The first said As-Salaamu Alaikum so ten good deeds were recorded for him. The second added so twenty were recorded for him. The third, thirty. These good deeds that the Muslim acquires in the lands of Islaam, does he acquire them there? What do you think?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The doctor): No.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): This is a very small example. So now I say to you, another example very small. This example differs from one Muslim land to another Muslim land, rather, from a Muslim locality to another Muslim locality in the same land, from a Muslim locality to another Muslim locality, rather, from house to house. Is there something more reduced than this? Is there something smaller than this? There is not. How is this? A Muslim land, however, and from it is this land, you say to him: &#8216;As-Salaamu Alaikum.&#8217; He says to you: &#8216;Marhabaa.&#8217; &#8216;When you are greeted with a greeting, greet in return with what is better than it or return it…&#8217; (An-Nisaa: 86)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is not raised in an Islamic manner. I am coming closer home a little bit with some small examples. As-Salaamu Alaikum, wa Alaikum As-Salaam. However, in the smallest example he entered and said: &#8216;As-Salaamu Alaikum.&#8217; He left and said: &#8216;As-Salaamu Alaikum&#8217; going about and automatically good deeds are recorded one after another. Allaah knows best from twenty four hours how much the total of these good deeds is. Why? Because he lives in a Muslim Salafee atmosphere. He knows his (peace be upon him) statement: &#8216;When one of you enters a sitting then let him give Salaams, and when he leaves let him give Salaams, for the first does not have more right than the second.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This and other than it from the many examples that we have brought home to you the reality which we seek. It is not possible for you to see it in the lands of disbelief, never. And because of that we ask Allaah عز و جل to inspire our Muslim youths to return to the land of Islaam and that they learn the rulings of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah of the Messenger (peace be upon him) upon the methodology of As-Salaf As-Saalih and that they educate themselves and those they are close with upon this pure Islaam. And perhaps this much is enough inshaallaah. And all praise is due to Allaah Lord of all that exists.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Q&amp;A Section of <i>Sharh Sitta Mawaadi&#8217; min as-Seerah</i> (pg. 67-68)<br />
Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Question: </b>Is Hijrah still applicable in this time of ours? And if it is, there must be a place of residence and provision for it. And it is not possible to achieve this…</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer: </b>Hijrah will remain in effect. The Messenger said: <b>“Hijrah will not cease until repentance ceases. And repentance will not cease until the sun rises from its place of setting (i.e. the west).”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hijrah is still in effect. So if a person is not able to establish his Religion in one area, he should go to another area where he will be able to establish his Religion along with the Muslims. And if he feels that he is not able to go to the lands of the Muslims, he should go to those lands in which he will be able to establish his Religion even if the country he goes to is a Land of Kufr (Disbelief). This is since some types of evil are less harmful than other types.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Companions migrated to Abyssinia – which consisted of Christians – since there they were able to establish their Religion and be safe from the harms of the pagan Arabs (of Makkah). Allaah says: <b>“So fear Allaah as much as you are able to.”</b> [Surah At-Taghaabun: 16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if there is a country in which there exists a Muslim minority or perhaps many Muslims, he should go there and be with them – even if it is a country of disbelievers. If he is not able to go to one of the lands of the Muslims, he should look to minimize evil (from himself) however much he is able to.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">His explanation of </span><i style="line-height:1.5em;">Thalathat-ul-Usool<br />
</i><i>Al-Ibaanah.com</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his explanation of <b>“The Three Fundamental Principles”</b> of Imaam Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab, Shaikh Ahmad An-Najmee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The definition of Hijrah is: To abandon the Land of Shirk, i.e. to leave it, and to come to a Land of Islaam. This is since the word Hijrah is derived from the root hajr which means to abandon or leave off. The Muslims were commanded to abandon the Land of Shirk and go to the Land of Islaam. The ruling on Hijrah is that it is obligatory for the one who is able to do it. This is why Allaah informs us that there will be a group of people whom the angels will take in death while they are wronging themselves due to their lack of migrating and their preferring the Land of Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says: <b>“Verily, as for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves (by not performing Hijrah), they (angels) will say (to them): ‘In what (condition) were you?’ They will reply: ‘We were weak and oppressed in the earth.’ They (angels) will say: ‘Was not the earth of Allaah spacious enough for you to migrate therein?’ Such men will find their abode in Hell – what an evil destination! Except the weak ones among men, women and children – who cannot devise a plan, nor are they able to direct their way. These are the ones whom Allaah is (most) likely to forgive, and Allaah is Ever Oft-Pardoning, Most Forgiving.”</b> [Surah An-Nisaa: 97-99]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says: <b>“O My servants who believe (in Me)! Verily, My earth is spacious so to Me alone, perform your worship.”</b> [Surah Al-‘Ankaboot: 56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Baghawee, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “The reason for the revelation of this ayah was due to some Muslims who had resided in Makkah and did not migrate (to Madeenah). Allaah called out to them using the title of Eemaan (for them).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We derive from these verses that Hijrah is obligatory on the one who is able to do it, which requires him to move from a Land of Disbelief to a Land of Islaam. This is since in a Land of Disbelief, the believer is exposed to harm and the government will be against him as opposed to in his favor. Even though he may be safe from harm, he will still not be safe from having to seek judgement in laws that are not from Allaah’s Legislation, such as man-made laws, which they use to govern the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, Hijrah in our present time must only be done with the permission from the country that one is migrating to. So if the country refuses to accept this emigrant, then he has no ability or power in the matter except by Allaah’s leave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Things used to be easy (in the old days). But as for today, there is difficulty in Hijrah either from the side of the country that one is migrating from or from the side of the country that one is migrating to. So whoever is able to make Hijrah, with ease and no difficulty, to a Land of Islaam, then such a person is obligated to do that. Furthermore, some of the Muslim countries today apply strict measures against those who adhere to the Religion of Allaah in everything that he brings and leaves behind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In summary, any Muslim that lives in a country, which the disbelievers rule based on man-made laws, must migrate from it if he is easily able to do it. And if it is not easy for him, then according to what is apparent (from the texts), he is excused due to Allaah’s saying: <b>“Allaah does not burden a soul with more than it can handle.”</b> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 286]. And with Allaah lies the success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[Q.1]: How can we make <i>hijrah</i> (migration) for the sake of Allaah nowadays?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A.1]: </b>The praise is for Allaah.  <i>Hijrah</i> (migration) for the sake of Allaah means moving from the land of <i>Shirk </i>to the land of Islaam, as the Muslims moved from Makkah before its people became Muslim to al-Madeenah, because it had become the city of Islaam after its people had pledged their allegiance (<i>bay’ah</i>) to the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) and asked him to make <i>hijrah</i> to them. So <i>Hijrah</i> means migrating to join other Muslims. <i>Hijrah</i> may also take the form of moving from one land of <i>Shirk</i> to another land of <i>Shirk</i> where evil is less prevalent and there is less danger to the Muslims, as when some of the Muslims migrated from Makkah, at the command of the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>), to Abyssinia (Ethiopia).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah is the Source of Strength.  May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his Family and his Companions, and grant them peace. [1]<i></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[Q.2]: What are the necessary qualities that must be present in a country for it to be regarded as <i>daarul-harb</i> (land of war) or <i>daarul-kufr</i> (land of disbelief)?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A.2]: </b>The Praise is for Allaah Every land or region in which the rulers and those in authority uphold the limits set by Allaah and they rule their people in accordance with Islaamic <i>Sharee’ah</i>, and the people are able to carry out what Islaam has enjoined upon them, is considered to be <i>Daarul-Islaam</i> (the land of Islaam).  The Muslims in such lands have to obey their rulers with regard to that which is right (<i>ma’roof</i>) and be sincere towards them, helping them to take care of the affairs of state and giving them moral and practical support. They should live there, and not go to live anywhere else except to another place which is under Islaamic rule where they may be better off. This is like the case of al-Madeenah after the <i>Hijrah</i> of the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>), when the Islaamic state was established there, and like Makkah after the Conquest, when the Muslims took power there and it became <i>Daarul-Islaam</i> after it had been <i>daarul-harb</i> and it had been obligatory for the Muslims there who were able to leave, to migrate from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every country or region in which the rulers and those in authority do not uphold the limits set by Allaah and do not govern those who are under their care by the rules of Islaam, and in which the Muslims are not able to establish the rituals of Islaam, is <i>daarul-kufr</i> (the land of kufr). This is like Makkatul-Mukarramah before the Conquest, when it was <i>daarul-kufr</i>.  The same applies to any land in which the people belong to the religion of Islaam, but those who are in authority govern by laws other than those revealed by Allaah, and the Muslims are not able to establish the rituals of their Religion.  They have to migrate from that place, fleeing so that their religious commitment will not be compromised, to a land which is ruled by Islaam and where they will be able to do that which is required of them by <i>Sharee’ah</i>. Whoever is unable to migrate men, women or children will be excused, but Muslims in other lands are obliged to save them and bring them from the <i>kaafir</i> lands to the Muslim land. Allaah the Exalted says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<b>Verily, as for those whom the angels take </b>(in death)<b> while they are wronging themselves </b>(as they stayed among the disbelievers even though emigration was obligatory for them)<b>, they </b>(angels)<b> say </b>(to them)<b>: In what </b>(condition)<b> were you? They reply: We were weak and oppressed on the earth. They </b>(angels)<b> say: Was not the earth of Allaah spacious enough for you to emigrate therein? Such men will find their abode in Hell what an evil destination! Except the weak ones among men, women and children who cannot devise a plan, nor are they able to direct their way. These are they whom Allaah is likely to forgive them, and Allaah is Ever Oft Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving.</b>” [Sooratun-Nisaa‘ 4:97-99]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<b>And what is wrong with you that you fight not in the Cause of Allaah, and for those weak, ill-treated and oppressed among men, women, and children, whose cry is: Our Lord! Rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors; and raise for us from You one who will protect, and raise for us from You one who will help.</b>” [Sooratun-Nisaa‘ 4:75]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But whoever is able to establish the rituals of Islam within his family and establish evidence against the rulers and people in authority, and bring about reform, making them change their ways, then it is prescribed for him to stay among them, because there is the hope that by staying there he may be able to convey the message and reform them so long as he is safe from temptation and <i>fitnah</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah is the source of strength. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.</p>

<p>This is a very important Q&amp;A concerning Hijrah to the west due to some kind of persecution.</p>
<p>Answered by Shaykh Rabee&#8217; Al-Madkhalee (hafithahuAllah)</p>
<p>We can see from his answer to the questioned put to our Shaykh Rabee (hafithahuAllah), that the Ulamaa have serious insight of what the west are up to regarding us.</p>
<p>Many Muslims make excuses for there brothers and sisters for being here in the west, Insha&#8217;allaah it&#8217;s time for us to advised our friends and families and our self&#8217;s to leave this place.</p>
<p>May Allaah give us the strength and the ability to leave the west, from all it&#8217;s dangers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Shaykh Rabee&#8217; on Hijrah to Britain</strong><br />
Question about Escaping to the West answered by Shaykh Rabee&#8217; Al-Madkhalee may Allaah preserve him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On more than one occasion, Shaykh Rabee&#8217; has made the points translated below. In fact, he says these things every time he is asked about migrating to the West and living there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"> May Allaah be benevolent to you; here is a question from the Salafi youth in Britain. They are asking about the ruling on residing in the lands of the unbelievers in order to escape the injustice of rulers in some Muslim countries. [They also ask about] the ruling on taking a British nationality.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah knows best, 90% of those who go to Europe and America go there not because any government is chasing them, not because of anything [like this]. Even if a government is trying to pursue [a Muslim], he should be patient and endure. When Ahmad b. Hanbal was tortured, did he go off to the lands of unbelief? I ask you: Ahmad b. Hanbal and others, then Ibn Taymiyah, when [the rulers] harmed them incessantly and imprisoned them, did they flee to the lands of unbelief? Allaah bless you, he should be patient, he should live in his own country, even in prison, it is better for him than going to Europe and America, especially since these [countries] have measures and policies to recruit Muslims into their societies, to Christianize them and convert them to atheists and heretics (zanaadiqah). These are old strategies which they are applying now and many corrupt preachers and corrupt scholars are striving to recruit Muslims into European societies now.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So why go to these countries? Why not be patient even if the government [of the Muslim country] pursues you, be patient, it is better for you. Many people go [to other counties] without being pursued. <span style="color:#ff0000;">They go to eat and drink and serve the Jews and Christians in their countries, degrading themselves and Islam</span>. Allaah bless you, He has promised he will provide your sustenance, whoever fears Allaah and obeys Him, He will make a way out for him and sustain him from where he would not imagine (Quran 65: 3). All you have to do is fear Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and obey Him (practice taqwaa) and your provision will come from places you would not imagine. A person never dies until he has fulfilled everything that was written for him. <span style="color:#993300;">But Shaytan beautifies for him the idea of going to the West, so he can live there the life of cattle, first in derision and meekness, and then in tribulation and danger surrounding him and his family</span>. When your child is six years old, where will he study? He will study in the schools of the Jews, atheists, secularists and Christians, and they will teach him their way of life, and they will not distinguish [between Muslims and non-Muslims] in this regard, may Allaah bless you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Adopting an unbelieving foreign nationality instead of an Islamic one has been declared an act of Kufr by some scholars. A person does not take this nationality except after becoming prepared by submitting to the laws of these countries and aligning his loyalty to them and his enmity for those who go against them. He might also be prepared by fighting [for them]. If the Islamic army approached the unbelievers land, he [would have to] face the Islamic army because he has become a soldier for the enemies of Allaah and is prepared. They might enlist and prepare him to fight the Muslims in their own lands, as has occurred in Afghanistan. They recruited Muslims to fight the Afghans and a fatwa (religious edict) was issued by some corrupt scholars stating it is allowed for [a Muslim] to fight the Muslims to confirm his nationality and his allegiance to America. This is the fatwaa of <strong>Al-Qardawi</strong>, who occupies a great status amongst Muslims due to this fatw?. All?h bless you, how many evil corrupt edicts there are! We ask All?h for protection and wellbeing!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Right now, measures are being taken in the West to achieve these goals: to recruit Muslims into Western societies. How can you go there in these circumstances? It is obligatory upon Muslims to migrate [back] to their lands when they hear of these actions and attempts to integrate and merge them into the Western societies.</p>
