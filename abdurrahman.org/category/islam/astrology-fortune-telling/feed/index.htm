<p class="has-text-align-center">CHAPTER No: 25</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>بيان شيء من أنواع السحر</strong></span></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Clarification of types of Sorcery (As-Sihr)</strong></span></p>



<p>Imam Ahmad (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Muhammad bin Ja&#8217;far narrated from Auf, from Haiyan bin Al- `Ala&#8217;, from Qatan bin Qabisah, from his father that he heard the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) say:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إن العيافة والطرق والطيرة من الجبت</strong></span></h2>



<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Verily, Al-Iyafah (letting birds fly to foretell events) and At-Tarq (drawing lines on earth to predict events) and At-Tiyarah (taking sight on some object as a bad omen) are Al-Jibt (sorceries/magic).&#8221;</strong></span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">`Auf (رضي الله عنه) said,</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>العيافة: زجر الطير، والطرق: الخط يخط بالأرض والجبت</strong></span></h2>



<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Al-&#8216;Iyafah is letting a bird&#8217;s flight foretell events while At-Tarq is drawing line on earth.&#8221;</span></strong></p>



<p>Hasan Basri (May Allah be pleased with him) said,</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>والجبت </strong><strong>رنة الشيطان</strong></span></h2>



<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Al- Jibt is the scream of Satan (devil).&#8221;</span></strong></p>



<p>The above Hadith has been narrated through good chain of narrators and collected by Abu Dawud, An-Nasa&#8217;i and Ibn Hibban.</p>



<p>Abu Dawud reported in his book with Sahih lsnad that Ibn Abbas (رضي الله عنه) narrated that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) said:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>من اقتبس شعبة من النجوم، فقد اقتبس شعبة من السحر، زاد ما زاد</strong></span></h2>



<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Whoever learns a part of astrology (drawing knowledge from stars) has learned a part of sorcery (magic). Those who learn more are getting that much more (sin to their credit).&#8221;</span></strong></p>



<p>In An-Nasa&#8217;i, Abu Hurairah (رضي الله عنه) is reported to have said:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>من عقد عقدة ثم نفث فيها فقد سحر، ومن سحر فقد أشرك، ومن تعلق شيئاً وكل إليه</strong></span></h2>



<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Whoever tied a knot and blew on it, has committed sorcery and whoever committed sorcery has committed Shirk. Whoever wears an amulet or talisman will be subjected to its control.&#8221;</span></strong></p>



<p>Ibn Mas&#8217;ud (رضي الله عنه) is reported to have heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) saying:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>ألا هل أنبئكم ما الغضة؟ هي النميمة، القالة بين الناس</strong></span></h2>



<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Shall I not tell you what Al-&#8216;Adh (literally: lying, sorcery etc.) is? It is conveying false rumors for the purpose of causing disputes between people.&#8221;</span> </strong>(Muslim)</p>



<p>Both Sahih collectors reported from Ibn Umar (رضي الله عنه) that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) said:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إن من البيان لسحراً</strong></span></h2>



<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Some eloquence can be (so beautiful that it constitutes) sorcery.”</span></strong></p>



<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Important issues of the Chapter</span></strong></p>



<p>1) Al-&#8216;Iyafah, At-Tarq, At-Tiyarah are three kinds of Al-Jibt (sorcery/magic).<br />2) Al-&#8216;Iyafah, and At-Tarq are explained.<br />3) Astrology too is a kind of sorcery.<br />4) Tying knots and blowing over them is also sorcery.<br />5) An-Namimah (tale bearing, backbiting) is also a form of sorcery.<br />6) Talking sometimes superfluously and eloquently can too be sorcery.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 69 : Point 115</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Look into the stars sparingly, just enough to help you to know the times of the prayer. And turn away from whatever besides that, since it invites to apostasy </strong></span></p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani: The Prophet (ﷺ) led us in the Fajr prayer at Hudaibiya after a rainy night. On completion of the prayer, he faced the people and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Do you know what your Lord has said (revealed)?</strong></span>&#8221; The people replied, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Allah has said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8216;In this morning some of my slaves remained as true believers and some became non-believers; whoever said that the rain was due to the Blessings and the Mercy of Allah had belief in Me and he disbelieves in the stars, and whoever said that it rained because of a particular star had no belief in Me but believes in that star.&#8217; &#8220;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Bukhari] [Muhsin Khan&#8217;s Translation]</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qatadah (<em>radi Allaahu anhu</em>) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>&#8220;These stars were only created for three purposes: Allah created them as adornment for the heaven </strong>(sky)<strong>, as missiles for the devils and as signs for navigation. Therefore, whoever seeks to interpret any other meanings for them other than these, then verily he has spoken with his own opinion, he has lost his portion and burdened himself with that which he has no knowledge of.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim both recorded this statement.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1 &#8211; Reading Star Signs</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Salih Alaa ash &#8211; Shaykh -hafidhullaah- said :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Whoever reads the page which contains star signs and he knows the star sign of when he was born, or he knows that star sign which is significant for him, and he reads the comments mentioned in that star sign then it is as if he has asked a soothsayer/fortune teller. So his prayer would not be accepted for forty days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he attests to it and believes in that star sign then he has disbelieved in that which was revealed to Muhammad &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- . . .&#8217; (the Shaykh continues saying: ) &#8216;and if he brings home newspapers which contain these type of things then it is as if he brought a soothsayer / fortune teller into his house.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Tamheed Sharh Kitaab al Tawheed p. 349 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2 &#8211; Watching Magical Acrobatic Stunts &amp; Circus Antics </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzaan -hafidhullaah- said :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;It is not permissible to use magic in the form of acrobatic stunts or circus antics or anything similar to that. Like the one who pulls a car with his hair, or a car is driven over him and does not harm him. . . . . all of this is magical imagery, so it is not allowed to perform it or to be happy with it, nor to attract your friends to do this in front of Muslims. Because it is clear evil, it is obligatory to reject and terminate it and to cleanse the Muslim lands of it . . . if those who go to see magic in the form of acrobatic stunts even though they are not pleased with going to see them, they have carried out something which is prohibited and they are sinful for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If they are pleased with this and they know that this is done by magic then they have fallen into disbelief because of it.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Daroos fee sharh Nawaqid al Islaam p. 152-156]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3 &#8211; Wearing an Engagement Ring</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This enters under the saying of the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8216;Indeed incantations, amulets and Tiwalah [1] (a form of magic) are Shirk.&#8217;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Ahmad and Abu Dawood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Uthaymeen -rahimullaah &#8211; gave the example that an engagement ring is a Tiwalah and he explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;If the people believe that it can benefit or harm, then with this intention it is from the minor Shirk, and even if this intention is not there &#8211; and this is highly unlikely that he does not have this intention &#8211; it is resemblance of the Christians since it is taken from them.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Qawl al-Mufeed ala Kitaab al Tawheed 1 /228-229]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4 &#8211; Wearing Brass Bracelets to Battle Against Rheumatism</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh AbdulAziz Ibn Baz &#8211; rahimullaah &#8211; said regarding these type of bracelets after having exhausted all the evidences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;The opinion which I hold in this issue is leaving these previously mentioned bracelets and not to use them; this is to block the path leading to Shirk, to terminate the aspect of any Fitnah with these bracelets and to incline to them, also that souls become attached to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, in having the incentive in turning the Muslim with his heart to Allaah -Subhanahu- and to have trust in Him, and reliance on Him sufficing with the means which are in accordance with the Sharia&#8217; and their allowance is well known with committing Shirk.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Majmoo&#8217; Fatawa ash-Shaykh Ibn Baaz vol.1 p.207]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwa no. 17727</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Some Arab newspapers and magazines dedicate pages to the horoscope, talking about zodiac signs such as Aries, Taurus, Gemini and others. They claim that people born under these signs will probably be moody because the zodiac conflicts a lot during this period. There are many things written in these pages, a copy of which is attached to the message and many Muslim youth read them. Please clarify the Islamic ruling on zodiac signs and your advice to Muslims and to those responsible for the magazines.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This is considered the same as <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>divination</strong> </span>used by fortune-tellers to inform people if they will be happy or miserable and if they should be optimistic or pessimistic. This is a prohibited idea dating back to the days of Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic time of ignorance). It is not permissible to practice, follow or spread these ideas. It is even more misleading and misguiding to Muslims to spread such ideas in newspapers, as they involve claiming to know Ghayb (the Unseen), which is the sole Right of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) Who says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Say</strong>: &#8220;<strong>None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghaib (Unseen) except Allâh, nor can they perceive when they shall be resurrected</strong>.&#8221; <span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Al-Naml, 27: 65]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah also says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And with Him are the keys of the Ghaib (all that is hidden), none knows them but He. And He knows whatever there is in the land and in the sea; not a leaf falls, but he knows it. There is not a grain in the darkness of the earth nor anything fresh or dry, but is written in a Clear Record.&#8221; </strong><span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Al-An`am, 6: 59]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah even denied that His Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him) knew the Ghayb. <span style="line-height:1.5;">Allah says, </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="line-height:1.5;">&#8220;Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): </span>I don’t tell you that with me are the treasures of Allâh, nor (that) I know the Unseen; nor I tell you that I am an angel. I but follow what is revealed to me.</strong>&#8221; <strong>Say</strong>: &#8220;<strong>Are the blind and the one who sees equal? Will you not then take thought?</strong>&#8221; <span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Al-An`am, 6: 50]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And I do not say to you that with me are the Treasures of Allâh, nor that I know the Ghaib (Unseen), nor do I say I am an angel, and I do not say of those whom your eyes look down upon that Allâh will not bestow any good on them. Allâh knows what is in their inner-selves (as regards belief, etc.). In that case, I should, indeed be one of the Zâlimûn (wrong-doers, oppressors).&#8221;</strong> <span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Hud, 11: 31]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Anyone who acquires a branch of the knowledge of astrology has acquired a branch of magic (of which they acquire more as long as) they continue to do so.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) and Hadiths in this regard. Muslim scholars unanimously agree on this well-established ruling prohibiting astrology.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Thus, it is the duty of every Muslim seeking the best for themselves and their religion to avoid this form of manipulating people&#8217;s minds and beliefs, to fear Allah regarding themselves and their nation and not to spread misleading ideas among Muslims</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>On the other hand, Muslim rulers (may Allah grant them success) should prevent this practice and punish those who spread it according to the Islamic prescribed punishment.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Question 32: </span></strong><strong>What is Soothsaying?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Answer by Shaykh Uthaymeen:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Soothsaying or <strong>divination</strong> (<strong>Kihaanah</strong>) is of the measure Fi’aalah and it is derived from <strong>al-Kahn</strong> which means speaking falsely, and searching for the facts in ways that are completely unfounded. This was the practice of some people during the pre-Islamic era (<strong>al-Jaahiliyyah</strong>) and with whom the Shayaateen (the devils) established contact, relating to them the hearing [57] they (the devils) steal from the heaven. Those receiving the hearing take each word and add to it whatever they want from the words of falsehood, then they impart it to the people. If the matter occurs exactly as they said, people will be deceived by them and will take them as authority to which they turn to for judgement and for predicting the future events. That is why we say that the soothsayer is the one who informs about the hidden matters in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one <strong>who visits a soothsayer</strong>, then he may be classified into one of the following three categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>First</strong></span>: He visits the soothsayer then he<strong><span style="color:#000000;"> asks him without believing him</span></strong>. Then this is legally forbidden, and the punishment assigned to the one who does this is such that prayers extending to forty days will not be accepted from him, as affirmed in the report collected in Saheeh Muslim and in which the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: “<strong><span style="color:#008000;">He who goes to a diviner (soothsayer) and asks him about anything, his prayers extending to forty days or nights will not be accepted.”</span></strong> [58]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Second</strong></span>: He goes to a Kaahin (soothsayer) and <strong><span style="color:#000000;">asks him about anything and believes him in what he tells</span></strong>. This is disbelief in Allaah (Azza wa Jal), because he believed him in his claim of knowing of al-Ghayeb (the hidden andunseen).[59] Believing men in their claim of knowing al-Ghayeb is a denial of the Saying of Allaah, The Most High: <span style="color:#008000;">“<strong>None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghayeb (unperceived realities) except Allaah</strong></span>.” [Qur’aan, soorat an-Naml (27):65].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And denying what Allaah and His Messenger inform of is Kufr (unbelief). That is why it is mentioned in the authentic transmission:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Whoever goes to a diviner, and believes what he says then he has indeed disbelieved in what was sent down upon Muhammad</span></strong>.” [60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Third</strong></span>: He goes to the fortune-teller and <strong><span style="color:#000000;">asks him about anything in order to expose his situation to the people</span></strong>, and that what he does is merely divination, distortion and misguidance. There is no harm in this. The proof for it is that when the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) encountered<strong> ibn Sayyad</strong> (who claimed prophethood), he (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) concealed something for him within himself (to test him), and when he (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) asked him about what he (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) concealed for him, he said: “It is a Dukh intending AdDukhaan (smoke).” Thereupon the Prophet ((Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam)) said: “May you be disgraced and dishonoured, you would not be able to go beyond your rank.” [61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the conditions of those who go to a diviner, and they are three.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first is that he goes to him not believing in him, nor intending to test and expose him, and this is unlawful. The applicable punishment upon the one who does this is that his prayers will not be accepted from him for forty days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second is that he asks him about anything, and believes him. This is unbelief in Allah (Azza wa Jal). It is obligatory upon the person who does this to repent from it, and to return to Allaah (Azza wa Jal). Otherwise, he dies on a state of unbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third situation is such that he goes to the diviner and asks him in order to test him, and expose his reality to the people. In this there is no harm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Ruling Regarding Those Who go to Diviners</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Question 33:</strong> It would be nice if we could know of the status of people who go to fortune-tellers.</p>
<p><strong>The Answer:</strong> Their situations are as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First Case:</strong> A person goes to the diviner and asks him about anything without believing him, and in doing so he does not intend to expose his reality. Then the person is sinful, and the applicable punishment is that prayers will not be accepted from him for forty days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second Case:</strong> He goes to the fortune-teller and then he asks him and believes him. This person is an unbeliever because he denies the Saying of Allaah, The Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghayeb (unperceived realities) except Allaah.</span> [Qur’aan, soorat an-Naml (27): 65].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third Case:</strong> He goes to him and asks him in order to test him, and expose his status and his lies and falsifying to the people. And we have mentioned that there is no harm in this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is a determined matter that if a thing that is legally permissible leads to something forbidden, then itself becomes prohibited. So, if it is determined that in this third case whereby the person goes to the diviner to test him and expose his reality, and as such it may become a reason leading people to be deceived by him–then under such circumstances he should not do that and should not go to him, even if it were to be done for this good intention. Since the rule is that, whatever leads to something prohibited then it is itself, prohibited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>References</strong> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[57] The Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: “<span style="color:#008000;">While the angels talk over the clouds about things that are going to happen on the earth [in another narration: “they mention the affairs decreed in heavens”], the devils hear a word of what they say and pour it in the ears of the sooth-sayer as one pours something in a bottle, and they add one-hundred lies to that (one word).”</span> Reported in Saheeh al-Bukhaaree, vol.4, no.508.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[58] Reported by Mulsim. See Saheeh Muslim, vol.4, no.5540.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[60] Reported by At-Tirmithee, and Ibn Maajah. It was authenticated by Ahmad Shaakir and al-Albaanee (See al-Irwaa’ by al-Albaanee, no.2006).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[61] The story of Ibn Sayyaad, a diviner, is detailed in Saheeh Muslim (Book of Fitan), Saheeh al-Bukhaaree (Books of Janaa’iz, Jihaad and Siyar, alQadar, al-Adab, and others), At-Tirmithee (Book of Fitan) and by others. In it the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) exposed his claim of Prophethood through this test. He was not able to complete the word Dukhaan pertaining to soorat adDukhaan. The devils imparting the information to Ibn Sayyaad were not able to snatch the complete word, thus it came in this distorted form.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I never heard &#8216;Umar saying about something that he thought it would be so-and-so, but he was quite right.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once, while &#8216;Umar was sitting, a handsome man passed by him, &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;If I am not wrong, this person is still on his religion of the pre-lslamic period of ignorance or he was their foreteller. Call the man to me.&#8221; When the man was called to him, he told him of his thought. The man said, &#8220;I have never seen such a day on which a Muslim is faced with such an accusation.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I am determined that you should tell me the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>I was a foreteller in the pre-lslamic period of ignorance</strong>.</span>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Tell me the most astonishing thing your female Jinn has told you of</strong></span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;One-day while I was in the market, she came to me scared and said, &#8216;Haven&#8217;t you seen the Jinns and their despair and they were overthrown after their defeat (and prevented from listening to the news of the heaven) so that they (stopped going to the sky and) kept following camel-riders (i.e. &#8216;Arabs)?&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umar said, &#8220;He is right.&#8221; and added,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;One day while I was near their idols, there came a man with a calf and slaughtered it as a sacrifice (for the idols). An (unseen) creature shouted at him, and I have never heard harsher than his voice. He was crying, &#8216;O you bold evil-doer! A matter of success! An eloquent man is saying: None has the right to be worshipped except you (O Allah).&#8217; On that the people fled, but I said, &#8216;I shall not go away till I know what is behind this.&#8217; Then the cry came again: &#8216;O you bold evil-doer! A matter of success! An eloquent man is saying: None has the right to be worshipped except Allah.&#8217;</strong> <strong>I then went away and a few days later it was said, &#8220;A prophet has appeared.&#8221;</strong></span></p>

Prohibition of Attributing Rain to the Stars</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1731.</b> Zaid bin Khalid (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) led the Fajr prayer at Al-Hudaibiyyah after a rainfall during the night. At the conclusion of prayer, he turned towards the people and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do you know what your Rubb has said?</span>&#8221; They replied: &#8220;Allah and His Messenger know better.&#8221; Upon this he remarked, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He has said: `Some of My slaves have entered the morning as My believers and some as unbelievers. He who said: We have had a rainfall due to the Grace and Mercy of Allah, believes in Me and disbelieves in the stars; and he who said: We have had a rainfall due to the rising of such and such star, disbelieves in Me and affirms his faith in the stars.</span>&#8221;&#8217;<br />

Chapter 303<br />
Prohibition of Consultation with Soothsayers</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1668.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) said: Some people asked the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) about soothsayers. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">They are of no account</span>.&#8221; Upon this they said to him, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! But they sometimes make true predictions.&#8221; Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">That is a word pertaining to truth which a jinn snatches (from the angels) and whispers into the ears of his friend (the soothsayers) who will then mix more than a hundred lies with it</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narration in Al-Bukhari is: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The angels descend in the clouds and mention matters which has been decreed in heaven; Satan steals a hearing (listens to it stealthily) and communicates it to the soothsayers who tell along with it a hundred lies</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1669.</b> Narrated Safiyyah, daughter of Abu<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';"> `</span>Ubaid, on the authority of some of the wives of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) who said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who goes to one who claims to tell about matters of the Unseen and believes in him, his Salat (prayers) will not be accepted for forty days</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1670.</b> Qabisah bin Al-Mukhariq (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The practice of `Iyafah, the interpretation of omens from the flight of birds, the practice of divination by drawing lines on the ground and taking evil omens are all practices of Al-Jibt (the idol, the diviner, or sorcerer)</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1671.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who acquires a branch of the knowledge of astrology, learns a branch of magic (of which he acquires more as long as) he continues to do so</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1672.</b> Mu`awiyah bin Al-Hakam (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, I have recently emerged from ignorance and Allah has favoured me with Islam. There are still some men among us who visit the soothsayers to consult them (on matters relating to the future).&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do not visit them.</span>&#8221; I said: &#8220;There are some men who are guided by omens.&#8221; He replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">These are the ideas which come up in their minds but you should not be influenced by them (i.e., these things) should not prevent them from pursuing their works</span>.&#8221; I said: &#8220;There are some men who practise divination by drawing lines on the ground.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">There was a Prophet who drew lines, the line which agrees with the line drawn by that Prophet would be correct</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b></b><b>1673.</b> Abu Mas`ud Al-Badri (May Allah be pleased with him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) prohibited the price of a dog, the earning of an prostitute, and the money given to a soothsayer</span>.<br />

They would go out and come across the Jinn at night in trees and upon the roads and so on, and the devils would take over them. This is because they were ignorant. They didn’t have any understanding of Tawheed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">So when he (i.e. Shaikh Al-Qar’aawee) came and spread Tawheed<strong>, </strong>not ruqyah or anything else, may Allah bless you, all of these things came to an end. All of these (possessions and illnesses) came to an end once Tawheed and knowledge spread. When Tawheed and knowledge spread, these things go away and come to an end. And when ignorance becomes widespread, sorcerers, soothsayers, devils and so on increase and cooperate with one another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I advised him to do as the good doers in the past did, which was to call to Tawheed and wage war against shirk and false superstitions such that the devils left them and they had no need for people to perform ruqyah on them from devils, sorcerers or anyone else….”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]<strong>Translator’s Note:</strong>Shaikh Abdullah Al-Qar’aawee was born in 1315H in Saudi Arabia where he played a great role in reviving the call to Islaam, particularly in its southern regions, making Saamitah the center of his efforts. He studied under such Scholars as Shaikh Muhammad bin Ibtaheem, the former muftee of Saudi Arabia, and produced students of his own such as Shaikh Haafidh Al-Hakamee. He passed away in 1389H, may Allah have mercy on him.</p>
