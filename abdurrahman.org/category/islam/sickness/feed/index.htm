<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1- Muslims who will enter Jannah without being called to account</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: Is it true that some Muslims will enter Jannah (Paradise) without being called to account?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Yes, it is true, The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(<strong>&#8220;All the nations were shown to me, and I saw a prophet accompanied by a small group of his followers, another with two or three people of his followers and a third not accompanied by any follower.&#8221;</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At the end of the Hadith, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Among my Ummah there are seventy thousand who would enter Jannah without being brought to account or being punished.&#8221;</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) asked who these people were, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;They are those who do not seek Ruqyah (recitation for healing or protection); they are those who do not get themselves cauterized; and they are those who do not believe in bad omens; rather, they put their trust in their Lord.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hadith implies that the Mu&#8217;min (believer), who continues obeying Allah&#8217;s commands and avoiding His prohibitions until death, will enter Jannah without being held accountable for their deeds and without suffering punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Falling under this category are the Mu&#8217;mins who do not ask others to recite Ruqyah over them. There is nothing wrong, however, if they themselves are accustomed to reciting Ruqyahs over other Muslims. This is because one who recites Ruqyah basically does a good deed by asking Allah (Exalted be He) to cure the illness of the person for whom they recite the Ruqyah. This is based on the authentic Hadith in which the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Whosoever among you is able to benefit his fellow believer, let him do so.)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Istirqa</strong></span>&#8216; means to ask others to recite Ruqyah for you. For example, you may ask a person to recite Rygyah for you. It is better not to ask others for Ruqyah unless one happens to be suffering from an ailment, In this case, it is not wrong to ask others to recite Ruqyah. It has been reported that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) asked Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) saying: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Seek healing through asking for Ruqyah</span></strong>) The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) ordered her to treat herself by means of asking others for Ruqyah, He also ordered Asma’ bint Umays to recite Ruqyah to the children of Jafar when they were under the influence of the evil eye. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is also reported to have said: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There is no Ruqyah (reciting Qur&#8217;an and supplicating over the sick seeking healing) better than that which is said as a treatment for an evil eye or (a sting of) a venomous animal</strong></span>.&#8221; It is not wrong to seek treatment by means of Istirqa’ when necessary. However, it is better not to resort to such means if it is possible to cure oneself by means of some other kind of medicine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also better not to treat oneself by means of <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>cauterization</strong> </span>if another means of treatment is available. This is based on the Hadith in which the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The best of all remedies are three; cauterization, drinking honey, and cupping, yet I hate to be cauterized.</strong></span>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another version it states: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">..and I forbid my Ummah (nation) from cauterization.</span></strong>) This denotes that cauterization should be used as a last resort when all other means prove unsuccessful. It is better to seek treatment by other means if possible. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have cauterized some of his Sahabah. However, cauterization may only be resorted to when necessary. It is, however, better to apply another means of treatment like drinking honey, cupping, or reciting the Qur&#8217;an, The Prophet&#8217;s (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) statement: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They are those who do not seek Ruqyah; they are those who do not get themselves cauterized&#8230;</strong></span>) does not denote that seeking Ruqyah or cauterization are prohibited; rather, it denotes that one may resort to other means of treatment in preference to these kinds. However, if one is forced by necessity to seek Ruqyah or cauterization, there is nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“T<strong><span style="color:#008000;">hey are these who do not believe in bad omens</span></strong>&#8220;: Believing in the occurrence of evil omens, a custom practiced by the pre-Islamic Arabs, constitutes an act of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among the characteristics of the seventy thousand Muslims who will enter Jannah without being called to account is that they avoid the prohibited practice of believing in bad omens and the reprehensible practice of seeking Ruqyah and cauterization when there is no need for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The statement &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">They put their trust in their Lord</span></strong>,&#8221; means that such Muslims avoid these things because they put their trust in Allah (Exalted be He) and seek to attain His Pleasure. The statement implies that they steadfastly obedient to Allah (Exalted be He) and they avoid not only what He has declared as prohibited but also some of what He has declared as permissible if there is something better than it. By doing so, they hope for Allah&#8217;s Reward and fear His Punishment. They draw near to Him through doing deeds that He loves and do so with their hearts filled with trust and confidence in Him (Glorified and Exalted be He),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to another similar Hadith, it was stated: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">An extra number of seventy thousand Muslims will enter Jannah with every thousand&#8230;)</span></strong> According to another Hadith: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allah promised to increase the number by as many as three Handfuls added by my Lord, Glorified be He.</span></strong>) This increase in number is known to none but Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To summarize, every upright Mu&#8217;min who avoids Allah&#8217;s Prohibitions and does not allow themselves to go beyond the limits set by Allah (Exalted be He) will be counted among the seventy thousand Muslims who will enter Jannah without Allah calling them to account or consigning them to punishment.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said that seventy thousand Muslims will enter Jannah without being called to account and without suffering punishment. When the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) inquired about their characteristics, the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) told them that they are those who do not seek Ruqyah, those who do not get themselves cauterized, and those who do not believe in bad omen. We ask Your Eminence to clarify these characteristics so that we may develop them.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said that <strong><span style="color:#008000;">seventy thousand people of his Ummah (nation) will enter Jannah without being called to account and without suffering punishment.</span></strong> In another Hadith, it was stated: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">An extra number of seventy thousand Muslims will enter Jannah with every thousand.,.</span></strong>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) was asked about their characteristics, he said: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">They are those who do not seek Ruqyah from others, those who do not get themselves cauterized, and those who do not believe in bad omens; rather, they put their trust in their Lord.</span></strong>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hadith refers to pious and faithful Muslims who adhere steadfastly to Allah&#8217;s Din (religion), those who worship Allah Alone, those who fulfill their religious duties, those who avoid His Prohibitions and strive hard to do good to the point that they decline to do what is permissible, yet undesirable, like seeking Ruqyah and cauterization. This perfects their Iman (faith). They do not ask others to make Ruqyah for them nor do they get themselves cauterized. It is better not to resort to seeking Ruqyah or cauterization unless under necessity. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) ordered ‘Aishah to treat herself by means of seeking Ruqyah. He also ordered Asma’ bint Umays to treat her children by means of seeking Ruqyah when they were under the influence of the evil eye. This indicates that seeking Ruqyah is permissible only when necessary. However, it is better not to treat oneself by means of Istirqa&#8217; or cauterization if another means of treatment is available, Some of the Sahabah were treated by means of cauterization. Khabbab ibn Al-Arat and other Sahabah were also treated by means of cauterization, The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is also reported to have used cauterization as a means of treating the sickness of some of his Sahabah. Having oneself cauterized does not necessarily mean that one will not be counted among the seventy thousand people who will enter Jannah without being held accountable for their deeds. However, one of their good characteristics includes their uprightness, truly obeying Allah (Exalted be He) and avoiding disobedience to Him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the meaning of the following Hadith: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) once asked his Sahabah: &#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221; They asked him about those people who will enter Jannah without being called to account. Whereupon the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: &#8220;They are those who do not seek Ruqyah, those who do not get themselves cauterized, and those who do not believe in bad omens; rather, they put their trust in their Lord.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This has been reported in the Hadith about the seventy thousand Muslims who are destined to enter Jannah without being called to account. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) told his Sahabah that his Ummah were displayed before him. Among them were seventy thousand people who are destined to enter Jannah without being called to account and without suffering punishment, Some people said; &#8220;The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) may be referring to those who were born Muslims.&#8221; Others said: &#8220;He may be referring to those who accompanied the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) during the early days of Islam and did not associate any partners with Allah.&#8221; When the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) entered upon them, he asked them about the topic they were discussing, When they told him that they were inquiring about the Muslims who will enter Jannah without being judged, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said; (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">They are those who do not seek Ruqyah, those who do not get themselves cauterized, and those who do not believe in bad omens; rather, they put their trust in their Lord</span></strong>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition to the characteristics mentioned in the above Hadith, they also fear Allah, believe in Him and hold steadfastly to His Din (religion).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><span style="color:#008000;">They are those who do not get themselves cauterized</span></strong>&#8221; means that they do not resort to cauterization when they are ill. Another great characteristic is that they put their trust in Allah (Exalted be He), However, it is permissible to treat sickness by means of cauterization or seeking Ruqyah as the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have permitted them both. He permitted “Aishah to treat herself by means of seeking Ruqyah. He also permitted the mother of Ja ‘far&#8217;s children to treat them by means of seeking Ruqyah. However, if another means of treatment is available, then it will be better not to resort to seeking Ruqyah or cauterization. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">The best of all remedies are three: cauterization, drinking honey, and cupping, yet I do not like to be cauterized</span></strong>. )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Believing in bad omens is prohibited because it leads to pessimism. There is a narration from Imam Muslim that states: &#8220;They do not recite Ruqyah to others,&#8221; but its status has been classified as weak. Some narrators have mistaken seeking Ruqyah for Ruqyah. There is nothing wrong if the Muslim recites Ruqyah for his fellow Muslim, The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing wrong with Ruqyahs as long as they do not contain formulas that bear the meaning of Shirk</span></strong>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have recited Ruqyah to his Sahabah, “Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) is also reported to have recited Ruqyah over the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) when he fell sick. The Sahabah are also on reported to have recited Ruqyah to each other. There is nothing wrong with reciting Ruqyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is better not to seek Ruqyah unless there is a necessity. This is based on the fact that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) ordered Aishah saying: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You may ask for someone to recite Ruqyah over you.</strong></span>&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) also said to the mother of the children of Ja ‘far &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">You may ask for someone to recite Ruqyah over them (her children).</span></strong>&#8221; There is nothing wrong to ask someone saying: “<strong>O so and so, recite the Qur&#8217;an over me so that Allah may cure my sickness. May Allah reward you greatly</strong>.&#8221; There is also nothing wrong to have oneself cauterized if there is need for that.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Who are the people who will enter Jannah without being held accountable for their deeds? Are they those who do not recite Ruqyah for themselves nor for others? Kindly explain this to us. May Allah reward you with the best.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Those who follow Allah&#8217;s Din, fulfill His religious duties, and avoid His Prohibitions are destined to enter Jannah without being called to account or suffering punishment. Among them are the seventy thousand who do not seek Ruqyah, have themselves cauterized or believe in bad omens, but put their trust in Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They also do not believe in bad omens because believing in them is prohibited. Moreover, they prefer to avoid cauterization as a form of treatment, This is because the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said that these are among the characteristics of the seventy thousand (who will enter Paradise without being called to account). It would be better to use another form of treatment instead of cauterization. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (The best of all remedies are three: cauterization, cupping, and drinking honey, yet I do not like to be cauterized, ) The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have cauterized some of his Sahabah, Therefore, it is better not to treat oneself by means of cauterization, especially when another means of treatment is available. If no other means is available, then there is nothing wrong to resort to this. That does not necessarily mean that they will not be accounted among the seventy thousand. This is because the seventy thousand are those who adhere to the Din of Allah, avoid His Prohibitions, and fulfill the duties He prescribed. Among their good characteristics is that they do not seek Ruqyah. However, seeking Ruqyah does not necessarily mean that they will not be included among the seventy thousand. Seeking Ruqyah is to ask others to recite Ruqyah for you. There is nothing wrong to ask for Ruqyah if there is need for that. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) ordered ‘Aishah to treat herself by means of seeking Ruqyah, He also ordered the mother of the children of Ja far to treat her children by means of seeking Ruqyah, so there is nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also nothing wrong to have oneself cauterized if there is a need for that. This is based on the Hadith in which the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (The best of all remedies are three things: cauterization, cupping, and drinking honey.) This Hadith denotes that though it is permissible to seek treatment by means of cauterization, it is preferable not to resort to it, especially when some other sort of medicine is available.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 40 : Point 64</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> that when children are afflicted by anything in the life of this world then they feel pain. And that is mentioned because Bakr ibn ukht `Abdul Waa<u>h</u>id said &#8220;<em>they do not feel pain</em>&#8221; and he lied.</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/when-children-are-afflicted-by-anything-in-the-life-of-this-world-then-they-feel-pain" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This matter is mentioned on account of those who say that children do not feel any pain. And he mentioned this to refute this man and this man it is said that he was from the <em>Khawaarij </em>also<em>. </em>And the <em>Khawaarij</em> have even more surprising things than these worthless sayings on account of their ignorance and on account of their pretence to knowledge. When a child suffers something, he screams and he cries and he calls out for help and this is a proof that he indeed feels pain and this is something witnessed and felt. However, this man has strange sayings and from them is this issue.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Al <u>H</u>aafi<u>z</u> ibn <u>H</u>ajar said in Lisaan ul-Meezaan: &#8220;Bakr ibn ukht `Abdul Waa<u>h</u>id ibn Zayd al-Ba<u>s</u>ree al-Zaahid&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was mentioned by Ibn <u>H</u>azm in <em>Al-Milal W’al Ni<u>h</u>al</em> as being one of the <strong><em>Khawaarij</em> </strong>that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993366;">“With regard to every sin, even a small sin, even a slight lie which a person told as a joke that the person who does it is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever), a <em>mushrik</em> (one who associates partners with Allaah) from the People of the Hellfire except that if he is from the people who fought at Badr then he will be a <em>kaafir</em>, a <em>mushrik</em> but he is from the People of Paradise”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his student `Abdullaah ibn `Eesaa used to say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993366;">“The insane person and the children and the animals never ever feel any pain on account of every ailment or anything else because Allaah never oppresses anything even by the extent of a tiniest ant.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qutaybah (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) quoted this matter of pain from Bakr himself. From his foul sayings is that, “Whoever steals anything even to the amount of a mustard seed will remain in the Hellfire forever along with the disbelievers” and Ibn Qutaybah refuted this at length.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 40 : Point 62</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> that when a man becomes ill, Allaah gives him reward for his illness.</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F378202253&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/allaah-causes-afflictions-to-strike-the-believers-to-purify-them-multiply-their-reward" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah does not allow the reward due to the believers to become lost and He causes afflictions to strike the believers in order to <strong>purify them</strong> or to <strong>multiply their reward</strong>. He may cause calamities to happen to the believer to wipe away his sins and to purify him from sins. And it may be the case that he does not have sins but He still causes them to happen to him in order to raise his ranks in the Hereafter because Allaah has written for him a high rank in Paradise, which he cannot reach through his deeds. So, therefore Allaah tries him with afflictions so that He multiplies the reward for him so that he can reach this level. So the believer is upon good and therefore he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“How amazing is the matter of the believer, all of his matters are good for him. If something pleasing comes upon him then he gives thanks and that will be good for him and if something harmful comes to him then he has patience (<u>s</u>abr) and that will be good for him and that will not be except for the believer (mu&#8217;min).”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So indeed the believer is struck by afflictions and they are something beneficial for him for either Allaah will wipe away his sins with them or otherwise Allaah will raise his rank on account of them.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Muslim (2,999) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Suhayb <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> <strong>Translator&#8217;s Side Point:</strong> Some of the People of Knowledge mentioned that if a person is struck by affliction and he has patience upon it then he is rewarded. And if he doesn’t have patience, shows displeasure and the like then that’s something different. W`Allaahu A`lam.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Ibn Baz Fatwas &#8211; (Part No. 1; Page No. 206,207)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Copper bracelets [1]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[1]This is another answer to a question about copper bracelets made to cure rheumatism</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Abdul-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz to my honorable brother, may Allah safeguard you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have received your noble letter, may Allah be pleased with you. I have also reviewed the enclosed documents on the properties of the copper bracelet recently made to cure rheumatism. I have considered the whole matter more than once and discussed it with a number of university lecturers. We exchanged opinions on the juristic ruling on the copper bracelet in question, but there were different opinions on the matter; some regard it permissible as it has properties of curing rheumatism, whereas others see that it is better not to wear it, on the ground that wearing it is like the practice of the people of Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic time of ignorance), who used to wear copper amulets and bracelets, thinking that they were a cure for many diseases and a reason for the safety of the person wearing them against envy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Uqbah ibn `Amir (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Anyone who wears an amulet, Allah will not fulfill their need, and anyone who wears a seashell, Allah will not give them peace</span>. [1]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to another narration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Anyone who hangs an amulet has committed Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). </span>[2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imran ibn Al-Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) also narrated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) saw a man with a brass bracelet on his hand. He (peace be upon him) asked him, &#8216;What is this?&#8217; The man replied, &#8216;A protection from weakness.&#8217; He (peace be upon him) said, &#8216;Cast it off, for verily it will only increase your weakness; and if you die wearing it, you will never succeed.&#8217; </span>[3]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to another Hadith:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) in one of his journeys sent a messenger to check the camels of the caravan, and ordered the cutting of all string necklaces hung around the necks of the camels which were thought by the people of Jahiliyyah to benefit and protect their camels. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These Hadiths and others show that a Muslim must not wear amulets, bracelets, strings, bones, beads or other things that are used by some people to prevent or remove evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In my opinion, it is better not to wear or use this copper bracelet to block any means to Shirk, and to not let the heart be attached to such things, and to direct Muslims with their hearts toward Allah Alone trustingly and confidently, and to restrict oneself to lawful means that are indisputably permissible. Surely, what Allah has made lawful and accessible is sufficient and dispenses with any need for what is forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) is authentically reported to have said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Anyone who guards themselves against doubtful matters keeps their religion and honor blameless, and anyone who indulges in doubtful matters indulges in unlawful matters, just as a shepherd who pastures his animals around a sanctuary will soon (transgress upon it and) pasture them in it. </span>[4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (peace be upon him) also said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Leave what causes you doubt and turn to what does not cause you doubt. </span>[5]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Undoubtedly, wearing a copper bracelet is similar to what was practiced by the people of Jahiliyyah. Wearing it constitutes either a prohibited matter of Shirk or a means leading to Shirk or at least a doubtful matter.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is better for a Muslim not to wear it and resort to lawful medical treatment. This is the opinion that seems correct to a group of scholars, shaykhs, and myself as well with regard to this issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah (Exalted be He) to guide you and us to what pleases Him, grant us good understanding of His Religion, and protect us against all that opposes His Laws. Indeed, He is Able to do all things. May Allah safeguard you. As-salamu `alaykum.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Dislike of Making a vow</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">478 &#8211; &#8220;<strong>Allaah Azza wa jal said: Making a vow does not earn anything for the son of Adam except that which I have destined for him. Rather, making a vow is something which makes a miserly person give. He comes to Me with that which he would not offer due to his miserliness</strong>. &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration: &#8216;<strong>He offers that which he never offered before</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>From The Fiqh of the hadeeth</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth, with all its different wordings, indicates that it is not legislated to make a vow, rather it is disliked.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The apparent meaning of this prohibition in some of its narrations is that making a vow is haram as some of the scholars have said. However, the saying of Allaah Ta&#8217;ala: &#8220;<strong>Rather, making a vow is something which makes a miserly person give</strong>.&#8221; One feels that this dislike or prohibition is specific to making a vow which is offered to Allaah as a recompense or which is done in exchange for a reward rather than a vow which, from the onset, is done out of obedience to Allaah. This (second type of) vow is purely a means of coming closer to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because the one who is making the (second type of) vow has the correct intent with it, i.e. that he wants to receive an obligatory reward, which is better than the optional reward. This is the vow which is intended &#8211; and Allaah knows best &#8211; with the saying of Allaah Ta&#8217;ala: &lt;&lt;<strong>They fulfil their vows</strong>&gt;&gt; rather than the meaning of the vow which is offered as a recompense to Allaah or which is done in exchange for a reward.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafidh said in &#8216;al- Fath (11/ 5000) that at -Tabari narrated an athar with an authentic chain on the authority of Qatadah who said regarding the saying of Allaah Ta&#8217;ala: &lt;&lt;<strong>They fulfil their vows</strong>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;They would make vows in obedience to Allaah in their prayer and their Fasting, Zakaat, Hajj, Umra and in those things that Allaah had made obligatory upon them. Allaah labelled them as righteous people. It is clear that this praise is not for the making a vow which is offered as a recompense to Allaah.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Before this he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;That Qurtubi mentioned in his book &#8216;al- Mufhim&#8217;, that the prohibition in the hadeeth regarding the vow was that vow offered as a reward to Allaah, and he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>An example of this prohibition is to say for instance, “If Allaah cures me from my illness then I will give such and such in charity.” The point of objection here is when the goal of coming closer to Allaah is given a condition, this then makes it clear that the action was not done with the pure intention of coming closer to Allaah Ta&#8217;ala rather he did it in exchange for recompense.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>What shows us this is that if he was not cured -from his illness- then he would not give charity. So he attached the act of giving charity to (Allaah) curing him. This is the condition of the miserly person. Surely he does not give anything from his wealth unless he has a quick, increased return on what he gave.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the meaning which is referred to in the hadeeth when the Messenger of Allaah said &#8220;Making a vow is something which extracts from a miserly person, that which a miserly person would not give&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Sometimes what is added to this ignorant belief is the idea that a vow means that the goal will be achieved or that Allaah gives him this goal due to this vow.</strong></span> This is also indicated in the hadeeth: &#8220;Without doubt, a vow cannot repel whatever Allaah has destined&#8221;. The first situation is close to disbelief and the second is a clear mistake.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al- Hafidh said: &#8220;I say: rather that the second type is also close to disbelief.&#8221; Then he brings a quote from al-Qurtubi in which the scholars regarded the prohibition mentioned in the narration is understood to be of disapproval. Then he says: &#8220;what is apparent to me is that, it is held to be prohibited for the one whom you fear has corrupt belief. Therefore it would be haram for this person to make this vow, and it would be regarded as disapproval for the one who does not have that corrupted belief.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a good explanation and what supports this is the story of Ibn Umar, who is the narrator of the hadeeth regarding the prohibition of vows, since they are vows offered as recompense.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: what he intends by this <strong>story</strong> is what has been narrated by Hakim (4/304) by way of Faleeh bin Sulayman on the authority of Sa&#8217;eed bin Harith that he heard Abdullaah bin Umar when he was asked by a man called Mas&#8217;ood bin &#8216;Amr, from the tribe of Bani Ka&#8217;b, say: o Abu Abdur Rahman my son was in the lands of the Persians, from those who were with Umar bin UbaydAllaah in Basra. There fell a severe plague, so when this reached me I made a vow that if Allaah brought my son to me I would walk to the ka&#8217;ba. My son came, but he was sick and died, so what do you think? &#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Umar said: Were we not prohibited from making vows?! Certainly the Messenger of Allaah -alayhis-sallat wa sallam- said; &#8220;A vow doesn&#8217;t bring anything forward nor does it delay anything, rather it takes something out of a miserly person.&#8221; Fulfil your vow.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>So, summing up, there is a warning in this hadeeth for the Muslim not to approach a vow which is offered as a reward. Therefore it is for the people to know this so that they do not fall into this prohibition whilst they thought that they were acquiring good by their deeds!</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his Family, his Companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ghamm</strong> Occurs Due To Misfortunes that happened in the past while <strong>hamm</strong> occurs due to an expected misfortune in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When someone has the feeling of grief in regard to his past sins, his grief will benefit him, because he is rewarded for it. Whoever worries about a good deed he wishes to do, his worry will benefit him as well. However if someone grieves for something that he missed from this world, then [he should know] that the missed thing will not return and that grief harms, so practically he is adding harm to harm, as I have mentioned in the previous chapter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A resolute person should protect himself from what brings about grief, and that is losing an object he loves. Therefore, whoever has many objects that he loves, his grief increases, and whoever decreases his objects of love his grief decreases accordingly. Someone may say, when I have no objects of love I also still have grief, we affirm this but we say to him; your grief over not having a loved one is not even a tenth of the grief experienced by the one who has lost a loved one. Have you not noticed that the one who does not have a child lives in grief but not as much as the one who lost his child?! Moreover when a person becomes accustomed to what he loves and enjoys it for a long period of time, it takes over his heart, therefore when he loses it he will feel the bitterness of his loss which will be greater than all the satisfaction he had during his lifetime. This is because the loved one is corresponding to the self just as health corresponds to it, which causes the self not to find satisfaction except in it, for its absence disturbs it. This is why the self grieves for its loss much more than it rejoices in its presence, because the inner self believes that what it had was its given right to possess. Therefore a wise person should monitor the closeness between himself, his beloved to ensure it remains moderately balanced, however if he requires that which brings about grief [i.e. loving some object or person], this causes grief then the cure is first to believe in predestination and that whatever Allah predestines is going to happen. He should then know that life is founded on distress, all constructed buildings shall eventually be ruined, all gatherings shall eventually depart, and whoever wants the lasting of what does not last is like he who wants what does not exist to exist. Therefore he should not ask of life what it was not created for.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A poet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>It [worldly life] is founded on distress yet you want it, Free of harm and distress </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should imagine that what befell him is multiplied, for this is when what he suffers will be easier on him. It is a habit of smart porters to put something heavy on top of what they are carrying, and then after taking a few steps, to remove the heavy object as that makes what they are carrying feel lighter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should also wait, in times of prosperity for an attack of tribulation, so that if any tribulation befalls him, he should think of what remains instead of what he has lost so that when part of that befalls him it becomes very easy on him. Such as when some- one loses some money so he counts what remains, and then considers the remaining as a profit. Or if someone imagines that he loses his eyesight, so that when he has ophthalmia, it becomes easy on him to bear this illness, likewise with the rest of harmful matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A poet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The prudent imagines in himself,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>his tribulations before they befall him.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>If they suddenly befall him,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>they do not surprise him because he had already imagined them.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And the ignorant trusts the days,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>and he forgets the demise of those who came before him.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So when trials of times surprise him,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>with some trials he becomes lost</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Though if he was strict in his affairs,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>patience would have taught him boldness</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A member of the righteous predecessors said, &#8220;I saw a woman, whose youthfulness surprised me, I said, &#8216;[There is no doubt] This face has never suffered from sorrow or sadness.&#8217; She said, Do not say that! For I do not know anyone who has suffered from what I have suffered. I had a husband who bought a sacrificial animal and slaughtered it, and we had two sons. The eldest told the one younger than him, &#8216;Come and I will show you how our father slaughtered the ewe/ So he slaughtered his brother. When we started to look for him, he ran away and my husband died while looking for him/ I said, &#8216;So how are you handling your sorrow?&#8217; She said, &#8216;If I could find aid in sorrow I would have employed it.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Section One: Treating Sorrow, Sadness and Grief</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sorrow, sadness and grief may befalls one due the prevalence of blackness, which should be treated with what will remove this blackness; which are the things that bring about joy. Grief freezes the blood while happiness heats it until its intrinsic heat is raised, both of them (happiness and grief) can harm, and may lead to death, if they are not immediately kept within moderate levels.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The Sick person is required to purify himself with water, performing ablution from minor impurity and <i>Ghusl</i> from major impurity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. If he is unable to purify himself using water, due to weakness or fear of increasing his illness, or delaying his recovery, then he may perform <i>Tayammum</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The way to perform <i>Tayammum</i> is to strike the clean earth with his hands once, then wipe his whole face with them, then wipe his hands, one with the other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. If he is unable to purify himself, the another person should assist him in making the ablution, or performing the <i>Tayammum</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. If a certain part of the body which is to be purified is afflicted by a wound, he should wash it with water; but if washing it with water will cause harm to him, then he may wet his hand with water and then wipe over it. If wiping over it may also cause harm he may perform <i>Tayammum</i> for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. If he has a severe fracture in any of his limbs, which is covered with a dressing or cast, he may wipe over it with water, instead of washing it, and it does not require <i>Tayammum</i>, because the wiping takes the place of washing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. It is permisable to make <i>Tayammum</i> using a wall, or anything else which is clean and contains dust. If the wall is covered with anything which is not from th earth such as paint, then one should not make <i>Tayammum</i> with it, unless there is dust over it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. If the <i>Tayammum</i> is not made on the earth or a wall or anything else containing dust, there is no objection to the collecting of dust in container or a hankerchief, in order to make <i>Tayammum</i> with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. If a person performs <i>Tayammum</i> for prayer, and remains in a purified state until the time of the next prayer, then he may pray with the <i>Tayammum</i> he made before and he does not need to repeat it for the second prayer, since he remains purified and nothing has invalidated it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. The sick person is obliged to cleanse his body from all manner of impurity, but if he is unable to do so, he may pray as he is, and his prayer will be correct and he does not need to repeat it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11 The sick person is required to pray in clean clothes, and if they became soiled, they must be cleaned or replaced with clean ones. If this is not possible, he may pray as he is, and his prayer will be correct and he does not need to repeat it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. The sick person is obliged to pray upon something clean and if it becomes soiled, he must wash it, change for something clean or cover it with something clean. If he is unable to do so, he may pray there, and his prayer will be correct and he does not need to repeat it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. It is not permissible for the invalid to delay the prayer due to his inability to achieve purification; rather, he should purify himself as much as he is able, then perform the prayer on time, even if there is some impurity on his body, his clothes or his place of prayer, which he is unable to remove.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allaah, the Lords of the Worlds, and may peace and blessings of Allaah be upon the noblest of the Prophets and Messengers, our Prophet, Muhammad and upon all his family and Companions. As for what follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Verily, Allaah, the Most Glorified, Most High has legislated purification for every prayer, because the elimination of impurity and the removal of pollution &#8211; whether on the body, the clothes or the place of prayer &#8211; are two of the conditions of prayer. So when the Muslim wishes to pray, he must perform the well known ablution <i>(Wudhu)</i> to purify himself from minor impurity, or make Ghusl if the impurity is of the major kind. And before making ablution, <i>Istinja&#8217;</i> must be performed with water, or <i>Istijmar</i> by the one who has urinated or defecated in order that the purification and cleansing be complete. What follows is an explanation of some of the rulings related to this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Istinja&#8217;</i> with water is obligatory every time something is discharged from the bowel and bladder, such as urine or faeces. But it is not necessary for the sleeper or one who passes wind to perform <i>Istinja&#8217;</i>. He is only required to perform ablution, because <i>Istinja&#8217;</i>is only prescribed for the removal of impurity, and there is no impurity in this situation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Istijmar</i> is performed using stones, or another material in its place (such as wood, paper etc.) It must consist of three clean stones, as proved by the Hadith of the Prophet<i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i> which states that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;Whoever performs Istijmar, let him make it </i><i>Witr</i> (i.e. use an odd number of stones).&#8221;</span> [Abu Dawud no.35 and Ibn Majah no. 337]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i> also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;If any of you goes to defecate, he should take with him three stones, for they will be sufficient for him.&#8221;</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim narrated that he <i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i> forbade <i>Istijmar</i> with less than three stones. It is not permissible to make <i>Istijmar</i> with animal droppings, bones or food or anything which contains some forbidden material. It is preferred for a person to perform <i>istijmar</i> with stones, or the like such as tissues etc. After which, he should use water, because the stones remove the essence of the pollution, but the water purifies the area and is therefore more thorough. A person has a choice of <i>Istinja&#8217;</i> with water, or<i>Istijmar</i> with stones or the like. It is reported on the authority of Anas, may Allaah be pleased with him, that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;The Prophet </i><i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i> entered the toilet and I and a young boy like me carried materials, including water and <i>&#8216;anaza</i> (a short spear) and he would perform <i>Istinja&#8217;</i> with the water.&#8221;</span> [al-Bukhari no.152 &amp; Muslim no.271.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported on the authority of &#8216;Aishah, may Allaah be pleased with her, that she said to a group of women:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Order your husbands to clean themselves following defecation with water, for I am too embarrassed to do so, and the Prophet (Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) used to do so.&#8221;</span></em> At-Tirmidhee said that it was authentic [At-Tirmidhee no.19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a person wants to use only one of them (i.e. stones or water), it is preferred to choose water, because it cleans the area removing the essence and the traces and it is more thorough in cleansing. If he chooses to only use stones, he should content himself with three, if it cleanses the area, but if it is not enough, he may use four or five (or more) until he has cleaned the area, but it is better to finish with an odd number, based upon the saying of the Prophet <i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Whoever performs Istijmar, let him make it Witr.&#8221;</span></em> [Abu Dawud no.35 and Ibn Majah no. 337]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissable to make the <i>Istijmar</i> with the right hand, according to the <i>Hadith</i> of Salman, may Allaah be pleased with him, in which he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Messenger of Allaah forbade us from performing <i>Istinja&#8217;</i> with the right hand.&#8221; And he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;None of you should hold his penis in his right hand while he is urinating. nor should he wipe himself with the right hand after answering the call of nature.&#8221;</span> </i>[Al-Bukhari no.153 &amp; Muslim no.267]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if his left hand has been cut off, or is broken or there is some disease in it, he may use his right hand, and there is no objection to that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because the Islamic law is based upon facility and ease, Allaah, the Most Glorified, Most High has lightened the burden of worship on those who have some excuse, according to the excuse. He, the Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And (He) has not laid upon you in religion any hardship</b>.&#8221; [Surah al-Hajj 22:78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allaah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you.&#8221;</b>[Surah al-Baqarah 2:185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can.&#8221;</b> [Surah at-Taghabun 64:16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet <i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;If I order you to do something, do it as much as you can.&#8221;</i></span> [Al-Bukharino.7288 &amp; Muslim no.1337]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;Verily the Religion is ease.&#8221;</i> </span>[Narrated by al-Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a sick person is unable to cleanse himself of minor impurity with the water by making ablution, or he is unable to purify himself of major impurity by making <i>Ghusl</i>, due to weakness, or fear of making his illness worse, or delaying his recovery, he may perform<i>Tayammum</i> [Dry ablution using sand or dust.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is done by striking his hands in clean dust once, then wiping his face with the palms of his hands and his fingers slowly, based upon the Words of Him, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And if you are ill, or on a journey, or one of you comes after answering the call of nature, or you have been in contact with women (by sexual relations) and you find no water, perform <i>Tayammum</i> with clean earth and rub therewith your faces and hands (Tayammum). Truly, Allaah is Ever Oft-Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving.&#8221;</b> [Surah An-Nisa 4:43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ruling on those who are unable to use water is the same that of those who are unable to find water, according to the words of the Prophet <i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;The reward of deeds depends upon the intentions and every person will get the reward according to what he has intended.&#8221;</i></span> [Al-Bukhari no. 1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A sick person may fall into one of a number of categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. If his illness is a simple one and he does not fear to use the water, such as an ailment from which there is no fear that using the water will delay his recovery, or increase his pain, or cause any infection, such as a headache, toothache and the like, or he is able to use warm water without harm, then it is not allowed for him to make <i>Tayammum</i>. Because the permission to perform it is in order to prevent harm, and there is no fear of harm to him, and because he can find water, therefore he must use it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. If he fears from an illness which he fears may &#8211; should he use water &#8211; cause his death or harm one of his organs, or may lead to some illness which might cause his death or harm one of his organs, or cause the loss of some faculty, then it is permissible for him to perform <i>Tayammum</i>, based upon the words of the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And do not kill yourselves (nor kill one another). Surely, Allaah is Most Merciful to you.&#8221;</b>[Surah an-Nisa&#8217; 4:29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. If he is suffering from some illness which makes him unable to move, and he finds no one to bring him water, it is permissible for him to perform <i>Tayammum</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Anyone suffering from a wound, an ulcer or fracture, or any illness which will be exacerbated by using water, and who becomes <i>Junub</i> [in a state of sexual impurity] is allowed to perform <i>Tayammum</i>, based upon the above evidences. If he is able to wash the healthy areas of his body, he must do so and make <i>Tayammum</i> for the rest.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A sick person who is in a place in which he finds neither water nor dust, or anyone who can bring him either one of them, may pray whatever condition he is in, and he is not allowed to delay the prayer, as Allaah, the Most High say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can.&#8221;</b> [Surah at-Taghabun 64:16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. An invalid afflicted with incontinence of urine, who is not cured by his treatment, must make ablution for every prayer after the start of its prescribed time, wash off any urine that has affected his body, and wear a clean garment for his prayer, if this is not a burden on him. But if it is, he is excused from it, based upon the Allaah Words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And (He) has not laid upon you in religion any hardship</b>.&#8221; [Surah al-Hajj 22:78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His Words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allaah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you.&#8221;</b>[Surah al-Baqarah 2:185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the words of the Prophet <i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;If I order you to do something, do it as much as you cable.&#8221;</i></span> [Al-Bukhari no.7288 &amp; Muslim no.1337]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He must try to the best of his ability to prevent the spread of the urine to his clothes, or his body, or the place in which he will pray. And everything that invalidates ablution also invalidates <i>Tayammum</i>, and in addition, the ability to use water or its presence. And Allaah knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"> Fatwa no. 3828</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: I am a Muslim woman in my twenties. I was married about a year and a half ago and thanks to Allah, I had a baby six months ago delivered naturally. A week after delivery, I began to suffer from severe depression, which had never happened to me before. I lost interest in everything, even taking care of the baby. I went to a psychiatrist and took medication until recently, but it was of no use and I became tired of long treatment. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">I ask Allah that you find an Islamically approved treatment for my distress and psychological depression, or the best remedy, so that I can return to my normal state and take care of my husband and baby, and be able to manage the affairs of my home. I heard sometime ago the Hadith, which states: The water of Zamzam is for whatever it is drunk for. I hope from Allah, then you, to clarify the meaning of this Hadith. Does it apply to my psychological case, or is it only for physical diseases? If Zamzam water is useful, by the Will of Allah, in treating my case, how can I get it? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Put your <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>trust in Allah</strong></span> and <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>expect good from Him</strong></span>. Entrust your affairs to Him and do not despair of His Mercy and Benevolence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no disease for which Allah has not also sent down the cure. You should make use of means and continue to consult specialized doctors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Recite <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Surahs Al-Ikhlas, Al-Falaq and Al-Nas</strong></span> three times, blowing into your hands after each recitation and wiping your face and whatever parts of your body you can. Repeat this procedure day and night and before going to sleep.<span style="line-height:1.5;">Recite </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Surah Al-Fatihah</strong></span><span style="line-height:1.5;"> anytime of day or night, and </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong style="line-height:1.5;">Ayat-ul-Kursy</strong></span><span style="line-height:1.5;"> (the Qur’anic Verse of the Throne, Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:255) before going to sleep. This is the best Ruqyah (Qur’an and supplications recited over the sick seeking healing) to protect oneself from evil. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5;">You should also <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>appeal to Allah with the Du‘a’</strong> </span>(Supplication) to be said at times of distress: </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;">لَا إلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ الْعَظيمُ الْحَلِيمْ، لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ رَبُّ العَرْشِ العَظِيمِ، لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا الله رَبُّ السَّمَوّاتِ ورّبُّ الأَرْضِ ورَبُّ العَرْشِ الكَريم</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="line-height:1.5;color:#008000;">La ilaha illa Allah al-`azim al-halim, la ilaha illa Allah rabbul-`arshi al-`azim, la ilaha illa Allah, rabbul-samawaati wa rabbul-ardi wa rabbul-`arshi al-karim </span>[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="line-height:1.5;color:#008000;">(There is no god but Allah, the Most Great and the All-Forbearing. There is no god but Allah, the Lord of the Great Throne. There is no god but Allah, the Lord of the heavens and the earth and the Lord of the Noble Throne). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5;">You may also heal and protect yourself through the <strong>Ruqyah</strong> of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him): </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="line-height:1.5;color:#008000;">&#8220;Remove the affliction, O Lord of mankind, and bring about healing as You are the Healer. There is no healing but Your Healing; a healing that leaves behind no ailment&#8221; </span>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5;">There are also many other Adhkar (invocations and remembrances said at certain times on a regular basis), Ruqyahs, and supplications stated in the Books of Hadith and Al-Nawawy mentioned them in his book Riyad Al-Salihin and Al-Adhkar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for what you mentioned about <strong>Zamzam water</strong> and the statement of the Prophet (peace be upon him): <em><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Zamzam water is for whatever it is drunk for. </span></strong></em>[3] This Hadith was related by Imam Ahmadand Ibn Majah on the authority of Jabir ibn `Abdullah from the Prophet (peace be upon him). It is a Hadith Hasan (a Hadith whose chain of narration contains a narrator with an exactitude weaker than that of authentic hadiths, but it is still free from eccentricity or blemish) and general in application. What is more authentic than it is the statement of the Prophet (peace be upon him) about Zamzam water: <em><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>It is blessed; it is a food that nourishes and a cure for sickness.</strong></span></em> [4] (Related by Muslim and Abu Dawud; this is the wording of Abu Dawud) If you would like some Zamzam water, you can ask anyone performing Hajj from your country to bring you some.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">‘A woman went to the hospital and the doctors aborted her four month old fetus, with the argument that the woman had German Measles or measles and if we did not abort it, it would have come out deformed or mentally disabled; what is your opinion?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh Answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I am asked a lot regarding the likes of this situation, and we hold the opinion that you should not respond to these doctors, since their silent expression says: &lt;&lt;we do not think it but as a conjecture, and we have no firm convincing belief (therein).’&gt;&gt; [Al-Jathiyah: 32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have been informed from more than one source that some women had been informed by some doctors the like of this information [of aborting fetuses], but they did not consent to aborting and to miscarrying, and the new-born was delivered naturally, so this confirms that it is nothing but as conjecture.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, every command is in the Hand of Allaah –Tabarak wa Ta’ala- He has the command and He creates everything, so it is not befitting that some doctors participate in the likes of these matters, of which the reality is hidden from all people. Perhaps some people research into some hidden matters more so than others, so it is not allowed to look into the unknown future for all the people, and no-one knows the unseen except Allaah –Tabarak wa Ta’ala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a woman … perhaps gives birth to a fetus that is deformed or similar to a deformed child, or like it is said nowadays, that it is disabled etc. . . . so, in respect to us being Muslims believing in Allaah –Azza wa Jal-  and that He is al-Hakeem (The All-Wise) and al-Aleem (The All-Knowing) there is no fault in His creation. So this variance which we generally see between human beings whether it is in skin colour or in height or shortness in stature or in being males or females, or in health and safety, or regarding diseases and illness etc. then all of this is what al-Azeez (The All-Mighty), al-Aleem (The All-Knowing) has pre-destined. Because the Lord –Azza wa Jal- wants to show His slaves that what they regard as good and ugly, then all of that according to Allaah –Azza wa Jal- is good. The way we look at the creation of Allaah – Azza wa Jal- is not the way the Creator Himself –Tabarak wa Ta’ala- views things, because &lt;&lt;there is nothing like unto Him and He is the All-knowing and All-Seeing.&gt;&gt; [Shura:11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At this opportunity it is necessary for me to mention a hadeeth, which I regard as very great concerning this topic and an answer to this question.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> saw a  man from his Companions, walking wearing a long garment and it was trailing below his ankles, so the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said to him: ‘O so and so, raise your garment since it is closer to piety and better to remain cleaner.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah I am bow-legged.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The shaykh continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘So this person lengthened his garment so that he could cover up this deficiency as he had presumed, and he apologized for this reason for having lengthened his garment so the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said to him: ‘O so and so – [the shaykh said: ‘and here is the main point’ ] – ‘All of Allaah’s creation is good. All of Allaah’s creation is good.’ [Saheeh: ‘Silsilah Saheehah’ 1441]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is why, what we see with our human physical eyes, has to be judged immediately that this is a deficient sight. We see, as is mentioned in an old Arabic proverb: ‘Not past his rabbit like nose’ (tip of his nose).  They used to say of old, ‘so and so does not see past his rabbit like nose’ (does not look further than the tip of his nose).  As for looking far ahead then no! In addition to this no matter how far a human being can see, no matter how very far, it is still a deficient sight.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Companion from the Companions of the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>saw himself as defective due to being bow-legged and the disability which was in his calves, so he covered it up by lengthening his garment. Because if he raised his garment slightly then some of the disability would have become exposed, so the Prophet &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> brought his attention to this. That what you see as a deficiency is not a deficiency because Allaah is the One Who created you like that, and this is not from your own doing. Just like Allaah –Azza wa Jal- said: &lt;&lt;This is the creation of Allaah. So show Me that which those (whom you worship), besides Him have created. &gt;&gt; [Luqman: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore this child, this fetus, if it is born naturally and it was disabled or was afflicted with an illness which the doctors previously had presumed, then this is the Will of Allaah which is the Destiny that Allaah made so that it can be a lesson for healthy people.  As it has been said: ‘Health is a crown placed upon the head of healthy people which none can see except a person who is ill.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also a very great, noble prophetic instruction, which is: ‘Do not look at those above you but look at those below you, since it is more befitting that you do not belittle the blessings of Allaah upon you.’ [Saheeh Lighayrihi: ‘Saheeh Targheeb  wa Tarheeb 2233]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So perhaps there is a person who has a beautiful form, however there are people who look at themselves and view themselves as ugly and they might say that this person really is beautiful.  So this is the variance in the creation and in beauty and it is the predestination of Allaah al-Azeez (The All-Mighty), al-Aleem (The All-Knowing) al-Hakeem (The All-Wise).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when Allaah created beauty He also created its opposite, as we have said that it is created for an Infinite Wisdom, we can express this with what has been said a very long time ago: ‘Opposites clarify each other.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it was not for ugliness, beauty would not be known. If it was not for illness, health would not be known. If it was not for males there would not be females. If it was not for females there would not be males.  So all this creation that we see, that Allaah created the people upon, it is from the Wisdom of Allaah –Azza wa Jal- this is why it is not befitting to conform to the opinions of doctors concerning matters which have not yet entered the sphere of life, and when it comes into the sphere of life then comes the saying of the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>: ‘O slaves of Allaah seek treatment, since indeed Allaah did not send down a disease except that He sent down the cure.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the hadeeth of Usamah bin Shareek <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em>, it was also narrated by another noble Companion and he is none other than Abdullaah bin Mas’ood <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu- </em>with an extra wording, he said: ‘Seek cure O slaves of Allaah since indeed Allaah did not send down a disease except that He sent down the cure, whoever knew it, knew it and whoever was ignorant of it, was ignorant of it.’ [Saheeh: ‘Silsilah Saheehah’ 451]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, there is nothing to hinder seeking cure later on, however there is a condition which needs to be taken into consideration, which is, that this seeking cure is due to a matter which the new-born is exposed to, i.e. that it is not allowed to change the creation of Allaah –Azza wa Jal, because Allaah –Azza wa Jal- mentions about the accursed Shaytan in the Noble Qur’aan, that the Shaytaan challenged the will of the Lord of the worlds –Azza wa Jal- in respect to Adam and his offspring saying: &lt;&lt; I will order them to slit the ears of cattle, and indeed I will order them to change the nature created by Allaah.&gt;&gt; [Nisa’:119]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not allowed to change the creation of Allaah –Azza wa Jal- and this has examples, very many examples.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;" align="center">Compiled &amp; Translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 – From Abu Umamah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said: the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘Treat your sick by giving <em>Sadaqah</em> (charity).’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected in Saheeh al-Jamia’ No. 3358 &amp; declared Hasan by Albaani]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 – From Ubadah bin Saamit who said I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘There is no person who is afflicted with a wound on his body, and he gives charity due to that, then Allaah expiates from him the like of what he gave in charity.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ahmad &amp; Albaani declared it to have an authentic Isnaad in Saheehah No. 2273]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – A man asked Abdullaah bin al-Mubarak <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> about ulcers that had sprung out on his knee for about seven years, and he tried to treat it with various treatments, he had asked doctors but to no avail. So Ibn Mubarak said: ‘<strong><span style="color:#808000;">Go and dig a well in a place where people need water, indeed I hope that there springs up water there, and by that you stop bleeding</span></strong>.’  The man did that and Allaah Ta’ala cured him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Seerah ‘Alaam’ 8/407]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bayhaqi quoted a story of our Shaykh al-Haakim Abu Abdullaah <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> who was afflicted with ulcers on his face, and he had tried a number of treatments but they did not go away, and it remained like that for nearly a year.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then asked the teacher, Imam Abu Uthmaan as-Sabooni to make <em>Dua’</em> for him in one of his gatherings on Friday, so he made <em>Dua’</em> and many of the people with him said <em>Ameen</em>.  When it came to the next <em>Juma’</em> a woman came to the gathering and left a brief message saying that she had gone back home and exerted herself in making <em>Dua’ </em>for al-Haakim Abu Abdullaah that night, and that she had seen the Messenger of Allaah<em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>in her sleep, and it was as if he was saying to her: &#8220;<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>T</strong><strong>ell Abu Abdullaah to distribute water amongst the Muslims.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I came with that message to al-Haakim, and he ordered that a watering place be built at the door of his home, when they had finished building it, he ordered for water to be poured into it and ice placed into that water, and then the people began drinking from that water.  Not a week had passed by, except that it was obvious that his health had been restored, and the ulcers had ceased. His face had become better than it was before, and he lived like that for a number of years.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected in ‘Saheeh Targheeb wa Tarheeb’ No. 964 Albaani declared it to be Saheeh Maqtu, 1/p.568]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 – Abu Tahir as-Silafee said in ‘Mua’jam as-Safr’: I heard Abu Hasan Ali bin Abu Bakr Ahmad bin Ali the scribe of al-Minzi in Damascus saying: I heard Abu Bakr al-Khabazi (d. 449A.H.) in Nisaboor saying: I became sick with a very dangerous illness, and a righteous neighbor of mine saw me and said: ‘Utilize the saying of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘Treat your sick by giving <em>Sadaqah</em> (charity).’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>It was summer time, and I bought many watermelons, and a group of poor people and children got together and ate them, then they raised their hands to Allaah –<em>Azza wa Jal-</em> and they made <em>Dua’</em> for me to be cured.</strong>  I swear by Allaah I had not reach the morning except that I regained complete health from Allaah &#8211;<em>Tabaraka wa Ta’ala</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Seerah ‘Alaam 18/44, Tareekh al-Islaam]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 – al-Barzali (d. 841A.H.) said in his Fatwa (5/612): Ibn Rushd was asked about the saying of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>: ‘Treat your sick by giving <em>Sadaqah</em> (charity).’ Is it authentic or not? And what does it mean? And if a person becomes sick and treats his illness with all types of medicines and they did not benefit him, then what is the way of giving <em>Sadaqah</em> as a medicine?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I do not remember this text (narration) in any of the authentic collections of narrations, however, if it is authentic, then the meaning is an encouragement to visit the sick, because it is from the obligatory rights from the Sunnah that it is upon a Muslim that he visit a Muslim if he becomes sick.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the saying ‘The Muslim is a brother of a Muslim, he encourages him to say the testification at the time of death, and he visits him when he is sick, and advises him when he is absent or if he has to testify.’ As for visiting him then this is a good deed, and every good deed is <em>Sadaqah</em>, since it has a connection with the sick person and visiting him brings happiness to him, and just like making <em>Dua’</em>. There is no doubt that there is hope that the <em>Dua’</em> will be answered and he will be cured.  Therefore, it does benefit him as a type of medicine, due to the saying of the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>: ‘He who sent down the illness also sent down the treatment.’<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Barzali said: some of our shaykhs from al-Qarawan understood this to have an evident meaning, namely that if a person gives <em>Sadaqah</em> on behalf of the sick, and that he requests the person whom he gave <em>Sadaqah</em> to, to make <em>Dua’</em> for the sick then it is hoped that he will be cured, due to the saying of the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>: ‘<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The supplication of one of you for his brother in his absence is answered</strong></span>.’<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 – ad-Dooree narrated in ‘<em>Tareekh</em>’ and al-Bayhaqi in ‘<em>Shu’ab al-Eemaan</em>’ from Ibraheem an-Nakhai who said: ‘<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>that the Companions used to regard giving <em>Sadaqah</em> as a means of repelling oppression</strong></span>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7 – From Hudayfah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> that the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘A <em>fitnah</em> (trail) which a man faces with regard to his family, his wealth, his own self, his son and his neighbor is expiated by fasting, prayer, charity, enjoining good and forbidding evil.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari &amp; Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8 – Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Indeed <em>Sadaqah</em> has an amazing effect in repelling different types of trials and tribulations, even if the charity was given by an evil person, or an oppressive person, in fact even if it was given by a non-Muslim! Indeed Allaah Ta’ala repels different types of trials and tribulations due to giving <em>Sadaqah</em>.  This is a matter which is well-known to the scholars and the general folk, and all of the people on the earth can associate with this fact because they have experienced it.’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘al-Wabil as-Sayyib’ p.63]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9 – Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘There are types of medicines which can treat illnesses which the minds of the senior doctors cannot comprehend, and that which their sciences, experiences and measurements cannot reach. These are the medicines of the heart and soul, and the strength of the heart, its dependence upon Allaah and trust upon Him and seeking refuge in Him. Prostrating and feeling in dire need of Allaah and humbling oneself for Allaah. Likewise giving <em>Sadaqah</em> (charity), making <em>Dua’</em>, repentance and seeking forgiveness, being good to the creation, aiding the distressed and liberating from grief and unhappiness.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Indeed these types of medication have been used by various nations, who are upon different religions and communities, and they found that they had an effect in the treatment of illnesses, which even the sciences of the most knowledgeable doctors could not reach, and they have no experience nor measurement of it. We have indeed experienced these matters a great deal and as others have, and we have seen what ordinary medicine can and cannot do.’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Zad al-Ma’ad’ 4/11-12]</p>

Chapter 145<br />
Supplication for the Sick</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>901.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: When a person complained to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) about an ailment or suffered from a sore or a wound, the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) would touch the ground with his forefinger and then raise it (Sufyan bin `Uyainah, the narrator, demonstrated this with his forefinger) and would recite:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `Bismil-lahi, turbatu ardina, biriqati ba`dina, yushfa bihi saqimuni, bi &#8216;idhni Rabbina&#8217; (With the Name of Allah, the dust of our ground mixed with the saliva of some of us would cure our patient with the permission of our Rubb.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>902.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: When the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) visited any ailing member of his family, he would touch the sick person with his right hand and would supplicate:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allahumma Rabban-nasi, adhhibil-ba&#8217;sa, washfi, Antash-Shafi</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">,</span><span style="color:#0000ff;"> la shifa&#8217;a illa shifa&#8217;uka, shifaan la yughadiru saqaman [O Allah! the Rubb of mankind! Remove this disease and cure (him or her)! You are the Great Curer. There is no cure but through You, which leaves behind no disease].&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>903.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I said to Thabit (May Allah had Mercy upon him)<span style="color:#008000;"> Should I not perform Ruqyah (i.e., recite supplication or Quranic Ayat and blow) over you, such supplication as was practised by the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)?&#8221;</span> He said:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Please do so.&#8221;</span> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) supplicated:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Allahumma Rabban-nasi, mudh-hibal-ba&#8217;si, ishfi Antash-Shafi</span><span style="color:#008000;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">,</span><span style="color:#008000;"> la shafiya illa Anta, shifa&#8217;an la yughadiru saqaman [O Allah! the Rubb of mankind! Take away this disease and cure (him or her). You are the Curer. There is no cure except through You. Cure (him or her), a cure that leaves no disease].&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>904.</b> Sa`d bin Abu Waqqas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) visited me during my illness and supplicated,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O Allah! Cure Sa`d. O Allah! Cure Sa`d. O&#8217; Allah! Cure Sa`d.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>905.</b> Abu<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';"> `</span>Abdullah bin Abul-`as (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I complained to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) about a pain I had in my body. The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Place your hand where you feel pain and say: `Bismillah (With the Name of Allah)&#8217; three times; and then repeat seven times: `A`udhu bi`izzatillahi wa qudratihi min sharri ma ajidu wa `uhadhiru (I seek refuge with Allah and with His Power from the evil that afflicts me and that which I apprehend).&#8221;&#8217;<br />
[</span>Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>906.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He who visits a sick person who is not on the point of death and supplicates seven times: As&#8217;alullahal-`Azima Rabbal-`Arshil-`Azimi, an yashfiyaka (I beseech Allah the Great, the Rubb of the Great Throne, to heal you), Allah will certainly heal him from that sickness.&#8221;</span><br />
[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>907.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) visited a bedouin who was sick. Whenever he visited an ailing person, he would say,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;La ba&#8217;sa, tahurun in sha&#8217; Allah [No harm, (it will be a) purification (from sins), if Allah wills].&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>908.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Jibril (Gabriel) came to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and said: &#8220;O Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)! Do you feel sick?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span> Jibril supplicated thus (i.e., he performed Ruqyah):<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Bismillahi arqika, min kulli shay&#8217;in yu&#8217;dhika, min sharri kulli nafsin aw `ayni hasidi, Allahu yashfika, bismillahi arqika. [With the Name of Allah. I recite over you (to cleanse you) from all that troubles you, and from every harmful mischief and from the evil of the eyes of an envier. Allah will cure you; and with the Name of Allah, I recite over you].&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>909.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri and Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;If a person says: `La ilaha illallahu wallahu Akbar (There is no true god except Allah and Allah is Greatest)&#8217;, his Rubb responds to him and affirms: `(Yes!) There is no true god except I, and I am the Greatest.&#8217; When he says: `La ilaha illallahu Wahdahu la sharika Lahu (There is no true god except Allah, the One, He has no partner).&#8217; Allah (SWT) affirms: `(Yes!) There is no true god except I. I have no partner.&#8217; When he says: `La ilaha illallahu Lahul mulku wa Lahul-hamdu (the sovereignty belongs to Him and all the praise is due to Him).&#8217; He (SWT) affirms: `(Yes!) There is no true god except I, Mine is the praise and to Me belongs the sovereignty.&#8217; When he says: `La ilaha illallahu wa la hawla wa la quwwata illa Billah (There is no true god except Allah, and there is no might and power but with Allah).&#8217; He (SWT) affirms: `(Yes!) There is no true god except I, and there is no might and power but with Me.&#8221;&#8217;</span> The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) added,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He who recites this during his illness and dies, will not be touched by the Fire (Hell).&#8221;</span><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people were sick and they said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Give us shelter and food. So when they became healthy they said, &#8220;The weather of Medina is not suitable for us.&#8221; So he sent them to Al-Harra with some she-camels of his and said, &#8220;Drink of their milk.&#8221; But when they became healthy, they killed the shepherd of the Prophet and drove away his camels. The Prophet sent some people in their pursuit. Then he got their hands and feet cut and their eyes were branded with heated pieces of iron. I saw one of them licking the earth with his tongue till he died.</p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.071.611"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle along with a a son of mine whose palate and tonsils I had pressed with my finger as a treatment for a (throat and tonsil) disease. The Prophet said, &#8220;Why do you pain your children by pressing their throats! Use Ud Al-Hindi (certain Indian incense) for it cures seven diseases, one of which is pleurisy. It is used as a snuff for treating throat and tonsil disease and it is inserted into one side of the mouth of one suffering from pleurisy.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet)</p>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.071.612"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the health of Allah&#8217;s Apostle deteriorated and his condition became serious, he asked the permission of all his wives to allow him to be treated In my house, and they allowed him. He came out, supported by two men and his legs were dragging on the ground between Abbas and another man. (The sub-narrator told Ibn &#8216;Abbas who said: Do you know who was the other man whom &#8216;Aisha did not mention? The sub-narrator said: No. Ibn Abbas said: It was &#8216;Ali.) &#8216;Aisha added: When the Prophet entered my house and his disease became aggravated, he said, &#8220;Pour on me seven water skins full of water (the tying ribbons of which had not been untied) so that I may give some advice to the people.&#8221; So we made him sit in a tub belonging to Hafsa, the wife of the Prophet and started pouring water on him from those water skins till he waved us to stop. Then he went out to the people and led them in prayer and delivered a speech before them.</p>

We are owners of livestock and have never been farmers,&#8221; and they found the climate of Medina unsuitable for them. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered that they be given some camels and a shepherd, and ordered them to go out with those camels and drink their milk and urine. So they set out, but when they reached a place called Al-Harra, they reverted to disbelief after their conversion to Islam, killed the shepherd and drove away the camels. When this news reached the Prophet he sent in their pursuit (and they were caught and brought). The Prophet ordered that their eyes be branded with heated iron bars and their hands be cut off, and they were left at Al-Harra till they died in that state.</p>

Those people differed in their opinions. Some of them said, &#8220;We have come out for a purpose and we do not think that it is proper to give it up,&#8221; while others said (to &#8216;Umar), &#8220;You have along with you. other people and the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle so do not advise that we take them to this epidemic.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said to them, &#8220;Leave me now.&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;Call the Ansar for me.&#8221; I called them and he consulted them and they followed the way of the emigrants and differed as they did. He then said to them, Leave me now,&#8221; and added, &#8220;Call for me the old people of Quraish who emigrated in the year of the Conquest of Mecca.&#8221; I called them and they gave a unanimous opinion saying, &#8220;We advise that you should return with the people and do not take them to that (place) of epidemic.&#8221; So &#8216;Umar made an announcement, &#8220;I will ride back to Medina in the morning, so you should do the same.&#8221; Abu &#8216;Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah said (to &#8216;Umar), &#8220;Are you running away from what Allah had ordained?&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Would that someone else had said such a thing, O Abu &#8216;Ubaida! Yes, we are running from what Allah had ordained to what Allah has ordained. Don&#8217;t you agree that if you had camels that went down a valley having two places, one green and the other dry, you would graze them on the green one only if Allah had ordained that, and you would graze them on the dry one only if Allah had ordained that?&#8221; At that time &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf, who had been absent because of some job, came and said, &#8220;I have some knowledge about this. I have heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;If you hear about it (an outbreak of plague) in a land, do not go to it; but if plague breaks out in a country where you are staying, do not run away from it.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Umar thanked Allah and returned to Medina.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.071.632"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the companions of the Prophet came across a tribe amongst the tribes of the Arabs, and that tribe did not entertain them. While they were in that state, the chief of that tribe was bitten by a snake (or stung by a scorpion). They said, (to the companions of the Prophet ), &#8220;Have you got any medicine with you or anybody who can treat with Ruqya?&#8221; The Prophet&#8217;s companions said, &#8220;You refuse to entertain us, so we will not treat (your chief) unless you pay us for it.&#8221; So they agreed to pay them a flock of sheep. One of them (the Prophet&#8217;s companions) started reciting Surat-al-Fatiha and gathering his saliva and spitting it (at the snake-bite). The patient got cured and his people presented the sheep to them, but they said, &#8220;We will not take it unless we ask the Prophet (whether it is lawful).&#8221; When they asked him, he smiled and said, &#8220;How do you know that Surat-al-Fatiha is a Ruqya? Take it (flock of sheep) and assign a share for me.&#8221;</p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.071.633"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the companions of the Prophet passed by some people staying at a place where there was water, and one of those people had been stung by a scorpion. A man from those staying near the water, came and said to the companions of the Prophet, &#8220;Is there anyone among you who can do Ruqya as near the water there is a person who has been stung by a scorpion.&#8221; So one of the Prophet&#8217;s companions went to him and recited Surat-al-Fatiha for a sheep as his fees. The patient got cured and the man brought the sheep to his companions who disliked that and said, &#8220;You have taken wages for reciting Allah&#8217;s Book.&#8221; When they arrived at Medina, they said, &#8216; O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! (This person) has taken wages for reciting Allah&#8217;s Book&#8221; On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;You are most entitled to take wages for doing a Ruqya with Allah&#8217;s Book.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A group of the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle proceeded on a journey till they dismounted near one of the Arab tribes and requested them to entertain them as their guests, but they (the tribe people) refused to entertain them. Then the chief of that tribe was bitten by a snake (or stung by a scorpion) and he was given all sorts of treatment, but all in vain. Some of them said, &#8220;Will you go to the group (those travelers) who have dismounted near you and see if one of them has something useful?&#8221; They came to them and said, &#8220;O the group! Our leader has been bitten by a snake (or stung by a scorpion) and we have treated him with everything but nothing benefited him Has anyone of you anything useful?&#8221; One of them replied, &#8220;Yes, by Allah, I know how to treat with a Ruqya. But. by Allah, we wanted you to receive us as your guests but you refused. I will not treat your patient with a Ruqya till you fix for us something as wages.&#8221; Consequently they agreed to give those travellers a flock of sheep. The man went with them (the people of the tribe) and started spitting (on the bite) and reciting Surat-al-Fatiha till the patient was healed and started walking as if he had not been sick. When the tribe people paid them their wages they had agreed upon, some of them (the Prophet&#8217;s companions) said, &#8220;Distribute (the sheep).&#8221; But the one who treated with the Ruqya said, &#8220;Do not do that till we go to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and mention to him what has happened, and see what he will order us.&#8221; So they came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and mentioned the story to him and he said, &#8220;How do you know that Surat-al-Fatiha is a Ruqya? You have done the right thing. Divide (what you have got) and assign for me a share with you.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet once came out to us and said, &#8220;Some nations were displayed before me. A prophet would pass in front of me with one man, and another with two men, and another with a group of people. and another with nobody with him. Then I saw a great crowd covering the horizon and I wished that they were my followers, but it was said to me, &#8216;This is Moses and his followers.&#8217; Then it was said to me, &#8216;Look&#8221; I looked and saw a big gathering with a large number of people covering the horizon. It was said, &#8220;Look this way and that way.&#8217; So I saw a big crowd covering the horizon. Then it was said to me, &#8220;These are your followers, and among them there are 70,000 who will enter Paradise without (being asked about their) accounts. &#8221; Then the people dispersed and the Prophet did not tell who those 70,000 were. So the companions of the Prophet started talking about that and some of them said, &#8220;As regards us, we were born in the era of heathenism, but then we believed in Allah and His Apostle . We think however, that these (70,000) are our offspring.&#8221; That talk reached the Prophet who said, &#8220;These (70,000) are the people who do not draw an evil omen from (birds) and do not get treated by branding themselves and do not treat with Ruqya, but put their trust (only) in their Lord.&#8221; then &#8216;Ukasha bin Muhsin got up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Am I one of those (70,000)?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then another person got up and said, &#8220;Am I one of them?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8221; &#8216;Ukasha has anticipated you.&#8221;</p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.071.654"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave his verdict about two ladies of the Hudhail tribe who had fought each other and one of them had hit the other with a stone. The stone hit her abdomen and as she was pregnant, the blow killed the child in her womb. They both filed their case with the Prophet and he judged that the blood money for what was in her womb. was a slave or a female slave. The guardian of the lady who was fined said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall I be fined for a creature that has neither drunk nor eaten, neither spoke nor cried? A case like that should be nullified.&#8221; On that the Prophet said, &#8220;This is one of the brothers of soothsayers.</p>

By Allah, we shall never replace you in it at all.&#8221; Then he asked them again, &#8220;If I ask you something, will you tell me the truth?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He asked. &#8220;Have you put the poison in this roasted sheep?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Yes,&#8221; He asked, &#8220;What made you do that?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;We intended to learn if you were a liar in which case we would be relieved from you, and if you were a prophet then it would not harm you.&#8221;</p>

As for the milk of she-asses, we have learnt that Allah&#8217;s Apostle forbade the eating of their meat, but we have not received any information whether drinking of their milk is allowed or forbidden.&#8221; As for the bile of wild animals, Ibn Shihab said, &#8220;Abu Idris Al-Khaulani told me that Allah&#8217;s Apostle forbade the eating of the flesh of every wild beast having fangs . &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(the wife of the Prophet) Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;No  calamity befalls a Muslim but that Allah expiates some of his sins because of it, even  though it were the prick he receives from a thorn.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 70, Number 545: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri and Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;No fatigue, nor disease, nor  sorrow, nor sadness, nor hurt, nor distress befalls a Muslim, even if it were the prick he  receives from a thorn, but that Allah expiates some of his sins for that.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Kab: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The example of a believer is that  of a fresh tender plant, which the wind bends lt sometimes and some other time it makes it  straight. And the example of a hypocrite is that of a pine tree which keeps straight till  once it is uprooted suddenly. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 70, Number 547: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The example of a believer is  that of a fresh tender plant; from whatever direction the wind comes, it bends it, but  when the wind becomes quiet, it becomes straight again. Similarly, a believer is afflicted  with calamities (but he remains patient till Allah removes his difficulties.) And an  impious wicked person is like a pine tree which keeps hard and straight till Allah cuts  (breaks) it down when He wishes.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 558, Vol. 9.) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I visited the Prophet during his ailments and he was  suffering from a high fever. I said, &#8220;You have a high fever. Is it because you will  have a double reward for it?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, for no Muslim is afflicted with any  harm but that Allah will remove his sins as the leaves of a tree fall down.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah&#8217;s Apostle emigrated to Medina, Abu Bakr and  Bilal got a fever. I entered upon them and asked, &#8220;O my father! How are you? O Bilal!  How are you?&#8221; Whenever fever attacked Abu Bakr, he would recite the following poetic  verses: &#8216;Everybody is staying alive among his people, yet death is nearer to him than his  shoe laces.&#8221; And whenever the fever deserted Bilal, he would recite (two poetic  lines): &#8216;Would that I could stay overnight in a valley wherein I would be surrounded by  Idhkhir and Jalil (two kinds of good smelling grass). Would that one day I would drink of  the water of Majinna and would that Shama and Tafil (two mountains at Mecca) would appear  to me.&#8217; Then I came and informed Allah&#8217;s Apostle about that, whereupon he said, &#8220;O  Allah! Make us love Medina as much or more than we love Mecca. O Allah! Make it healthy  and bless its Mudd and Sa for us, and take away its fever and put it in Al&#8217;Juhfa.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Usama bin Zaid said that while he. Sad and Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b  were with the Prophet a daughter of the Prophet sent a message to him, saying. &#8216;My  daughter is dying; please come to us.&#8221; The Prophet sent her his greetings and added  &#8220;It is for Allah what He takes, and what He gives; and everything before His sight  has a limited period. So she should hope for Allah&#8217;s reward and remain patient.&#8221; She  again sent a message, beseeching him by Allah, to come. So the Prophet got up. and so did  we (and went there). The child was placed on his lap while his breath was irregular. Tears  flowed from the eyes of the Prophet. Sad said to him, &#8220;What is this, O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle?&#8221; He said. &#8220;This Is Mercy which Allah has embedded in the hearts of  whomever He wished of His slaves. And Allah does not bestow His Mercy, except on the  merciful among His slaves. (See Hadith No. 373 Vol. 2) </font></p>

No, it  is but a fever that is boiling or harassing an old man and will lead him to his grave  without his will.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Then, yes, it is so.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I visited the Prophet during his illness and touched him  while he was having a fever. I said to him, &#8220;You have a high fever; is it because you  will get a double reward?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes. No Muslim is afflicted with any harm,  but that his sins will be annulled as the leave of a tree fall down.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle entered upon sick man to pay him a visit,  and said to him, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Allah willing, (your sickness will be) an expiation  for your sins.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;No, it is but a fever that is boiling within an  old man and will send him to his grave.&#8221; On that, the Prophet said, &#8220;Then yes,  it is so.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 70, Number 567: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Usama bin Zaid: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet rode a donkey having a saddle with a Fadakiyya  velvet covering. He mounted me behind him and went to visit Sad bin &#8216;Ubada, and that had  been before the battle of Badr. The Prophet proceeded till he passed by a gathering in  which &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul was present, and that had been before &#8216;Abdullah  embraced Islam. The gathering comprised of Muslims, polytheists, i.e., isolators and Jews.  &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha was also present in that gathering. When dust raised by the donkey  covered the gathering, &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai covered his nose with his upper garment and  said, &#8220;Do not trouble us with dust.&#8221; The Prophet greeted them, stopped and  dismounted. Then he invited them to Allah (i.e., to embrace Islam) and recited to them  some verses of the Holy Qur&#8217;an. On that, &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai said, &#8220;O man ! There is  nothing better than what you say if it is true. Do not trouble us with it in our  gathering, but return to your house, and if somebody comes to you, teach him there.&#8221;  On that &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha said, Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Bring your teachings to our  gathering, for we love that.&#8221; So the Muslims, the pagans and the Jews started abusing  each other till they were about to fight. The Prophet kept on quietening them till they  became calm. Thereupon the Prophet mounted his animal and proceeded till he entered upon  Sad bin Ubada. He said to him &#8220;O Sad! Have you not heard what Abu Hubab (i.e.,  &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai) said?&#8221; Sad said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Excuse and forgive him, for  Allah has given you what He has given you. The people of this town (Medina decided  unanimously to crown him and make him their chief by placing a turban on his head, but  when that was prevented by the Truth which Allah had given you he (&#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai) was  grieved out of jealously, and that was the reason which caused him to behave in the way  you have seen.&#8221; </font></p>

He said, &#8220;Do the lice of your head trouble you?&#8221; I said,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; So he called a barber to shave my head and ordered me to make expiation  for that.&#8221; </font></p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;I wish that had happened while I was still living,  for then I would ask Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness for you and invoke Allah for you.&#8221; Aisha  said, &#8220;Wa thuklayah! By Allah, I think you want me to die; and If this should happen,  you would spend the last part of the day sleeping with one of your wives!&#8221; The  Prophet said, &#8220;Nay, I should say, &#8216;Oh my head!&#8217; I felt like sending for Abu Bakr and  his son, and appoint him as my successor lest some people claimed something or some others  wished something, but then I said (to myself), &#8216;Allah would not allow it to be otherwise,  and the Muslims would prevent it to be otherwise&#8221;. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to visit me during my ailment which  had been aggravated during Hajjat-al-Wada&#8217;. I said to him, &#8220;You see how sick I am. I  have much property but have no heir except my only daughter May I give two thirds of my  property in charity?&#8221;! He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Half of it?&#8221; He  said, &#8220;No.&#8221; I said &#8220;One third?&#8221; He said, &#8220;One third is too much,  for to leave your heirs rich is better than to leave them poor, begging of others. Nothing  you spend seeking Allah&#8217;s pleasure but you shall get a reward for it, even for what you  put in the mouth of your wife.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah&#8217;s Apostle was on his death-bed and in the house  there were some people among whom was &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab, the Prophet said, &#8220;Come,  let me write for you a statement after which you will not go astray.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said,  &#8220;The Prophet is seriously ill and you have the Qur&#8217;an; so the Book of Allah is enough  for us.&#8221; The people present in the house differed and quarrelled. Some said &#8220;Go  near so that the Prophet may write for you a statement after which you will not go  astray,&#8221; while the others said as Umar said. When they caused a hue and cry before  the Prophet, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Go away!&#8221; Narrated &#8216;Ubaidullah: Ibn &#8216;Abbas  used to say, &#8220;It was very unfortunate that Allah&#8217;s Apostle was prevented from writing  that statement for them because of their disagreement and noise.&#8221; </font></p>

My nephew is- ill.&#8221; The Prophet touched my head with his hand and  invoked Allah to bless me. He then performed ablution and I drank of the remaining water  of his ablution and then stood behind his back and saw &#8220;Khatam An-Nubuwwa&#8221; (The  Seal of Prophethood) between his shoulders like a button of a tent. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We went to pay a visit to Khabbab (who was sick) and he had  been branded (cauterized) at seven places in his body. He said, &#8220;Our companions who  died (during the lifetime of the Prophet) left (this world) without having their rewards  reduced through enjoying the pleasures of this life, but we have got (so much) wealth that  we find no way to spend It except on the construction of buildings Had the Prophet not  forbidden us to wish for death, I would have wished for it.&#8217; We visited him for the second  time while he was building a wall.

They (the Prophet&#8217;s companions) said, &#8216;Not even you, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8217; He  said, &#8220;Not even myself, unless Allah bestows His favor and mercy on me.&#8221; So be  moderate in your religious deeds and do the deeds that are within your ability: and none  of you should wish for death, for if he is a good doer, he may increase his good deeds,  and if he is an evil doer, he may repent to Allah.&#8221; </font></p>

How are you?&#8221; Whenever Abu Bakr got the fever he used to say, &#8220;Everybody is  staying alive with his people, yet death is nearer to him than his shoe laces.&#8221; And  when fever deserted Bilal, he would recite (two poetic verses): &#8220;Would that I could  stay overnight in a valley wherein I would be surrounded by Idhkhir and Jalil (two kinds  of good smelling grass). Would that one day I could drink of the water of Majinna, and  would that Shama and Tafil (two mountains at Mecca) would appear to me!&#8221; I went to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and informed him about that. He said, &#8220;O Allah! Make us love Medina  as much or more than we love Mecca, and make it healthy, and bless its Sa and its Mudd,  and take away its fever and put it in Al-Juhfa.&#8221; (See Hadith No 558) . </font></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Muhammad bin Saalih Al-&#8216;Uthaimeen<br />
Fusool fis-Siyaam wat-Taraaweeh waz-Zakaat [Upcoming E-Book]<br />
Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Lesson Three: The Ruling on a Sick or Traveling Person Fasting</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says: <b>And whoever amongst you is sick or on a journey, then (he may make up) the same amount of missed days on other days. Allaah wants ease for you and He doesn’t want to make things difficult for you.” </b> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A sick person falls into two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>First:</b> Whoever has an illness that is permanent and there is no anticipation of it being cured (near term), like cancer for example, this person is not required to fast. This is because he does not have a condition in which it is expected that he will be able to do it (i.e. the fast). However, for every day missed, he must feed a needy person whether if it is by him gathering the same amount of needy people as the days he missed and feeding all of them at once as Anas bin Maalik (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) used to do when he was old, or it could be by dividing up the food for the needy people according to the days missed and then giving every needy person a quarter of a Prophetic <i>saa’</i>, i.e. what weighs about half a kilo and 10 grams of good wheat. It is better if one serves meat or fat along with it in order to compliment the meal. The same applies to an elderly person that is not able to fast, in that he should feed a needy person for every day missed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Second:</b> Whoever has a temporary illness that they will recover from, such as a fever and what resembles that. This kind of illness has three scenarios:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Fasting will not burden or cause harm to him. Such a sick person is obligated to fast since he has no excuse to abandon it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Fasting will be difficult on him but it won’t cause any harm to him. In this situation it is detested for him to fast because one is actually refraining from using Allaah’s allowance, while at the same time he is burdening himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Fasting will harm him. In this situation, it is forbidden for him to fast because of the harm that he will be inflicting upon himself. Allaah says: <b>“And do not kill yourselves. Verily Allaah is All-Merciful to you.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Surah An-Nisaa: 29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says: <b>“And do not throw yourselves into destruction with your own hands.”</b> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 195]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in a hadeeth, the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“There is to be no harming (of others) nor harming (of oneself).”</b> Reported by Ibn Maajah and Al-Haakim, and An-Nawawee said: “Its paths of narrations strengthen one another.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One can find out if fasting will be harmful to a sick person by (1) that person feeling it to be harmful on himself or by (2) him being informed of it by a trustworthy doctor. When a person who falls under this category of being sick breaks his fast, he must make up the number of days he missed when he recovers. But if he dies before he recovers then making up the missed days is no longer binding upon him, since he is only obligated to fast the number of days missed on other days, which he was not able to reach.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A traveler falls into two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>First:</b> Whoever intends by traveling to cheat his way out of fasting. It is not permissible for such a person to break his fast, since cheating one’s way out of Allaah’s obligations does not remove those obligations from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Second:</b> Whoever does not intend the above by traveling. This person may fall into one of the following three situations:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Fasting is extremely difficult upon him. In this case, it is forbidden for him to fast since one time “The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) was fasting while on the military expedition to conquer Makkah, when news reached him that the people found it difficult to fast and they were looking at him to see what he would do. So he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) called for a cup of water after ‘Asr and drank from it while the people were looking at him. Later it was said to him: ‘Some people are still fasting.’ So he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) replied: <b>‘Those are the disobedient ones. Those are the disobedient ones.’</b>” [Reported by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Fasting is difficult upon him, but not so severe. In this situation it is detested (makrooh) for him to fast since he is refraining from one of Allaah’s allowances, while putting a burden upon himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Fasting is not difficult upon him. In this case he may do whatever is easiest on him – whether it is fasting or choosing not to fast. This is based on Allaah’s statement: <b>“Allaah wants ease for you and He doesn’t want to make things difficult for you.”</b> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word “want” here takes on the meaning of love (i.e. He loves ease for you). If there is no difference between fasting or not fasting, then fasting is more preferable, because this is what the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) did, as is reported in Saheeh Muslim from Abud-Dardaa (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) who said: “We went out (on a journey) with the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) during Ramadaan under intense heat conditions to the point that each of us would put his hand over his head (to cover it) due to the severe heat (of the sun). And no one would be fasting among us except for the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) and ‘Abdullaah bin Rawaaha.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A traveler is considered to be traveling from the time he leaves his country to the time he returns to it. And if he takes up residency in the land he travels to for a period of time, he is considered to be traveling as long as he holds the intention that he will never reside there after the objective for which he traveled there for in the first place is fulfilled.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he is entitled to all of the allowances a traveler has even if the length of his residency extends for a long time. This is since the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) did not mention any time limit defining when a travel ends. And the foundation with regard to this issue is that one remains in a traveler’s state and under its rules until there comes a proof that the travel has ended and that its rules fail to apply.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no difference in breaking the fast while traveling between a time-constrained travel, such as Hajj, ‘Umrah, visiting a relative, business travel, and so on and between a continuous travel, such as journeys made by car service drivers such as taxis or other larger forms of transportation (i.e. buses). When these drivers exit from their countries, they all enter into the state of travelers and it is permissible for them to do whatever other travelers are permitted to do, such as not fasting during Ramadaan, shortening the four rak’ah prayers into two rak’ahs, and combining the Dhuhr and ‘Asr prayers and Maghrib and ‘Ishaa prayers, when there is a need for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abstaining from the fast is better for them than fasting, if that is easier for them. And they can make up the days missed during the winter. This is because these car service drivers have their own country, which they ascribe to. So when they are in their country, then they are considered residents and whatever applies for or against all other residents also applies for and against them. And when they travel, they are considered travelers and whatever applies in favor or against travelers also applies in favor or against them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"> <strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is the ruling on Insurance, wether it be life insurance or property insurance?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Insuring one&#8217;s life and property is forbidden; it is not permissible due to the fact that Al-Gharar (Uncertainty, Risk or Speculation) and usury are involved therein. And Allah &#8211; the Almighty the All-Powerful &#8211; has forbidden all types of dealings that involver usury and dealings in which there is Al-Gharar (Uncertainty, Risk or Speculation), as a mercy for the (muslim) community and a protection for them for what is harmful to them. Allah &#8211; Most Glorified, Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;where as Allah has permitted trading and forbidden riba&#8221; (usury). Al-Baqarah 2:275</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it has been authentically reported from the Messenger of Allah (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) that he forbade selling AL-Gharar. And Allah is the granter of success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh `Abdul-`Azeez Bin Baz<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">115- Ruling on those who claim to be mediators between mankind and Jinn for the sake of treating incurable diseases</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: I heard that there is a woman who deals with Jinn (creatures created from fire). She was told by Jinn that she will be a good mediator between mankind and Jinn in order to treat incurable diseases that physicians failed to treat. The woman is only a mediator, while the Jinn are the ones who will prescribe medicines and perform operations. But people cannot see them. What is the ruling on this regard?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: There is no basis for what you mentioned and such statements can not be relied upon. The tales of Jinn, very old women and those who serve the Jinn are unauthentic and can not be relied upon. It is not permissible to deem as authentic the sayings of old women, old men, youth or any other person who reports from the Jinn. One should guard himself against using or serving them. This is because if the Jinn use him, they will draw him to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) if they are unbelievers. Moreover, there is no certain way whereby we can distinguish the believer from the unbeliever. They may be hypocrites who deceive Mu&#8217;mins (believers) by these acts. This is because one can not discern their affairs or deal with them openly in order to know their status and morals from authentic sources to distinguish between the reliable and the unreliable ones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Briefly, there is great ambiguity and difference in morals and attributes between us and them whereby we can not know their realities. Whoever is a believer among them, we supplicate to Allah (Exalted be He) to grant him success and guidance. But we can not trust or rely upon them in treating patients, counseling with them or any thing else as this leads to claiming to know the Ghayb (the Unseen). Man may be tried by dealing with the Jinn and thinks that he knows the Ghayb through the Jinn. He will be, in this case, like those people about whom Allah (may He Glorified and Exalted) says: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘And verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter with the males among the jinn, but they (jinn) increased them (mankind) in sin and transgression&#8217;</strong></span>. Man will be in great danger if he deals with the Jinn. They may lead him to commit Shirk, Bid`ah (innovation in religion) and sins. Thus, man can cause harm to himself or to others unknowingly. Consequently, it is not permissible to deal with them for the sake of curing or any other purpose.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one knows or deals with any one of the Jinn, he has to call him to worship Allah alone, teach him goodness, call him to Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah) and obedience to Allah (Exalted be He). One should also advise him to teach others goodness and obedience to Allah (Exalted be He). <strong>But man should not trust them or ask them anything for people because they may give him something that brings harm to people</strong>. They may give him something good and then deceive him. Briefly, he who deals with them faces great danger because one cannot certainly discern their affairs because they see you and you cannot see them. They may conceal many things from you. They may also claim to be Muslims while they are hypocrites. They may deal with you in order to achieve certain purposes and then do whatever they desired when their purposes are achieved. If you deal with them, you will be in danger. Therefore, you have to avoid them<b> </b>except for the sake of calling them to Allah (Exalted be He), informing, and guiding them to the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: There is a woman called Masasah (sucker) who lives in a village. Men and women used to visit her for treatment especially those who suffer diseases in their abdomens, back or chest. Every one pays her one hundred Riyals. If a man suffers pains in his abdomen, she makes him lie down on his back and sucks his abdomen with her mouth. This means that she puts her mouth on the place of pain and sucks like the process of cupping without using anything. Then, she ejects from her mouth a pebble, vein or anything else. Is it permissible to do this? May Allah reward you well!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It seems that this woman is a sorcerer who deceives people by these acts. People think that she has knowledge and extraordinary abilities that are unknown to physicians as she sucks a man&#8217;s abdomen and then ejects pebbles and the like from her mouth. This woman may use the Jinn in order to trick people by showing them that she brings something out of their abdomens while there is nothing. She only deceives people&#8217;s sight as was done by the sorcerers during the confrontation between Musa (Moses) and Pharaoh. She might also have something in her mouth like pebbles upon visiting the patient. Then, she ejects it when she sucks his abdomen in order to convince people that this thing comes out of his abdomen. We believe that it is not permissible to visit or seek treatment with this woman and others like her. This is because this woman and those like her are sorcerers who deceive people with lies or with using Jinn and things that were prohibited by Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) as Shirk and other evil things that she does with patients for the sake of curing them. Briefly, it appears that this woman is a liar and a sorcerers who uses Jinn. Therefore, it is not permissible to visit her or those like her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He who visits a diviner and asks him about anything, his Salahs (Prayers) extending to forty nights will not be accepted</strong></span>. This Hadith was reported by Muslim in his Sahih.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was reported in another narration: He who visits a diviner or a fortuneteller and believes him in what he says disbelieves what was revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This women and those like her lie and invent things that are baseless. These false things are told by Jinn in order to deceive people and lead them astray without knowing the truth. Allah is the One sought for help.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: I have a story that I desire to tell you about in order to give me an interpretation or advice about it. My neighbor&#8217;s daughter who is eighteen years old was sick. She had a psychological disorder. Her father brought her to physicians, but they did not achieve any progress. Then, he brought her to diviners and sorcerers who told him that she was touched by Jinn and they would treat her. The girl stayed with them for one day only. Then, she returned home as she had completely recovered from her disease. She now leads a normal and tranquil life with her father. What is the ruling on this regard? May Allah reward you well!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This may be done by Jinn and their supporters. They may cause harm to a woman or a man in order to make him feel sick. Then, if the guardian of the patient visits them and asks them for help, they will help him and remove the causes of diseases they have done. They do this in order to deceive people and lead them to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and glorifying, resorting, seeking help and invoking Jinn and devils. All these acts are from evil acts and the machinations plotted by devils. Therefore, a Muslim should not be deceived by these things. He should not visit, resort or ask those people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: He who visits a diviner and asks him about anything, his Salah (Prayer) extending to forty nights will not be accepted. And: He (peace be upon him) said when he was asked about diviners: &#8220;Do not visit them!&#8221; He said: &#8220;They are nothing.&#8221; And: He who visits a diviner or a fortuneteller and believes him in what he says disbelieves what was revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him). And: He is not from us; who performs sorcery or has it performed for him, performs divination or has it performed for him or sees an evil omen or has it seen for him. All these acts, machinations and deception do not give people an excuse to visit them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>People should avoid them and seek cure from these diseases through legal remedies which includes reciting the Qur&#8217;an. Reciting the Qur&#8217;an is a remedy for diseases caused by Jinn and others. A Mu&#8217;min (believer) should recite for the patient and supplicate to Allah (Exalted be He) to grant him cure and recovery. Then, harm will be removed by Allah&#8217;s Will. This remedy was tried by the Imams (initiator of a School of Jurisprudence) and scholars in past and modern ages and was a cause of cure and remedy.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one died because of this disease, it would be his moment of death. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) predestined for him to die because of this disease that they think to be the handwork of sorcerers and Jinn. Therefore, one should not prefer his temporal desire for obtaining a cure at their hands through something that causes harm in his religion and incurs Allah&#8217;s wrath upon him to what pleases Allah (Exalted be He) and brings about His satisfaction. Therefore, one should follow legal instructions and remedies. If he dies, he will die according to his appointed moment of death. This is what should man think and do. He is not permitted to visit sorcerers or diviners out of fear of death. All these acts are great falsehoods, mischief in the earth, defiance of religion and aggression against what is legislated by Allah (Glorified be He). Allah is the One sought for help.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">The Ruling Concerning Performing a Cesarean Section</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This issue occurs in one of four situations<strong>:</strong></p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>[1] That the mother is alive and the baby is alive</strong>:  In which case it is not permissible to do any surgical operation except under necessity such as when delivery becomes difficult, etc.  This is because it is not permissible to perform operation when there is no need, as the body is a trust that must be cared for by every person.  He must not do anything that threatens it except for a more useful goal, because the operation may harm the child.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>[2] That both mother and child are dead</strong>:  Here, it is not permissible to perform the operation for there is no benefit in it.</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>[3] That the mother is alive while the child is dead</strong>:  Here it is permissible to perform operation to remove it.  Because, obviously – and Allah knows best – it will not be removed except by an operation.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left:60px;text-align:justify;">&#8211; If there is a fear for the mother with the operation, it is not permissible to perform the operation as the fear of the harm prevents doing what may benefit.<br />
&#8211; If the possibility of harm is very low, and the child may continue to remain in her womb, then there is no problem with the operation, because the continued existence of the baby in her womb prevents her from pregnancy.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>[4] That the mother is dead while the baby is alive</strong>:  Hanbali scholars have stated that it is forbidden to operate in order to remove the child.  Their reason for this ruling is that is involves mutilation and a transgression upon an honour that is existent for the sake of a life supposed to be existent, except where part of the child has started coming out, in which case it is allowed to operate to bring out the rest.  They said, ‘it is allowed for a midwife to pounce on it so as to force it out’.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibnul-Qayyim stated in his book – I’laa, al-Muwaaqqi’een [3/413] – that is was said to Imam Ahmad that Sufyaan was asked concerning a woman who died with a baby moving in her womb, that he said: “I don’t see anything wrong with slitting her stomach to remove it.”  On hearing this, Ahmad said:  ‘Evil indeed is what he said.’  And he continued to repeat that, saying ‘Subhaanallah – glory be to Allah, ‘Evil indeed is what he said.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say [the author], the reasoning of our scholars, which is that this involves mutilation, implies that it should be permissible in these days since the operation does not involve any mutilation.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Based on this, the correct view is that of Sufyaan, which is that it is compulsory (Waajib) to operate if there is a high probability of the baby’s safety,</li>
<li>Or strongly encouraged (Mustahab), if it is likely that he survives,</li>
<li>And permissible (Mubaah), where there is a low chance of its survival.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>This is so because of many reasons:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>One</strong>:  Because it is based on that which was forbidden by our scholars, their reason no longer existent as, once the stomach is incised and then stitched back, after removing the baby, there is no mutilation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Two</strong>:  The honour of the living is greater than that of the dead.  So, if we were to assume that incising her stomach involves dishonouring her, then doing that is less than dishonouring the living (baby which is exposed to death).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Three</strong>:  The baby is a living and honourable human being exposed to death, and operating to remove it involves saving a human soul from death, which is compulsory, as the benefit can be achieved without any harm.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Four</strong>:  That our scholars have permitted operating the case of a child who is half into the world, to remove the rest – based on the reason that his life is known (for sure), whereas before it comes out its life is only imaginary – implies that there shouldn’t be a difference between the two situations, before or after it has started coming out, so long as we are sure of its life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Five</strong>:  The benefit in it outweighs the harm and it is well known that Islam either compels Muslims or encourages them (to do things) whenever their benefit is higher than their harm; For there is no doubt that incising the stomach of a dead, pregnant woman, to save her baby is a benefit that outweighs the harm in it.  Hence, the thing boils down to either being compulsory  or encouraged, or (at worst) permissible, according to the level of hope in saving the life of the child, or otherwise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">There are some people who write amulets for sick, insane, and psychiatric patients including in them parts of the Qurýan and Sunnah we never vouch for the sound creed of such people. We advised them against doing so, but they refused to listen, saying: We write only what is in the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam), which is not prohibited. Some of these amulets are worn by the patients themselves, or by an impure woman such as a menstruating woman, or a woman in her postnatal, or an insane, an under age child who does not know how to clean himself. Is this permissible?</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) permitted incantations with Qur&#8217;anic recitation, and supplications, as long as they do not include Shirk, or meaningless words. Muslim narrated in his Sahih that Auf bin Malik said: We used to use incantations in the pre-Islamic era, so we asked the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam): What formula should we recite for that purpose? He said: <span style="color:#008000;">Let me hear what you say. There is no harm in incantations as long as they do not include Shirk in them</span>. [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Scholars have unanimously agreed on the permissibility of incantations provided they meet the above condition, and believing that it has no effect without the Will of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is rather, Shirk according to the Hadith which is narrated by Imam Ahmad in which Imran bin Husain, may Allaah be pleased with him, reported that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) <span style="color:#008000;">saw a man wearing a copper bangle on his arm, and he asked him: What is this? He said: I am wearing it for cephalic weakness. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: Remove it, for it will not increase you in anything except weakness, and if you should die while you are wearing it, you would never be successful. </span>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another version narrated by Ahmad, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: <span style="color:#008000;">He who wears an amulet commits Shirk</span>. [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also narrated by Ahmad and others that Ibn Mas&#8217;ud, may Allaah be pleased with him, said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah saying: <span style="color:#008000;">Verily, incantations amulets and Tiwalah [5] are Shirk</span>. [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If the worn amulet contains Qur&#8217;anic words, then it is, prohibited according to the preponderant opinion for three reasons:</strong> </span></p>
<ol>
<li>The general prohibition of wearing any kind of amulets according to the Prophetic traditions with no exception.</li>
<li>Leaving no excuse for wearing amulets that contain other than Qur&#8217;anic formulas.</li>
<li>Amulets that are worn are usually subject to disrespect by taking them into washrooms, or wearing them during intercourse or the like.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">As for writing a Surah or a Verse on a slate or on a sheet, and washing the writing with water and saffron, to drink that water for the hope of gaining blessings, knowledge, wealth, good health, or the like, we have never heard that such was done by the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) for himself or for someone else.</span> He neither permitted any of his Companions to do so, nor did he give the permission to his Ummah to do so, even though the needs for doing so are existent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Based on the above, it is better to avoid doing so, and be content with what is authentically approved of incantations of Qur&#8217;anic recitation, the beautiful Names of Allaah, the authentic supplications, or the like, whose meaning are clear and they are free from the blemishes of Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should seek nearness to Allaah by doing only the permissible things for the hope of gaining reward, relief, and gaining beneficial knowledge. This should be sufficient, and he who is content with what Allaah has legitimized, Allaah renders him free from the need of someone else. It is only Allaah Who grants success.</p>
