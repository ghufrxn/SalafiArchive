<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Foundations of the Innovated Sects are Four</span><br />
Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 64 : Point 110</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b style="color:#993300;">Know that the roots of innovations (</b><em style="color:#993300;font-weight:bold;">Al-Bid&#8217;ah</em><b style="color:#993300;">) are four. From these seventy-two innovated sects branch off, each one of these have offshoots until they amount to two thousand eight hundred. All of them are misguidance. And all of them will be in the Fire except for one, which is those who believe in what is contained in this book, and who holds it as his creed, without having any </b><span style="color:#993300;"><b>uncertainty</b></span><b style="color:#993300;"> in his heart or any doubts. He will be a person of the Sunnah and he is the one who will be saved, if Allah wills </b></span>[1].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] That is, whatever the book comprises of, from the sayings of Allah, the words of His Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) and that which the Companions were united upon.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 54: Point 90D &amp; 90E</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:(90D)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And they called to sectarianism (<em>furqah)</em> and Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, forbade sectarianism. Some of them declared others to be disbelievers. And everyone called to his own opinion and to calling those who disagreed with him disbelievers. So the ignorant people, the rabble and those having no knowledge went astray. They caused the people to become greedy for the things of this life and to fear worldly punishment. So the people followed them upon fear regarding their religion and out of hope for what they possessed from this world</span>.</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And they called to sectarianism and Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, has forbidden sectarianism.”</span> </strong>Allaah has forbidden sectarianism, splitting; <em>al-furqah</em>. So He said:</p>
<p><strong>وَلَا تَكُونُوا كَالَّذِينَ تَفَرَّقُوا وَاخْتَلَفُوا مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَهُمُ الْبَيِّنَاتُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And do not be like those who split up and differed after the clear signs had come to them.</span> </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah</em> 105)</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا تَفَرَّقَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ إِلَّا مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَتْهُمُ الْبَيِّنَةُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And those who were given the scripture did not differ except after the clear truth had come to them.</strong></span>(Sooratul-Bayyinah (98), <em>aayah</em> 4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they differed and split not upon ignorance but rather upon knowledge; `<em>ilm</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying,<span style="color:#993300;"> <strong>“And some of them declared others to be disbelievers,” </strong></span>The <em>firaq</em> (sects) started declaring each other to be disbelievers. And this is a sign which is manifest upon them. And this is a proof that they are all upon falsehood. As for the people of the truth and the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> then they do not declare each other to be disbelievers. Rather, they are friends and allies to each other, they love each other and they support each other and they advise each other. And likewise, they do not declare the other sects to be disbelievers except for what the Book and the Sunnah proves to be disbelief. Otherwise, it is the case that they (the people of sunnah) are justly balanced with regard to the matter of <em>Takfeer</em>. They do not declare anyone a disbeliever except for those whom the proof is established that he is a disbeliever and they are not hasty with regard to this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and each one called to his own opinion and to declaring those who disagreed with him to be disbelievers.” </strong></span>This is a sign of the people of misguidance. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>فَتَقَطَّعُوا أَمْرَهُم بَيْنَهُمْ زُبُرًا ۖ كُلُّ حِزْبٍ بِمَا لَدَيْهِمْ فَرِحُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So they split into parties and sects, each one following a separate book, every group rejoicing in what it was upon.</strong></span>(Sooratul-Mu·minoon (23), <em>aayah </em>53)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Zuburan</em>; meaning books. They authored books and this occurs. They author books to support their own position and their own party and they rejoice in what they are upon. And if they had just been upon ignorance then it could be hoped that they would return. However, they rejoice in what they are upon from falsehood and they believe it to be the truth. And this is a punishment from Allaah for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“So the ignorant people and the <em>ra`aa`</em> (the common rabble) and those who had no knowledge went astray.”</span> </strong>They led the ignorant people astray and the rubble and those who had no knowledge. But as for the people of the truth and the people of knowledge then they are not affected by these sects and these misguidances because they know that it is falsehood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And they caused the people to become greedy for things of this world and they cause them to fear the punishment of this world.” </strong></span>That is from the means which they utilise in their trial that they give their followers some of the things, which they crave after.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So the creation followed them therefore, upon fear with regard to their religion and upon hope with regard to what they had of this world.” </strong></span>Many of the people have love of this world so therefore, they will follow anyone who will give them anything from wealth even if he is upon falsehood as a result of their craving for wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Point Continues </strong></span></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:(90E)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>So the <em>Sunnah</em> and the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> were suppressed and innovations appeared and became widespread. The people committed disbelief in many ways, which they were not aware of. They applied analogy and considered the ability of the Lord, His signs, His rulings, His commands and His prohibitions according to their own intellects and opinions. So whatever accorded with their intellects, they accepted it and whatever ran contrary to their intellects, they rejected it. So Islaam became a stranger and the <em>Sunnah</em> became a stranger and the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> became strangers within their own homes.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So the <em>Sunnah</em> and the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> became suppressed and innovations appeared and became widespread.” </strong></span>After the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> had been apparent in the <em>quroon al-mufa<u>dd</u>alah</em> (most excellent generations) and the people of evil had been subdued, then the affair became turned around and the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> became suppressed and the people of falsehood became apparent. However, this will not persist. Even if the people of falsehood become apparent at one time then they will decline in the future and they will collapse in the future. And the final outcome will always be for the people of <em>Taqwa</em>; those who are dutiful to their Lord. And Imaam Ibn ul-Qayyim <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said:<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And the truth is aided and tested so do not be surprised for this is the way of the Most Merciful.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And they applied analogy,” </strong></span>Analogy (<em>Qiyaas)</em>, meaning in `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) because `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) has no analogy in it because it is <em>tawqeefeeyah</em> (reliant upon direct text). Action with regard to it is not upon except a proof. And no analogy is made in matters of creed and belief. Analogy can only be in <em>fiqh</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and they considered the ability of the Lord and His signs and His rulings and His commands and His prohibitions in accordance with their intellects and their own opinions.” </strong></span>This is al <em>qiyaasul baa<u>t</u>il</em> (the false and futile analogy) making analogy with regard to Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, the One Who cannot be imagined by their minds and their opinions. So they rebut based upon the analogy of their intellects, the speech of Allaah and the speech of His Messenger.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So whatever conformed with their intellects, they accepted it and whatever was contrary to their intellects, they rejected it.” </strong></span>So they make their intellects and their opinions the judge, so whatever conflicts with it, they reject it, either by <em>ta·weel</em> (interpreting it away) or by <em>raf<u>d</u></em> (directly rejecting it) and not accepting it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying,<span style="color:#993300;"> <strong>“So therefore, Islaam became a stranger and the <em>Sunnah</em> became a stranger and the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> became strangers within their own homes.” </strong></span>Just as he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Islaam began as a stranger and it will return to being a stranger just the same as it began. So give glad tidings of a tree in Paradise to the strangers.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>So then they said, “Who are the strangers O Messenger of Allaah?” So he said, “Those who are upon correctness when the people become corrupted.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And in one narration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Those who correct whatever the people corrupt.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They correct themselves are upon correctness and they correct whatever the people have corrupted. They are the <em>ghurabaa</em> (strangers). Why are they called strangers (<em>ghurabaa)</em>? Because those who contradict them are many and those who criticise them are many, so they are strangers amongst the people of their own lands and the people of their own time.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Translator’s side point: Some of the versions have at the end , <strong>“So the people followed them upon fear regarding their worldly life and out of hope for what they possessed from this world.”</strong> <em>W`Allaahu A`lam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Translator’s side point: Quote being from his famous poem <em>Al-Kaffiyaat ash-Shaafiyah</em> along with the explanation of it, they give a reference there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> mentioned in his explanation, “This seems to be referring to the like of the Jahmiyyah and the Mu`tazilah. They brought this matter of analogy and their intellect into the religion and used it to reject the texts; texts with regard to the attributes of Allaah, the Most High and other than them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> <strong>Shaykh Aal Ash Shaykh</strong> continues with the wordings of the <u>h</u>adeeth but this part of the <u>h</u>adeeth is reported by Muslim (145) of a hadeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> without what follows in the main text here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also reported by Muslim (146) from Ibn `Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhuma</em> from the Prophet that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Islaam began as a stranger and it will return to being a stranger just as it began and it will retreat between the two mosques just as a snake returns to its hole.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5">[5]</a> As for the wording, when the companions asked,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Who are the strangers, O Messenger of Allaah? Then he replied, “They are those who are upon correctness when the people become corrupted.”</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This wording is reported by A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>abaraaniyy in <em>Al-Mu`jam al-Kabeer</em> and <em>Al-Mu`jam al-Awsa<u>t</u></em>, <em>Al-Mu`jam as-Sageer</em> from Sahl ibn Sa`d as-Saai`dee. Al-Haythamee said in <em>Majma` az-Zawaa`id</em>, its narrators are those of the <em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> except for Bakr ibn Sulaym and he was reliable as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a side point, Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy declared this narration authentic in <em>As-<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> under <u>h</u>adeeth no. 1273,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The strangers are those who are upon correctness themselves when the people become corrupted.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the last wording that’s mentioned, <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“They are those who correct whatever the people corrupt,”</strong> </span>that is reported by At-Tirmidhiyy and A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>abaraaniyy in <em>al-Kabeer</em> from a narration of `Amr ibn `Awf that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The religion began as a stranger and it will return to being a stranger. So give glad tidings to the strangers, those who rectify what the people have corrupted after me from my Sunnah.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as a<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>irmidhiyy said, “This <u>h</u>adeeth is <em><u>h</u>asan, <u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (good, authentic).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Shaykh al-Albaaniyy in his checking of <u>T</u>irmidhiyy declared this particular report here as <em><u>d</u>a`eef jiddan</em> (very weak, not authentic).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the footnote also, they mention a further wording reported by Ibn Abee Shaybah and Imaam A<u>h</u>mad and ad-Daarimee and Ibn Maajah and others from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Ibn Mas`ood that contains the wording, it was said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Who are the strangers? And that he said, “An-nuzzaa` minal qabaa-il (they are the scattered ones from amongst the tribes).” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They mention here that Imaam al-Bukhaariyy declared that narration to be <u>h</u>asan, as was reported from him by his student, a<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>irmidhiyy. And Al-Baghawee said in <em>Shar<u>h</u>us Sunnah</em>, the <u>h</u>adeeth is <em>sa<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> <em>gareeb</em> with a singular chain. And again this particular report here was declared <em>da`eef</em> by Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy in the checking of <em>Sunan Ibn Maajah</em>, <em>W`Allaahu A`lam</em>.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 52: Point 90A</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said, “My nation will divide into 73 sects; all of them shall be in the Fire except one, and it is the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>; the united body upon the truth.” It was said, “Who are they, O Messenger of Allaah?” He said, “That which I and my companions are upon today.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/my-ummah-will-divide-into-73-sects-all-of-them-shall-be-in-the-fire-except-one" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And you should know that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said, “My nation will divide into 73 sects, all of them in the Fire except one and it is <em>al-Jamaa`ah</em>; the united body upon the truth,” </strong></span>Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, commanded us to unite; to become <em>ijtimaa</em>` upon the truth.</p>
<p><strong>وَاعْتَصِمُوا بِحَبْلِ اللَّهِ جَمِيعًا وَلَا تَفَرَّقُوا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And cling together to the rope of Allaah and do not separate. </strong></span>(Soorah Aali-Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>103)</p>
<p><strong>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ فَرَّقُوا دِينَهُمْ وَكَانُوا شِيَعًا لَّسْتَ مِنْهُمْ فِي شَيْءٍ ۚ إِنَّمَا أَمْرُهُمْ إِلَى اللَّهِ ثُمَّ يُنَبِّئُهُم بِمَا كَانُوا يَفْعَلُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Those who split up their religion and become sects, you have nothing to do with them. Their affair is just with Allaah. Then He will inform them of what they used to do. </strong>(</span>Sooratul An`aam (6), <em>aayah </em>159)</p>
<p><strong>وَلَا تَكُونُوا كَالَّذِينَ تَفَرَّقُوا وَاخْتَلَفُوا مِن بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَهُمُ الْبَيِّنَاتُ ۚ وَأُولَٰئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And do not be like those who split and differed after the clear signs have come to them. And they are the ones for whom will be a tremendous punishment. </strong></span>(Soorah Aali-Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>105)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He forbade us from splitting and He commanded us with uniting and with clinging on to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger. So He said:</p>
<p><strong>وَأَنَّ هَٰذَا صِرَاطِي مُسْتَقِيمًا فَاتَّبِعُوهُ ۖ وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا السُّبُلَ فَتَفَرَّقَ بِكُمْ عَن سَبِيلِهِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And this is my straight way so follow it and do not follow the divergent paths for they will split you and lead you away from His path.</span> </strong>(Sooratul An`aam (6), <em>aayah </em>153)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not permissible to split and differ on account of desires or on account of <em>taqleed</em> (blindly following) fathers and forefathers or as a result of blindly following the Jews and the Christians. Differing is not permissible in the matters of `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) and in the fundamentals of the religion. Rather, it is obligatory to agree and to be united with regard to it. As for differing in issues of <em>fiqh</em> then this occurs. However, it is obligatory to return and refer back to those sayings which the proof establishes. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>فَإِن تَنَازَعْتُمْ فِي شَيْءٍ فَرُدُّوهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَالرَّسُولِ إِن كُنتُمْ تُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ وَأَحْسَنُ تَأْوِيلًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So if you dispute about anything then refer it back to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger if you truly believe in Allaah and in the Last Day. That is better and finer in its outcome.</span> </strong>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), <em>aayah </em>59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore <em>ikhtilaaf</em> (differing) in `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) is not permissible because `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) is <em>tawqeefeeyah</em> (reliant upon text). It is not a place for <em>ijtihaad</em> (scholarly deduction). But as for the issues of <em>fiqh</em> and <em>istinbaat</em> (deduction of rulings) then in that case, each one of the People of Knowledge in that matter who are suitable to promote <em>ijtihaad</em> can strive to deduce rulings and they may differ in their outlooks. However, they should not just remain upon their differing. Rather, they should refer back to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger. So, whoever has proof then they should follow him and take his saying and leave their own opinions. This is the position of the people of the Sunnah and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em> and this is what the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> directed us to. As for our saying, leave the people and let everyone have his own opinion and the differing of the nation is a mercy as they say then we say <em>haathaa baatil </em>(this is false and futile). Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَلَا يَزَالُونَ مُخْتَلِفِينَ</strong><br />
<strong>إِلَّا مَن رَّحِمَ رَبُّكَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they will continue to disagree except for those who your Lord has mercy upon.</span> </strong>(Soorah Hood (11), <em>aayah </em>118-119)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying, <strong>“Except for those who your Lord has mercy upon,” </strong>indicates that those whom Allaah has mercy upon do not differ and that differing is a punishment (<em>a<u>th</u>aab)</em> and is not a mercy (a <em>ra<u>h</u>mah)</em>. Mercy is for those who do not differ and if they do differ then they refer back to the Book and the Sunnah and they take what is correct and they leave what is wrong. This is the way of <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for each one remaining upon his own opinion and what so and so said and so and so then this is not the way of the Muslims. This is the way of the <em>Ahlul-Ahwaa</em> (innovated sects) and the People of <em>Shahawaat</em> (followers of desires). They search for whatever saying will conform to their desires and whatever will conform to what they want and whatever differs with their desires, they abandon it even if the Imaam whom they say that they take his saying says it. Meaning, they do not accept from the sayings of the Imaams and the scholars except what is in accordance with their desires. As for what contradicts their desires then they reject it. So, this is a proof that they are just following their own desires, whatever conforms with their desires they accept it and whatever is contrary to their desires they abandon it. <em>Wa laa <u>h</u>awla wa laa quwatta illaa billaah</em> (and there is no movement and no ability except with the aid of Allaah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is what is called to nowadays in the newspapers and magazines and meetings and conferences mostly and upon the channels. They promote disagreement and they say we are just making things open and easy for the people. With what are we making things open and easy for the people? With abandonment of the Book and the Sunnah and with going along with sayings whose people are not secure from error; those who make errors sometimes and are correct sometimes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whereas they; meaning the Imaams of the past, they forbade us from taking their sayings except what accords with the proof. They forbade us from taking their sayings, which are in contrary to the proof. So, this is a matter, which it is obligatory to be aware of because the people today have been put to trial on account of those people who confuse things for the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So his saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And you should know that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said, my nation will split into 73 sects, all of them will be in the Fire except one,” </strong></span>This <u>h</u>adeeth is authentic, when its chains of narration are gathered and its many narrations and the Imaams reported in their works and speak in praise of it and actual circumstances testify to its truth. So he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed that this nation of Muhammad will split into 73 sects and these are the major fundamental sects and there are actually more than these sects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said all of them will be in the Fire, meaning the 72, all of them will be in the Fire except for one and it is the 73<sup>rd</sup> one, which is that which is upon the like of what the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his companions were upon. So it is what will be saved from the Fire. And therefore, they are called <strong><em>al-Firqatun Naajiyah</em></strong> (the saved sect) and they are called <strong><em>Ahl-us-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em></strong> (the People of the Sunnah and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>); the united body upon the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whatever is beside them then they are opposers to the truth under the threat of the Hellfire. So from them will be those who enter the Fire on account of disbelief (<em>kufr)</em> and from them will be those who enter the Fire on account of <em>fisq</em> (evil doing) and from them will be those who enter the Fire on account of <em>ma`<u>s</u>iyyah</em> (sin, disobedience). They are not all the same with regard to entering the Fire. So it is not to be taken from this <u>h</u>adeeth that these sects, all of them are disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“</span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And it is the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>; the united body,”</span> </strong><em>Al-Jamaa`ah</em> (united body) is whoever is upon the truth even if it is a single person. This is the <em>Jamaa`ah</em> (the united body). As for <em>Al-Kathrah</em> (being numerous on its own); a group being numerous then this on its own does not indicate the truth. He, the Most High said:</p>
<p><strong>وَإِن تُطِعْ أَكْثَرَ مَن فِي الْأَرْضِ يُضِلُّوكَ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And if you were to obey most of those upon the earth, they will lead you astray from the path of Allaah.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-An`aam (6), <em>aayah </em>116)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا أَكْثَرُ النَّاسِ وَلَوْ حَرَصْتَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And most of mankind even if you eagerly wish will not be believers.</span> </strong>(Soorah Yoosuf (12), <em>aayah </em>103)</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا وَجَدْنَا لِأَكْثَرِهِم مِّنْ عَهْدٍ ۖ وَإِن وَجَدْنَا أَكْثَرَهُمْ لَفَاسِقِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We have not found most of them to be true to their covenant, We have found most of them to be disobedient ones. </strong></span>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>102)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So being numerous is not what is counted. What is counted is those who are upon the truth even if they are few in number, even if it is a single person then he will be the <em>Jamaa`ah</em> (the body upon the truth).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“<strong>It was said, “Who are they O Messenger of Allaah? He said, “That which is upon that which I and my companions are upon today.” </strong></span>This is the correct path, those who are upon that which the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his companions were upon, they are the <em>Jamaa</em>`<em>ah</em> (the united body upon the truth).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Advice to the Salafiyyoon</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brothers, use <strong>beneficial knowledge</strong> and <strong>solid proof</strong> and <strong>beneficial wisdom</strong> in your <em>Dawa’</em>. You should have all the noble and <strong>beautiful manners</strong> encouraged by the Book and the Messenger of guidance; indeed they are causes for victory and causes for success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You have to believe that the Companions did not spread Islaam or enter it into the hearts except with their <strong>wisdom</strong> and their <strong>knowledge</strong> more so than with their swords.  However, whoever enters into Islaam under the sword might not be firm, but whoever enters Islaam by way of knowledge, proof and evidence then this is what makes his Eemaan firm by Allaah’s permission and His assistance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is upon you to have these good methods and also to be serious about knowledge.  You have to be serious about <em>Dawa’</em> to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now – O brothers – I advise you with two issues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: Brotherhood between all of <em>Ahl -ul-Sunnah</em>; So O you Salafees, disseminate the soul of love and brotherhood between yourselves.  Put into effect what the Messenger of Allaah <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> informed us of regarding the believers: ‘Like a building, some of its parts supporting others.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that they are: ‘<strong>Like a single body if one limb complains then the rest of the body suffers with fever and insomnia</strong>.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is how you should be O brothers: distance yourselves from the causes of splitting, I swear by Allaah indeed it is a dangerous evil and a disastrous disease.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: distance yourselves from the causes which lead to enmity, hatred, splitting up and dissension.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Keep away from these things; because this has become predominant nowadays at the hands of people, about whom only Allaah knows their condition and intent.  It has become predominant and has torn apart the youth in this country – whether in the university or other than it – or in the other parts of the <em>Duniya</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why?! Because those who are not from its people – neither in knowledge nor in understanding – entered into the arena of giving <em>Dawa’</em> to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is possible that the enemies could have entered someone into the midst of the<em>Salafeeyeen</em> to tear them apart and split them up, and this issue is not unlikely, rather it can truly happen <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Strive to have brotherhood.  If any dissension has occurred between you, then both parties should make themselves forget what is past and start with a clean slate now.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say to the brothers: whoever falls short it is not allowed to debase him, nor destroy the one who is deficient.  Whoever makes a mistake amongst us we do not destroy him. <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em> – but we cure him with gentleness, wisdom and face him with love and friendship and all the rest of the righteous manners, along with the correct <em>Dawa’</em> until he repents.  And if there remains a weakness in him then we are not hasty with him, or otherwise, I swear by Allaah no one will remain, no one will remain!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are some people now who chase after the Salafis so much so that they reached the scholars and called them those who water things down <em>(Mumaya’een)</em>!! There is hardly any scholar in the arena of <em>Dawa’</em> today except that he has been falsely attacked with this claim about him!  Of course this is the way of the Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen and the way of <em>Ahl-ul-Bida’</em> since, from the weapons of the <em>Ahl ul-Bid</em>a’ is that they begin by overthrowing the scholars, rather it is the Jewish Masonic way: that if you wanted to discredit an idea, then discredit their scholars or their personalities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So keep away from this rotten legacy and have respect for the scholars.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="dropcap">
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a unanimous agreement amongst Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah that it is an obligation to stick to the <strong>Jamaa&#8217;ah </strong>[1] and that it is forbidden to break away from it, and that sticking to it is a virtue while separating oneself away from it is a vice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many evidences from the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah, reaching the level of tawaatur, have been reported concerning this, and likewise there are many narrations from the Salaf with this regard. Allaah says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;And hold onto the Rope of Allaah, all of you together, and be not divided&#8230;&#8221;</b></span> [Surah Aali &#8216;Imraan: 103]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abee Haatim [2] said: &#8220;My father narrated to me saying: &#8216;Amr Ibn &#8216;Alee As-Sairafee informed me, saying: &#8216;Abdu Rabbihi Ibn Baariq Al-Hanafee &#8211; and he praised him with good &#8211; narrated to me, saying: Simaak Ibn Al-Waleed Al-Hanafee narrated to me that he met Ibn &#8216;Abbaas in Madeenah and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;What do you say about a ruler who governs us, yet oppresses and abuses us, shall we not prevent him?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Ibn &#8216;Abbaas said: &#8216;No, obey him, O Hanafee.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said: &#8216;O Hanafee, the Jamaa&#8217;ah, the Jamaa&#8217;ah! Indeed, the nations that came before you were only destroyed because of their splitting up. Did you not hear Allaah say: <b>&#8216;And hold onto the Rope of Allaah, all of you together, and be not divided&#8230;'&#8221;</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Atiyyah said in his Tafseer:[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The expressions of the scholars of Tafseer have varied with regard to the meaning of this (part of the) ayah <b>&#8216;The Rope of Allaah.&#8217;</b> So Ibn Mas&#8217;ood said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>&#8216;The Rope of Allaah is the Jamaa&#8217;ah.&#8217; </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas Ibn Maalik narrated that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8216;Indeed, the tribe of Israa&#8217;eel split up into seventy-one sects. And my ummah (nation) will split up into seventy-two sects &#8211; all of them will be in the Hellfire except one.&#8217;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it was said to him: &#8216;O Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه و سلم), which is this (saved) one?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) clenched his fist and said: <b>&#8216;The Jamaa&#8217;ah.&#8217;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he recited the ayah: <b>&#8216;And hold onto the Rope of Allaah, all of you together.&#8217;</b>[4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas&#8217;ood said in one of his khutbahs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;All of you together, adhere to obedience (of Allaah) and the Jamaa&#8217;ah, for indeed it is the Rope of Allaah that He has commanded us with.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qataadah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8216;The Rope of Allaah that He commanded us to hold onto is the Qur&#8217;aan.&#8217;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Suddee said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8216;The Rope of Allaah refers to the Book of Allaah.&#8217;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas&#8217;ood and Ad-Dahhaak also said this. And other things have been said, all of which are similar to what has been mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word <b><i>jamee&#8217;an</i></b> (all of you together) is connected to the command &#8216;Itasimoo (Hold onto), so the meaning becomes: <b>&#8216;Be united upon your mutual holding of it (the Rope of Allaah).&#8217;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8216;And be not divided&#8217;</b> refers to the kind of division that leads to not uniting for Jihaad and for protecting the Religion and the Word of Allaah. This is the dividing that comes from tribulations (fitan) and dividing in matters of Creed.&#8221; [End of Ibn &#8216;Atiyyah&#8217;s words, rahimahullaah]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say that their differing on the tafseer of the part of the verse: <b>&#8220;Rope of Allaah&#8221;</b> is a differing indicating variety in meaning, not a contradiction in meaning, as has been indicated here by Ibn &#8216;Atiyyah, Ibn &#8216;Abdil-Barr and other muhaqqiqeen. And his interpreting it to be the Book of Allaah combines all of the mentioned statements (of the Salaf). [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Qurtubee mentioned in his Tafseer[6] the opinion of those who say that the <b>&#8220;Rope of Allaah&#8221;</b> means the Qur&#8217;aan and the opinion of those who say it means the Jamaa&#8217;ah. Then he said: &#8220;The intended meanings are all close and similar for indeed Allaah commands unity and forbids division. This is since division is destruction while the Jamaa&#8217;ah is salvation.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The <b>&#8216;Rope of Allaah&#8217;</b> has been interpreted as Allaah&#8217;s Book (i.e. the Qur&#8217;aan), His Religion, Islaam, Sincerity, His Command, His covenant, Obedience to Him and as the Jamaa&#8217;ah. All of these sayings have been stated by the Companions and those who followed them in goodness until the Day of Judgement. And all of it is correct, for the Qur&#8217;aan commands towards the Religion of Islaam &#8211; and this is Allaah&#8217;s Command, His covenant and obedience to Him. And adhering to it <i>jamee&#8217;an</i> (in a unified group) can only be done with the Jamaa&#8217;ah. And the Religion of Islaam in reality is Sincerity to Allaah.&#8221; [7]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By this, it is understood that their sayings (i.e. of the Salaf) in their interpretation of <b>&#8220;The Rope of Allaah&#8221;</b> are not contradictory of one another but rather each saying compliments the other such that Allaah&#8217;s intended meaning becomes clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jareer At-Tabaree reported in his Tafseer [8] that Qataadah said concerning the ayah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And do not be divided &#8211; and remember Allaah&#8217;s blessing on you.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily, Allaah hates that you be divided &#8211; and He forbade you from it. And He loves that you hear and obey and (stick to) the Jamaa&#8217;ah. So love for yourselves what Allaah loves for you &#8211; if you are able. And there is no might except by (the leave of) Allaah.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="dropcap">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="bodytext"><span class="bodytext">Allaah (subhanaha wa ta&#8217;aala) said: </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="bodytext" style="color:#008000;"><span class="bodytext"><b>&#8220;Those who were given the Scriptures did not differ except out of mutual jealousy and hatred (bagyan) after knowledge had come to them.&#8221; </b></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="bodytext"><span class="bodytext">Informing that their differing arose after the coming of knowledge that made clear to them as to what they should steer clear of &#8211; for indeed Allaah does not let a people become misguided after He guided them except after telling them what they should steer clear of. And informing that they differed only due to the reason of <strong>mutual jealousy and hatred</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="bodytext"><span class="bodytext"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Al-Bagy</strong></span> means to exceed the proper bounds as was indicated by Ibn Umar (in his commentary to the verse): &#8216;arrogance and jealousy&#8217; &#8211; this arising due to differing ijtihaads that were not based upon knowledge. What is not meant by al-Bagy is the permissible difference that arises between the scholars for al-Bagy is either the neglect or omission of the truth, or exceeding the proper bounds. <strong><span style="color:#808000;">Exceeding the proper bounds either by leaving an obligatory action or by performing a forbidden action and it is known that splitting and disunity is the outcome of this</span></strong>.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of this lies in what He said about the People of the Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">And from those who call themselves Christians, We took their covenant but they abandoned (or forgot) a portion of the Message that was sent to them. So we planted enmity and hatred till the Day of Resurrection</span>.&#8221;</b> (5:14)</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So He informed us that in their forgetting/abandoning a portion of the Message &#8211; meaning leaving a portion of that which they were commanded with &#8211; lay the reason for their enmity and hatred.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what is occurring amongst the adherents of our religion and it can be found amongst the various parties that differ with regards to their principles and many subsidiary matters &#8211; found amongst the scholars and the worshippers &#8211; to the point that one finds a resemblance to the two nations about whom one says about the other: <b>&#8216;They are upon nothing.&#8217;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is like what we find amongst the legal jurists who stick to the outward actions of the religion, and those that take to the path of tasawwuf  who stick to the inward actions of the religion for each one of these negates the path of the other and claims that they are not from the People of the Religion, or they oppose the other in a way of opposing of those who do not consider the other to be part of the religion. There occurs between them enmity and hatred.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because Allaah has ordered that the heart be purified just as He has ordered that the body be purified. Both these aspects of purification are from the religion that Allaah has commanded and made obligatory. Allaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Allaah does not want to place you in difficulty, but He wants to purify you and to complete His Favour on you that you may be thankful.&#8221;</b></span> (5:6 &#8211; the verse pertaining to wudu)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;In it (the mosque) are men who love to purify themselves and Allah loves those who purify themselves.&#8221;</b></span> (9:108)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Indeed Allaah Loves those who turn to Him in repentance and He loves those who purify themselves.&#8221;</b> </span>(2:222)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Take charity from their wealth in order to purify and sanctify them.&#8221;</b></span> (9:103)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;They are the ones whose hearts Allaah does not wish to purify.&#8221;</b></span> (5:41)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Indeed the polytheists are impure and filthy&#8221;</b> </span>(9:28)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we find that the concern of many of the legal jurists and the worshipper is only the purification of the body, and he goes beyond the requirement of the sharee&#8217;ah with respect to his concern and action. And he leaves what he has been commanded and recommended with respect to the purification of the heart, and he does not understand purification except in this bodily aspect. And we find that the concern of many of the sufis is the purification of the heart only, to the extent that he will go beyond the requirement of the Sharee&#8217;ah with respect to his concern and action. And he leaves what he has been commanded and recommended with respect to the purification of the body.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the first group go to the extreme of wasting water and considering to be impure that which is not impure, and staying away from that which has not been legislated to stay away from, this despite their hearts containing different shades of jealousy, arrogance and hatred towards their brothers. In this there is a clear resemblance to the Jews.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other group goes to the extreme of negligence, they go to great extents to safeguard the heart to the point that they consider ignorance of that which is obligatory to know &#8211; such as the evil from which it is obligatory to steer clear of &#8211; from those things that safeguard the heart (from actually desiring that evil). In this they do not differentiate between safeguarding the heart from desiring evil, and safeguarding the heart through its knowing the evil and its knowing that with which it has been commanded. Then alongside this negligence and ignorance they do not preserve themselves from the impure things and therefore establish the obligatory purification in the way of the Christians.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So enmity has occurred between these two groups due to their leaving a portion of what they have been commanded with, and due to their <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>bagy</strong> </span>&#8211; which is to exceed the correct bounds, either by ignoring or omitting the truth, or by enmity and oppression. Bagy sometimes occurs amongst some people, or sometimes with regards to the rights of Allaah &#8211; both of these are implied. This is why He said: <b>&#8220;out of mutual jealousy and hatred&#8221;</b> for each group was displaying bagy to the other by not acknowledging the others right and not refraining from showing enmity to the other. Allaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Nor were the People of the Book divided until the clear proof came to them.&#8221;</b></span> (98:4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Mankind was one nation and Allaah sent Messengers as bringers of glad-tidings and warners. And He revealed with them the Book in truth so that they may judge amongst mankind in that which they differed. And only those to whom it was given differed concerning it after clear proofs came to them through hatred, one to another.&#8221;</b></span> (2:213)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Indeed those who divide their religion into sects, you have no concern in them in the least.&#8221;</b></span> (6:159)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;(Always) turning in repentance to Him, and be afraid an dutiful to Him: and establish the prayers and do not be of the polytheists &#8211; of those who split up their religion and became sects, each sect rejoicing in that which is with it.&#8221;</b></span> (30:31-32)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because each party of the polytheists used to worship whatsoever god their desires dictated as Allaah said: <span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;What you call the polytheists to is hard upon them.&#8221;</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;O Messengers! Eat of the goodly things and do righteous deeds. Indeed I am Well-Acquainted with what you do. And Verily! This, your religion, is one religion and I am your Lord, so keep your duty to Me. But they have broken their religion into sects, each group rejoicing in what it has.&#8221;</b></span> (23:51-52)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it becomes clear <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>the way of unity is by means of gathering all of the religion, and acting upon it in its entirety &#8211;</strong></span> that is worshipping Allaah Alone without any partners as He ordered, inwardly and outwardly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The way to disunity is by leaving a portion of that which the servant has been commanded with, and by al-bagy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The result of unity is:</strong> the Mercy and Pleasure of Allaah, His sending salaah upon the servants, and happiness in this world and in the hereafter, and white faces (on the Day of Judgement).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The result of disunity is:</strong> the Punishment of Allaah, His Curse, and black faces, and the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) declaring himself free of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is one of the proofs that consensus is a definitive proof, for when they unite then they are all obeying Allaah in this and have Mercy showered on them. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And there cannot be obedience to Allaah and His Mercy by way of an action that He has not commanded, in either belief, saying or action</strong></span>. For if there were to be a saying or action upon which they agreed that had not been commanded by Allaah, then this would not be obedience to Allaah and neither would it be a means of His Mercy. Abu Bakr al-Azeez depended upon this proof in the beginning of his &#8216;at-Tanbeeh.&#8217;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 55</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Is there something you want to add concerning the qualities of the saved sect?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong> The truth of the matter is that there isn’t anything to add, since the four fundamental matters that we have mentioned are clear and sufficient. However, it might need some details with respect to the matter of manners. So, the most important aspect of manners is unity and agreement on the truth, the thing that Allaah (Azza wa Jal) has enjoined on us:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Your Rabb (Allaah) prescribed for Noah, and that which We revealed to you –[O Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)], and that which He prescribed for Ibraaheem, Moosaa, ‘Eesaa–that you should establish the Religion, acting upon what is prescribed, and not split into sects regarding it.</em></span> [Qur’aan, soorat ash-Shooraa (42): 13].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (Allaah Azza wa Jal) informed us that those who split their Religion into sects, Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is clear of them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, those who divided their religion and break up into sects, you Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) have no concern of them in the least.</span></em> [Qur’aan, soorat al-An’aam (6): 159].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So agreement and unity of the hearts are from the most distinguished qualities of the saved group, ahlus-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah. In case disagreement amongst them occurs due to Ijtihaad,[74] in matters where Ijtihaad is applicable, then they do not hold enmity, hatred or hostility against each other. Rather, they believe that they are brothers even if this kind of disagreement takes place amongst them. This is true to the extent that each of them would pray behind the Imaam believing that the latter is not in a state of Wudoo´ whilst the Imaam believes he does have his Wudoo’. An example for this is that each of them would pray behind someone who ate camel meat believing that it nullifies the prayer whilst this Imaam believes that it does not. Thus each of them consider that the prayer behind this Imaam is correct, even though if he would have prayed the same prayer [after eating camel meat] by himself, he would have consider it incorrect. All of this is because they consider that the difference in opinion arising from Ijtihaad, in cases where Ijtihaad is permissible, is, in reality, not a disagreement. Since each one of the disputants follows what is incumbent upon both for them to follow from the evidence that is impermissible for either one to relinquish. They see that if their brother disagrees with them regarding a certain action and does this in compliance with the evidence, then in reality he is in agreement with them. This is because they themselves call for the following of the proof wherever it may be. So if he disagrees with them based upon his conformance with what he regards as valid proof, then in reality he is in agreement with them, since he is in conformity with that which they call for and aim to, from judging by the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is well known to many scholars what took place between the companions with regard to similar matters of disagreement, even during the time of their Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم). He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not harshly denounce anyone of them. When he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) returned from the battle of al-Ahzaab, Jibreel came to him and directed him to set out for Banee Quraydhah who broke the covenant with the Muslims. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) then ordered his companions and said: “None of you should pray ‘Asr except at Banee Quraydhah.” [75] So, they left Madeenah for Banee Qurayadhah, and when the time for ‘Asr prayer arrived some of them delayed their prayer until they reached Banee Qurayadhah and therefore prayed it outside of its time. They did not pray until after sun set, since the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: “None of you should pray ‘Asr except at Banee Quraydhah.” Others prayed on time and said that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) intention was for them to make haste in setting off. [76]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those were the ones who were correct in their understanding. In spite of this, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not blame anyone of them, and none of them held any enmity or hatred against each other because of their disagreement in understanding this text. That is why I believe that it is a binding duty upon the Muslims who belong to the Sunnah that they should be one nation, and that factionalism should not occur amongst them–a person belongs to this group and another belongs to another group, and the third belongs to a third group and so on. In such a manner, they fight amongst each other with the spears of their tongues. They hate each other and take enemies out of each other because of a disagreement whose ruling is permissible to deduce by way of Ijtihaad. There is no need for me to specifically mention each group. But the sensible person would understand and the matter would be clear to him. So, I believe that it is incumbent upon ahlus-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah to unite even though they may dispute in that wherein they have been differing as a result of their understanding of what is necessitated by the texts. All praise is due to Allaah, for this is a matter in which there is ample scope for accommodation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is important is agreement and unity of the hearts. And there is no doubt that the enemies of Islaam love that the Muslims are divided, regardless whether they are enemies who openly express their hostility, or enemies who pretend to be friends of Muslims or Islaam, while in reality they are not. So, the obligatory thing is that we should be distinguished with this distinctive mark and that is we are from the saved sect that agrees to unity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align:center;">بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The subject of this lecture is, “al-Bay’aa wa Hizbiyyah” (Allegiance and Partisanship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Bay’aa (Allegiance):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam brought forth the obligation to give bay’aa (allegiance), and the Prophet (: sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) commanded it. The allegiance was originally given to him, then the leaders after him and then the khulafah (caliphs) afterwards. In our time, many deviated; making bay’aa to anyone they chose from those who set themselves up as leaders of Muslim groups. Due to the large number of groups, al-bay’aa has multiplied and varied, becoming even numerous. This has led to disputes, with each group claiming to be on the truth and that their leader deserves the legal bay’aa (allegiance).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Definition of al-Bay’aa:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Linguistically, al-bay’aa means to reach an agreement with respect to matters of trade or on obedience and following (i.e., a covenant).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Islamic meaning (al-istilah), albay’aa means the covenant on obedience. It is as if the one who pledges allegiance gives the covenant to his ameer (leader), assigning him the ability to conclude matters concerning himself and the Muslims at large; this ameer can not be disputed with in any way. Similarly, the Muslim agrees to obey the ameer in what he assigns from certain tasks, whether it is in times of ease or difficulty, in that which he likes, and that which he dislikes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the people of the past used to give albay’aa to the leaders and give him the covenant, they would put their hands in his hand affirming the &#8216;ahd, confirming the promise of allegiance in a manner similar to the way people shake hands after reaching an agreement while selling and buying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Definition of Hizbiyyah (Partisanship):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the linguistic aspect, al-hizb means a group of people; the plural of hizb is ahzab (parties). The hizb of a man are his followers and his soldiers, who are holding to the same view as him. If a group of people’s hearts and deeds are in agreement, then they constitute a hizb, even though they may not physically meet. In addition, a hizb, linguistically, is a kind of people whose desires are the same.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Islamic or legal meaning (i.e., in Islamic terminology) of hizb is not totally blameworthy nor is it entirely praiseworthy. It is blamed or praised in accordance with its intended use. For instance, Allah says in the Qur’an (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">« <span style="color:#008000;">Shaytan has overtaken them. So he has made them forget the remembrance of Allah. They are the party of Shaytan. Verily, it is the party of Shaytan (hizbushaytan) that will be the losers!</span> » [Surah al-Mujadilah (58:19)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Clearly, this is an example that is blameworthy. Similarly, in the same surah (chapter) of the Qur’an, Allah says (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;">They are the Party of Allah (hizbaAllahi). Verily, it is the Party of Allah that will be the successful</span>. » [Surah al-Mujadilah (58:22)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, in one context, it was blameworthy when the hizb was associated with Shaytan, and in another instance, it was praiseworthy when it was the party of Allah, concerning the believers.1 Certainly, if the hizb comprises the people of wickedness, desires, misguidance and disbelief, then all of that is blameworthy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Dangers of Hizbiyyah:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everyone who examines the Islamic history finds that tahazub (bigotry) to opinions, madhahib (schools of thought), and innovations splits the Muslim ummah and takes away from its unity. That is why the textual proofs are replete with calls for unity and keeping from all means that leads to splitting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Ruling concerning al-Bay’aa</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many textual proofs came to confirm the command of pledging allegiance and to warn against abandoning it and the consequences of that. Allah says (in the translation of the meanings):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If any group would carry such a name, then it must not have convictions and practices that oppose Tawheed, like invoking other than Allah, and worshipping graves etc. This is shirk. So Muslims should not be deceived by emotional and (or) politically misleading practices.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">« <span style="color:#008000;">Indeed, Allah was pleased with the believers when they gave their Bay’aa (pledge) to you (O Muhammad ) under the tree, He knew what was in their hearts, and He sent down As-Sakinah (calmness and tranquility) upon them, and He rewarded them with a near victory.</span> » [Surah al-Fath (48:18)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Allah says in the same surah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;">Verily, those who give Bay’aa (pledge) to you (O Muhammad ) they are giving Bay’aa (pledge) to Allah. The Hand of Allah is over their hands. Then whosoever breaks his pledge breaks only to his own harm, and whosoever fulfills what he has covenanted with Allah, He will bestow on him a great reward</span>. » [Surah al-Fath (48:10)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sunnah also emphasized al-bay’aa, calling for the believer to give allegiance and stating that whoever dies without having pledged allegiance to the Muslim ruler dies in the state of the pre-Islamic era. This refers to giving the pledge to the general Muslim imam who most people give the pledge to in his time or in his country, in the absence of the general Muslim khilaafah. This is the obligated pledge incumbent on every Muslim, and it is forbidden to abandon or dissent in terms of obedience on this pledge, whether in times of ease or difficulty, in that which he likes and that which he dislikes. This applies as long as the leader does not command sins, in which case, he can not be obeyed but rather is to be obeyed in other issues.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Not obeying the ruler on sins which he may command, does not necessitate rebellion against him, as many of the youth understand. When we talk about this imam, whether he was set up by influential people in the country or assigned by his predecessor or even to the degree that he took leadership by force, it is forbidden to rebel against him as long as he does not commit clear, plain kufr and until the conditions of rebellion to remove him are fulfilled. First, his kufr must be clear and can not tolerate any misinterpretation, requiring an unambiguous proof from Allah and (or) the Messenger () that his case (saying and/or action) is truly kufr. Moreover, there must be the ability to change him and that this change will not lead to a greater evil. When all these conditions are met, and it is obvious how difficult this is, only then can he may be removed; otherwise the Muslims are told to be patiently persevering until these conditions are fulfilled.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Illegal Bay’aa:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In our time, numerous deviations have occurred with respect to illegal pledges, not condoned by shariah. This has had a negative impact on Muslim society at large. The following are some instances of deviant pledges.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first example is that of the <strong>Sufis to their elders or their shaykhs</strong>. You find the Sufi mystic making an &#8220;eternal&#8221; pledge to his shaykh, such that he can never leave that shaykh’s way. Such a pledge has no basis in shariah; rather, it is without a doubt futile. Some mystic Sufis give the pledge by shaking hands between men and women. They say they will continue to be that shaykh’s students and adepts, no matter what that shaykh says. To that end, they even take the pledge to share their wealth and money with him. In fact, the shaykh can take a tax levee from them. These are criminal acts and mischief that have no basis in shariah and Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the second type of <strong>deviant pledges is that of group members to their group leaders</strong>; this is becoming widespread in many countries. Everyday you find these groups splitting, forming subgroups and sub leaders. In these groups, the leaders request from the members to make a full pledge, as if it were the legal pledge to the Muslim general leader or imam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These groups vary with respect to the covenants they take. Some say that anyone who abandons giving the pledge of allegiance to the leader of their group is a kaafir (disbeliever). Others maintain that giving the pledge is fardh (obligatory) and that anyone who does not give it is sinful. As such, they assign an ameer for their group as a means to lift the sin from them. This kind of pledge is futile, baseless, and not found in shariah. Anyone who claims it is obligatory to give a pledge of allegiance to a leader of a group is certainly in error.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> Consequences of the Illegal Bay’aa:</strong> </span>The consequences of the illegal bay’aa are many.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>, we now have more than one pledge at the same time and in the same country because each group thinks that the correct bay’aa is for their ameer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>, these bay’aa lead to enmity, conflict, and hatred between these groups. In turn, they compete with each other to acquire larger and larger numbers for their groups.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly</strong>, it has spread misconceptions regarding takfeer because some of these groups believe that the one who does not give the pledge is a kaafir and feels that their ameer is the only ameer. Therefore, they make takfeer on anyone who does not give the pledge to that ameer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourthly</strong>, it has led to the spilling of the inviolable blood. In some Muslim countries, a member of a particular group may be killed if he decides to leave that group. Likewise, a leader of a group may kill a competitor or those who oppose his leadership. This is real, and not fictional, occurring in many places.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifthly</strong>, this has led and still leads to confrontations between these groups and the government. The consequences of that are terrible, including rebellion, bloodshed, harshness, takfeer, and evil on top of evil. It has reached the degree that some of these groups have adopted what they call “revolutionary concepts,” when even the term “revolution” has nothing to do with Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The consequences of these illegal ahzab (parties) who demand bay’aa are great. They have corrupted the souls and thoughts of many Muslim youths around the world. We refer the matter to Allah, the Most High. We ask Him to save us from falling into this mischief and to protect the ummah (Islamic nation) from such disputes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no Power or Might except with Allah. May the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions, and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O you who Believe! Have tawraa (fear and obedience) of Allaah as you should do, and do not die except that you are Muslims. And hold fast all together to the rope of Allaah and do not be divided. And remember the favour of Allaah upon you, for you were once enemies one to another, but He joined your hearts together, so that by His Grace, you became brothers. And you were on the brink of a pit of Fire, and He saved you from it. Thus does Allaah make His Signs clear to you, that you may become guided. Let there arise out of you a group of people inviting to all that is good, enjoining all that is good and forbidding all that is evil. They are the ones who are successful. And do not be like those who split up and differed amongst themselves, after the clear proofs had come to them. For them is a tremendous punishment. On the Day of Resurrection, some faces will be white and some faces will be black.&#8221; [Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan 3:102-105].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the Scholars of <i>tafseer</i> (Qur&#8217;aanic explanation) said: &#8220;The faces of the people of Sunnah and Unity will be white, whereas the faces of the people of Sectarianism and Differing will be black.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said: &#8220;So Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; ordered all of the Believers to cling to the Rope of Allaah collectively, and not to split-up. And clinging to this Rope of Allaah has been explained as meaning: Clinging to the Book of Allaah, to His Religion, to Islaam, to <i>ikhlaas</i> (purity of beliefs and actions to Allaah), to His Commands, to His Covenant, to His obedience and also to the Jamaa&#8217;ah. All of these explanations have been related from the Sahaabah (Companions) and also From those who followed them in righteousness &#8211; and all of it is correct. For the Qur&#8217;aan commands one with the Religion of Islaam; and that is Allaah&#8217;s Covenant, and His Command, and obedience to Him. It also entails clinging together collectively as a Jamaa&#8217;ah. And the Religion of Islaam &#8211; in its reality &#8211; is <i>ikhlaas</i> (purity and sincerity in beliefs and action) to and for Allaah alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> relates:<br />
The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Indeed Allaah is pleased with three things: That you worship Allaah alone without associating a partner along with Him; that you hold fast altogether to the Rope of Allaah and not to become divided; and that you give sincere advice to whomsoever Allaah puts in charge of your affairs.&#8221;</i>2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; has made oppressing the Muslims, both their living and their dead, <i>haraam</i> (forbidden). And he has made sacred their blood, their wealth and their honour. And it is established from the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> that he said during the farewell Hajj (Pilgrimage): <i>&#8220;Indeed your blood, your property and your honour is sacred to each other, just like this day of yours, in this month of yours, in this city of yours. Have I not conveyed the message. Those who are present must convey (my words) to those who are absent. Perhaps the one to whom it is conveyed understands it better than the one who directly hears it.&#8221;</i>3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Those who harm Believing men and women undeservingly, carry upon themselves the crime of slander and clear sin.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:58].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, whosoever harms any Believer, living or dead, not because of any sin sin which necessitates that &#8211; then he has entered into this <i>Aayah</i> (verse). And whosoever is a <i>mujtahid</i> (one who is sincerely striving to arrive at the truth), then there is no sin upon him. And if the <i>mujtahid</i> is harmed by someone, then he has harmed him undeservingly. And whosoever is sinful, but has repented from such sin, or he is forgiven due to some other reason; such that there is no punishment left for him &#8211; and then someone harms him, then he has harmed him undeservingly.&#8221;4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> relates:<br />
&#8220;Do not envy one another. Do not inflate prices upon one another. Do not hate one another. Do not forsake one another. Do not undercut one another. But be worshippers of Allaah and be brothers. The Muslim is the brother of another Muslim he neither oppresses him, nor humiliates him, nor lies to him, nor holds him in contempt. And piety is right here &#8211; and he pointed to his chest three times. It is enough evil for a person to hold his brother Muslim in contempt. The whole of a Muslim for another Muslim is sacred; his blood, his property and his honour&#8221;5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Umar <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhumaa</i> relates:<br />
The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;A Muslim is a brother to another Muslim. He neither oppresses him, nor humiliates him, nor forsakes him. Whosoever helps his brother, Allaah will help him. Whosoever removes one of the griefs of this world from a Muslim, then Allaah will remove one of his griefs on the Day of Resurrection. And whosoever hides a fault of any Muslim, then Allaah will hide one of his faults of the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;</i>6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> relates:<br />
The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;None of you will truly believe until you love for your brother what you loves for yourself.&#8221;</i>7</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <i>sallalaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said:<br />
<i>&#8220;The example of the Believers in their mutual love and mercy is like the example of a body, if one part of the body feels pain, then all the body suffers in sleeplessness and fever.&#8221;</i>8</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alavhi wa sallam</i> said:<br />
<i>&#8220;The Believer to the Believer is like a solid structure, one part supporting the other.&#8221;</i> And he interlaced his fingers to demonstrate this.9</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what we have mentioned in this small treatise, and what we hold as part of our Religion and belief in front of Allaah. And in it is a sufficiency for whosoever desires right guidance and whosoever intends to seek the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah &#8211; both for us and our Muslim brothers and sisters &#8211; safety and protection from those things that bring about His wrath and anger and painful punishment. And we seek refuge in Allaah from the passing away of His blessings, and that His grant of the state of safety and well-being is changed into something else. And we seek Allaah&#8217;s refuge from His sudden retribution and from all that which angers Him. O Allaah! We seek refuge in You from the severe trials and from the place of lowest misery and despicability, and from the evil that has been decreed, and from the abuse of the enemies. And Allaah is sufficient for us and what an excellent Guardian. And may Allaah send the praises and blessings upon Muhammad and upon his Family, Companions and followers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah Magazine, Issue No.6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE BASIS OF RIGHT GUIDANCE</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) &#8211; <i>rahimahallaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Religion of the Muslims is built upon following the Book of Allaah, the Sunnah of His Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, and that which the Ummah has agreed upon. So these are the three infallible <i>usool</i> (fundamentals). So whatever the Ummah differs in, then it is referred back to Allaah and His Messenger. Thus, it is not for anyone to set-up a person for the Ummah, and to call to his way, and form <i>walaa</i> (love, loyalty and allegiance) and <i>&#8216;adaa</i> (enmity and hatred) based upon that, except for the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. Nor is any speech set-up for them based upon which they form <i>walaa</i> and <i>&#8216;adaa</i>, except for the speech of Allaah, and that of His Messenger, and that which the Ummah has agreed upon. Rather, this is the practice of the people of Innovation, who set-up a person, or a saying, with which they cause splits in the Ummah; forming <i>walaa</i> or<i> &#8216;adaa</i> based upon that saying or ascription.&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Taymiyyah &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; also said:<br />
&#8220;It is not for anyone to ascribe himself to a particular Shaykh and to have <i>walaa</i> with those who follow him, or to have <i>&#8216;adaa</i> based upon that. Rather, he should have <i>walaa</i> for everyone who is from the people of <i>eemaan</i> (i.e. is a Muslim) and is known to have <i>taqwaa</i> (piety and obedience to Allaah in that which He has ordered and prohibited), from the Shaykhs, or from others. No one should be particularised with an increase in <i>walaa</i> except if he sees from him greater <i>eemaan</i> and <i>taqwaa</i>. So precedence and excellence is given to whomsoever Allaah and His Messenger have given them to. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;O mankind! Indeed We created you from a man and a woman, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Indeed the most noblest of you with Allaah are those that have the most <i>taqwaa</i> (piety).&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Hujuraat 49:13].&#8221;2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>SECTARIANISM AND MISPLACED LOYALTIES</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah said:<br />
&#8220;Indeed the people of the truth and the Sunnah do not follow anyone (unconditionally) other than Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>; who does not speak from his desires, rather it is nothing less than Revelation sent down to him. So it is obligatory to affirm all that he informs, and to obey all that he commands. This status is not given to anyone else from this Ummah. Rather, every person&#8217;s saying can be taken or left, except that of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. So whoever sets up an individual other than Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, such that the one who loves and agrees with him is reckoned to be from <i>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah</i>, and the one that differs with him is reckoned to be from the people of innovations and sectarianism &#8211; as happens with those groups who follow certain Imaams of <i>kalaam</i> (theology and rhetorical speech) &#8211; then the person doing so is from the people of innovation, deviation and sectarianism.&#8221;3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; further said:<br />
&#8220;Indeed many &#8211; from the people who say such sayings &#8211; follow their desires in this, in order to elevate their egos, or to gain leadership; or whatever is connected to it. Their intention is not to make the word of Allaah uppermost, nor is it to make the Religion purely for Allaah. Indeed, they have hatred for those who oppose them &#8211; even if it is a <i>mujtahid</i> (a Scholar striving his utmost to arrive at the truth) who is excused, and whom Allaah is not angry with. Likewise, they are pleased with those who agree with them &#8211; even if it is an ignorant person with evil intentions, who neither has any knowledge, nor good intent. This leads them to praise those whom Allaah and His Messenger have not praised, and to censure those whom Allaah and His Messenger have not censured. It also causes them to have <i>walaa</i> (love and allegiance) and <i>&#8216;adaa</i> (enmity and hatred) based upon their own self-desires, not upon the Religion of Allaah and His Messenger &#8230; So whosoever does this will only bring about <i>fitan</i> (trials and discord) between the people.&#8221;4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>PRESERVING THE LOVE AND UNITY</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez bin Baaz &#8211; <i>hafidhahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Religion of Allaah orders to judge (with justice) in all matters, and not to have <i>walaa</i> (love, loyalty and allegiance) with your brother merely because he agrees with you, or to have <i>&#8216;adaa</i> (enmity and being distant) from him merely because he disagrees with you on a certain opinion or issue. This is not from justice at all! The Companions &#8211; <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhum</i> &#8211; differed in various issues, yet this did not affect the happiness and sincerity between them, nor their <i>walaa</i> and love for each other &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with them all. So the Believer acts upon the <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i> (Prescribed and Divine Islaamic Law) of Allaah, follows the truth, gives priority to the evidences before anyone &#8211; yet in doing so, he does not oppress his brother, nor negate doing justice to him when he differs regarding any issue of <i>ijtihaad</i> in which the evidences are not so apparent. Likewise is the case for those issues in which differences occur due to a different interpretation of the text. So, in such instances he is excused, and it is upon you to sincerely advice him, and to love only the good for him, and not to split-up, nor to have enmity and hatred between you and your brother &#8211; and there is no might, nor any power, except with Allaah. &#8220;5</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">source: From Al-Istiqaamah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>SHAYKH &#8216;ABDUL-&#8216;AZEEZ BIN BAAZ</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: What is the obligation upon the Muslim Scholars with regard to the large number of <i>jam&#8217;iyyaat</i> (societies) and <i>jamaa&#8217;aat</i> (groups) in many of the Islaamic lands and elsewhere, and with regard to the differences that exist between them, to the point that each group declares the others to be misguided. Do you not hold that it is fitting to enter into explaining the like of this matter, and to clarify the truth concerning their differences, for fear that these differences will increase and lead to evil consequences for the Muslims?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: &#8220;Our Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> made clear to us a single way which it is obligatory upon the Muslims to follow and traverse, and that is Allaah&#8217;s Straight Path and the methodology of His upright religion. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And this is My Straight Path, so follow it and do not follow other paths that will separate you from His Path. This has He ordained for you, that you may become pious.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:153]. Just as the Lord of Might and Majesty warned the Ummah (nation) of Muhammad <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> against splitting and disunity, since that is one of the greatest causes of failure and of the enemy taking control, as occurs in the saying of Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic&#8217;s: <b>&#8220;And fold fast altogether to the rope of Allaah and do not be divided.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan 3:101]. And His &#8211; the Most High&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;He has ordained for you the same religion which He ordained for Nooh, and that which We revealed to you, and that which We ordained for Ibraaheem, Moosaa and &#8216;Eesaa <i>&#8216;alayhimus-salaam</i>, saying: that you should establish the religion by doing that which you are ordered with, and make no divisions in it. Intolerable for the Pagans is that to which you call them.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ash-Shooraa 42:13]. So this is a Divine call to unity and for hearts to be harmonised. And in any Islaamic land, if there are many groups for the purpose of good, aid, co-operating in righteousness and piety between the Muslims &#8211; without their being differences between the desires of the companions and followers &#8211; then this is good, is a blessing, and produces great benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if each of them declare the others to be misguided and attack their actions, then this harm is very great and its evil consequences very serious. Then what is obligatory upon the Muslims is to clarify the true state of affairs and to discuss with each group and to sincerely advise all of them that they should proceed upon the way laid down by Allaah for His servants, and upon that which our Prophet Muhammad <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> called to. Then those who ignore this, or continue in their stubbornness, due to personal benefit or goal &#8211; known only to Allaah &#8211; then what is obligatory upon those who know the reality is to make this known about them and to warn against them, so that the people may avoid their path, and that those who do not know the reality of their affair may not fall into it and be led astray, and that they are not turned away from the Straight Path which Allaah ordered that we follow, as occurs in His &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;And this is My Straight Path, so follow it and do not follow other paths that will separate you from His Path. This has He ordained for you, that you may become pious.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:153]. And from that which there is no doubt about is that the multitude of sects and groups in the Islaamic society is, firstly something desired by Shaytaan, and secondly something desired by the enemies of Islaam from amongst mankind. Since agreement and unification of the Muslims, and their being aware of the dangers which threaten them and their <i>&#8216;aqeedah</i> (beliefs), will make them active in refuting and rebutting it, and acting in a unified manner for the benefit of the Muslims &#8211; thus repelling the danger from their religion, their lands and their brothers. And this is something which the enemies &#8211; from amongst mankind and jinn &#8211; are not pleased with. Therefore they are very eager to split-up the Muslims, destroy their unity and to sow the seeds of enmity and discord between them. We ask Allaah that He unites the Muslims upon the truth and that He removes from their society every type of misguidance and every cause of discord. Indeed He is the One Who is able to do that, and He is the One having full power over it.&#8221; 1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: &#8230; and the students of knowledge refer back to you and to the other major Scholars and ask them. So what do you advise them? Do you advise and approve of entering (i.e. joining) the likes of these groups; such as <i>Jamaa&#8217;atul-Ikhwaan</i>, <i>Jamaa&#8217;atut-Tableegh</i>, <i>Jamaa&#8217;atul-Jihaad</i>, and so on, or do you advise them to remain upon seeking knowledge with the students of knowledge from those who call to the way of the Salaf (the Pious Predecessors)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: &#8220;All praise is for Allaah and may Allaah extol and send blessings of peace upon His Prophet. We advise them all to unite upon a single way and that is the way of seeking knowledge and attaining understanding of the Book and the Sunnah, and to proceed along the <i>manhaj</i> (methodology) of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah. I advise them all that their goal should be to follow the Book and the Sunnah and to proceed upon the <i>manhaj</i> of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah, and that they should all call themselves Ahlus-Sunnah or the followers of the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> (Pious Predecessors). But as for <i>tahazzub</i> (bigotted partisanship) for the <i>Ikhwaanul-Muslimeen</i>, or <i>Jamaa&#8217;atut-Tableegh</i>, or so on, then I do not advise that. That is a mistake. Rather we advise them that they should be together upon a single way, a single <i>jamaa&#8217;ah</i>, advising one another with the truth and having allegiance to Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah. This is the correct way to prevent differences. But if there are various groups upon that same way (i.e. of following the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i>) &#8211; a group in such and such a place, and another in such and such a place &#8211; but all of them are upon the <i>Salafee</i>2 way, following the Book and the Sunnah, calling to Allaah and having allegiance to Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah &#8211; without <i>tahazzub</i> (partisanship) and without <i>ta&#8217;assub</i> (bigotted blind-following) &#8211; then that is not harmful &#8211; even if there are a number of groups &#8211; as long as their way and their goal is one.&#8221;3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>SHAYKH SAALIH AL-FAWZAAN</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: Noble Shaykh, with regards to the serious state in which the Ummah of Islaam lives &#8211; a state of confusion in peoples&#8217; thoughts &#8211; particularly in matter relating to the Religion. For the Islamic <i>Jamaa&#8217;ahs</i> (groups) and sects have become many, and each of them claim that their <i>manhaj</i> (methodology) is the correct Islamic methodology which must be followed. So the Muslim is left in a state of confusion as to what he should follow and which one is upon the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: &#8220;Splitting up is not from the Religion, since the Religion commands us with unity and that we should be a single <i>Jamaa&#8217;ah</i> and a single Ummah upon the <i>&#8216;aqeedah</i> (belief) of Tawheed (i.e. to single out Allaah alone for worship) and upon following the Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Indeed this Ummah of yours is a single Ummah and I am your Lord, so worship Me alone.&#8221; </b>[Soorah al-Anbiyaa 21:92]. And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And hold fast altogether to the rope of Allaah and do not become divided.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan 3:103]. And Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Indeed those who split-up their Religion and become sects, you have no part with them in the least. Their affair is with Allaah who will tell them what they used to do.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:159]. So this contains a severe warning against splitting and differing. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:<b> &#8220;And do not be like those who split-up and differed after the clear evidences came to them. For them is a tremendous punishment.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan 3:105].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So our Religion is the Religion of <i>al-Jamaa&#8217;ah</i>, and the Religion of agreement and unity. Splitting is not from the Religion, since the Religion orders that we are a single <i>Jamaa&#8217;ah</i> and the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said:<i> &#8220;The Believer to the Believer is like a building, one part supporting the other.&#8221;</i>4 And he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> also said: <i>&#8220;The example of the Believers with respect to their mutual love, mercy and affection is like the example of a single body.&#8221;</i>5 And it is known that a building and a body are a single cohesive thing, not disunited and fragmented &#8211; since if a building splits then it will collapse; and likewise a body, if it splits, then life will be lost. Thus, there must be a unity and we must be a single <i>Jamaa&#8217;ah</i> whose foundations is Tawheed and whose methodology is the <i>da&#8217;wah</i> (call) of the Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>; and which proceeds upon the Religion of Islaam. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And this is My Straight Path, so follow it, and do not follow other paths that will separate you from His Path.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:153]. So these groups, and this splitting which is present today, is not approved of by Islaam. Rather, Islaam forbids it severely and commands uniting upon the <i>&#8216;aqeedah</i> (belief) of Tawheed and upon the methodology of Islaam, a single <i>Jamaa&#8217;ah</i> and a single Ummah, just as our Lord &#8211; the Most Perfect, the Most High &#8211; ordered. And splitting and their being many (differing) groups and parties is from the plots of the devils &#8211; from the jinn and mankind &#8211; against this Ummah. So the <i>kuffaar</i> (disbelievers) and the <i>munaafiqs</i> (hypocrites) have never ceased, since olden times, introducing their poison in order to split the Ummah. The jews said previously: <b>&#8220;And a party of the People of the Book say: Believe in the morning in that which is revealed to the Muslims, but reject it at the end of the day, so they may turn back.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan 3:72]. Meaning: that the Muslims will leave their religion when they see you leaving it. And the Hypocrites said: <b>&#8220;Do not spend on those who are with Allaah&#8217;s Messenger until they desert him.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Munaafiqoon 63:7]. <b>&#8220;And as for those who erect a mosque by way of disbelief and seeking to harm and disunite the Believers &#8230;&#8221;</b> [Soorah at-Tawbah 9:107].&#8221; 6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q]: What is the ruling with regards to those who align themselves with those <i>jamaa&#8217;ahs</i>, particularly those that are established upon secrecy and giving <i>bay&#8217;ah</i> (pledge of allegiance to the party leader)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: &#8220;The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> informed us that splitting would occur and he ordered us, at that particular time, to come together and to be upon that which the Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and his Companions were upon. So he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;The jews split-up into seventy-one sects and my Ummah would split-up into seventy-three sects. All of them are in the Fire except one.&#8221;</i> They said: Who is it O Messenger of Allaah? So he replied: <i>&#8220;That which I and my Companions are upon this day.&#8221;</i>7 And he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said, when his Companions asked him to advise him: <i>&#8220;I advise you to have taqwaa (fear and obedience) of Allaah and to hear and to obey, even if an Abysinnian slave is a leader over you. And those of you who live long after me will see many differences of opinion. So hold fast to my Sunnah and the guidance of the Rightly-Guided Khaleefahs (Successors) after me; cling to it tightly &#8230;&#8221;</i>8 So this is the <i>manhaj</i> (methodology) which is obligatory for all the Muslims to follow, until the Day of Resurrection. So when disagreements occur then they must return back to that which the Salaf (the Pious Predecessors) of this Ummah were upon, with regards to <i>manhaj</i>, <i>bay&#8217;ah</i> (pledge of allegiance), and other matter connected to the Religion.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah, Issue No.3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the One free from all imperfections &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;So have <i>taqwaa</i> (fear and obedience) of Allaah and reconcile the differences between yourselves.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Anfaal 8:1].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed the Believers are but brothers. Therefore reconcile the differences between your brothers, and fear Allaah so that you may receive mercy.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Hujuraat 49:10].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;So this is a knot which Allaah has bound the Believers together with, such that whenever a person is found possessing <i>eemaan</i> (faith) in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers and the Last Bay &#8211; whether in the eastern or western part of the world &#8211; then such a person becomes the brother of the Believers. This brotherhood obligates that the Believers should love for that person that which they love for themselves, and hate for that person that which they hate for themselves. Therefore, the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said &#8211; whilst ordering the brotherhood of <i>eemaan</i> (faith): <i>&#8220;Do not envy one another. Do not inflate prices upon one another. Do not hate one another. Do not forsake one another. Do not under-cut one another. But be worshippers of Allaah and brothers. The Muslim is the brother of another Muslim; he neither oppresses him, nor humiliates him, nor lies to him, nor holds him in contempt. And piety is right here &#8211; and he pointed to his chest three times. It is enough evil for a person to hold his brother Muslim in contempt. The whole of a Muslim for another Muslim is sacred; his blood, his property and his honour.&#8221;</i>1 And he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;The Believer to the Believer is like a solid structure, one part supporting the other.&#8221; And he interlaced his fingers to demonstrate this.</i>2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus Allaah and His Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> ordered that the rights of the Believers be fulfilled by each other, and that those matters which will bring about harmony, love and togetherness be carried out. All of this is to be done in order to further the rights that they have over one another. So from such tights is that when fighting occurs between them &#8211; thereby causing their hearts to separate and to have hatred and to cut-off from each other &#8211; then the Believers should bring about reconciliation between their brothers and do that which will remove the enmity. Then Allaah ordered <i>taqwaa</i> in general and made the bestowal of His Mercy the consequence of their having <i>taqwaa</i> and their fulfilling the rights of the Believers. So He said: <b>&#8220;And have taqwaa of Allaah in order that you may receive mercy.&#8221;</b> Thus, if Allaah&#8217;s Mercy is attained, then the good of this world and the Hereafter will also be attained.&#8221;3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Aaishah <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhaa</i> used to say, that when people abandoned acting upon this Aayah (verse): <b>&#8220;When two parties of the Believers fight each other, then make reconciliation between them.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Hujuraat 49:9]. So when the Muslims began fighting each other, it was obligatory to reconcile them, as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; ordered. However, when they did not do this, then fitnah (trials and tribulations) spread, as did ignorance, and this is what caused the differences to continue.4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Shall I not inform you of something that is greeter in degree than (optional) fasting, charity and Prayer?&#8221;</i> They said: Indeed inform us. So he said: <i>&#8220;It is reconciling the people. For indeed causing corruption between them is the shaver!&#8221;</i>5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> explained this shaving in another saying: <i>&#8220;The disease of the people before you has overcome you, namely envy and hatred and it is the shaver. I do not say that it shaves-off the heir. Rather, it shaves-off the religion!&#8221;</i>6</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwaas by Shaykh ’Abdul-’Azeez bin Baaz, Shaykh Naasirud-Deen al-Albaanee, Shaykh ibn Uthaymeen<br />
Al-Ibaanah Online, Issue No.3 &#8211; Dhul-Qa’dah 1416H / April 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Fatwa of Shaykh bin Baaz</b> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q] What is the obligation upon the Muslim Scholars with regard to the large number of <i>jamiyyaat</i> (societies) and <i>jamaa’at</i> (groups) in many of the Islaamic lands and elsewhere, and with regard to the differences that exist between them, to the point that each group declares the others to be misguided. Do you not hold that it is fitting to enter into explaining the like of this matter, and to clarify the truth concerning their differences, for fear that these differences will increase and lead to evil consequences for the Muslims?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: Our Prophet <i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> made clear to us a single way which it is obligatory upon the Muslims to follow and traverse, and that is Allaah’s Straight Path and the methodology of His upright religion. Allaah &#8211; <i>the Most High</i> &#8211; said: <b>“And this is My Straight Path, so follow it and do not follow other paths that will separate you from His Path. This has He ordained for you, that you may become pious.”</b> [Soorah al An’aam 6:153]. Just as the Lord of Might and Majesty warned the Ummah (nation) of Muhammad <i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> against splitting and disunity, since that is one of the greatest causes of failure and of the enemy taking control, as occurs in the saying of Allaah &#8211; <i>the Mighty and Majestic’s</i> &#8211; : <b>“And hold fast altogether to the rope of Allaah and do not be divided.”</b> [Soorah Aal-Imraan 3: 101 ]. And His &#8211; <i>the Most High’s</i> &#8211; saying: <b>“He has ordained for you the same religion which He ordained for Nooh, and that which We revealed to you, and that which We ordained for Ibraaheem, Moosaa and ’Eesaa ’alayhimus-salaam, saying: that you should establish the religion by doing that which you are ordered with, and make no divisions in it. Intolerable for the Pagans is that to which you call them.”</b> [Soorah ash-Shooraa 42:13].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a Divine call to unity and for hearts to be harmonised. And in any Islaamic land, if there are many groups for the purpose of good, aid, cooperating in righteousness and piety between the Muslims without their being differences between the desires of the companions and followers &#8211; then this is good, is a blessing, and produces great benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if each of them declare the others to be misguided and attack their actions, then this harm is very great and its evil consequences very serious. Then what is obligatory upon the Muslims is to clarify the true state of affairs and to discuss with each group and to sincerely advise all of them that they should proceed upon the way laid down by Allaah for His servants, and upon that which our Prophet Muhammad <i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> called to. Then those who ignore this, or continue in their stubbornness, due to personal benefit or goal &#8211; known only to Allaah &#8211; then what is obligatory upon those who know the reality is to make this known about them and to warn against them, so that the people may avoid their path, and that those who do not know the reality of their affair may not fall into it and be led astray, and that they are not turned away from the Straight Path which Allaah ordered that we follow, as occurs in His &#8211; <i> the Mighty and Majestic’s</i> &#8211; saying: <b>“And this is My Straight Path, so follow it and do not follow other paths that will separate you from His Path. This has He ordained for you, that you may become pious.”</b> [Soorah al-An’aam 6:153]. And from that which there is no doubt about is that the multitude of sects and groups in the Islaamic society is, firstly something desired by Shaytaan, and secondly something desired by the enemies of Islaam from amongst mankind. Since agreement and unification of the Muslims, and their being aware of the dangers which threaten them and their <i>’aqeedah</i> (beliefs), will make them active in refuting and rebutting it, and acting in a unified manner for the benefit of the Muslims, thereby repelling the danger from their religion, their lands and their brothers. And this is something which the enemies -from amongst mankind and jinn &#8211; are not pleased with. Therefore they are very eager to split-up the Muslims, destroy their unity and to sow the seeds of enmity and discord between them. We ask Allaah that He unites the Muslims upon the truth and that He removes from their society every type of misguidance and every cause of discord. Indeed He is the One Who is able to do that, and He is the One having full power over it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Fatwaa of Shaykh al-Albaanee</strong> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q]: What is the <i> Sharee’ah</i> ruling concerning these numerous Islaamic groups, parties and organizations which differ amongst themselves in their <i>minhaaj</i> (methodology), their modes of operations, their <i>da’wah</i> (call), their ’aqeedah (beliefs) and the foundations upon which they are based. Especially when the group of truth is a single one, as is proven by the hadeeth?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: We have spoken a lot about the answer to this question, therefore we shall be brief whilst speaking about it. So we say: It will not be hidden from any Muslim who has knowledge of the Book and the <i>Sunnah</i> and that which our <i> Salafus-Saalih</i> (Pious Predecessors) &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with them all &#8211; were upon, that firstly; formation of parties and organizing into groups with differing thought, and secondly; differing in the <i>minhaaj</i> (methodology), is not from Islaam at all. Rather it is from what our Lord &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; has actually forbidden, in more than one <i> aayah</i> (verse) from the noble Qur‘aan. From this is His &#8211;<i> the Most High’s</i> &#8211; saying: <b>“And do not be like those who worship others besides Allaah &#8211; those who split-up their religion and become sects. Each party rejoicing in only that which is with them.”</b> [Soorah Room 30:31-32]. And our Lord &#8211;<i> the Mighty and Majestic</i> &#8211; also says: <b>“And if your Lord has so willed, He could have made mankind a single nation. But they will not cease to differ, except those upon whom your Lord has bestowed His Mercy.”</b> [Soorah Hood 11: 118 -119] So Allaah &#8211; <i>the Most Blessed, the Most High</i> &#8211; made exempted from this differing and disagreement &#8211; a differing which must occur by Allaah’s creational Decree , but not as something that He is pleased with or desires from us &#8211; that sect upon which He has bestowed His Mercy, as occurs in His saying:<b> “ &#8230; except those upon whom your Lord has bestowed His Mercy.”</b> And there is no doubt whatsoever, that any group that has purity of intention for Allaah, and earnestly desire to be from that nation which is exempted from this differing; and upon whom Allaah has bestowed His Mercy, then there is no way to practically reach and attain this in the Islaamic societies, except by returning to the Book and to the <i>Sunnah</i> of the Messenger <i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> and to what our <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> (Pious Predecessors) &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with them all &#8211; were upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah’s Messenger <i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> made clear the <i>manhaj</i> (methodology) and the correct way, in many authentic ahaadeeth: From the Prophet <i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>, that one day he drew a straight line upon the ground, and drew short lines around the straight line. Then he recited Allaah &#8211; <i>the Most Blessed, the Most High’s</i> &#8211; saying: <b>“And this is My Straight Path, so follow it, and do not follow paths other that will separate you from His Path.”</b> [Soorah al-An’aam 6:153]. He then pointed with his finger to the straight line and said that this is Allaah’s Straight Path. Then he pointed to the other lines away from the Straight Path and said: <i>“</i><em>At the head of each of these other paths, there is a devil calling the people to it.</em><i>”</i> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is no doubt that these short paths are those which represent the many parties and groups. Therefore, what is obligatory upon every Muslim who truly desires to be from <i>al-Firqatun-Naajiyah</i> (the Saved Sect) is that he proceeds upon the Straight Path &#8211; neither turning to its left or its right. And there is no party which is successful, except the Party of Allaah, about which the noble Qur‘aan mentions to us: <b>“Indeed, it is the Party of Allaah who are succesful.”</b> [Soorah al-Mujaadilah 58:22].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, every party which is not the party of Allaah is only from the party of Shaytaan and not from the party of <i>ar-Rahmaan</i> (the Most Merciful). And there is also no doubt at all, that proceeding upon the Straight Path requires correct knowledge of it, and this cannot be attained by mere organization and mere formation of parties &#8211; that desire to be upon true Islaam, but not truly understanding what was the Islaam that Allaah &#8211; the Most Blessed, the Most High &#8211; sent down upon the heart of Muhammad <i> sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>. And the sign of the Saved-Sect was clearly stated by the Prophet <i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>, when he was asked about it &#8211; so he said: <i>“</i><em>It is that which I and my Companions are upon.</em><i>”</i> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this hadeeth indicates to the one eagerly seeking knowledge of Allaah’s Straight Path, that one must have knowledge of two extremely important matters: &#8211; <i><b> Firstly</b></i>: That which the Messenger <i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> was upon. <b><i>Secondly</i></b>. That which his <i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam’s</i> Companions were upon. this is because the noble Companions were those who transmitted the guidance of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> and his <i>Sunnah</i> to us, and secondly that they were the ones who best followed this <i>Sunnah</i> in practice. So since this is the case, it is not therefore possible for us to have a correct understanding of the Prophet’s <i>Sunnah</i>, except by way of his Companions &#8230; Thus, attaining a correct understanding of Islaam cannot be possible except through knowing the life examples of the Companions and how they followed this great Islaam which they took from the Prophet <i> sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> &#8211; either from his sayings, actions or tacit approvals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, we believe with certainty, that every group that does not establish itself upon the foundations of the Book and the <i>Sunnah</i> and the <i>manhaj</i> (methodology) of the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> having extensively and comprehensively studied the rulings of Islaam, the large and the small, the principles and the branches then this group will not be from the Saved Sect; the Sect that which proceeds upon the Straight Path which was indicated by the Messenger <i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> in the authentic hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if we imagined that there are separate groups in the Islaamic lands, upon this <i>manhaj</i> (methodology), then they will not be considered as being parties, rather they are a single group, with a single <i>manhaj</i> and its path is a single one. Though they are separated by land, they are not, however, separated in thoughts, <i>’aqeedah</i> (beliefs), or <i>manhaj</i>. Rather this separation is only due to a physical separation of land &#8211; as opposed to the various groups and parties, which may even be in a single land, yet despite this, each party is pleased only with what it possess. As for these types of parties, we do not believe that they are upon the Straight Path. Rather we state with certainty, that they are upon those paths &#8211; at the head of each one there is a devil calling the people to it. And hopefully this contains an answer for what has preceded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Fatwaa of Shaykh Ibn al-’Uthaymeen</b> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[QJ: Are there any texts from the Book of Allaah or the <i>Sunnah</i> of His Prophet <i> sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> which contain an allowance of multiple groups and parties or <i>al-Ikhwaan</i>?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: I say: There is not in either the Book or the <i>Sunnah</i> that which allows multiple parties and groups. Rather, there is in the Book and the <i>Sunnah</i> that which censures this. Allaah &#8211; <i>the Most High</i> &#8211; said: <b>“Verily those who split-up their religion and become sects, you have no concern with them in the least. Their affair is with Allaah, Who will tell them about what they used to do.”</b> [Soorah al-An’aam 6: 159]. Allaah &#8211; <i> the Most High</i> &#8211; said: <b>“Each sect rejoicing in only that which is with itself.”</b> [Soorah Room 30:32]. And there is no doubt that these parties are contrary to what Allaah ordered. Rather what Allaah has ordered and encouraged is in His saying: <b>“And indeed this Ummah of yours is one Ummah and I am your Lord, so fear and obey Me.”</b> [Soorah al-Mu‘minoon 23:52]. And some people say: It is not possible for the <i> da’wah</i> (call) to be strong unless it is done within the framework of a party! We say to that: This is incorrect! Rather the <i>da’wah</i> will be strong whenever the person is under the Book of Allaah and the <i> Sunnah</i> of His Messenger <i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> following the narrations of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu </i> <i>’alayhi wa sallam</i> and that of his Companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Comprehensive Guidance</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From al-Haarith al-Ash’aree <i>radiallaahu ’anhu</i>, who said that Allaah’s Messenger <i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Allaah &#8211; <i>the Most High</i> &#8211; ordered Yahyaa ibn Zakariyyaa <i>’alayhimus-salaam</i> with five things; that he should act upon them and order the Chldren of <i> Israa‘eel</i> to cat upon them. ’Eesaa ibn Maryam <i>’alayhis-salaam</i> said to him: Indeed Allaah ordered you with five things, that you act upon them and that you order the Children of <i>Israa‘eel</i> to act upon them. So either you order them, or I will order them. So Zakariyyaa said: If you precede me in that, I fear that I will be punished or swallowed up by the earth. So he gathered the people in the mosque of Jerusalem until it was filled, and the people sat upon its walls. He admonished them saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Indeed Allaah has ordered me with five things which I should act upon and order you to act upon. The first of them is that you should worship Allaah and not associate anything along with Him in this worship. That one who associates anything in worship with Allaah is like a man who bought a slave with his own wealth &#8211; either gold or silver &#8211; and said: This is my house and this is my work, so work and give the wages to me. So the slave worked and gives the wages to other than his owner. So which of you would be pleased for his slave to be like that? But Allaah created you and provides for you, so do not associate anything in worship with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I order you with Prayer, and when you pray then do not turn aside.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I order you with Fasting. And that is the like of a man, amongst a group of people, who had a small pouch containing musk. Each of them likes to smell it. And, to Allaah, the fasting person is better than the smell of musk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I order you with <i>sadaqah</i> (charity). For its likeness is that of a man taken prisoner by the enemy, so they take hold of him and tie his hand to his neck, so he says: Will you not allow me to ransom myself from you? So he gives them small and large amounts to escape from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I order you to make mention and remember Allaah alot. And the like of this is a man being chased by the enemy, who are hastening after him. So he comes to a protected fortress and enters into its protection. Likewise is the case for the servant. For he does not protect himself from Shaytaan, except through the remembrance of Allaah &#8211; <i>the Mighty and Majestic</i>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger <i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <b>“I order you with five things which Allaah ordered me with: The <i>Jamaa’ah</i>, [1] hearing, obeying, <i>hijrah</i> (migration) and <i>jihaad</i> in the way of Allaah &#8211; <i>the Mighty and Majestic</i>. So whosoever separates from the <i>Jamaa’ah</i> by a hand-span, throws of the yoke of Islaam from his neck, unless he repents. And whosoever calls with the call of the days of ignorance, then he is from the horde of Hell-Fire”</b> It was said: Even if he fasts and prays? He said: <b>“Even if he fasts and prays. So call with the call of Allaah, which Allaah gave: The Muslims, the Believers, Worshippers of Allaah.”</b> [2]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. At Teebee said &#8211; as occurs in <i>Tuhfatul-Awaadhee Sharh Sununut-Tirmidhee</i> (5/162): “What is meant by the <i>Jamaa’ah</i> is the Companions, the <i> Taabi’een</i> and the generation after the <i>Taabi’een</i> &#8211; the <i> Salafus-Saalih</i> (Pious Predecessors): That is, I order you to cling to their guidance and their way, and to associate with them.”<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Al-Istiqaamah &#8211; Shawwaal 1418H / February 1998 &#8211; Issue No.8</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]:<b>THE OBLIGATION TO UNIFY THE RANKS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ibn al-&#8216;Uthaymeen &#8211; hafidhahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;From the sincere advice which I hold to be necessary in the Religion to give to the youths, a word which I hope that Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect, the Most High &#8211; will cause to be of benefit, and it is:That they should all be in conformity and harmony, so that they may become strong, and become an obstacle blocking the way of those who plot against Islaam and its people. This is what Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; has enjoined upon us. He &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And hold fast altogether to the rope of Allaah and do not be divided. And remember the favour of Allaah upon you, in that you were once enemies to one another, but He joined your hearts together, so that by His Grace you became brothers.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:103]. And Allaah the Blessed, the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Let there arise from amongst you a group of people inviting to all that is good, enjoining the good and forbidding the evil. It is they who are the successful ones, And do not be like those who differed amongst themselves after the clear proofs had come to them; for them is a painful punishment.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:104-105]. So Allaah ordered that they should all cling together to His rope and He forbade splitting, and in other Aayahs He forbade differing, and informed us that it is the cause of failure and the cause of decline of strength, and He ordered us to persevere patiently. So Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And do not differ, lest you lose courage and your strength departs, and be patient. Indeed Allaah is with those who are patient.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Anfaal 8:46]. And as is known, the people of good who help the youths of the revival in their work &#8211; with what they are able from wealth, and so on &#8211; if they see them splitting in this way, then they will not be so eager to help and assist them. So I call all of our brothers to unite together, and to fear Allaah with regards to themselves and with regards to the Ummah (nation) of Islaam, and that they should not cover up this light which has appeared on the horizon; the call to Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8230;&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;Holding fast to the rope of Allaah altogether and not becoming divided is one of the greatest usool (fundamentals) of Islaam.&#8221;2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]:<b>THE PROHIBITION OF SPLITTING</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan &#8211; hafidhahullaah &#8211; said: &#8220;Splitting up is not from the Religion, since the Religion</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">commands us with unity and that we should be a single Jamaa&#8217;ah and a single Ummah upon the &#8216;aqeedah (belief) of Tawheed (i.e. to single out Allaah alone for worship) and upon following the Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;aloyhi wa sallam. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:<b>&#8220;Indeed this Ummah of yours is a single Ummah and I am your Lord, so worship Me alone.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Anbiyaa 21:92]. And Allaah &#8211; the Most High -said: <b>&#8220;And hold fast altogether to the rope of Allaah and do not become divided.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmaan 3:103]. And Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Indeed those who split-up their Religion and become sects, you have no part with them in the least. Their affair is with Allaah who will tell them what they used to do.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:159]. So this contains a severe warning against splitting and differing. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And do not be like there who split-up and differed after the clear evidences came to them. For them is a tremendous punishment.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:105].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So our Religion is the Religion of al-Jamaa&#8217;ah, and the Religion of agreement and unity. Splitting is not from the Religion, since the Religion orders that we are a single Jamaa&#8217;ah and the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said: <i>&#8220;The Believer to the Believer is like a building, one part supporting the other.&#8221;</i>3 And he sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam also said: <i>&#8220;The example of the Believers with respect to their mutual love, mercy and affection is like the example of a single body.&#8221;</i>4 And it is known that a building and a body are a single cohesive thing, not disunited and fragmented &#8211; since if a building splits then it will collapse; and likewise a body, if it splits, then life will be lost. Thus, there must be a unity and we must be a single Jamaa&#8217;ah whose foundation is Tawheed and whose methodology is the da&#8217;wah (call) of the Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam; and which proceeds upon the Religion of Islaam. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:<b>&#8220;And this is My Straight Path, so follow it, and do not follow other paths that will separate you from His Path.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:153]. So these groups, and this splitting which is present today, is not approved of by Islaam. Rather, Islaam forbids it severely and commands uniting upon the &#8216;aqeedah (belief) of Tawheed and upon the methodology of Islaam, a single Jamaa&#8217;ah and a single Ummah, just as our Lord &#8211; the Most Perfect, the Most High &#8211; ordered. And splitting and their being many (differing) groups and parties is from the plots of the devils &#8211; from the jinn and mankind against this Ummah. So the kuffaar (disbelievers) and the munaafiqs (hypocrites) have never ceased, since olden times, introducing their poison in order to split the Ummah. The jews said previously: <b>&#8220;And a party of the People of the Book say: Believe in the morning in that which is revealed to the Muslims, but reject it at the end of the day, so they turn back.&#8221; </b>[Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan 3:72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: that the Muslims will leave their religion when they see you leaving it. And the Hypocrites said: <b>&#8220;Do not spend on those who are with Allaah&#8217;s Messenger until they desert him.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Munaafiqoon 63:7]. <b>&#8220;And as for those who erect a mosque by way of disbelief and seeking to harm and disunite the Believers &#8230;&#8221;</b> [Soorah at-Tawbah 9:107].&#8221;5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]: <b>THE CONNECTION BETWEEN UNITY AND REFUTING FALSE BELIEFS AND PRACTICES</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez bin Baaz &#8211; hafidhahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There is no doubt that it is obligatory upon the Muslims to unify their ranks and to unite their word upon the truth and to co-operate in goodness and piety against the enemies of Islaam &#8211; as Allaah, the Most Perfect &#8211; ordered them with in His saying: <b>&#8220;And hold fast altogether to the rope of Allaah and do not become divided.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:102]. And likewise, Allaah has warned the Muslims against splitting up, as occurs in His &#8211; the Most Perfect&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;And do not be like those who differed and split-up after the clear evidences came to them.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:105]. However, the order to unify the Muslims and unite their word upon the truth and to hold fast to the rope of Allaah, does not mean that they should not censure wrong beliefs and practices &#8211; whether from the Soofees or other than them. Rather, what the order to hold fast to the Rope of Allaah necessitates is: To order the good; forbid the evil; to clarify the truth, with the clear Sharee&#8217;ah proofs, to whomsoever is misguided or has a mistaken opinion, until they unite upon the truth and turn away from that which opposes it. All of this is included in His &#8211; the Most Perfect&#8217;s &#8211; saying:<b> &#8220;And help you one another in righteousness and piety, and do not help one another in sin and transgression.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:2]. And His &#8211; the Most Perfect&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;Let there arise from amongst you a group of people calling to all that is good, enjoining the good and forbidding the evil, they are the ones who are successful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal&#8217;Imraan 3:1 10]. And when the people of truth hold back from clarifying the mistakes of those who have erred or are mistaken, then they will not have achieved that which Allaah ordered them with, as regards calling to goodness, ordering the good and forbidding the evil. So the person in error will remain upon his error, and the one acting in opposition to the truth will remain upon his mistake. And this is contrary to what Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; prescribed, with regards to sincere advice, co-operation upon goodness, ordering the good and forbidding the evil &#8211; and Allaah alone is the One Who grants success.&#8221;6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said: &#8220;Refuting ahlul-bida&#8217; (the innovators) is a Jihaad, to the extent that Yahyaa ibn Yahyaa (d.226H) said: &#8220;Defence of the Sunnah is more excellent than Jihaad in the path of Allaah.&#8221;7&#8243;8</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Humaydee (d.218H) &#8211; rahimahullaoh &#8211; said: &#8220;By Allaah, that I fight against those who reject the hadeeth of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam is more beloved to me than fighting the unbelievers.&#8221;9</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim (d.751H)- rahimahullaah &#8211; said: &#8220;Jihaad with the clear proofs and the tongue; Comes before Jihaad with the sword and the spear.&#8221;10</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said: &#8220;When some people asked Ahmad bin Hanbal (d.241H) that they felt uneasy about [criticising people] by saying that such and such is this, and such and such is that, he replied: &#8220;lf I were to remain silent, how would the ignorant ones know the authentic [narrations] from the inauthentic?&#8221; Similarly, the innovators who introduce heretical writings which oppose the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah, and those who innovate in matters of worship, then explaining their true condition and warning the Ummah against them is an obligation by the unanimous agreement of the Muslim Scholars. In fact, when Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal was asked whether a person who fasted, prayed and secluded himself in the mosque for worship was dearer to him than a person who spoke out against ahlul-bid&#8217;ah (the innovators), he replied: &#8220;When he fasts and prays and secludes himself, then he does so for the benefit of his own self. However, when he speaks out against the innovators, he does so for the benefit of the Muslims in general, and this is more virtuous.&#8221; So it is clear that opposing the Innovators is of general benefit to the Muslims and is considered one of the types of Jihaad in the path of Allaah. Since purifying the Religion of Allaah, and its minhaaj (methodology), its Shoree&#8217;ah, and defending it from their attacks and that of their enemies is a collective obligation &#8211; a fact which is agreed upon by the Scholars. For if Allaah did not raise up some people to repel the harms [caused by] others, then the Religion would become corrupted. Indeed, this type of corruption is even greater than the corruption resulting from the disbelievers conquering the Muslims. This is because <b>when the disbelievers conquer the Muslims, they do not corrupt their hearts nor their Religion, except after some time. Whereas the innovators corrupt the hearts from the very outset.&#8221;</b>11</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah, Issue No.7 ,July 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And those who were given the Scripture (the Jews and the Christians) did not split-up except out of <i>baghee</i> (hatred and envy) between each other, after the knowledge had come to them.&#8221; </b>[Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:19].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam as-Sa&#8217;dee (d.1376H)- <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This is why Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; ordered the Muslims with<i> ijtimaa&#8217;</i> (collectiveness) in their Religion, and prohibited them from <i>tafarruq</i> (splitting-up). He informed them that they must not reject what Allaah revealed to them from the Book. Indeed the People of the Book (i.e. the jews and the Christians) did not split-up until after Allaah had revealed to them the Scripture, in which He ordered them with<i> ijtimaa&#8217;</i> (being unified). However, they did the opposite to what He ordered them with, due to mutual jealousy and hatred. So hatred and jealousy culminated in them having grudges and enmity between one another, they then fell into differing and splitting up. So &#8211; O Muslims &#8211; beware of doing the likes of this.&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;Allaah explained that their splitting only occurred after the knowledge had come to them, and which showed them what they were commanded to do and to avoid. For Allaah does not leave people to stray, except after giving them guidance, until He explains to them what they were commanded to do. And He informed that the reason for their <i>tafarruq</i> (splitting) was due to <i>baghee</i> (mutual envy, jealousy, hatred) And <i>baghee</i> occurs due to either falling short of the truth, or transgressing the limits. It is due either to abandoning an obligation, or doing something prohibited. So know that this is what necessitates <i>tafarruq</i> (splitting).&#8221;2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE ROOT OF CORRUPTION</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim (d.751H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It is upon the one who speaks in this matter, or any other matter, that he should only do so based upon knowledge and the truth; and that his objective should be sincerity to Allaah, to His Book, to His Messenger; and the giving of sincere advice to his Muslim brothers. But if he makes the truth accord with his own whims and desires, then this will corrupt and ruin the heart, the actions, and the state of affairs. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And if the truth were to be in accordance with their desires, then indeed the heavens and the earth &#8211; and all that is therein &#8211; would be corrupted and ruined.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Mu&#8217;minoon 23:71]. The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;None of you truly believe until he makes</i> <i>his desires accord with what I have been sent with.&#8221;</i>3 So <i>&#8216;ilm</i> (knowledge) and <i>&#8216;adl</i> (justice) are the root of every good, whereas <i>dhulm</i> (oppression) and <i>jahl</i> (ignorance) are the root of every evil. And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; sent His Messenger with the Guidance and the Religion of Truth, and He commanded the doing of justice between people and that none of them should follow their whims and desires. Allaah the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;So call to Islaam and stand firm, and do not follow their whims and desires, but say: I believe in whatever has been revealed by Allaah from the Book, and I have been commanded to do justice between you. Allaah is our Lord and your Lord, for us our deeds and for you your deeds. There is no dispute between us and you. Allaah will assemble us all, and to Him is the final return.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ash-Shooraa 42:15].&#8221;4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>A NECESSARY JIHAAD</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;<i>Jihaad</i> against the <i>nafs</i> (soul) and its whims and desires is the foundation of <i>jihaad</i> against the unbelievers and the hypocrites. Indeed a person will not have the ability to wage <i>jihaad</i> against them, until he wages <i>jihaad</i> against his own soul and its whims and desires first.&#8221;5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Ghunaymaan &#8211; <i>hafidhahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;It is obligatory upon all those who speak about an affair from the affairs of the Religion that they do so purely for Allaah&#8217;s sake, sincerely for the truth. And that they overcome their soul and strive hard against following their whims and desires, not inclining towards worldly matters; such as love of being praised, seeking fame and reputation, gaining a large following, and other such matters. So the one who seeks to gain any of this, will gain only the vanities of this world.&#8221;6</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah Issue No.8 &#8211; Shawwal 1418H / February 1998</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>SETTING THE STANDARD</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ibn Ibraaheem- rahimahullaah- (d. 1389H) said: &#8220;Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah [the Saved Sect] have an usool (set of fundamentals) which is firmly based upon proofs; and upon this are built the furoo&#8217; (subsidiary issues).&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>GUIDELINES REGARDING DIFFERENCES</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam as-Sa&#8217;dee (d. 1376H)- rahimahullaah &#8211; said: &#8220;Differences of opinions that occur between the [Scholars] of the Ummah are from two angles:- Firstly: Differences in the furoo&#8217; (subsidiary issues), and in issues of ijtihaad (qualified striving to reach the truth); such that when a person &#8211; whether it is a judge, muftee, writer, or teacher &#8211; strives to arrive at a ruling and is correct, he is rewarded two-fold. But if he strives and is mistaken, then he is rewarded once. Second: Differences in matters of usool (fundamentals); such as the issues related to Allaah&#8217;s Attributes, al-Qadr (Predestination and Pre-Decree), Eemaan (faith), and their like. These cause those who oppose [such usool] to be regarded as deviants, because of them opposing the proofs from the Book and the Sunnah, and that which the Salafus-Saalih (Pious Predecessors) &#8211; the Companions and those who followed them in goodness &#8211; were agreed upon.&#8221;2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE PERMISSIBLE TYPE OF DIFFERING</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ibn al-&#8216;Uthaymeen &#8211; hafidhahullaah &#8211; said: &#8220;This sect [i.e. the Saved-Sect] unites upon the truth, even if its people do have differences of opinion between themselves. However, these differences do not harm their [unity], nor cause them to declare each other as deviants. Rather, their hearts are still united, even when these difference of opinion occur in matters linked to the &#8216;aqeedoh (beliefs); such as did the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam see his Lord with his eyes, or did he not see him [with his eyes]? Or is the punishment in the grave to the body and the soul, or just to the soul only? Or other such issues. This is because these issues are subsidiary issues connected with the usool, they are not in the actual usool itself. So they do not declare each other as being deviants when they differ in such matters &#8211; contrary to what the innovators do.&#8221;3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE PROHIBITED TYPE OF DIFFERING</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;The Scholars &#8211; from the Companions, the Taabi&#8217;een, and those who came after them &#8211; when they differed in any matter, then they followed the command of Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; in His saying: <b>&#8220;If you differ in anything amongst yourselves then refer it back to Allaah and His Messenger, if you do truly believe in Allaah and the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:59]. So they would discuss concerning the issue; discuss, consult and sincerely advise. Sometimes they would differ in matters linked to the &#8216;aqeedah, as well as issues linked to actions, yet along with such differences, they still preserved the unity and brotherhood. Yes, whosoever opposes the clear Book and the beneficial Sunnah, or that which the Pious Predecessors of this Ummah had Ijmaa&#8217; (consensus) upon, opposing it without a justifiable excuse, then such a person has acted with the action of the Innovators &#8230; As regards differing in matters of rulings and actions, then the examples are too many to be recorded. So if every Muslim who differed in something were to be boycotted and abandoned, then no unity or brotherhood would ever remain. And Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar radiallaahu &#8216;anhumaa &#8211; who were the best of the Muslims &#8211; used to differ in matters, but they did not intend except good. And the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said to his Companions on the day of [the expedition to] Banu Quraydhah: &#8220;Let none of you pray &#8216;Asr except when you reach Bonu Quraydhah.&#8221; So the time for the &#8216;Asr Prayer came during the journey, so one group amongst them said: We will not pray until we reach Banu Quraydhah; so they missed the actual time for &#8216;Asr. The other group said: We will not miss it by delaying the Prayer; so they prayed along the way. And the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam did not criticise any of the two groups. This is related by al-Bukhaaree and Muslim, from Ibn &#8216;Umar.4 So this differing was in a matter related to rulings and actions, not in the important usool (fundamantels) itself.&#8221; 5</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">By the Shaykh Muhaddith Allaama Rabee&#8217; bin Hadi bin Umayr al-Madkhalee<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s Introduction</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise belongs to Allaah the Lord of the Heavens and the Earth, peace and blessings be upon His Prophet, the Prophet’s family, his Companions and all those who follow his way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following is a translation of a lecture which the noble <em>Shaykh</em> – may Allaah reward him with goodness &#8211; delivered in the blessed city of the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.   This lecture, which is available in tape form, was transcribed and adapted into a booklet[1] and published in 1426 A.H.  Due to the immense importance of the topic and the deep wisdom of the <em>Shaykh</em> we place it forward in the hands of our brothers and sisters by Allaah’s permission to promote the correct <em>Dawa’</em> on the understanding of the <em>Manhaj as-Salafiee</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah to bless and protect our noble <em>Shaykh</em> and all the noble scholars of Islaam and reward them on our behalf with a great reward amongst the righteous in His uppermost Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p>In the Name of Allaah the Most Kind the Most merciful</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed all Praise belongs to Allaah, we praise Him, we seek His aid and we seek His forgiveness.  We seek refuge in Him from the evil of ourselves and the evil of our actions. Whomsoever Allaah guides, there is none to misguide him, and whomsoever Allaah leaves astray then there is none that can guide him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em>, Alone without any partner, and I testify that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Fear Allaah as He should be feared and dare not die except in a state of Islaam with complete submission to Allaah.</span></strong> &gt;&gt; [al-Imraan: 102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O mankind! Be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person (Adam) and from him He created his wife and from them both He created many men and women.  And fear Allaah through Whom you demand your mutual (rights) and do not cut the relations of the wombs (kinship). Surely, Allaah is Ever an All­-Watcher over you.</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [an-Nisaa: 1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you who believe! Keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him and always speak the truth.  He will direct you to do righteous good deeds and will forgive you your sins.  And whosoever obeys Allaah and His Messenger he has indeed achieved a great achievement.</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [Ahzab: 70-71]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Amma ba’d:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the best speech is the Speech of Allaah, the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>&#8211; and the worst of the affairs are the innovated ones, every innovation is a <em>Bida’</em> and every <em>Bida’</em> is misguidance and every misguidance is in the Hellfire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Welcome &#8211; O my brothers for the sake of Allaah and O you noble students &#8211; those students of this distinguished knowledge who have made the journey from far distant places, to drink from the knowledge of the <em>Sharia&#8217;</em> which gushes forth from the Book of Allaah and from the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> at the place of descent of the revelation in the city of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.   Which is the second place of descent of the revelation after Makkah al-Mukkaramah the place from where the banners for the struggles and conquests were sent out to make the word of Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala –</em> uppermost, to spread this true religion and to make this <em>Deen</em> apparent over all the religions.  As Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala –</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">It is He Who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to make it victorious over all other religions even though the <em>Mushrikoon</em>(polytheists) hate it.</span></strong>&gt;&gt;[as-Saff:9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Allaah made this religion manifest at the hands of the noble, sincere Companions; the Companions of Muhammad   <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> &#8211; who conquered hearts with knowledge, guidance and Eemaan.  They conquered fortresses and lands with the swords of truth.  So they assisted the religion of Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em> with everything they had of strength, with everything that they were capable of sacrificing of wealth and souls.  They put into effect the objective which Allaah had intended for this <em>Deen</em>, that it prevail and that it be manifest above all religions.  This is because this religion stands upon guidance and upon knowledge not upon desires, ignorance, foolishness and chaos &#8211; which has now become predominant in many countries!  &#8211; There are those people whose <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> is not built upon the Book of Allaah nor upon the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah, rather their <em>Dawa’</em> stands upon the following desires, except those whom Allaah  <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em> has protected.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Islaamic University &#8211; along with those who are responsible for it and those who founded it &#8211; came to realize the reality of the Muslims and what they live in of ignorance and their being far from the true <em>Manhaj</em> of Allaah &#8211; except for a few &#8211; in the Muslim world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed this University was founded upon correct Islaamic methodologies, which spring forth from the Book of Allaah and from the Sunnah of theMessenger of Allaah – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam</em>.  There were about four fifths of those accepted to the University from the sons of the rest of the Islaamic world and 20 in every 100 from the sons of the country of the two holy Islaamic sites so that those who come to the place of the descent of the revelation to receive pure knowledge could return to their countries to disseminate this knowledge, this goodness and this guidance which they had learnt:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#008000;">Of every group of them, a party only should go forth, that they (who are left behind) may get instructions in (Islaamic) religion, and that they may warn their people when they return to them, so that they may beware (of evil).</span></strong> &gt;&gt; [at-Taubah: 122]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a great opportunity for you, so take advantage of it and come closer to the pure and clear beneficial knowledge which is derived from the Book of Allaah and from the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, since its sources are abundant and all praise belongs to Allaah &#8211; in this city and in this university.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever wishes truth and goodness  &#8211; for himself, his family, his people and country &#8211; then it is upon him to become serious and acquire knowledge from those of the scholars who are present; those who have given their own selves to learning this truth and disseminating it, <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">The Correct Sources of Knowledge</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is upon him to learn from the sources which contain the correct beliefs and correct methodologies, to read the <em>Salafi Tafseer</em> books, which are based upon the <em>Tafseer</em> of the Book of Allaah by the Book of Allaah, by the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah and by the <em>Fiqh</em> of the noble Companions those who lived through the descent of the revelation and were present at the time of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> and lived with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They knew the aim of the Book and the Sunnah. They are the ones whose <em>Fiqh</em> should be held on to as they preserved the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam</em><em>.  </em>This is why the noble Messenger – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam &#8211;</em> when he spoke about splitting up into sects and spoke about the <em>Firqaat-Un Najeeyah</em> said: &#8216;Those who are upon what I am upon and my Companions.'[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this <em>Fiqh</em> of the true <em>Deen</em> of Allaah which the noble Companions had &#8211; which they acquired from the Book of Allaah and from the Sunnah of theMessenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, from his sayings, actions, his teachings and his directives – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam –</em> it is obligatory upon us to take it as our reference.  The Companions are the intended believers in the saying of Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala -:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been shown clearly to him and follows other than the believers&#8217; way. We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and burn him in Hell &#8211; what an evil destination. &gt;&gt; [an-Nisaa: 115]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a severe threat to the one who contends with Allaah and His Messenger and follows a path other than that of the believers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So pay attention to this matter and strive to understand the way of the believers which they derived from the Book of Allaah, the Sunnah of theMessenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam </em>&#8211; and from his purifying and educating them upon the Book and the wisdom <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a great opportunity for you; understand from it the true <em>Deen</em> of Allaah and strive earnestly to make it apparent over all religions with proofs and evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is upon you to seek knowledge from its original watering sources; from the <em>Salafi</em> books of <em>Tafseer</em>, from the <em>Salafi</em> books of <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em>, which gush forth from the Book of Allaah and from the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah –<em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam</em>.  The difference between the way of the truthful believers and the way of the innovating discriminators of the true <em>Manhaj</em> of Allaah will become clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They &#8211; I swear by Allaah &#8211; are the protectors of this <em>Ummah</em> upon the <em>Deen</em> of Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em>, they had the correct <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em> and <em>Manhaj</em> and they were firmly upon what Muhammad <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> came with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From what is understood principally, is that it is obligatory upon us to follow the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> to hold on firmly to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> and to bite onto that with our molar teeth, just as the Messenger of Allaah mentioned &#8211; when he gave an eloquent sermon whereby tears fell and the hearts trembled  &#8211; the Companions requested him to give them some advice they said ; O Messenger of Allaah it is as if this is a farewell sermon, so advise us, he said: ‘I advise you to fear Allaah&#8230;&#8230;.’  pay attention to this advice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘….to hear and obey, whoever lives from amongst you will see many differences so it is upon you to hold on to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly guided <em>Khulafah</em>, bite on to it with your molar teeth, beware of newly invented matters, for every newly invented matter is a <em>Bida</em>’ and every <em>Bida’</em> is misguidance.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s note: Due to the saying of the noble Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> ‘Whoever does not thank the people does not thank Allaah.’ As narrated by Abee Sa’eed, &amp; authenticated by al-Albaani in as-Saheehah, I say that may Allaah reward with all goodness in this life and in the Hereafter the brother who facilitated us with the booklet and aided us in its translation.  And to our editor, may Allaah enter her into the highest grades of His Paradise among the Prophets, the Companions and the righteous for all her efforts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The headings were added for further clarity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Narrated by Tirmidhi (2641) from the hadeeth of Abdullaah bin ‘Amr –radhiAllaahu anhu- &amp; regarded as Hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’ (5343).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Narrated by Abu Daawood (4607), Tirmidhi (2676) &amp; Ibn Majah (42) from the hadeeth of al-Irbaad bin Saariyah –radhiAllaahu anhu &#8211; &amp; it was authenticated by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’ (2549).</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Part 2</strong></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">The Station of <em>Taqwa</em> and <em>Ihsaan</em></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this sermon consists of the advice to fear Allaah, which is necessary and it is not exemplified except in the lives of the righteous, truthful scholars as in the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allaah. &gt;&gt;[Fatir: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fear Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em> so you can reach this level and learn so that you can reach that status; because the one who knows the correct <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em>, <em>Manhaj</em> and rulings, manners and behaviour springing from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> then he is the one who fears Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em> and <em>Taqwa</em> is attained with all of these matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when these matters &#8211; which we have mentioned – are acknowledged then the slave is driven to the <em>Taqwa</em> of Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em>, to having fear of Him and being aware of Him in every time, place and situation.  This is a great station which is the station of <em>al-Ihsaan</em> (perfection of worship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;That you worship Allaah as if you see Him and if you cannot see Him then know that He sees you.'[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This station of <em>al-Ihsaan</em> (perfection of worship) is that a person has certainty that Allaah sees him and that Allaah hears all he says and hears; the beating of his heart, the feelings of his heart and what he thinks to himself.   Allaah<em>Subhanahu Wa Ta’ala</em> knows it and hears it and He sees his movements and when he is still.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the true believer regards Allaah with true greatness and he acknowledges that Allaah <em>Subhanah</em> hears everything that he says and knows everything he discusses, or thinks to himself and that Allaah has:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Angels <em>Kirâman </em>(honourable)<em> Kâtibîn</em> writing down (your deeds). They know all that you do. &gt;&gt; [al-Infitar: 11-12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if these distinguished feelings are found in the soul of a believer then he has acquired the characteristic of <em>Taqwa</em> which causes him to keep away from sinning, <em>Shirk, Bida&#8217;</em> and superstitions and he acquires the station of <em>al-Ihsaan</em>(perfection of worship) since he is aware of Allaah and he feels that Allaah sees him and he cannot hide anything of his affairs from Allaah not a little nor a lot, not even the like of an atom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a noble awareness and distinguished feeling which pushes one <em>-InshAllaah &#8211;</em> to the <em>Taqwa</em> of Allaah.  This cannot be reached except for the one who knows the correct <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em>, the correct rulings of <em>Halaal</em> and <em>Haraam</em> and knows the commands and prohibitions, the promise and the warnings from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam</em><strong><em>.  </em></strong>They are the ones who deserve the praise of Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala –</em> He said; about them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allaah.&gt;&gt; [Fatir: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Allaah will exalt in degree those of you who believe and those who have been granted knowledge. &gt;&gt; [al-Mujadilah: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So strive to be from these types of people: i.e. that you combine knowledge and action.  That is the fruit of correct knowledge and having the <em>Taqwa</em> of Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em> and being aware of Him.</p>
<h1 style="text-align:justify;">The Call to Allaah</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is upon you O brothers to acquire the pure, truthful Eemaan, beneficial knowledge and righteous actions.  Our Lord <em>–Jal Sha’anahu-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; By <em>Al-&#8216;Asr</em> (the time). Verily! Man is in loss, except those who believe and do righteous good deeds, and recommend one another to the truth and recommend one another to patience&gt;&gt; [al-Asr: 1-3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Truthful Eemaan is only built upon knowledge.  Righteous actions do not emanate except from knowledge. <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> to Allaah cannot be set forth with it (i.e. knowledge) except by the people of knowledge and being patient with harm <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em> &#8211; is required for the one who has learnt, teaches and calls to Allaah  <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So be from those who know and believe in this knowledge, those who call to this knowledge and Eemaan and are patient with harm in the path of conveying this truth and goodness to the people.  Indeed a believing Muslim caller to Allaah will face harm the likes of which never even crossed his mind and nor had he anticipated!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A believer is not dazed by this since he is harmed in the way of Allaah and the best of Allaah’s creation were harmed in the path of <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> to Allaah although they were the Prophets and the noble Messengers <em>&#8211; alayhim as-sallam &#8211;</em> and they were harmed more than us.  They were tried with severe enmity and hatred more than we are and this is the meaning of the saying of the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam </em>: &#8216;The people with the severest trials are the Prophets, then the righteous people then their likes and their likes.'[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> saying: &#8216;No one was harmed for the sake of Allaah like I was harmed.'[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever holds fast to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah and calls to it, will definitely be harmed &#8211; except if Allaah wills &#8211; so accustom yourself to patience:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Only those who are patient shall receive their rewards in full, without reckoning. &gt;&gt; [az-Zumar: 10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah ordered His Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> to take the great Prophets as an example and to be patient in the field of <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> and striving just as the great Prophets were patient.  Allaah said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Therefore be patient as did the Messengers of strong will and be in no haste about them (disbelievers). &gt;&gt; [al-Ahqaf: 35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Narrated by Bukhari (50) &amp; Muslim (9) from the hadeeth of Abu Huraira – radhiAllaahu anhu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Narrated by Ahmad in his Musnad (1484) and it’s his wording. Also by Tirmidhi (2398) &amp; Ibn Majah (4023) from the hadeeth of Sa’ad bin Abee Waqqas – radhiAllaahu anhu &#8211; &amp; it was authenticated by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’ (992,994).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Narrated by Tirmidhi (2472) &amp; Ibn Majah (151) from the hadeeth of Anas –radhiAllaahu anhu &#8211; &amp; it was authenticated by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’ (5125).</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 3</h2>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">An Excellent Example</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we have in the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> and in all the Prophets of Allaah a good example.  The Messenger was commanded to take those Prophets before him as an example and to follow their guidance and we have been commanded to follow the guidance of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, and take him as an example:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a good example to follow forhe who hopes in (the Meeting with) Allaah and the Last Day and remembers Allaah much. &gt;&gt; [al-Ahzab: 21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This good example is complete in every matter which Muhammad <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> came with<em>;</em> so, he is an example in his <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em>, so we believe in that which he believed in; an example in his worship, so we worship Allaah making the religion sincerely for Him, following that which the noble Messenger – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam &#8211; </em>came with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is an example in great manners which perhaps many of the callers to Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em> and many of the youth have lost, much of it having been forgotten and some of the youth have forgotten it too.  Indeed Allaah has praised His Messenger – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam &#8211;</em> with eloquent praise and He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And verily, you are on an exalted standard of character &gt;&gt; [Qalam: 4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the caller to Allaah, the student of knowledge, the instructor and the guide all need to take the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> as an example in their <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em>, <em>Manhaj</em> and manners.  So if these matters are combined in the caller to Allaah or they are nearly complete then this <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> will be successful <em>&#8211; InshAllaah &#8211;</em> and the caller to Allaah will have presented it in the most beautiful and best form <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the caller to Allaah is deficient in the matters of his <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>, being deficient in having noble manners-from which is having patience, wisdom, gentleness, softness and other things which are important, which the <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> of the Messengers <em>–alayhim Sallat wa Sallam-</em> requires.  Then this is an apparent deficiency in his <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>.  So it is upon him to ensure he manifests those matters completely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps many of the people are negligent of this! And this harms the <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> of Salafiyyah and harms its people.  Since if these manners are neglected and the<em>Dawa&#8217;</em> is presented to the people in a way that they dislike and is made unpleasant and detestable by having harshness, severity and recklessness &#8211; and the likes of these things &#8211; then this is an obstacle to the <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> and to it being accepted.  Since these matters are even disliked in the affairs of the <em>Duniya</em> let alone in the matters of the <em>Deen</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is necessary for the student of knowledge to follow a path of righteous good manners in giving <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">The Manner of The Call</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is necessary for you &#8211; O brother &#8211; to take as an example the<em>Aathar</em> which are mentioned about the way of calling to Allaah; and that is done by studying the biography of the Messenger, studying his manners, studying his <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em> and studying his <em>Manhaj</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people do not care about the <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em> of the Messenger nor about his<em>Manhaj</em> and they follow other methodologies and beliefs, which Shaytaan fabricates for the people of <em>Bida&#8217; </em>and misguidance whom Allaah forsakes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are a few people who have been blessed enough to acquire the <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em>, but they are deprived of the <em>Manhaj</em>!  There are people who are blessed with the <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em> and the <em>Manhaj</em> but in their behaviour they end up neglecting the<em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em> and the <em>Manhaj</em>, the truth is with them &#8211; correct <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em> and correct<em>Manhaj</em> &#8211; but their behaviour and technique of giving <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> destroys the <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>and harms it!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So be careful of opposing the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> in his <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em>, his<em>Manhaj</em> and his <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>.  It is upon you to learn how he – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam &#8211;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">used to call the people and to find out about these prophetic instructions of wisdom, patience, gentleness, pardoning and forgiveness, softness, kindness and other matters alongside these.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Comprehend these O brothers and know that these are necessary in our <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>to the people; do not take one aspect of Islaam and neglect the other aspects, or take one aspect from the ways of giving <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> to Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em> and neglect the other aspects.  Since that harms the <em>Deen</em> of Allaah <em>-Azza wa Jal-</em> and it harms the <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> and its people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I swear by Allaah; the <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> of <em>Salafiyyah</em> in recent times &#8211; and in other times &#8211; was not spread except at the hands of people who were scholars, wise and gentle, who were the representation of the <em>Manhaj</em> of the Messenger – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam &#8211;</em> and they implemented what they were able to.  So Allaah caused them to be of benefit and the <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> <em>As-Salafiyyah</em> was widespread in many lands of the <em>Duniya</em> via their manners, knowledge and wisdom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the present time; we see that the <em>Dawa&#8217; As-Salafiyyah</em> is retreating and dwindling and that is not due to anything except the loss of their wisdom, rather the wisdom of the Messenger – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam &#8211;</em> foremost, and the loss of the likes of his gentleness, mercy, manners, kindness and softness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Aeysha cursed a Jew, so the Messenger of Allaah said to her: &#8216; O &#8216;Aeysha indeed Allaah loves kindness in all matters.'[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a scholar nowadays mentions this hadeeth to the youth, directing them to the correct <em>Manhaj</em> of giving <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> to Allaah, then they say: this is watering things down (<em>Tameea’</em>)!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If these noble manners are mentioned and cited as a reminder the likes of wisdom, kindness, softness, gentleness and pardoning -which are the necessary requirements for giving <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> to Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em> and they are attributes which attract the people to the correct <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>&#8211; then the result of this would be that the people would enter into the religion of Allaah in droves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These people, who try to change things, push the people away &#8211; in spite of the saying of the Messenger of Allaah: ‘Indeed there are those amongst you who repel.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> ‘Make things easy, and do not make things difficult, give good news and do not drive people away.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brothers: these people do not comprehend! Otherwise &#8211; I swear by Allaah &#8211; it obligates them to then brand the Messenger as one who waters things down<em>(Mumaya’)</em>! And that the Companions and the scholars of the <em>Ummah</em> watered things down <em>(Mumaya’een)</em>!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their claim of watering down necessitates that they – those who are upon this severity and destructive harshness &#8211; which has destroyed the <em>Dawatul Salafiyyah</em>&#8211; it necessitates, that they claim that the Messenger himself who calls to kindness, wisdom and softness is also watering things down <em>(Mumaya’)</em>, and we seek forgiveness from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I swear by Allaah; they do not want this nor do they intend the Messenger of Allaah in what they say!  But they lack understanding.  So it is upon them &#8211; from now on &#8211; to comprehend what results from these rulings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We, indeed &#8211; by Allaah, strive, debate, write, advise and call to Allaah <em>&#8211; Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em>with kindness and they regard us from those who water things down<em>(Mumaya’een)</em>, they do not want us to say: wisdom, softness and kindness!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed we have seen that harshness has destroyed the <em>Dawa’ As-Salafiyyah</em>, and torn its people apart, so what should we do?? I say: O brothers, when we see fires burning, do we leave them to burn more?? Or do we bring that which will extinguish these fires???</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was forced to &#8211; and this is my obligation &#8211; and I used to say this before today, but I concentrated upon this when I saw this destruction, and I saw these tribulations.  I say: it is upon you to have gentleness, it is upon you to have softness, it is upon you to have brotherhood and it is upon you to be merciful to each other.  Indeed this harshness has been directed towards the <em>Ahl -ul-Sunnah</em> themselves whereas they have left the <em>Ahl- ul- Bida&#8217;</em> and aimed at the<em>Ahl-ul Sunnah</em> with this destructive harshness and mixed it with oppression and false oppressive rulings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Be aware be very aware, lest you follow this path which will destroy you and destroy <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> <em>As-Salafiyyah</em> and it destroys its people.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 4</h2>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Said, The Messenger Said, The Scholars Said</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Call to Allaah <em>&#8211; Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em> with everything you have, with proofs and evidences in every place, with the words &#8216;Allaah said&#8217;, and &#8216;the Messenger of Allaah said&#8217; and aided with &#8211; after Allaah – with the speech of the scholars of guidance whom, both the <em>Ahul -ul &#8211; Sunnah</em> and the people of <em>Bida&#8217;</em> accept in their leadership and their status in Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I advise those brothers who go to Africa or to Turkey or to India or any other place that they should go with the phrase: &#8216;Allaah said, the Messenger of Allaah said and so and so from the scholars whom they respect said.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if, for example you went to Africa and you said: ‘Ibn Abdul Barr said, Malik said, so-and-so said.’  Even though the number of people who have corrupt beliefs is not small in number!  So if you come to them with the Book of Allaah <em>&#8211; Ta&#8217;ala </em>&#8211; and with the Sunnah of the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> then you should also bring the speech of the scholars so that they will listen to your speech and obey you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is wisdom, but if you come to them with just your own speech from yourself no-one will ever accept it from you. So it is necessary for you &#8211; after the speech of Allaah and the speech of His Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> that you connect it up with the speech of the scholars who have status in the hearts of the people and have a high station, those whom the people will not criticize nor their statements. So if you say: ‘Bukhari said’, you will find that they respect him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So for example: The <em>Soofeeyah</em> everywhere respect Bukhari and they respect Muslim.  They respect these two books (Saheeh al-Bukhari and Saheeh Muslim) and they respect these two Imams.  They respect Ahmad bin Hanbal, al-Awzaa’ee and Sufyaan ath-Thawree and other than them from the preceding senior people of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why there are ties between us and them where we meet up in the truth, so we enter into them from these channels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is from wisdom O brothers; you should not now, due to this, begin by saying: ‘Ibn Taymeeyah said’, even though he is an Imam; because the ignorant people do not know him and even if they knew him they are made to hate him from what they hear from their senior people, so they do not want him nor do they desire him <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>..</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should say :’Ibn Taymeeyah said’  amongst the <em>Salafiyeen</em> -those who respect him- but do not say amongst other people, for example ‘Ibn Taymeeyah said, Ibn Abdul Wahhab  said,’ because the ignorant person who is cultured amidst the people of <em>Bida&#8217;</em> runs away from this, so their shaykhs push them away.  So mention to them the names of the scholars whom they respect and hold in regard, because their leaders and their shaykhs misrepresent Ibn Taymeeyah and Ibn Abdul Wahhab and they misrepresent the scholars and leaders of the Dawa&#8217; as we previously mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So do not approach them from this angle, since it is not from wisdom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, approach them from the angle of: ‘Malik said, Sufyaan ath-Thawree</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">said, al-Awzaa’ee said, Ibn &#8216;Uyainah said, Bukhari said, Muslim said, in such-and-such volume on such-and-such page.’  So the likes of these, they will accept from you.  Then if they accept this from you, they will after that respect Ibn Taymeeyah, they will know that he is on the truth and they will respect Ibn Abdul Wahab and they will know that he is on the truth etc.<em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: this is a word of admonition, to follow the path of wisdom in calling the people to Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is from wisdom not to curse their <em>Jamaah</em> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And insult not those whom they (disbelievers) worship besides Allaah, lest they insult Allaah wrongfully without knowledge. &gt;&gt; [al-An’aam:108]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Journey to Sudan</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: when I went to Sudan, we stopped at Port Sudan.[1]  I was received by the youth of <em>Ansaar as-Sunnah</em> and they said to me: O shaykh we want to bring your attention to something.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: “Go ahead.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: “Say whatever you want, say: &#8216;Allaah said, the Messenger of Allaah said.&#8217; and attack with whatever you want of <em>Bida&#8217;</em> and misguidance; like supplicating to other than Allaah, slaughtering, vows and seeking help etc.  But do not mention: such-and-such sect, nor so-and-so shaykh.  Do not mention that the <em>Tijaaneeyah</em> are from the different sects, nor the <em>Batineeyah</em>, nor mention their leaders, but quote the <em>&#8216;Aqaaid</em> (beliefs); and you yourself will find that the truth will be accepted from you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: “fine.”  And I followed that way and found a great acceptance from the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not think &#8211; O student of knowledge &#8211; that it is from the complete, truthful<em>Manhaj</em> that it is necessary to curse their shaykhs and to defame them!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Allaah <em>Subhanahu</em> says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And insult not those whom they (disbelievers) worship besides Allaah, lest they insult Allaah wrongfully without knowledge. &gt;&gt; [al-An’aam:108]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So don&#8217;t curse the shaykh or say: &#8216;deviant!&#8217; or something similar! Or such<strong><em>&#8211;</em></strong>and<strong><em>&#8211;</em></strong>such <em>Tariqaa</em> (<em>Soofee</em> path)!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since, when they hear this they run away from you.  You will be sinful and will have pushed the people away then you will be those who cause the people to turn away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> sent Muadh and Abu Musa to Yemen he said: “Make things easy and do not make things difficult, give glad-tidings and do not push people away.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are from the ways in which there is ease and glad-tidings.  It does not cause the people to be driven away.  I swear by Allaah that I did not enter a masjid except that I saw joy on the faces of the people and I couldn&#8217;t exit the place due to the many people who came to me to shake my hand and invite me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the leaders of the <em>Soofeeyah &#8211; Shayaateen &#8211;</em> saw the danger of this way and this methodology in giving <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>, so they gathered together and conspired and strung some statements together with which to refute me.  They announced a lecture for me in a big field.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we all gathered in this field and I spoke, then their leader got up and commented upon what I said, he began to allow seeking help from other than Allaah, to allow <em>Tawwassul </em>(Seeking closeness to Allaah with Haram means), to speak with the denial of <em>Sifaat</em>, talking and talking &#8230;&#8230;.. Supporting all types of falsehood with an evil interpretation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he finished &#8211; he had no evidences, and he had mentioned weak and fabricated Ahadeeth and he mentioned sayings of Socrates.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: “O people, you have heard my speech and I say: ‘Allaah said, the Messenger said.  The well known scholars of the <em>Ummah</em> said.’  This man has mentioned fabricated Ahadeeth and did not support it with anything from the Qur&#8217;aan.  Did you hear: &#8216;Allaah said such-and-such in allowing seeking aid from other than Allaah?  And regarding the permissibility of <em>Tawwassul</em>?  Did you hear statements of the senior scholars like Malik and those like him?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You did not hear that, rather you heard fabricated and weak Ahadeeth and the statements of people who you know well to believe in superstitions.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this person who believed in superstitions began cursing and swearing.  And I began laughing, I did not curse him nor did I swear at him and I did not say anything more then: may Allaah bless you, may Allaah reward you, may Allaah reward you, may Allaah bless you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then we left, I swear by Allaah other than whom there is none worthy of worship except Him &#8211; the next day the people began talking in the <em>masajid</em> and the markets that the <em>Soofeeyah</em> were defeated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] This is an inference to a lecture that Shaykh Rabee’ gave in the city of Port Sudan in the year 1392 A.H.  This is just one of many of the evidences that Shaykh Rabee’ follows a moderate Manhaj &amp; has wisdom in giving Dawa’ to Allaah from the beginning of his life until today.  This is contrary to what some people claim that Shaykh Rabee’ follows a Manhaj of harshness. – Publisher’s Quote.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Narrated by Bukhari (3038) &amp; by Muslim (1733) from the hadeeth of Abu Musa al-Ashaari –radhiAllaahu anhu.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 5</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Guidance for the People</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So learn, O brothers, the correct methods of the <em>Sharia&#8217;</em>.  The aim is guidance for the people and the aim is conveying the truth to the hearts of the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brother, it is upon you to use all that you can from the ways of the <em>Sharia&#8217;</em> in the path of <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> to Allaah.  And we do not believe that the ends justify the means since this is from the characteristics of the people of <em>Bida&#8217;</em> who fell into &#8211; due to these characteristics &#8211; lying, twisting, circling around the subject and trickery.  Just as the Imam &#8216;Alee bin Harb al-Moosalee said: &#8216;Every person who follows his desire lies and he doesn&#8217;t care that he lies.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We don&#8217;t have any of these characteristics; we are the people of honesty and the people of truth.  We present the truth in a form and fashion which the people accept and it affects their hearts, may Allaah bless you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then we also went to &#8216;Kasla&#8217; in Sudan and <em>MashAllaah</em> the <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> was going smoothly and well and all praise belongs to Allaah, we spoke there and praise belongs to Allaah and Allaah made our speech beneficial.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then we went to &#8216;al-Ghazarif&#8217; it is a small city there and we rotated between all the <em>masajd</em> in that place.  The people said: there does not remain in this city except one <em>masjid</em>, which is with the <em>Tijaaneeyah</em>, which we cannot get to!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I SAID: &#8216;WHY NOT?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: &#8216;They&#8217;re prejudiced, severely prejudiced.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: &#8216;Let&#8217;s go to them and request permission, if they allow us to talk, we will convey the message and if they prevent us then we have an excuse in front of Allaah, it is not necessary that we face them with force and strength <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>..</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we went there and the imam led us in prayer.  After we finished it, I gave him Salaams and said to him, will you allow me to deliver a speech to these brothers?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8216;go ahead.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I spoke, called to Allaah, to Tawheed, to Sunnah and to other matters of knowledge.  I criticized some of the mistakes which are present, points of misguidance until I reached to the hadeeth of &#8216;Aeysha <em>–radhiAllaahu anha-</em> which is mentioned by Bukhari and Muslim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There are three things, whoever speaks with one of them then he has told a major lie against Allaah: whoever says: that Muhammad saw his Lord; then he has told a major lie against Allaah, whoever says: that Muhammad knows what will happen tomorrow; then he has told a major lie against Allaah’: and I mentioned the proofs for that &#8211; &#8216;and he who claims that Muhammad did not convey what was revealed to him; then he has told a major lie against Allaah.’[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Imam stood up &#8211; he was annoyed and he said to me: ‘I swear by Allaah that indeed Muhammad saw his Lord with his own eyes!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to him: <em>JazakAllaahu khair</em>.  As for ‘Aeysha &#8211; who is the most knowledgeable of the people about the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em>, she said: ‘whoever says: that Muhammad saw his Lord; then he has told a major lie against Allaah.’ If the Messenger of Allaah had seen his Lord he would have told her, but he did not tell her this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he began to make a din and press me, I said to him: ‘O my brother wait until I finish my talk, then after that ask about whatever you want.  That which I know I can answer, that which I do not know, I&#8217;ll say to you Allaah knows best.’  I left him and continued speaking, I don&#8217;t know if he remained or left.  I don’t know, I didn&#8217;t turn around towards him. Then I heard a man saying:  ‘I swear that what this man is speaking the truth!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I heard the same sentence again from somebody else and he added: &#8216;the man is saying: &#8216;Allaah said, the Messenger of Allaah said.&#8217; <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the <em>Adhaan</em> was called for the <em>Isha</em> prayer, so the talk ended.  The prayer was about to begin and the people began pushing me to lead them in prayer. So I said to them: &#8216;no way, I won&#8217;t lead you in prayer, the <em>Imam</em> will lead.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: &#8216;we swear by Allaah you will lead the prayer, we swear by Allaah you will lead the prayer.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: &#8216;OK&#8217; and I led them in prayer.  After we finished I left with the youth of<em>Ansaar as-Sunnah </em>and I asked them: &#8216;where did the <em>Imam</em> go?&#8217; They said: &#8216;They evicted him.&#8217; I said: &#8216;who evicted him?&#8217; they said: &#8216;we swear by Allaah his congregation evicted him.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED. &#8211; O BROTHERS &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a person comes and says that the <em>Tijaaneeyah</em> <em>al-Marganiyaah</em> are fools! They might slaughter him, not just evict him, but if you come to them with wisdom and gentleness <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em> then Allaah will make them benefit by this.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Advice to the Salafiyyoon</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brothers, use beneficial knowledge and solid proof and beneficial wisdom in your <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>. You should have all the noble and beautiful manners encouraged by the Book and the Messenger of guidance; indeed they are causes for victory and causes for success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You have to believe that the Companions did not spread Islaam or enter it into the hearts except with their wisdom and their knowledge more so than with their swords.  However, whoever enters into Islaam under the sword might not be firm, but whoever enters Islaam by way of knowledge, proof and evidence then this is what makes his Eemaan firm by Allaah&#8217;s permission and His assistance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is upon you to have these good methods and also to be serious about knowledge.  You have to be serious about <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Now &#8211; O brothers &#8211; I advise you with two issues:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: Brotherhood between all of <em>Ahl -ul-Sunnah</em>; So O you Salafees, disseminate the soul of love and brotherhood between yourselves.  Put into effect what the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> informed us of regarding the believers: ‘Like a building, some of its parts supporting others.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that they are: ‘Like a single body if one limb complains then the rest of the body suffers with fever and insomnia.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is how you should be O brothers: distance yourselves from the causes of splitting, I swear by Allaah indeed it is a dangerous evil and a disastrous disease.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: distance yourselves from the causes which lead to enmity, hatred, splitting up and dissension.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Keep away from these things; because this has become predominant nowadays at the hands of people, about whom only Allaah knows their condition and intent.  It has become predominant and has torn apart the youth in this country &#8211; whether in the university or other than it &#8211; or in the other parts of the <em>Duniya</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why?! Because those who are not from its people – neither in knowledge nor in understanding &#8211; entered into the arena of giving <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is possible that the enemies could have entered someone into the midst of the <em>Salafeeyeen</em> to tear them apart and split them up, and this issue is not unlikely, rather it can truly happen <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Strive to have brotherhood.  If any dissension has occurred between you, then both parties should make themselves forget what is past and start with a clean slate now.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say to the brothers: whoever falls short it is not allowed to debase him, nor destroy the one who is deficient.  Whoever makes a mistake amongst us we do not destroy him. <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em> &#8211; but we cure him with gentleness, wisdom and face him with love and friendship and all the rest of the righteous manners, along with the correct <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> until he repents.  And if there remains a weakness in him then we are not hasty with him, or otherwise, I swear by Allaah no one will remain, no one will remain!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are some people now who chase after the Salafis so much so that they reached the scholars and called them those who water things down <em>(Mumaya’een)</em>!! There is hardly any scholar in the arena of <em>Dawa’</em> today except that he has been falsely attacked with this claim about him!  Of course this is the way of the Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen and the way of <em>Ahl-ul-Bida’</em> since, from the weapons of the <em>Ahl ul-Bid</em>a’ is that they begin by overthrowing the scholars, rather it is the Jewish Masonic way: that if you wanted to discredit an idea, then discredit their scholars or their personalities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So keep away from this rotten legacy and have respect for the scholars.</p>

<h1 style="text-align:justify;">The Intent of The Opponents</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I swear by Allaah; that those who make efforts in speech against me &#8211; or attack that which we are upon – do not do so except that the intended result is to bring down the <em>Manhaj</em>; so the one who dislikes this <em>Manhaj</em> speaks about its scholars.  He who hates this <em>Manhaj</em> and wants to bring it down follows this path, so that there are no obstacles for them: they follow way of the Jews and the way of the misguided groups from the Raawafidah and other than them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Raawafidah hate Islaam and they are not capable of speaking against Muhammad &#8211;<em> sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, so they speak against Abu Bakr and Umar and the scholars of the <em>Ummah</em>; they want to overthrow Islaam.  If the people of major <em>Bida&#8217;</em> speak: then they don&#8217;t speak against Ahmad and Shafi&#8217;, but they speak against Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab and Ibn Taymeeyah and their likes; so that they can try to overthrow this <em>Manhaj</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And now, we have people who have grown up amongst the ranks of the<em>Salafeeyeen</em>, I was not aware that they wanted to break up the leaders from amongst the scholars!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These people, what do they want? What do they want? If they intend Allaah and the Hereafter and intended to aid this <em>Manhaj</em> – they claim to love this<em>Manhaj</em> – but I swear by Allaah, if they really loved it they would have defended the scholars of this <em>Manhaj</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So do not feel safe about your <em>Deen</em> with these people.  Do not regard them as trustworthy. <em>BarakAllaahu Feekum</em> &#8211; be completely careful of them, hold together firmly and have brotherhood amongst yourselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I know that you are not without blame, nor are the scholars without blame – we sometimes make mistakes with the exception of those who fall into <em>Rafd</em> or<em>‘aatizal</em> or <em>Tajahum</em> or fall into <em>Hizbeeyah</em> from the different parties which are present; then this person is the one to be abandoned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <em>Salafi</em> who has allegiance to the <em>Salafeeyeen</em> and loves the <em>Salafi</em><em>Manhaj</em> <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>&#8211; and dislikes the different groups, dislikes <em>Bida’</em> and its people – amongst other aspects from the signs of the <em>Salafi</em> <em>Manhaj</em> – but then this <em>Salafi</em> becomes weak in other points, here we are gentle with this person we do not leave him but we advise him and we rescue him and we are patient with him and we try to cure him <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it were said: whoever makes a mistake is destroyed! Then according to this statement no-one remains! This is why you see these people, when they have finished dealing with the youth; they begin by overthrowing the scholars – this is the <em>Manhaj</em> of the Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen when they entered into many countries.  The first thing they started with was overthrowing the scholars and at the same time they defend Sayyid Qutb, Hasan al-Banna, Mawdudi and others from amongst <em>Ahl –ul Bida’</em>.  They overthrow the scholars of the <em>Salafi Manhaj</em> and they described the scholars as being agents and spies and scholars of the rulers……and many other accusations!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is their intent!?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their intent is to overthrow the <em>Salafi</em> <em>Manhaj</em> and to establish falsehood and misguidance upon mutiny.   Those who now defame the scholars say that they themselves are the <em>Salafiyoon</em> yet, along with that, they criticize the scholars of the <em>Salafiyyah</em>!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What do they want? Do they want to raise the banner of Islaam!? And raise the banner of the Sunnah and the <em>Manhaj</em> <em>as-Salafi</em>?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Never, never!  These are indications and proofs that they are blameworthy liars, no matter what they claim for themselves.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Final Counsel</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I advise you O brothers and I emphasize that you leave off splitting and that you should have brotherhood and mutual cooperation upon the truth. You should spread this <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> between the students of the university and other than them in its correct and beautiful form, not in the distorted form which these people follow!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Present the <em>Dawa&#8217; as-Salafiyyah</em> as I mentioned in a beautiful form with the words; ‘Allaah said, the Messenger of Allaah said, the Companions said, Shafi&#8217; said, Ahmad said, Bukhari said, Muslim said’, also the scholars of Islaam whom they respect and revere, bring their attention to the speech of the scholars <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em> this will aid you a great deal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Of course, you will find some people who will be obstinate but not everyone is obstinate.  You will find most of the people accepting your <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> whether it is here in the university or when you return to your countries. Use these methods which attract the people to the Book of Allaah and to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em>, to the <em>Manhaj</em> of the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em>, to the correct beliefs and correct <em>Manhaj</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka  wa Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em> that He gives us and you capability and success in that which He loves and is pleased with and that He makes us from the sincere callers and practising scholars and keeps us and you away from the plots of<em>Shaytaan</em>, also from the plots of the <em>Shayateen</em> from <em>Jinn</em> and mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Him <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em> that He puts love between your hearts and gathers you upon the truth, that you are beneficial wherever you reside and wherever you travel and go to, and I ask Allaah to make that a reality.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his Family, his Companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>
