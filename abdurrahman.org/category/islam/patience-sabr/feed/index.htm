<p><em><strong>Sahih Bukhari</strong> Volume 4, Book 55, Number 583:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">.. After Ishmael’s mother had died, Abraham came after Ishmael’s marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmael’s wife about him, she replied, ‘He has gone in search of our livelihood.’ <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied, ‘We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution,’ complaining to him.</strong></span> He said, ‘When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house).’ When Ishmael came, he seemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, ‘Has anyone visited you?’ She replied, ‘Yes, an old man of so-and-so description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were living in a hardship and poverty.’ On that Ishmael said, ‘Did he advise you anything?’ She replied, ‘Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the threshold of your gate.’ Ishmael said, ‘It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family.’ So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (i.e. Jurhum).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmael’s wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, ‘He has gone in search of our livelihood.’ <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Abraham asked her, ‘How are you getting on?’ asking her about their sustenance and living. She replied, ‘We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance).’ Then she thanked Allah’</strong></span> Abraham said, ‘What kind of food do you eat?’ She said. ‘Meat.’ He said, ‘What do you drink?’ She said, ‘Water.” He said, “O Allah! Bless their meat and water.” The Prophet added, “At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.” The Prophet added, “If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca.” The Prophet added,” Then Abraham said Ishmael’s wife, “When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate.’ When Ishmael came back, he asked his wife, ‘Did anyone call on you?’ She replied, ‘Yes, a good-looking old man came to me,’ so she praised him and added. ‘He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in a good condition.’ Ishmael asked her, ‘Did he give you any piece of advice?’ She said, ‘Yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate.’ On that Ishmael said, ‘It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to keep you with me.’ [<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2009/07/23/the-mother-of-ishmael/">https://abdurrahman.org/2009/07/23/the-mother-of-ishmael/</a>]</p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Explanation from Dr. Muhammad Bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Khumayyis&#8217; explanation of <em><a style="color:#993300;" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/09/21/explanation-of-four-rules-of-shirk-shaykh-muhammad-al-khumayyis/">Four Rules Regarding Shirk</a></em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Language</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>yatawallaaka</em> (He befriend you) meaning that He take you as a friend (<em>walee</em>) through (His) love, granting of success and guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Explanation</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author has begun by supplicating and asking Allaah, the Most Generous, Lord of the Great Throne, to befriend the one who reads this book in this world and the Hereafter. As for befriending him in this worldly life, then it is by loving him, guiding him, directing him and assisting him. And as for befriending him in the Hereafter, then it is by showing him mercy and forgiveness, protecting him from the Hellfire and admitting him into Paradise. Then he also supplicates that he be blessed wherever he may be, and that Allaah make him fulfill the meaning of servitude, as well as its stations, which are three:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>First: Being thankful for His Blessing</strong></span>. This is at the time when He gives it, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Work you, O family of Dawood, with thanks!”</span> [Surah Saba: 13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And if you are grateful, He will be pleased therewith for you.”</span> [Surah Az-Zumar:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And give thanks to Me and do not disbelieve.”</span> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 152]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Being thankful for Allaah’s Blessing is shown through the heart by way of affirming, acknowledging and showing gratitude. And it is shown through the tongue by way of speaking about the blessing and praising it. And it is shown through the limbs by way of acting in accordance with what pleases Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Second: Being patient during tribulations</span>,</strong> hard times and with the things that one hates, which befall the people as a test and examination from Allaah. What is obligatory in these situations is that one have patience. Patience means suppressing the heart from being displeased and from despairing; suppressing the tongue from complaining; and suppressing the limbs from those acts that negate and contradict patience. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And bear with patience whatever befalls you.”</span> [Surah Luqmaan: 17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And give glad tidings to those who are patient.”</span> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 155]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Third: Seeking forgiveness after committing a sin</strong></span>. This is since all of the Son of Aadam (i.e. humans) are sinners. But what is obligatory upon mankind when they should fall into sin is to rush to ask for forgiveness and repentance, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And those who when they commit some immoral act (i.e. fornication) or wrong themselves with evil, remember Allaah and so seek (His) forgiveness for their sins. And who is it that forgives sins except Allaah? And they do not persist knowingly in what sins they committed (after that).”</span> [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 135]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are the three characteristics: Being thankful for (Allaah’s) Blessing, being patient during times of tribulation, and seeking forgiveness after committing a sin. Whoever fulfills all of these will no doubt be from those who will experience happiness. In fact, happiness is linked to these three characteristics more than any others. All of them contain the meanings of Tawheed, submission, compliance and acceptance from Allaah.</p>

<p><strong>Posted from</strong>: <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/11/17/tafseer-explanation-surah-al-baqarah-dr-saleh-as-saleh/"><strong>Tafseer – Explanation Surah Al-Baqarah</strong></a> – Dr Saleh as Saleh [Audio Series|En]. Explanation Based on Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s Tafseer</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The following has been posted from <em>Tafseer Ibn Katheer</em> (Darussalam English Publications):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After Allah commanded that He be appreciated, He ordained patience and prayer. It is a fact that the servant is either enjoying a bounty that he should be thankful for, or suffering a calamity that he should meet with patience. A Hadith states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Amazing is the believer, for whatever Allah decrees for him, it is better for him! If he is tested with a bounty, he is grateful for it and this is better for him; and if he is afflicted with a hardship, he is patient with it and this is better for him.</strong></span>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah has stated that the best tools to help ease the effects of the afflictions are patience and prayer. Earlier we mentioned Allah&#8217;s statement:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَاسْتَعِينُوا بِالصَّبْرِ وَالصَّلَاةِ ۚ وَإِنَّهَا لَكَبِيرَةٌ إِلَّا عَلَى الْخَاشِعِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And seek help in patience and As-Salah </strong>(the prayer)<strong> and truly, it is extremely heavy and hard except for <em>Al-Khashiin</em> (</strong>i.e., the true believers in Allah<strong>)</strong></span> (2:45)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are several types of Sabr ـ patience: one for avoiding the prohibitions and sins, one for acts of worship and obedience. The second type carries more rewards than the first type. There is a third type of patience required in the face of the afflictions and hardships, which is mandatory, like repentance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Sabr has two parts: patience for the sake of Allah concerning what He is pleased with (i.e., acts of worship and obedience), even if it is hard on the heart and the body, and patience when avoiding what He dislikes, even if it is desired. Those who acquire these qualities will be among the patient persons whom Allah shall greet (when they meet Him in the Hereafter; refer to Surat Al-Ahzab 33:44), Allah willing.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Proof is He the Most High’s saying:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَالْعَصْرِ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الْإِنسَانَ لَفِي خُسْرٍ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">إِلَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالْحَقِّ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالصَّبْرِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">By Time. Mankind is certainly in loss. Except for those who have <em>eemaan</em> (those who truly believe) and perform righteous deeds, and enjoin one another with the truth and enjoin one another with patience.</span> [103:1-3]</strong><sup style="text-align:justify;">11</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory that you learn these four matters in detail – is there any proof for what the Shaikh has said? That it is obligatory upon us to learn these four matters, and he has promised us that he will not say anything except with a proof, so where is the proof? The proof upon that is His saying, He the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Bismillaahirra<u>h</u>maanirra<u>h</u>eem</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">By Time. Mankind is certainly in loss. Except for those who have <em>eemaan</em> </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(those who truly believe)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> and perform righteous deeds, and enjoin one another with the truth and enjoin one another with patience.</span> </strong>[103:1-3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Except for those who have <em>eemaan</em>”, <strong>this is the first matter</strong>: knowledge, because <em>eemaan</em> cannot be except through knowledge, which is awareness of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, awareness of His Prophet and awareness of the religion of Islaam with the proofs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second matter: </strong>“And they perform the righteous deeds”, this is action upon the knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third matter: </strong>“And they enjoin each other with the truth”, this is calling to the knowledge and action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The fourth matter:</strong> “And they enjoin each other with patience”, upon harm in the path of calling to knowledge and action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying, He the One free of all imperfections:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَالْعَصْرِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">By Time.</span> </strong>[103:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The, “<em>Waw</em>”, is the <em>waw-ul-qasm</em> (the <em>‘waw’</em> of an oath). And <em>Al-‘A<u>s</u>r </em>is a noun upon which an oath is sworn and it is <em>majroor</em>, and the sign that it is <em>majroor</em> is that it has a <em>kasrah</em> upon it. And what is meant is Time and a time period.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, swears by a time period and by Time, and it is something created. And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, swears by whatever He wishes from the creation, but the creation may not swear an oath except by Allaah. And Allaah does not swear an oath except by something which has importance, and which contains a Sign from His Signs, He the Perfect and Most High. So this Time, contains a lesson and has importance, and therefore Allaah swore an oath by Time, and He swore by the night when it covers, and He swore an oath by the daytime brightness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for the creation, then he may not swear an oath except by Allaah. And it is not permissible for us to swear an oath by other than Allaah. He <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu’ alaihi wa sallam </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Whoever swears an oath by other than Allaah, then he has committed unbelief or he has committed shirk.”</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said:<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Whoever is going to swear an oath, then let him swear by Allaah or let him keep silent.”</strong><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah swears by whatever he wishes and he does not swear except by something which has importance and which contains a lesson, so what is the lesson here in this Time? The lessons are tremendous, the succession of the night and the day, and how they interchange and take from each other, this one taking from that one, and that one taking from this one, and they succeed each other in this amazing ordered manner which does not vary or alter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a proof for the Ability of Allaah the Perfect and Most High. And then, whatever occurs within this Time from events and catastrophies and calamities and from favours and blessings and good things, and whatever occurs within this Time, this is from the lessons. And likewise because night and day are an arena for righteous action to be performed in. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> .. وَهُوَ الَّذِي جَعَلَ اللَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَارَ خِلْفَةً </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He </strong>(Allaah)<strong> is the One who made the night and the day to follow each other in succession …</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning they follow each other in succession, this one follows on from this one.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> لِّمَنْ أَرَادَ أَن يَذَّكَّرَ أَوْ أَرَادَ شُكُورًا ..</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">… for whoever wants to be reminded of Allaah or whoever wants to give thanks for Allaah’s favours.</span> </strong>[25:62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in some of the recitations of this <em>aayah, </em>it occurs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">… for the one who wants to remember Allaah …</span> </strong>[25:62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the night and the day are a tremendous bounty to be earned for a person who utilizes them in obedience to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and the arena for action is the night and the day, you have nothing else besides the night and the day, they are the arena for action and for good and pure earning for this world and the hereafter. So in the night and the day there are lessons and there are benefits, so therefore Allaah swore an oath by Time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is this oath sworn upon? It is His saying:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الْإِنسَانَ لَفِي خُسْرٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Mankind is certainly in loss.</span> </strong>[103:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It (Mankind) means all of the descendants of Aadam, He did not exclude anyone, neither the kings nor the leaders, nor the rich people nor the poor people, nor the free people nor the slaves, nor the males nor the females. So, “<em>Al-</em>”, in, “<em>Al-Insaan</em>”, is for <em>istighraaq</em> – to make the word all-inclusive. All of the descendants of Aadam are in loss, meaning they will be in loss and destruction if they waste this precious Time, and they utilize it in disobedience to Allaah and in doing that which will harm them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this Time which is very cheap with many people, time seems prolonged for them, they become weary and bored, and they say, “<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>We want to kill some time</strong></span>”. So they bring amusements, or they travel abroad to spend a holiday and just to spend some time somewhere, or they laugh and joke to use up time. So those people, they use it up and waste it – then it will be loss and regret upon them on the Day of Resurrection. And it could be the source of their true happiness, if only they took care of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So all of the descendants of Aadam are in loss and destruction, except for those who have the <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">four qualities</span></strong> which are: knowledge and action and calling to Allaah and having patience upon any harm which the person meets. So whoever has these four qualities will be saved from this loss.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And having <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah is not possible except through having knowledge, which is knowledge and awareness of Allaah.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"> وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they perform the righteous and correct deeds</span> </strong>[103:3]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning they perform the righteous deeds from the obligatory duties and the recommended duties. So they utilize their time in performing the righteous deeds in that which will benefit them in their religion and in their worldly life, for even worldly action contains good and can contain reward if it is done with the intention of using it as an aid upon obedience. So how about action for the hereafter. So what is important is that you do not waste the time, rather you use it in something which will be to your advantage and benefit you.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالْحَقِّ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they enjoin each other with the truth</span> </strong>[103:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They command the good and they forbid the evil and they call to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and they teach beneficial knowledge and they propagate knowledge and good amongst the people. They become callers to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"> وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالصَّبْرِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they enjoin each other with having patience.</span> </strong>[103:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They have patience upon whatever strikes them. <span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>abr</em></strong></span> in the language means <strong>restraining</strong>, and what is meant by it here is restraining oneself upon obedience to Allaah. And it is of three types:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first one is: </strong>Patience upon obedience to Allaah.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second one is: </strong>Patience in keeping away from those things which Allaah has forbidden.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third one is:</strong> Having patience with those things which Allaah has Pre-decreed to occur.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So the first:</strong> patience upon obedience to Allaah, because the person’s soul desires laziness and desires relaxation, so therefore a person must force it to have patience upon obedience and upon the prayer and upon fasting and upon <em>jihaad</em> in Allaah’s cause even though it may dislike these matters, he should cause it to have patience and he should restrain it on obedience to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And the second: </strong>patience in keeping away from those things Allaah has made forbidden. The soul desires forbidden things and desires. It inclines towards them and is attracted to them, so therefore the person must bind it and restrain it away from the forbidden things, and this requires patience, and it is not easy to prevent the soul from desires and forbidden things. Whoever does not have patience, then his soul will overcome him and incline towards forbidden things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third is: </strong>having patience with the painful things which Allaah has decreed, the calamities which strike a person, from the death of a close relative or loss of wealth or illness which befalls a person, he must have patience upon the pre-ordainment and pre-decree of Allaah and he should not become vexed and he should not become angry, rather he should restrain the tongue from wailing and forbidden lamenting and from displaying anger and he should withhold himself from vexation and he should withhold his limbs from striking the cheeks and from tearing the front-opening of the garments. This is patience upon calamities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for faults, then he should not have patience upon them, rather he should repent to Allaah and flee away from them. However, with regard to calamities which are not something which you yourself have done, rather they are from Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, He has decreed that they will occur to you as a test and a trial or as a punishment for you for sins which you have committed just as there occurs in His saying the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا أَصَابَكُم مِّن مُّصِيبَةٍ فَبِمَا كَسَبَتْ أَيْدِيكُمْ وَيَعْفُو عَن كَثِيرٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whatever calamity strikes you then it is on account of the sins which your hands have committed and Allaah pardons and does not punish, a great deal.</span> </strong>[42:30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a calamity strikes the Muslim in his self or in his wealth or in his children or his close relative or one of his brothers from the Muslims, then it is upon him to have patience and to await reward. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِينَ إِذَا أَصَابَتْهُم مُّصِيبَةٌ قَالُوا<span style="color:#008000;"> إِنَّا لِلَّهِ وَإِنَّا إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُونَ</span></span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أُولَٰئِكَ عَلَيْهِمْ صَلَوَاتٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ وَرَحْمَةٌ ۖ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُهْتَدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Those who, when a calamity strikes them they say, “Indeed we belong to Allaah and we will certainly be returning to Him”. Those people, upon them is praise from their Lord and mercy, and they are the ones who are guided.</span> [2:156-157]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is patience, and from that is having patience upon harm which comes in calling to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, for that is from the calamities. So it is upon you to have patience upon whatever you meet from harm upon the path of good. And do not turn away from doing good, because some people wish to do good, however, if something which he dislikes faces him he then says, “It is not obligatory upon me to enter myself into these matters”. Then he abandons teaching if he is a teacher, he abandons calling to Allaah, he abandons giving the <em>khu<u>t</u>bah</em> if he is a <em>kha<u>t</u>eeb</em> (one who gives the <em>khu<u>t</u>bah</em> in a mosque), he abandons leading the prayer in the mosque, he abandons commanding the good and forbidding the evil – this person has not had patience upon the harm which came to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if you are upon error, then it is upon you to turn back to the truth and to correctness, but if you are upon  something true and you have not erred, then it is upon you to have patience and to await and expect reward and to be aware and to feel that this is in the cause of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and that you will receive reward for it, and that you remember the harm which occurred to the Prophets <em>‘alaihimu<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam </em>and how they had patience and how they strove and fought in Allaah’s cause, until Allaah the Mighty and Majestic gave them victory.</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قَالَ الشَّافِعِيُّ رَحِمَهُ اللهُ:<span style="color:#808000;"> لَوْ مَا أَنْزَلَ اللهُ حُجَّةً عَلَى خَلْقِهِ إِلاَّ هَذِهِ السُّوْرَةَ لَكَفَتْهُمْ</span></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ash-Shaafi‘ee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said: “<strong>If Allaah had not sent down any proof upon his creation except this <em>soorah</em>, then that would have sufficed for them</strong>.”<sup>12</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “Ash-Shaafi‘ee”: He is the Imaam Mu<u>h</u>ammad ibn Idrees Ash-Shaafi‘ee and Ash-Shaafi‘ee is an ascription to his great great grandfather who was called Shaafi‘, and he was from Quraish from Banul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib. He died in the year 204 H, and he was one of the four Imaams. And he said this saying, because Allaah has made clear in this <em>soorah</em> the reasons for wretchedness and the means for true happiness and success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the means for true happiness and success is that the person has these four characteristics: knowledge, and action, and calling, and having patience upon harm in the cause of Allaah the Most High. So Allaah’s proof is established upon His creation through this <em>soorah</em>. Allaah the Perfect says to them &#8211; I have made clear to you the means for true happiness in this short and brief <em>soorah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Qur’aan, all of it, and the Sunnah are details for these four matters. However, this <em>soorah</em> has made clear the means to true happiness and success in general terms, through it the proof has been established upon the creation, and the texts of the Qur’aan and the Sunnah give the details and clarify these four matters. And the speech of Ash-Shaafi‘ee does not mean that this <em>soorah</em> is sufficient for mankind, even if Allaah had not sent down anything else. But rather it has established the proof upon them, because Allaah has made clear in it the means to true happiness and the reasons for total wretchedness, so on the Day of Resurrection no-one can say, “I did not know the means to true happiness and I did not know the reasons leading to total wretchedness”, when he has read this brief and short <em>soorah</em>.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<h3><strong>Calling to the Knowledge</strong></h3>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الثَّالِثَةُ: الدَّعْوَةُ إِلَيْهِ<sup> </sup><span style="font-size:10px;vertical-align:super;"> </span></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The third is calling to it.<sup>9</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>Calling to it</strong>”: meaning, it is not sufficient that a person learns knowledge and acts himself and does not call to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. Rather he must call and invite others so that he benefits himself and benefits others, and because this knowledge is something he is entrusted with, it is not your personal property which you can hoard away and withhold from the people, when the people are in need of it. So what is obligatory upon you is to convey it and to explain it and to call the people to good. This knowledge, which Allaah has given you the task of carrying, is not an endowment for your benefit alone, rather it is for you and for others besides you, so do not keep it to yourself and prevent the people from benefiting from it. Rather it is essential that you convey it and you must clarify it to the people. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِذْ أَخَذَ اللَّهُ مِيثَاقَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ لَتُبَيِّنُنَّهُ لِلنَّاسِ وَلَا تَكْتُمُونَهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And when Allaah took the solemn agreement from those who were given the scripture, you must make it clear to the people and not conceal it</span> </strong>[3:187]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a solemn agreement which Allaah took from the <em>‘ulemaa</em> (people of knowledge) that they would make clear to the people that which Allaah has taught them, in order that the good should spread, and to bring the people out from the depths of darkness into light, and this was the work of the Messengers and of those who followed them. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ هَٰذِهِ سَبِيلِي أَدْعُو إِلَى اللَّهِ ۚ عَلَىٰ بَصِيرَةٍ أَنَا وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَنِي ۖ وَسُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَمَا أَنَا مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say: “This is my way, I call to Allaah upon clear knowledge, I and those who follow me, and Perfect is Allaah and I am not from the people of <em>shirk</em> (those who associate others with Allaah).”</span> </strong>[12:108]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the way of Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu’alaihiwasallam </em>and the way of his followers: knowledge, and action and calling to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. So whoever does not call, and he has the ability to call, and he has knowledge and he conceals it, then he will be given a bridle of fire on the Day of Resurrection as occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Aboo Daawood and At-Tirmidhee and Ibn Maajah from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah who said: Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu’alaihiwasallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong> “Whoever is asked about knowledge and he conceals it, then Allaah will give him a bridle of fire on the Day of Resurrection”. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Albaanee declared this <u>h</u>adeeth <u>h</u>asan <u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Ibn Maajah reports a longer wording from Aboo Sa‘eed Al-Khudree … [declared very weak by Al-Albaanee].</p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Having patience upon harm which is encountered whilst carrying this out.</strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong><span style="color:#993300;">الرَّابِعَةُ: الصَّبْرُ عَلَى الأَذَى فِيهِ<sup>  </sup></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><sup> </sup>The fourth is having patience upon any harm encountered whilst carrying it out.<sup>10</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>Having patience upon any harm encountered whilst carrying it out</strong>”: it is known that whoever calls the people, and commands the good and forbids the evil, then he will be exposed to harm from the evil-doers, because many of the people do not want good, rather they want desires and forbidden things and false whims, so when someone comes who calls them to Allaah and who deters them away from their desires, then there will certainly be a reaction from them either in speech or in action. So what is obligatory upon whoever calls to Allaah and desires the Face of Allaah is that he should have patience upon the harm, and he should persist in calling to Allaah, and his example in that regard will be the Messengers <em>‘alaihimu<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em>, and the best of them and their seal is Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ’alaihi wasallam.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What did he encounter from the people, how much harm did he suffer in sayings and actions? They said he was a sorcerer and a liar, and they said he was a madman. They said those sayings about him which Allaah the Mighty and Majestic has mentioned in the Qur’aan. And they harmed him with physical harm, they threw stones at him until his heels ran with blood <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ’alaihi wasallam</em> when he called them to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. And they threw the after-birth of camels on his back whilst he was making prostration by the Ka‘bah, and they threatened to kill him and they tried to intimidate him, and in the battle of U<u>h</u>ud, there occurred to him and to his Companions that which occurred <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> – they broke his lateral incisor tooth and they wounded his head <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ’alaihi wasallam</em> and he fell into a ditch, and he was the Prophet of Allaah – all of this was harm in calling to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. However he had patience and he bore it and he was the most excellent one of the creation <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em>. So therefore whoever carries out this call will certainly face harm in accordance with the level of his <em>eemaan</em> and his call, however it is upon him to have patience as long as he is upon the truth, then he should have patience and bear it, for he is in Allaah’s cause, and whatever harm befalls him then it will be reward from Allaah the Perfect and Most High, upon the scale of his good deeds.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 39 : Points 54-56</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[54] And to have patience with the judgement of Allaah. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[55] And to have <em>eemaan</em> in all the decrees of Allaah, the good and the bad, the sweet and the bitter. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[56] Aand to have <em>eemaan</em> in whatever Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, has said. Allaah knew whatever the servants were going to do and where they were heading to, they do not escape from the knowledge of Allaah and there is nothing in the earth or in the heavens except that which is known by Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F377372234&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/glad-tidings-to-those-who-have-patience-when-they-are-struck-by-calamity" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A mention of this has already preceded at the beginning of the levels of <em>eemaan</em> in <em>Al-Qa<u>d</u>aa W’al Qadr</em> (preordainment and predecree). And using predecree and preordainment as an evidence when calamities strike, which a person <strong>does not have a choice about</strong>, is something praiseworthy because this shows his being satisfied and his submitting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَبَشِّرِ الصَّابِرِينَ</strong> &#8211; 2:155</p>
<p><strong>الَّذِينَ إِذَا أَصَابَتْهُم مُّصِيبَةٌ قَالُوا إِنَّا لِلَّهِ وَإِنَّا إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُونَ</strong> &#8211; 2:156</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And give glad tidings to those who have patience, those who when they are struck by calamity, they say “Indeed we belong to Allaah and to Him we shall return.” </strong></span>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah</em> 155-156)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for using predecree and preordainment as a proof for <strong>evil deeds</strong>, which they <strong>commit and do by choice</strong> then they have no argument in predecree for that. Rather, they are punished for their deeds and they are falling short and the gate to repentance is open instead of arguing with Allaah saying: “Why did You decree this upon me?” while you have abandoned the repentance. This is from blameworthy inabilities. Rather, hasten to repentance and seek forgiveness and blame yourself. So, this is what is required from the servant that he should look at his own deeds.</p>
<p><strong> وَلْتَنظُرْ نَفْسٌ مَّا قَدَّمَتْ لِغَدٍ ۖ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ</strong> &#8211; 59:18</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And let each soul look and see what deeds it puts forward for the Day of Judgement.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Hashr (59), <em>aayah</em> 18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look at your deeds, it is possible for you to change them and to repent from them and to seek forgiveness. As for preordainment and predecree then that is the affair for Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, it is not your matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And they will not exit from the Knowledge of Allaah,” </strong>everything Allaah has full knowledge of it and He, the Perfect and Most High fully encompasses it. He knows the disbelief of the disbeliever and the sin of the sinful person and the oppression of the oppressor. It is not hidden from Him. He knows the obedience of the obedient person and the actions of the obedient person. He knows this and that. However, He gives them some respite, gives them some time perhaps they will repent, perhaps they will return back. So if they repent, well and good otherwise in front of them is the reckoning; the <em>hisaab</em>. So, Allaah does not neglect them at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And there is not in the earth nor in the heavens except that which is known by Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic,” </strong>this is just as has preceded, everything is known by Allaah, whatever was in the past and whatever will be in the future, all of it Allaah has encompassed it with His Knowledge, nothing whatsoever is hidden from Him, He, the Perfect and Most High. He knew it and He decreed it and He wrote it and He wished it and willed it and He created it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the sons of Abu Talhah (May Allah be pleased with him) was ailing. Abu Talhah went out and the boy died in his absence. When he came back, he inquired, &#8220;How is the boy?&#8221;. Umm Sulaim, the mother of the boy, replied, &#8220;Better than before&#8221;. Then she placed his evening meal before him and he ate it; and thereafter slept with her. At last, she said to him: &#8220;Arrange for the burial of the boy&#8221;. In the morning, Abu Talhah went to Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and informed him of the event. He enquired, &#8220;Did you sleep together last night?&#8221; Abu Talhah replied in the affirmative, on which the Prophet (ﷺ) supplicated, &#8220;O Allah bless them.&#8221; Thereafter, she gave birth to a boy. Abu Talhah said to me: &#8220;Take up the boy and carry him to the Prophet (ﷺ)&#8221;; and he sent some dates with him. The Prophet (ﷺ) enquired, &#8220;Is there anything with him?&#8221; He said; &#8220;Yes, some dates&#8221;. The Prophet (ﷺ) took a date, chewed it and put it in the mouth of the baby and rubbed the chewed date around the baby&#8217;s gum and named him &#8216;Abdullah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narration in Bukhari adds: Ibn &#8216;Uyainah relates that a man from the Ansar told him that he had seen nine sons of this &#8216;Abdullah, every one of whom had committed the Noble Qur&#8217;an to memory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narration of Muslim says: The son of Abu Talhah (May Allah be pleased with him) who was born of Umm Sulaim died. She (Umm Sulaim) said to the members of the family: &#8220;Do not tell Abu Talhah about his son until I mention it to him myself.&#8221; Abu Talhah came (home) and she gave him supper. He ate and drank. She then beautified herself the best way she ever did and he slept with her. When she saw that he was satisfied after sexual intercourse with her, she said, &#8220;O Abu Talhah! If some people borrow something from another family and then (the members of the family) ask for its return, would they refuse to give it back to them.&#8221; He said, &#8220;No&#8221;. She said, &#8220;Then hope reward for your son&#8221;. Abu Talhah got angry, and said; &#8220;You left me uninformed until I stained myself (with sexual intercourse) and then you told me about my son. &#8220;He went to Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and informed him about the matter. Thereupon Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, &#8220;May Allah bless the night you spent together!&#8221; He (the narrator) said: She conceived. (One day) Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was in the course of a journey and she was along with him. When Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to come back to Al-Madinah from a journey, he would not enter it (during the night). When the people came near Al- Madinah, she felt labour pains. He (Abu Talhah) remained with her and Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) proceeded on. Abu Talhah said: &#8220;O Rubb, You know that I love to go along with Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) when he goes out and enter along with him when he enters, and I have been detained as You see.&#8221; Umm Sulaim then said: &#8220;O Abu Talhah, I do not feel (so much pain) as I was feeling earlier, so we better proceed on. So we proceeded on and she felt the labour of delivery as they reached (Al-Madinah). She gave birth to a male child. My mother said to me: &#8220;O Anas, none should suckle him until you go to Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) tomorrow morning.&#8221; The next morning I carried the baby with me to Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and narrated the rest of the story.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وعن أنس رضي الله عنه قال‏:‏ كان ابن لأبي طلحة رضي الله عنه يشتكي، فخرج أبو طلحة، فقبض الصبي، فلما رجع أبو طلحة قال‏:‏ ما فعل ابني‏؟‏ قالت أم سليم وهى أم الصبي ‏:‏ هو أسكن ما كان، فقربت إليه العشاء فتعشى، ثم أصاب منها، فلما فرغ قالت‏:‏ واروا الصبي، فلما أصبح أبو طلحة أتى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فأخبره، فقال‏:‏ ‏&#8221;‏أعرستم الليلة ‏؟‏‏&#8221;‏ قال‏:‏ نعم ، قال‏:‏ ‏&#8221;‏اللهم بارك لهما، فولدت غلاماً، فقال لي أبو طلحة‏:‏ احمله حتى تأتى به النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم، وبعث معه بتمرات، فقال‏:‏ ‏&#8221;‏أمعه شيء‏؟‏‏&#8221;‏ قال‏:‏ نعم، تمرات فأخذها النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم فمضغها ، ثم أخذها من فيه فجعلها في فيّ الصبي ، ثم حنكه وسماه عبد الله‏.‏ ‏(‏‏(‏متفق عليه‏)‏‏)‏ ‏.‏</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وفى رواية لمسلم‏:‏ مات ابن لأبي طلحة بن أم سليم ، فقالت لأهلها لا تحدثوا أبا طلحة بابنه حتى أكون أنا أحدثه، فجاء فقربت إليه عشاءً فأكل وشرب، ثم تصنعت له أحسن ما كانت تصنع قبل ذلك، فوقع بها، فلما أن رأت أنه قد شبع وأصاب منها قالت‏:‏ يا أبا طلحة، أرأيت لو أن قوماً أعاروا عاريتهم أهل بيت فطلبوا عاريتهم، ألهم أن يمنعوهم‏؟‏ قال‏:‏ لا، فقالت ‏:‏ فاحتسب ابنك‏.‏ قال‏:‏ فغضب، ثم قال‏:‏ تركتني حتى إذا تلطخت أخبرتني بابني‏؟‏‏!‏ فانطلق حتى أتى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم فأخبره بما كان ، فقال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم‏.‏ ‏&#8221;‏بارك الله في ليلتكما‏&#8221;‏ قال‏:‏ فحملت، قال وكان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم في سفر وهي معه، وكان رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم إذا أتى المدينة من سفر لا يطرقها طروقاً فدنوا من المدينة، فضربها المخاض، فاحتبس عليها أبو طلحة، وانطلق رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قال‏:‏ يقول أبو طلحة‏:‏ إنك لتعلم يارب أنه يعجبني أن أخرج مع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم إذا خرج، وأدخل معه إذا دخل، وقد احتبست بما ترى، تقول أم سليم‏:‏ يا أبا طلحة ما أجد الذى كنت أجد، انطلق، فانطلقنا، وضربها المخاض حين قدما فولدت غلاماً‏.‏ فقالت لي أمي ‏:‏ يا أنس لا يرضعه أحد حتى تغدو به على رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم، فلما أصبح احتملته فانطلقت به إلى رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم‏.‏ وذكر تمام الحديث‏.‏</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ghamm</strong> Occurs Due To Misfortunes that happened in the past while <strong>hamm</strong> occurs due to an expected misfortune in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When someone has the feeling of grief in regard to his past sins, his grief will benefit him, because he is rewarded for it. Whoever worries about a good deed he wishes to do, his worry will benefit him as well. However if someone grieves for something that he missed from this world, then [he should know] that the missed thing will not return and that grief harms, so practically he is adding harm to harm, as I have mentioned in the previous chapter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A resolute person should protect himself from what brings about grief, and that is losing an object he loves. Therefore, whoever has many objects that he loves, his grief increases, and whoever decreases his objects of love his grief decreases accordingly. Someone may say, when I have no objects of love I also still have grief, we affirm this but we say to him; your grief over not having a loved one is not even a tenth of the grief experienced by the one who has lost a loved one. Have you not noticed that the one who does not have a child lives in grief but not as much as the one who lost his child?! Moreover when a person becomes accustomed to what he loves and enjoys it for a long period of time, it takes over his heart, therefore when he loses it he will feel the bitterness of his loss which will be greater than all the satisfaction he had during his lifetime. This is because the loved one is corresponding to the self just as health corresponds to it, which causes the self not to find satisfaction except in it, for its absence disturbs it. This is why the self grieves for its loss much more than it rejoices in its presence, because the inner self believes that what it had was its given right to possess. Therefore a wise person should monitor the closeness between himself, his beloved to ensure it remains moderately balanced, however if he requires that which brings about grief [i.e. loving some object or person], this causes grief then the cure is first to believe in predestination and that whatever Allah predestines is going to happen. He should then know that life is founded on distress, all constructed buildings shall eventually be ruined, all gatherings shall eventually depart, and whoever wants the lasting of what does not last is like he who wants what does not exist to exist. Therefore he should not ask of life what it was not created for.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A poet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>It [worldly life] is founded on distress yet you want it, Free of harm and distress </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should imagine that what befell him is multiplied, for this is when what he suffers will be easier on him. It is a habit of smart porters to put something heavy on top of what they are carrying, and then after taking a few steps, to remove the heavy object as that makes what they are carrying feel lighter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should also wait, in times of prosperity for an attack of tribulation, so that if any tribulation befalls him, he should think of what remains instead of what he has lost so that when part of that befalls him it becomes very easy on him. Such as when some- one loses some money so he counts what remains, and then considers the remaining as a profit. Or if someone imagines that he loses his eyesight, so that when he has ophthalmia, it becomes easy on him to bear this illness, likewise with the rest of harmful matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A poet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The prudent imagines in himself,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>his tribulations before they befall him.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>If they suddenly befall him,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>they do not surprise him because he had already imagined them.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And the ignorant trusts the days,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>and he forgets the demise of those who came before him.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So when trials of times surprise him,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>with some trials he becomes lost</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Though if he was strict in his affairs,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>patience would have taught him boldness</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A member of the righteous predecessors said, &#8220;I saw a woman, whose youthfulness surprised me, I said, &#8216;[There is no doubt] This face has never suffered from sorrow or sadness.&#8217; She said, Do not say that! For I do not know anyone who has suffered from what I have suffered. I had a husband who bought a sacrificial animal and slaughtered it, and we had two sons. The eldest told the one younger than him, &#8216;Come and I will show you how our father slaughtered the ewe/ So he slaughtered his brother. When we started to look for him, he ran away and my husband died while looking for him/ I said, &#8216;So how are you handling your sorrow?&#8217; She said, &#8216;If I could find aid in sorrow I would have employed it.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Section One: Treating Sorrow, Sadness and Grief</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sorrow, sadness and grief may befalls one due the prevalence of blackness, which should be treated with what will remove this blackness; which are the things that bring about joy. Grief freezes the blood while happiness heats it until its intrinsic heat is raised, both of them (happiness and grief) can harm, and may lead to death, if they are not immediately kept within moderate levels.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE RULING CONCERNING WISHING FOR DEATH DUE TO ENCOUNTERING MANY HARDSHIPS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[Q]: I have faced so many hardships in my life that it has made me hate this life. Every time I turned to Allaah and pleaded to Him to take my life at the earliest possible moment. This continues to be my wish up until now, as I do not see any solutions to my problems except death; it is the only thing that can save me from this torment. Is this behaviour <i>haraam</i> (forbidden) for me?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: <strong>Shaykh Ibn al-‘Uthaymeen</strong> – <em>rahima</em><i>hullaah</i> – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“When a person wishes for death due to the hardships and afflictions that have befallen him, then he is doing something that Allaah’s Messenger <i>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i> prohibited, when he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>“None of you should wish for death due to some harm that has come to him, rather, if he has such a wish then let him say: O Allaah! Give me life if You know that life is better for me. And give me death if You know that death is better for me.” </i></span>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is not allowed for anyone to wish for death on account of some harm, hardship or difficulty that has come to him. In fact, he should have <i>sabr</i> (patience) and expect a reward from Allaah – the Most High – due to his being patient, and he should wait for relief to come to him; just as the Prophet <i>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>“And know that victory comes with patience, relief with distress, and ease with hardship.”</i></span>[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the one who is afflicted with any affliction should know that those afflictions are an expiation for some of the sins he has committed. Indeed, no Believer is afflicted with any kind of grief, pain or suffering except that Allaah expiates – due to that – some of his sins; even if it be the harm caused by a mere pricking of a thorn. So when a person has patience and hopes in a reward from Allaah, he reaches the level of being amongst the <i>saabiroon</i> (those who truly have patience), and this is a very lofty level. <span style="line-height:1.5;">Allaah – the Most High said about its people:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“And give glad tidings to the apatient ones; those who, when afflicted by a calamity, say: Indeed we belong to Allaah, and to Him shall we truly return.”</span></em> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:155-156].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The woman in the question feels that there is no solution for her problems except death. I believe that this is a mistaken view.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Death does not solve any problems. In fact, sometimes it only increases the difficulties. How many people die whilst being afflicted with calamities, difficulties and suffering, but they had been wronging themselves by sinning, and did not give up their sins or repent to Allaah. So death, in this case, is just a quicker coming of punishment.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps if such a person had remained alive, then Allaah would have guided him him to the doors of repentance, seeking forgiveness, patience, facing up to the problems and expecting relief. All of this would have been good for him. Therefore, it is upon you – the questioner – to be patient and expect relief from Allaah – the Mighty and Majestic – just as Allaah – the Most High – said in His Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“So indeed with hardship here is relief. Indeed with hardship there is relief.”</span> </em>[Soorah Inshiraah 94:5-6].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet <i>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i> said in the authentic narration:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>“Victory comes with patience; relief with affliction, and ease with hardship.” </i></span>[5] [6]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">There are also some Angels who write down the deeds of human beings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;But verily, over you (are appointed Angels in charge of mankind) to watch you, honorable, writing down (your deeds), they know all that you do&#8221;</strong></span> (Al-Infitar 82:10-12)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Not a word does he (or she) utter, but there is a watcher by him ready (to record it)&#8221;</strong></span> (Qaf 50: 18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the companions of Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy upon him, visited him while he was sick. He found him groaning from the sickness. He said:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>&#8220;O Abu &#8216;Abdullah! Are you groaning? Tawus said &#8216;Indeed, the Angels write down everything, even the groan of a sick person, because Allah says:</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Not a word does he (or she) utter, but there is a watcher by him ready (to record it(Qaf 50: 18)&#8221;&#8216;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, Abu &#8216;Abdullah began to have (more) patience, and he stopped groaning,[1] because everything is written down. &#8220;Not a word does he (or she) utter? &#8211; Meaning any word uttered by you is written. However, you might be rewarded or punished for it. This is based on the saying that was said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[1] For what was reported by Salih bin Al-Imam Ahmad, he said: <em>&#8220;During his sickness prior to death, my father said: &#8216;Take out the book of &#8216;Abdullah bin Idris.&#8217; then said: &#8216;Read to me the narration of Laith that Tawus used to dislike groaning during sickness.&#8217; After that I did not hear to my father a groan till he died.&#8221;</em> Siyar A&#8217;lam An-Nubula (11:215).</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b></b><b></b><b>Q: Could you please tell us about the reward that Allah prepares for the patient in this world and in the hereafter and those who are obedient to Him (Exalted be He)?</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody"><b>A: </b>Allah (Glorified be He) created mankind and Jinn (creatures created from fire) to worship Him Alone and not to associate any partner with Him. He (Exalted be He) thus says: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody">&#8220;And I (Allâh) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone).&#8221; </span></strong><span class="HarfBody" style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Dhariyat, 51: 56</span> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Allah (Exalted be He) also says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody"> &#8220;O mankind! Worship your Lord (Allâh), Who created you and those who were before you so that you may become Al-Muttaqûn (the pious &#8211; See V.2:2).&#8221; </span></strong><span class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 21</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">The `Ibadah (worship) that mankind and Jinn are created for and commanded to do is to obey Allah (Exalted be He), avoid His prohibitions, and mention Him abundantly. The essence of `Ibadah is to believe in Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah) and to manifest this through making Du`a&#8217; (supplication) to Allah Alone, fearing Allah Alone, longing for His Mercy, and being sincere to Him in all forms of `Ibadah such as Salah (Prayer), Sawm (Fast), and so on.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Allah (Exalted be He) promises His obedient slaves that He will bestow upon them abundant goodness and praised rewards in this world and in the hereafter. Allah (Exalted be He) promised them that He will grant them Jannah (Paradise) and dignity in the Hereafter. Thus, Allah (Exalted be He) says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody"> &#8220;So be patient. Surely, the (good) end is for Al-Muttaqûn (the pious)&#8221; </span></strong><span class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Hud, 11: 49</span></span><strong><span class="HarfBody"><br />
</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Allah (Exalted be He) also says: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody">&#8220;&#8230;but give glad tidings to As-Sâbirûn (the patient).&#8221; </span></strong><span class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 155</span></span><strong><span class="HarfBody"><br />
</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody"> &#8220;Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: &#8220;Truly! To Allâh we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.&#8221;&#8221; </span></strong><span class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 156</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;They are those on whom are the Salawât (i.e. who are blessed and will be forgiven) from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His Mercy, and it is they who are the guided ones.&#8221; </strong><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 157</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Only those who are patient shall receive their reward in full, without reckoning.&#8221; </strong><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Zumar, 39: 10</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Whoever works righteousness &#8211; whether male or female &#8211; while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islâmic Monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter).&#8221; </span></strong><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 97</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;<a style="color:#000000;" name="Nobodyisgivenablessingbetter"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="15206" class="tip"></span>Nobody is given a blessing better and greater than patience.</span>&#8221; <span style="color:#808080;">[1]</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (peace be upon him) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;<a style="color:#000000;" name="Wonderfularetheaffairsofa"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="10537" class="tip"></span>Wonderful are the affairs of a believer, for there is good in every affair of them. If they have an occasion to feel delight, they thank &#8216;Allah&#8217;, thus there is good for them in it; and if they suffer from an affliction, they endure it patiently, which is good for them. This is not the case with anyone else except a believer.</span>&#8221; <span style="color:#808080;">[2]</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, the patient person has a praised reward in this world and in the hereafter or he will be rewarded in Jannah and dignified in the hereafter. It is worth mentioning that such a reward will only be given to the patient person who shows patience regarding being pious, adherence to obedience of Allah, and enduring the hardships that they encounter in this world; poverty, illness, and so on. Allah (Glorified be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> &#8220;It is not Al-Birr (piety, righteousness, and each and every act of obedience to Allâh, etc.) that you turn your faces towards east and (or) west (in prayers); but Al-Birr is (the quality of) the one who believes in Allâh, the Last Day, the Angels, the Book, the Prophets&#8221; </span></strong><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 177</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">until His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> &#8220;&#8230;and who are patient in extreme poverty and ailment (disease) and at the time of fighting (during the battles). Such are the people of the truth and they are Al-Muttaqûn (the pious).&#8221; </span></strong><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 177</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Generally speaking, patience and piety always lead to praised consequences. Allah (Exalted be He) tells the believers regarding their enemy: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">&#8220;But if you remain patient and become Al-Muttaqûn [the pious &#8211; See V.2:2], not the least harm will their cunning do to you.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Subhanahu wa ta’ala (the One Free of all Imperfection, the most High) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;And certainly, We shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits, but give glad tidings to As-Sabirin.&#8221;</strong></span> [2:155]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: &#8220;Truly! To Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.&#8221;</strong></span> [2:156]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Calamities inflicted on man:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- Fear: covering the general fear and the specific fear.<br />
2- Hunger: state when one&#8217;s stomach is empty of food while being eager to have it.<br />
&#8211; Having little food<br />
&#8211; Having little means of acquiring it<br />
&#8211; Afflicted with an illness which prevents the person from eating due to loss of appetite, a blockage in the throat, ulcers in the stomach or a disease preventing absorption of nutrients.<br />
3- Loss of wealth: This covers money, belongings, cattle etc.<br />
4- Loss of Lives<br />
5- Loss of fruits, either less produce or destruction of the produce</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2:155] <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And certainly, We shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits, but give glad tidings to As-Sabirin.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2:156] <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: &#8220;Truly! To Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The saying of Allaah subhanahu wa ta’ala (what means): “but give glad tidings to AsSabirin,” tells us of the merits of the patient ones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2:45] <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And seek help in patience and As-Salât (the prayer) and truly it is extremely heavy and hard except for Al-Khâshi&#8217;ûn [i.e. the true believers in Allâh &#8211; those who obey Allâh with full submission, fear much from His Punishment, and believe in His Promise (Paradise, etc.) and in His Warnings (Hell, etc.)].</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of knowledge said that patience is of three types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Patience on the obedience to Allaah<br />
2. Patience on avoiding disobedience and keeping away from sins<br />
3. Patience on the pre-decrees of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most difficult and the most superior of them all in merits is the first type Because it involves acting, which covers doing acts of obedience and restraining the self from laxness towards that so that the self does not abandon obedience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As to the patience on avoiding the sin there is only restrainment. This type of patience has more merits than the patience concerning the pre-decree of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Patience on the pre-decrees of Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala, is inevitable: whether we are patient or not the decree is certain to pass, and one&#8217;s sorrow would not lift the pre-decree.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2:155] <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And certainly, We shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits, but give glad tidings to As-Sabirin.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2:156] <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: &#8220;Truly! To Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People as a whole can be divided into two types in relation to patience:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The patient ones<br />
2. The discontent ones: those who express displeasure and complaints</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having patience on calamities is obligatory and people afflicted with calamities react in different ways:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">i) Displeasure and complaint (and this is unlawful)<br />
ii) Patience<br />
iii) Contentment<br />
iv) Gratitude (Ash-Shukr)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Concerning the first one it is unlawful.</strong> It is not permitted for the person to be displeased and discontent with the pre-decree of Allaah neither in his heart, on his tongue or by his actions as this is from the major sins</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;He who slaps his cheeks, tears his clothes and follows the ways and traditions of the Days of Ignorance is not one of us.&#8221;</strong> </span>[Al Bukhari Volume 2, Book 23, Number 382].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This does not mean that the person cannot be sad and that he is the same whether afflicted by calamity or not. He is called, however, to persevere and be patient. The situation is not the same to the person before and after the calamity, he feels it but he does not say except that which pleases Allaah and does not do what angers Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second reaction is having patience</strong>, it is obligatory and a must for the person to observe patience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the third reaction is contentment, being content with the pre-decree of Allaah, and content with this calamity which befalls him</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The difference between being patient and being content:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The patient person feels pain in his heart but does not express it in his sayings and actions and does not do what displeases Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The content person does not go in pain, meaning that the presence or absence of the calamity, knowing it is from Allaah, does not make him feel in his heart the pain and (or) sorrow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third level of Contentment</strong> is higher than the second level of Patience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The fourth reaction of gratitude</strong> for the calamity (Ash-shukr):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How is a person thankful for a calamity which touches him and affects him? First, these calamities could be hastened punishments for sins which he has done so he thanks Allaah that He hastened the punishment of these sins in this life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Secondly, he thanks Allah for not making his calamities more sever i.e. in his deen. Thirdly, he thanks Allaah by anticipating the reward because the more severe the calamity, the more is he rewarded. Therefore, he thanks Allah subhaanahu wa ta&#8217;aala for the reward which will be much more than what he can expect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the four stations that people fall in with respect to calamities that Allaah mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2:156] <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: &#8220;Truly! To Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The patient ones have combined Allaah’s Lordship with the rewards necessitating the righteous work and they refer the whole thing to Allah, in their hearts and on their tongues. So to say: &#8220;Truly! To Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return,&#8221; is from the completion and perfection of patience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also to say that which came in the Sunnah: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“O Allah give me reward on my calamity; bring forth to me something better than it”</strong></span> [Saheeh Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Truly! To Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.&#8221; Saying this together with patience is the guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2:157] <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>They are those on whom are the Salawat (i.e. blessings, etc.) (i.e. who are blessed and will be forgiven) from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His Mercy, and it is they who are the guided-ones.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>Note: may Allaah, the most High, reward our ADMIN team in the room &#8220;understanding islam&#8221; for their works on text documentation during classes. This is one of their efforts.</em></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwaa: Becoming Angry When Hardships Occur<br />
فتاوى أركان اإلسال )سOriginal Title: )46<br />
Original Author: Muhammad Ibn Saalih Al-‘Uthaymeen<br />
Translated by: Abu az-Zubayr Harrison &#8211; <a href="http://www.authentic-translations.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">authentic-translations.com</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from Fataawaa Arkaan Al-Islaam (no. 64) by Shaykh Ibn Al-‘Uthaymeen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Question</span></strong>: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>What’s the ruling of someone who becomes angry when a hardship or affliction befalls him?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Answer</span></strong>: People, during circumstances of affliction or difficulties, are at four levels:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">The First Level &#8211; Becoming Angry</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This can be in different ways:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first way: The anger is by the heart as if he’s angry at his Lord. So, he gets angry with what Allaah has decreed for him, and this (level) is not permissible. It’s possible that it could even lead to disbelief. Allaah (عزّ وجلّ) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَنْ يَعْبُدُ اللَّهَ عَلَى حَرْفٍ فَإِنْ أَصَابَهُ خَيْرٌ اطْمَأَنَّ بِهِ وَإِنْ أَصَابَتْهُ فِتْنَةٌ </span><span style="color:#000000;">انْقَلَبَ عَلَى وَجْهِهِ خَسِرَ الدُّنْيَا وَاآلخِرَةَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And among mankind is he who worships Allaah as it were, upon the very edge (i.e. in doubt); if good befalls him, he’s content therewith, but if a trial befalls him, he turns back on his face (i.e. reverts back to disbelief after embracing Islaam). He loses both this world and the Hereafter.</span> [Soorah Al-Hajj, 22:11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second type: The anger is by the tongue like making praying and supplicating for destruction or ruin or by similar statements, and this is also impermissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third type: The anger is by the limbs like slapping the cheeks, ripping the clothes, pulling out hair (some Arab cultural reactions of Jaahiliyyah), and similar actions. And none of this is allowed; it’s in contradiction to having patience which is required.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">The Second Level &#8211; Remaining Patient</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It’s just like a poet said, “Patience, like its name, is bitter in taste, yet its outcomes are sweeter than honey.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such a person sees this thing (the affliction, problem) as weighing down heavily on him, But he bears it although he dislikes that it happened. His faith bears it patiently and prevents him from being angry. So, the times of affliction and times without are not the same to him. This (level) is obligatory because Allaah (عزّ وجلّ) commanded the people to be patient, saying:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَاصْبِرُوا إِنَّ اللَّهَ مَعَ الصَّابِرِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And be patient. Certainly, Allaah is with the patient ones.</span>[Soorah Al-Anfaal 8:46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">The Third Level – Being Pleased with the Affliction</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In such a way, the person is pleased with the affliction. It’s the same to him whether it happened or not; it’s not difficult upon him and he doesn’t bear it as if it is something weighing heavily on him. This (level) is preferred but not an obligation according to the most correct opinions. The difference between this level and the one before it is apparent because the affliction happening or not happening (in this third level) is the same due to the fact that the person at this level is actually content and pleased. As for the level before it, the affliction is hard upon him, yet he still remains patient over it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>The Fourth Level – Being Thankful</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Actually being grateful is the highest level. This is the state when a person thanks Allaah for the affliction that has befallen him. He knows that such a difficulty is a means of expiation for his sins and perhaps a cause for an increase in his good deeds. The Prophet (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#808000;">There’s no affliction that strikes a Muslim except that Allaah expiates with it (his sins), even with a thorn that may poke him</span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Recorded by Al-Bukhaaree (no. 5640) and Muslim (no. 2572)]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Taken from the book : </strong><strong> Tools for the Patient &amp; Provisions for the Thankful<br />
</strong>By Shaykh ul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad – may Allaah have mercy upon him – said: ‘Allaah <em>&#8211; Subhanahu   &#8211;</em> mentions <em>Sabr</em> (patience) in the Qur’aan in 90 places.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we will mention the different types of Ayaat where <em>Sabr</em>(patience) is mentioned, and <em>Sabr</em> is of many types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1)</strong>The command of having patience. As in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>And endure patiently, for your patience is not but from Allah</em>))[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>So wait  patiently for the command of your Lord</em>))[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2</strong>) The prohibition of what opposes patience. Like in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>A</em><em>nd be in no haste about them (Unbelievers).</em>))[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>So do not become weak, nor be sad</em>))[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying: ((<em>And be not like the Companion of the Fish</em>))[5]  and in brief, having patience with everything He has prohibited, since it opposes patience, which He has commanded us to have.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3)</strong> Attaching success to patience. As in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>O you who believe! Endure and be more patient, and guard your territory by stationing army units permanently at the places from where the enemy can attack you, and fear Allah so that you may be successful.</em>))[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He attached success to all of these matters together.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4)</strong> Notification that the reward is multiplied for the patient ones, more than the other people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Like His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>T</em><em>hese will be given their reward twice over, because of what  they were  patient with</em>))[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>Only those who are patient shall receive their rewards in full, without reckoning</em>))[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sulayman bin al-Qasim said: ‘The reward for every action is known, except the reward for patience.  Allaah Ta’ala said: ((<em>Only those who are patient shall receive their rewards in full without reckoning</em>)).[9]  Then Sulayman said: ‘like a heavy rain fall.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>5)</strong> Linking patience with leadership in the <em>Deen</em> and with having<em>Yaqeen</em> (certainty), Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>And We made from among them (children of Israel) leaders, giving guidance under Our command, when they were patient and used to believe in Our Ayaat</em>.))[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So with patience and certainty, leadership is achieved in the religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>6)</strong> Allaah makes them victorious, by Allaah <em>&#8211; Subhanahu-</em> being with them.  He Ta’ala said: ((<em>Surely, Allah is with those who are patient</em>)).[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu ‘Alee ad-Daqaaq said: ‘The <em>Sabiroon</em> (patient ones) are victorious and have honour in both worlds, since they have been told that Allaah is with them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>7)</strong> That Allaah Ta’ala has combined three matters for the <em>Sabiroon</em>which He did not gather for anyone other than them. They are that Allaah gives the Salaat upon them (i.e. those who are blessed &amp; will be forgiven) from Himself, and gives them mercy from Himself, and He gives them guidance from Himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>But give glad tidings to those who are patient. Who when afflicted with calamity say: “Truly! To Allaah we belong and to Him we shall return. “They are those on whom are the Salaawat (who are blessed and will be forgiven) from their Lord, and they are those who receive His Mercy, and it is they who are the guided ones.</em>))[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the Salaf said – the patient person is honoured according to the affliction that he has been given – ‘What is wrong with me that I am not patient, and indeed Allaah has promised me three characteristics for being patient, and every one of these characteristics is better than the world and everything in it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>8)</strong> Allaah <em>Subhanahu</em> made <em>Sabr</em> as an aid and a tool, and He commanded us to take assistance with <em>Sabr</em>, and He said: ((<em>And</em><em> seek help in patience and prayer</em>))[13] so whoever has no <em>Sabr,</em> has nothing to help him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>9)</strong> Allaah <em>Subhanahu</em> attached victory to patience and piety, Allaah Ta’ala said: ((<em>Yes, if you hold on to patience and piety, and the enemy comes rushing at you; your Lord will help you with five thousand angels having distinctive marks</em>))[14] this is why the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘and know that victory comes with patience.’[15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>10</strong>) Allaah <em>Subhanahu</em> made patience and piety a great form of protection from the deception of the enemy and his evil planning. So the slave does not request a form of protection greater than patience and piety.  Allaah Ta’ala said: ((<em>But if you remain patient and become pious, not the least harm will their cunning do to you</em>))[16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>11)</strong> Allaah <em>Subhanahu</em> said that His Angels send their salaams upon those who have patience, in Paradise.  Like He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>And the angels shall enter unto them from every gate saying: Salamun Alikum for what you were patient with!  Excellent indeed is the final home</em>.))[17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>12)</strong> That Allaah <em>Subhanahu</em> allows the patient people to punish the enemy for what they, the enemy, afflict upon them, and then Allaah swears, stressing an oath with utmost emphasis, that being patient is better for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>And if you punish your enemy, then punish them with the like of that with which you were afflicted.  But if you endure patiently, verily, it is better for those who are patient</em>.))[18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So ponder over this oath which uses [some of the words, which show great emphasis in the Arabic language, (Translators note)] in the answer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>13</strong>) That Allaah <em>Subhanahu</em> has prepared forgiveness and a great reward for patience and good actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He said : ((<em>Except  those who show patience and do  righteous good deeds, for them is forgiveness and a great reward</em> ))[19] and Allaah has exempted these patient ones, from those despised types of humans who are characterized with despair and disbelief when they are afflicted, and with delight and pride when they receive a blessing.  There is no escape from this despised character except with patience and good actions, just like forgiveness and a great reward cannot be acquired except with patience and good actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>14)</strong> That Allaah <em>Subhanahu</em> made <em>Sabr</em> for afflictions from the things He had determined, meaning that from those things that are determined are the most noble and the most honoured, and Allaah said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>And verily, whosoever shows patience and forgives, that would truly be from the things recommended by Allaah</em>))[20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Luqman said to his son: ((<em>Enjoin what is good and forbid what is wrong, and bear with patience whatever befalls you.  Verily, these are some of the important commandments ordered by Allaah with no exception</em>))[21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>15)</strong> Allaah promised the believers victory and success. This is His word, which He told them previously and it is a beautiful word, and He informs them that they can only achieve this victory and success with patience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>And the fair word of your Lord was fulfilled for the children of Israel, because of their endurance</em>))[22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>16)</strong> Allaah <em>Subhanahu</em> linked His love with patience and He made it for the patient.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>And many a Prophet fought (in Allaah’s way) and along with him (fought) large bands of religious learned men.  But they never lost heart for that which befell them in Allaah’s way, nor did they weaken or degrade themselves. And Allaah loves those who are patient.</em>))[23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>17</strong>) That Allaah <em>Subhanahu</em> informs us about a good characteristic and it is not attained except by the patient, and He mentions this in two places in His Book : in <em>Soorat al-Qassas</em> about the story of Qaroon, and those who were given knowledge said to those who wished they had what they had been given :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(( <em>Woe to  you! The reward of Allah (in the Hereafter) is better for those who believe and do  righteous good deeds, and this none shall attain except those who are patient</em>))[24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in <em>Soorat Ha-Mim Sajda</em>, where the slave is commanded to repel evil with that which is better than it, so if he does this, then he will become closer with the one with whom he had enmity as if he was a close and beloved friend, then Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>But none is granted such goodness except those who are patient, and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion (of the happiness in the Hereafter</em>).))[25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>18)</strong> Allaah <em>Subhanahu</em> informs us that indeed those who benefit from His <em>Ayaat</em>, and He admonishes them with these <em>Ayaat</em>, are the patient and thankful people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said: ((<em>And indeed We sent Moses with Our Ayaat “Bring out your people from the darkness into light, and remind them of the Days of Allah.” Truly, in this there are signs for every patient, thankful person.</em>))[26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah Ta’ala said about Luqman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>Do you not see the ships sail through the sea by the grace of Allah? That He may show you His signs? Verily in this are signs for every patient, grateful person</em>.))[27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He Ta’ala said regarding the story of Saba:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>So We made them as tales (in the land), and We dispersed them all, totally. Verily, in this are signs for every steadfast, grateful person.</em>))[28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>And among His signs are the ships, in the sea, like mountains. If He Wills, He can cause the wind to cease, and then they would become motionless on the back (of the sea).  Verily in this are signs for everyone who is patient and grateful</em>.))[29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are four places in the Qur’aan which indicate that those who benefit from the <em>Ayaat</em> of the Lord are the patient and thankful people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>19)</strong> That Allaah Ta’ala commended His slave Ayyoob with the best of praise due to his patience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>Truly We found him patient. How excellent a slave! Verily, he was ever oft-turning in repentance (to Us)</em>!)).[30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He called Ayyoob an excellent slave, by knowing that he was a patient person, and this indicates that the person who does not have patience when he is afflicted by trials is indeed a wretched slave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>20)</strong> Allaah <em>Subhanahu</em> gave a verdict of loss, as a general verdict about everyone who does not believe, and they are not from the people of <em>Haqq</em> (truth) and patience.  This shows that no one benefits except the people upon the truth and with patience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said: ((<em>By ‘Al-Asr’ (the Time).  Verily! Man is in loss. Except those who believe and do righteous good deeds, and recommend one another to the truth and recommend one another with patience</em>.))[31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why Shafiee said: ‘If all the people ponder over this <em>Ayaah</em> it would suffice them.’ This is why the perfection of a slave is in the perfection of his sustenance: the sustenance of knowledge and the sustenance of good actions, and they are <em>Imaan</em> and righteous actions.  And just as the slave needs to perfect himself, he also needs to perfect others than himself, and that is done with advising with the truth and advising with patience, and the basis for this and its foundation and the trunk upon which it stands is indeed <em>Sabr</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>21)</strong> Allaah singled out the people of the right hand in that they are the people of patience and compassion. They are characterized as such due to their having these two characteristics, and that they advise others with these characteristics.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>Then he became one of those who believed, and recommended one another to perseverance and patience, and also recommended one another to mercy and compassion.  They are those on the Right Hand (the dwellers of Paradise)</em>.))[32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is restricted to the people of the right hand who have these two characteristics.  People in comparison to these two characteristics are of four types: those who have these two characteristics are the best of these four types; the evilest type is the one who does not have any patience nor does he have any mercy; the type that follows next is he who has patience but no mercy; then after them is the fourth type who has mercy and compassion, but has no patience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>22)</strong> Allaah <em>Subhanahu</em> linked <em>Sabr </em>with the ‘<em>Arkaan</em> (pillars) of Islaam and with all the aspects of <em>Imaan</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He linked patience with <em>Salah</em> (prayer), like in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>And</em><em> seek help in patience and prayer</em>))[33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He linked patience with general good deeds, like His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>Except those who show patience and do righteous good deeds, for them is forgiveness and a great reward</em>))[34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He linked it to piety. Like His saying: ((<em>Verily</em><em>, he who fears Allaah with obedience to Him and is patient.</em>  ))[35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He linked it to being thankful. Like His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((<em>Truly, in this there are signs for every patient, thankful person</em>.))[36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He attached patience to the truth.  Like His saying: ((<em>And recommend one another to the truth and recommend one another with patience</em>))[37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He linked it with mercy. Like His saying: ((<em>And recommended one another to perseverance and patience, and also recommended one another to mercy and compassion</em>))[38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He linked it with <em>Yaqeen</em> (certainty). Like His saying: ((<em>When they were patient and used to believe in Our Ayaat</em>))[39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He linked patience to truthfulness.  Like in His saying: ((<em>The men and women who are truthful, the men and women who are patient</em>.))[40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He made patience as a reason for His love, and His closeness and His victory, and His help and His good reward. Just some of these characteristics are sufficient as a honour and a favour, and Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from the book: <strong>Tools for the Patient &amp; Provisions for the Thankful<br />
</strong>By Shaykh ul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Imaan</em> is of two halves; half is patience (<em>Sabr</em>) and half is being thankful (<em>Shukr</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">More than one from amongst the <em>Salaf</em> said: ‘Patience is half of<em>Imaan</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullaah bin Masood <em>&#8211; radi Allaahu anhu –</em> said: ‘<em>Imaan</em> is of two halves: half is patience and half is gratitude.’<br />
This is why Allaah <em>– Subhanahu –</em> combines patience and being thankful in His saying: &lt;&lt;<em>Truly, in this there are signs for every patient, thankful person.</em>&gt;&gt;[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Allaah has mentioned in the verses of soorat Ha Mim ‘Ain Seen Qaaf 33, and soorat Saba 19, and in soorat Luqman 31.  Indeed there are considerations which have been mentioned for these classifications of patience and gratitude:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First Consideration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That <em>Imaan</em> is a definition for all sayings, actions and intentions. And this is divided into two divisions: performing righteous actions and leaving prohibitions; so doing an action is obedience to Allaah and that is the reality of <em>Shukr</em>. Leaving a prohibition is being patient in keeping away from sins, and all of the <em>Deen</em> is about these two aspects: doing that what you have been commanded to do, and leaving what you have been commanded to leave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second Consideration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That <em>Imaan</em> is built upon two pillars: <em>Yaqeen</em> (certainty), and <em>Sabr</em>(patience). They are two pillars that are mentioned in His <em>Ta’ala</em>’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<em>And We made from among them (Children of Israel), leaders, giving guidance under Our Command, when they were patient and used to believe with certainty in Our Ayaat</em>&gt;&gt;[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So with <em>Yaqeen</em>, the reality of commands and prohibitions is known, and the reality of reward and punishment is also known.  With patience commands are carried out, and patience also stops a person from doing that which he has been prohibited from.  He will not achieve true faith in fulfilling commands and keeping away from prohibitions, knowing these commands and prohibitions are from Allaah, nor will he achieve true faith of reward and punishment, except with <em>Yaqeen</em> (certainty).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not possible for the slave to remain steadfast upon carrying out commands, and stopping oneself from prohibitions except with patience, therefore patience becomes half of <em>Imaan</em>, and the second half of <em>Imaan</em> is being thankful, by carrying out what he has been commanded with, and leaving that which he has been prohibited from.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Third Consideration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Imaa</em>n is sayings and actions.  Sayings of the heart, and sayings of the tongue.  Actions of the heart, and actions of the limbs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The explanation of this is: whoever knows Allaah with his heart, and does not affirm it with his tongue then he cannot be a believer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Allaah said concerning the people of Pharaoh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <em>And they belied the Ayaat, wrongfully and arrogantly, though they themselves were convinced thereof [i.e. those (Ayaat) are from Allaah]</em> &gt;&gt;[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And like wise, Allaah said concerning the people of ‘Aad and the people of Salih :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<em>And ‘Ad and Thamûd (people)! And indeed (their destruction) is clearly apparent to you from their (ruined) dwellings. Shaytan made their deeds fair seeming to them, and turned them away from the Right Path, though they were intelligent.</em> &gt;&gt;<em><strong>[4]</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Musa said to Pharaoh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(( <em>Musa  said: “Verily, you know that these signs have been sent down by none but the Lord of the heavens and the earth as clear evidences</em> ))<em><strong>[5]</strong></em><em>.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these people achieved the sayings of the heart: which are <em>al-Ma’rifah</em> (knowing) and <em>‘ilm</em> (knowledge), but despite this they were not regarded as believers.  Also, the person who says with his tongue that which is not in his heart is not regarded as a believer, but rather he is regarded as being from the hypocrites.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, the one who knows with his heart and affirms it with his tongue is not regarded as a believer with just that, until he performs actions of the heart from love and hate, friendship and hostility; so he loves for Allaah and His Messenger, and he has loyalty to the<em>‘Aawliyah </em>(friends) of Allaah and he shows enmity to the enemies of Allaah, and he submits his heart to Allaah Alone.  Submitting oneself to following His Messenger and obedience to Him (Allaah), and adhering to His <em>Sharia’</em> externally and internally, and if he does this, it is not sufficient for him to have complete <em>Imaan</em> until he does that what he has been commanded with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these four <em>‘Arkaan </em>(pillars) are the <em>‘Arkaan</em> of <em>Imaan </em>upon which<em>Imaan</em> is built, and it is: going back to knowledge and action, and abstaining from that which is prohibited, which is also regarded as action. Both knowledge and action cannot be achieved except with patience, so <em>Imaan</em> becomes two halves: one of which is patience, and the other which is the result of this patience, is knowledge and action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Fourth Consideration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The soul has two forces: a driving force, and a restraining force, and the soul is always going back and forth between the rules of these two forces; driven towards that which it loves, and abstaining from that which it dislikes.  The whole of the <em>Deen</em> is based upon, motivating oneself and abstaining.  Motivation towards obedience, and abstention from sinning against Allaah. It is not possible to achieve any of these except by patience</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Fifth Consideration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The whole of the <em>Deen</em> is hope and fear, so the believer is one who has hope and fear.  Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> said: &lt;&lt;<em>Verily, they used to hasten on to do good deeds, and they used to call on us in hope and in fear</em>&gt;&gt;[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in  the supplication at the time of going to sleep, which Bukhari narrated in his ‘<em>Saheeh</em>’: ‘O Allaah, indeed I have submitted my self to You, and directed my face towards You, and entrusted my matters to You.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So you will never find a believer except that he is one who has hope and fear.  Hope and fear are not established except on the stalk of patience, so fear encourages him to be patience and hope steers him towards being thankful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Sixth Consideration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That everything that a slave is exposed to in this world, does not exclude that which will benefit him in this world and in the Hereafter, or that which will harm him in this world and in the Hereafter, or that which will benefit him in one of these two places, and harm him in the other.  The noblest types of action that a person does are those that benefit him in the Hereafter, and he leaves the other world and leaves that which will harm him in it, and this is the reality of <em>Imaan</em>.  Hence the action that benefits him is<em>Shukr</em> (thankfulness), and leaving that which harms him is patience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Seventh Consideration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That a slave cannot separate himself from an action that he does, nor a prohibition that he leaves, and destiny overtakes him.  He has an obligation of three things, patience and thankfulness.  So fulfilling that which you have been commanded to do is <em>Shukr</em> (thankfulness) and leaving prohibitions and being patient with your destiny, is patience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Eighth Consideration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the slave consists of two aspects which call him: an invitation that calls him to the <em>Duniya</em> and its worldly desires and delights.  And an invitation that calls him to Allaah and the Hereafter, and that which has been prepared in it for the <em>‘Aawliyah</em>of Allaah from amongst its everlasting blessings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the rebel of worldly passions and desires is <em>Sabr</em>, and that which responds to Allaah and the Hereafter is <em>Shukr</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Ninth Consideration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Deen</em> revolves around two fundamental principles: determination and perseverance. These are two principles which are mentioned in the hadeeth which has been narrated by Ahmad and an-Nisaee on the authority of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> ‘O Allaah verily I ask of You perseverance in my affairs, and determination in conduct.[7]<br />
The foundation of <em>Shukr</em> is the correctness of resolve, and the foundation of <em>Sabr</em> is the force of perseverance, so when a slave is supported with determination and perseverance, then he has indeed been supported with assistance and capability.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Tenth Consideration:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the <em>Deen</em> is built upon two foundations: Truth and patience, and both are mentioned in the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<em>And they advise one another to the truth, and recommend one another with patience</em><em>.</em>&gt;&gt;[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what it is required of the slave is to do actions truthfully with in himself, and implementing them amongst the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is the reality of <em>Shukr</em>, which is not possible for the slave unless he is patient upon it, and in doing that <em>Sabr</em> becomes half of<em>Imaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah &#8211;<em>Subhanahu Ta’ala-</em> knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

Chapter 3<br />
Patience and Perseverance</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;O you who believe! Endure and be more patient..&#8221;</b></span><b>. (3:200)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And certainly, We shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits, but give glad tidings to As-Sabirun (the patient)&#8221;</b></span><b>.  (2:155)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Only those who are patient shall receive their reward in full, without reckoning.&#8221;</b></span><b> (39:10)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And verily, whosoever shows patience and forgives, that would truly be from the things recommended by Allah.&#8221;</b></span><b> (42:43)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Seek help in patience and As-Salat (the prayer). Truly, Allah is with As-Sabirun (the patient).&#8221;</b></span><b> (2:153)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And surely, We shall try you till We test those who strive hard (for the Cause of Allah) and As-Sabirun (the patient)&#8221;</b></span><b> (47:31)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are numerous Verses of the Noble Qur&#8217;an inculcating patience and extolling it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>25.</b> Abu Malik Al-Harith bin Asim Al-Ash`ar (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Wudu&#8217; is half of Salah; the utterance of  (Al-hamdu lillah &#8211; all praise belongs to Allah) fills the Scales of good actions; the utterance of (Subhan Allah wa Al-hamdu lillah) (Allah is far removed from every imperfection and all praise belongs to Allah) fills the space between the heavens and the earth, and Salat (prayer) is light; and charity is the proof of Faith; and endurance is light, and the Qur&#8217;an is a plea in your favour or against you. Every person departs; he either ransoms it or puts it into perdition&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>26.</b> Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that: Certain people of the Ansar asked the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and he gave them; then they again asked him and he gave them until all what he possessed was exhausted. Then the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Whatever wealth I have, I will not withhold from you. Whosoever would be chaste and modest; Allah will keep him chaste and modest and whosoever would seek self-sufficiency, Allah will make him self-sufficient; and whosoever would be patient, Allah will give him patience, and no one is granted a gift better and more comprehensive than patience&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>27.</b> Abu Yahya Suhaib bin Sinan (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;How wonderful is the case of a believer; there is good for him in everything and this applies only to a believer. If prosperity attends him, he expresses gratitude to Allah and that is good for him; and if adversity befalls him, he endures it patiently and that is better for him&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>28.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: When the last illness of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) made him unconscious, Fatimah (May Allah be pleased with her) exclaimed: &#8220;Ah, the distress of my dear father.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;There will be no distress for your father after today&#8221;</span>. When he died she said: &#8220;My father, Allah has called you back and you have responded to His Call. O father! Garden of Firdaus is your abode. O father! We announce to Jibril your death.&#8221; When he was buried, she said: &#8220;Are you satisfied now that you put earth over (the grave of) Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)?&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>29.</b> Usamah bin Zaid (May Allah be pleased with them) narrated: The daughter of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) sent for him as her child was dying, but the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) returned the messenger and sent her good wishes saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Whatever Allah takes away or gives, belongs to Him, and everything with Him has a limited fixed term (in this world), and so she should be patient and anticipate Allah&#8217;s reward.&#8221;</span> She again sent for him adjuring him for the sake of Allah to come. The Messenger of Allah, accompanied with Sa`d bin `Ubadah, Mu`adh bin Jabal, Ubayy bin Ka`b, Zaid bin Thabit and some other men went to see her. The child was lifted up to the Messenger of Allah while his breath was disturbed in his chest. On seeing that, the eyes of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) streamed with tears. Sa`d said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! What is this?&#8221; He replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;It is compassion which Allah has placed in the hearts of His slaves, Allah is Compassionate only to those among His slaves who are compassionate</span> (to others)&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">  Another version says: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah shows compassion only to those among His slaves who are compassionate&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>30.</b> Suhaib (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;There lived a king before you and he had a court magician. As he (the magician) grew old, he said to the king: `I have grown old, so send me a young boy in order to teach him magic.&#8217; The king sent him a young boy to serve the purpose. And on his way (to the magician) the young boy met a monk to whom he listened to and liked it. It became his habit that on his way to the magician, he would meet the monk and sit there and would come to the magician (late). The magician used to beat him because of this delay. He complained about this to the monk who said to him: &#8216;When you feel afraid of the magician, say: Members of my family detained me. And when you fear your family, say: The magician detained me.&#8217; It so happened that there came a huge beast and it blocked the way of the people, and the young boy said: &#8216;I will know today whether the magician or the monk is better.&#8217; He picked up a stone and said: `O Allah, if the way of the monk is dearer to You than the way of the magician, bring about death to the animal so that the people be able to move about freely.&#8217; He threw that stone at it and killed it and the people began to move about freely. He then came to the monk and told him the story. The monk said: `Son, today you are superior to me. You have come to a stage where I feel that you would be soon put to a trial, and in case you are put to a trial, do not reveal me.&#8217; That young boy began to heal those born blind and the lepers and he, in fact, began to cure people from all kinds of illnesses. When a courtier of the king who had gone blind heard about him, he came to him with numerous gifts and said, `If you cure me, all these things will be yours.&#8217; He said, `I myself do not cure anyone. It is Allah, the Exalted, Alone Who cures; and if you affirm faith in Allah, I shall also supplicate to Allah to cure you.&#8217; This courtier affirmed his faith in Allah and Allah cured him. He came to the king and sat by his side as he used to sit before. The king said to him, `Who restored your eyesight?&#8217; He said, `My Rubb.&#8217; Thereupon he said, &#8216;Do you have another lord besides me?&#8217; He said, `My Rubb and your Rubb is Allah.&#8217; So the king kept torturing him untill he revealed the young boy. The young boy was thus summoned and the king said to him, &#8216;O boy, it has been conveyed to me that you have become so much proficient in your magic that you cure the blind and the lepers and you do such and such.&#8217; Thereupon he said, `I do not cure anyone; it is Allah Alone Who cures,&#8217; and the king took hold of him and began to torture him until he revealed of the monk. The monk was summoned and it was said to him: `You should turn back from your religion.&#8217; But he refused. The king sent for a saw, placed it in the middle of his head and cut him into two parts that fell down. Then the courtier of the king was brought forward and it was said to him: `Turn back from your religion.&#8217; He, too, refused, and the saw was placed in the midst of his head and he was torn into two parts. Then the boy was sent for and it was said to him: `Turn back from your religion.&#8217; He refused. The king then handed him over to a group of his courtiers, and said to them: `Take him to such and such mountain; make him climb up that mountain and when you reach its peak ask him to renounce his Faith. If he refuses to do so, push him to his death.&#8217; So they took him and made him climb up the mountain and he said: `O Allah, save me from them in any way you like,&#8217; and the mountain began to shake and they all fell down (dead) and that young boy came walking to the king. The king said to him, `What happened to your companions?&#8217; He said, `Allah has saved me from them.&#8217; He again handed him to some of his courtiers and said: `Take him and carry him in a boat and when you reach the middle of the sea, ask him to renounce his religion. If he does not renounce his religion throw him (into the water).&#8217; So they took him and he said: `O Allah, save me from them.&#8217; The boat turned upside down and they all drowned except the young boy who came walking to the king. The king said to him, `What happened to your companions?&#8217; He said, `Allah has saved me from them,&#8217; and he said to the king: `You cannot kill me until you do what I command you to do.&#8217; The king asked, `What is that?&#8217; He said, `Gather all people in one place and tie me up to the trunk of a tree, then take an arrow from my quiver and say: With the Name of Allah, the Rubb of the boy; then shoot me. If you do that you will be able to kill me.&#8217; `The king called the people in an open field and tied the young boy to the trunk of a tree. He took out an arrow from his quiver, fixed in the bow and said, `With the Name of Allah, the Rubb of the young boy,&#8217; he then shot the arrow and it hit the boy&#8217;s temple. The young boy placed his hand upon the temple where the arrow had hit him and died. The people then said: `We believe in the Rubb of this young boy.&#8217; The king was told: `Do you see what you were afraid of, by Allah it has taken place; all people have believed.&#8217; The king then commanded that trenches be dug and fire lit in them, and said: `He who would not turn back from his (the young boy&#8217;s) religion,  throw him in the fire&#8217; or `he would be ordered to jump into it.&#8217; They did so till a woman came with her child. She felt hesitant in jumping into the fire. The child said to her: `O mother! Endure (this ordeal) for you are on the Right Path&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>31.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) passed by a woman who was crying over a grave and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Fear Allah and be patient.&#8221;</span> She said, &#8220;Away from me! My calamity has not befallen you and you are not aware of it.&#8221; The woman was later told that it was the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) (who had advised her). She came to his door where she found no doorkeeper. She said, &#8220;(I am sorry) I did not know you.&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Patience is (becoming) only at the first (stroke) of grief&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration in Muslim says: The woman was crying over her son.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>32.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah, the Exalted, says: &#8216;I have no reward other than Jannah for a believing slave of Mine who remains patient for My sake when I take away his beloved one from among the inhabitants of the world&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>33.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: I asked the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) about pestilence and he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;It is a punishment which Allah sends upon whomsoever He wills, but Allah has made it as a mercy to the believers. Anyone who remains in a town which is plagued with pestilence maintaining patience expecting the reward from Allah, and knowing that nothing will befall him other than what Allah has foreordained for him, he would receive a reward of Shaheed&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>34.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah, the Glorious and Exalted said: `When I afflict my slave in his two dear things (i.e., his eyes), and he endures patiently, I shall compensate him for them with Jannah.&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>35.</b> `Ata&#8217; bin Abu Rabah reported: Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) asked him whether he would like that he should show him a woman who is from the people Jannah. When he replied that he certainly would, he said, &#8220;This black woman, who came to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and said, `I suffer from epilepsy and during fits my body is exposed, so make supplication to Allah for me.&#8217; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8216;If you wish you endure it patiently and you be rewarded with Jannah, or if you wish, I shall make supplication to Allah to cure you?</span>&#8216; She said, &#8216;I shall endure it.&#8217; Then she added: `But my body is exposed, so pray to Allah that it may not happen.&#8217; He (Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) then supplicated for her&#8221;.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>36.</b> `Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I can still recall as if I am seeing the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) resembling one of the Prophets whose people scourged him and shed his blood, while he wiped blood from his face, he said: &#8220;O Allah! Forgive my people, because they certainly do not know&#8221;.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>37.</b> Abu Sa`id and Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Never a believer is stricken with a discomfort, an illness, an anxiety, a grief or mental worry or even the pricking of a thorn but Allah will expiate his sins on account of his patience&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>38.</b> Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I visited the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) when he was suffering fever. I said, &#8220;You seem to be suffering greatly, O Messenger of Allah.&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Yes, I suffer as much as two persons.&#8221;</span> I said, &#8220;Is that because you have a double reward?&#8221; He replied<span style="color:#0000ff;"> that that was so and then said, &#8220;No Muslim is afflicted by a harm, be it the pricking of a thorn or something more (painful than that), but Allah thereby causes his sins to fall away just as a tree sheds its leaves&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>39.</b>  Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He whom Allah intends good, He makes him to suffer from some affliction&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>40.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Let not one of you wish for death because of a misfortune which befalls him. If  he cannot help doing so, he should say: &#8216;O Allah, keep me alive as long as You know that life is better for me, and make me die when death is better for me&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>41.</b> Khabbab bin Al-Aratt (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: We complained to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) regarding the persecution inflicted upon us by the disbelievers while he was lying in the shade of the Ka`bah, having made a pillow of his cloak. We submitted: &#8220;Why do you not supplicate for our prevalence (over the opponents)?&#8221;. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Among those people before you, a man would be seized and held in a pit dug for him in the ground and he would be sawed into two halves from his head, and his flesh torn away from his bones with an iron comb; but, in spite of this, he would not wean away from his Faith. By Allah, Allah will bring this matter to its consummation until a rider will travel from San`a&#8217; to Hadramout fearing none except Allah, and except the wolf for his sheep, but you are in too much of a hurry&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is: He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) had placed his cloak under his head and we had been tortured by the polytheists.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>42.</b> Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: After the battle of Hunain, Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) favoured some people in the distribution of spoils<span style="color:#800000;"> (for consolation)</span>. He gave Al-Aqra` bin Habis and `Uyainah bin Hisn a hundred camels each and showed favour also to some more honourable persons among the Arabs. Someone said: &#8220;This division is not based on justice and it was not intended to win the Pleasure of Allah.&#8221; I said to myself: &#8220;By Allah! I will inform Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) of this.&#8221; I went to him and informed him. His face became red and he said, &#8220;Who will do justice if Allah and His Messenger do not?&#8221; Then he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;May Allah have mercy on (Prophet) Musa (Moses); he was caused more distress than this but he remained patient.</span>&#8221; Having heard this I said to myself: &#8220;I shall never convey anything of this kind to him in future&#8221;.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>43.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;When Allah intends good for His slave, He punishes him in this world, but when He intends an evil for His slave, He does not hasten to take him to task but calls him to account on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>44.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: One of the sons of Abu Talhah (May Allah be pleased with him) was ailing. Abu Talhah went out and the boy died in his absence. When he came back, he inquired, &#8220;How is the boy?&#8221;. Umm Sulaim, the mother of the boy, replied, &#8220;Better than before&#8221;. Then she placed his evening meal before him and he ate it; and thereafter slept with her. At last, she said to him: &#8220;Arrange for the burial of the boy&#8221;. In the morning, Abu Talhah went to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and informed him of the event. He enquired,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Did you sleep together last night?&#8221;</span> Abu Talhah replied in the affirmative, on which the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) supplicated,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O Allah bless them.</span>&#8221; Thereafter, she gave birth to a boy. Abu Talhah said to me: &#8220;Take up the boy and carry him to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)&#8221;;  and he sent some dates with him. The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) enquired,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Is there anything with him?&#8221;</span> He said; &#8220;Yes, some dates&#8221;. The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) took a date, chewed it and put it in the mouth of the baby and rubbed the chewed date around the baby&#8217;s gum and named him `Abdullah.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narration in Bukhari adds: Ibn `Uyainah relates that a man from the Ansar told him that he had seen nine sons of this `Abdullah, every one of whom had committed the Noble Qur&#8217;an to memory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narration of Muslim says: The son of Abu Talhah (May Allah be pleased with him) who was born of Umm Sulaim died. She (Umm Sulaim) said to the members of the family: &#8220;Do not tell Abu Talhah about his son until I mention it to him myself.&#8221; Abu Talhah came (home) and she gave him supper. He ate and drank. She then beautified herself the best way she ever did and he slept with her. When she saw that he was satisfied after sexual intercourse with her, she said, &#8220;O Abu Talhah! If some people borrow something from another family and then (the members of the family) ask for its return, would they refuse to give it back to them.&#8221; He said, &#8220;No&#8221;. She said, &#8220;Then hope reward for your son&#8221;. Abu Talhah got angry, and said; &#8220;You left me uninformed until I stained myself (with sexual intercourse) and then you told me about my son. &#8220;He went to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and informed him about the matter. Thereupon Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;May Allah bless the night you spent together!&#8221;</span> He (the narrator) said: She conceived. (One day) Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was in the course of a journey and she was along with him. When Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to come back to Al-Madinah from a journey, he would not enter it (during the night). When the people came near Al-Madinah, she felt labour pains. He (Abu Talhah) remained with her and Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) proceeded on. Abu Talhah said: &#8220;O Rubb, You know that I love to go along with Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) when he goes out and enter along with him when he enters, and I have been detained as You see.&#8221; Umm Sulaim then said: &#8220;O Abu Talhah, I do not feel (so much pain) as I was feeling earlier, so we better proceed on. So we proceeded on and she felt the labour of delivery as they reached (Al-Madinah). She gave birth to a male child. My mother said to me: &#8220;O Anas, none should suckle him until you go to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) tomorrow  morning.&#8221; The next morning I carried the baby with me to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), and narrated the rest of the story.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>45.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The strong man is not one who is good at wrestling, but the strong man is one who controls himself in a fit of rage.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>46.</b> Sulaiman bin Surad (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I was sitting with the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) when two men began to quarrel and curse each other and the face of one of them turned red and the veins of his neck were swollen (from rage). Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;I know of a word, if he were to utter that, his rage would vanish and that is: A`udhu billahi minash-Shaitan nir-rajim (I seek refuge with Allah from Satan, the accursed).&#8221;</span> So they (Companions) said to him: &#8220;The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) tells you to utter: &#8216;I seek refuge with Allah from Satan, the accursed&#8221;.<br />
[Al-Bukhariand Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>47.</b> Mu`adh bin Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The one who suppresses anger and has the power to give effect to it, will be called out by Allah, the Exalted, to the forefront of the creatures on the Day of  Resurrection and he will be asked to choose any of the virgins (Hur) of his liking&#8221;.</span><br />
[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>48.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A man asked the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) for an advice and he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Do not get angry&#8221;</span>. The man repeated that several times and he replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Do not get angry&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>49.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;A Muslim, male or female, continues to remain under trial in respect of his life, property and offspring until he faces Allah, the Exalted, with no sin record&#8221;.</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>50.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: &#8216;Uyainah bin Hisn came to Al-Madinah and stayed with his nephew Hurr bin Qais who was among those whom Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) showed favour to. The knowledgeable people (Qurra&#8217;), whether they were old or young, had the privilege of joining Umar&#8217;s council and he used to consult them. &#8216;Uyainah said to Hurr: &#8220;My nephew, the Leader of the Believers shows favour to you. Will you obtain permission for me to sit with him?&#8221; Hurr asked `Umar and he accorded permission. When `Uyainah came into the presence of `Umar, he addressed him thus: &#8220;O son of Khattab, you neither bestow much on us nor deal with us justly.&#8221; `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) got angry and was about to beat him up when Hurr said: &#8220;O Leader of the Believers, Allah said to His Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam):<span style="color:#ff0000;"> &#8216; Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the foolish (i.e., don&#8217;t punish them)</span>.&#8217; (7:199) This one is from the ignorants. When Hurr recited this, `Umar became quite motionless in his seat. He always adhered strictly to the Book of Allah.<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>51.</b> Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;You will see after me favouritism and things which you will disapprove of.&#8221;</span> They submitted: &#8220;What do you order us to do (under such circumstances)?&#8221; He replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Discharge your obligations and ask your rights from Allah&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>52.</b> Usaid bin Hudhair (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that: A person from among the Ansar said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! You appointed such and such person and why do you not appoint me?&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;After me you will see others given preference to you, but you should remain patient till you meet me at the Haud</span> (Al-Kauthar in Jannah)&#8221;.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">53. `Abdullah bin Abu Aufa (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) at one time when he confronted the enemy, and was waiting for the sun to set, stood up and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O people! Do not long for encountering  the enemy and supplicate to Allah to grant you security. But when you face the enemy, show patience and steadfastness; and keep it in mind that Jannah lies under the shade of the swords.&#8221;</span> Then he invoked Allah, saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O Allah, Revealer of the Book, Disperser of the clouds, Defeater of the Confederates, put our enemy to rout and help us in over-powering them&#8221;.</span><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Uwais Abdullaah Ali<span style="line-height:1.5em;"> [Rahimahullah] &#8211; Transcribed Lecture</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Khutubatul-Haajah …..</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The greater the hardship, or trial or tribulation the greater the reward. The greater the difficulty the greater the reward. The greater the trial or tribulation or difficulty that you are put through the greater the reward will be for you and for me from Allah (Tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala).<br />
If Allah loves a people, He puts them to trial, He tests them and places them in difficulty. Allah the Exalted states in Surah Baqarah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>&#8220;We will test you with something of fear, and hunger and loss of wealth, and souls and vegetation. And give glad tidings to those who have patience. Those who if in any difficulty or trial, or tribulation occurs to them or happens to them, they say: &#8216;Verily We are from Allah and to Allah we return.&#8217; They are those who will receive prayers from their Lord and Mercy and it is those who are guided.&#8221;<br />
</em></strong><br />
The great reward is in accordance to how great o­nes trial, difficulty or test is. The greater the test and trial, the greater the reward. And everyone must have tests and everyone will have problems &amp; trials and everyone will be put to difficulty, everyone will have moments of grief, moments of sadness moments when things are not as they feel or would like them to be. But the difference is the believer is patient, the believer believes in the decree of Allaah, the believer seeks the reward of Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) at that time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The believer praises Allah. The believer will be rewarded in his time of difficulty. The believer has burns and the Kaafir has burns. The believer needs an operation and a Kaafir needs an operation. The believer loses a mother and a Kaafir loses a mother. The believer loses his wife and the Kaafir will lose his wife. Everyone experiences difficulty. Everyone experiences trials and tribulations but the believer because of what Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) has given him of Imaan and for what he has of patience and being pleased with the decree of Allaah, and seeking a reward from Allaah and seeing the wisdom of Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) in his difficulty, he will be raised and he will receive great rewards.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Dawud mentions in the Sunnan, related by Ahmad :<br />
It is in the Saheehah (when you hear as-Saheehah it means it is authenticated by Shaikh Naasir ud-Din al-Albaani in his authentic books of narrations – Hadith No. 959) :The Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;This my Ummah, is a Ummah that has mercy upon it, &#8216;Marhooma&#8217;- a Ummah that has mercy that&#8217;s been wrapped in Mercies; there is no punishment for this Ummah in the Hereafter except their punishment that they experience in the Dunya &#8212; killing and death and dying, trials and tribulations, earthquakes and the like.&#8221;</em> And the wording of Abu Dawud is : <em>&#8216;This Ummah reminds of the Ummah, that Allaah has placed His mercy upon. This Ummah will not have any punishment in the Hereafter, this punishment is in this world with fitn, trials, tribulations and punishments and difficulties, and earthquakes and killings, murder, death.. like this.<br />
</em><br />
&#8216;As recorded in Buhari and Muslim: The Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;Whoever Allah wants good for him, he puts them to test. He puts them through difficulties. Like a diamond or some metal that has to be burnt and then that which is bad from it is removed so that you have that which is the pure diamond or the pure gold or whatever. Put them to tests, trials and difficulties.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As narrated by Tirmidhi and Ibn Maajah : (This is the Hadith that we started with) &#8211; The Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8216;The greater reward is with the greater trial or the greater the trial or difficulty of test or hardship is then the greater the reward. And when Allah loves a person He will tests them. So he who will be pleased and then He will be pleased. He who is displeased, then He will be displeased.'(Sahaba&#8217;s name not clear) &#8216;The people as long as they are in good health, good shape, good condition they are covered. You don&#8217;t know their true character because they are in good situation, they are in good circumstance. As long as they are in a good circumstances they are covered. But if a trial or difficulty or a hardship comes upon them, then you will see their reality. They will go to their reality. The Mu&#8217;min will run to his Imaan, the Mu&#8217;min will run to his belief, the believer will run to his belief, his Imaan and the hypocrite will run to his hypocrisy, and the hypocrite will run to his hypocrisy. &#8220;Without being shaken, you don&#8217;t not know what comes to the top and what goes to the bottom. Without being shaken you don&#8217;t know a man from those who are faking; you won&#8217;t know women from those who are faking. You won&#8217;t know those who truly believe from those who don&#8217;t. Those who make a claim o­n their tongue and is not really in their hearts and from their limbs from those who are willing to die for this matter. This can o­nly be shown by trials, the tribulations and tests and difficulties.&#8221;<br />
</em><br />
Imam Ahmed brought it and Sheikh Nassir brings in his Saheehah No. 147 : Suhaib said that, &#8216;we were sitting with the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and suddenly he laughed. Suddenly the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) laughed. He asked his companions: <em>&#8216;Won&#8217;t you ask me what I am laughing about?.&#8217;</em> So they asked the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) &#8216;what are you laughing about ?&#8217; So he said : <em>&#8216;I laughed because I was astonished at the affair of a believer.&#8217;</em> (Listen these are words of Musthafa alaihi salam. He doesn&#8217;t speak of his own desires whatever he speaks it is revelation; Listen, these are words of Rasulullah describing a believer.). <em>All of his affairs, all of his circumstances are good, all of it. If something happens to him that he loves, if Allah blesses him with something that he loves, then he praises Allaah and this is good. And if something happens to him, if he is put into some difficulty, test or tribulation or hardship or something that he hates, he is patient and that is good for him. And no o­ne&#8217;s situation is totally good except the believer. And no o­ne else&#8217;s affair, no o­ne else&#8217;s circumstance, no o­ne else&#8217;s condition, no o­ne else&#8217;s situation is totally good except the mu&#8217;min, except the believer.&#8217;<br />
</em><br />
&#8216;The o­nes who received the most difficulty, and went through the most hardship were the beloved people to Allaah &#8212; the prophets. Allah loved them more than the rest of mankind or creatures. He tested them. He put them through test , he put them through hardship, he put them through difficulties. Listen to this narration of Ibn Majah and Sheikh Nassir also brings in his Saheehah No. 144 : (Sahaba&#8217;s name not clear) &#8220;I entered upon the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) before he passed away whilst he was suffering having a fever &#8212; I placed my hand upon him and I felt the heat from above the blanket, I felt the heat of his fever from above the blanket. I said : &#8216;O Messenger of Allaah, how hard it is upon you.&#8217; The Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam ) said : <em>&#8216;Yes, it is like that. Trials and tribulations, hardships and difficulties are doubled and multiplied and increased for us prophets. But also the reward, the blessing, the level that he is raised with Allaah upon is also multiplied and increased for him.&#8217;</em> I said : &#8216;O Messenger of Allaah who are most put through difficulty? Who are the people who are most tested? Who goes through the most trials and tribulation O&#8217; Messenger of Allaah?&#8217; He said : <em>&#8216;The prophets, then the righteous (saalihun)&#8217; ,<br />
</em><br />
some of them are tested with clothing, some of them are tested with no clothing except an abaya that they place around their bodies, nothing else. But o­ne of them used to be so happy when he was put to trial or test like you see enjoyment and pleasure and contentment through ease. They were happy with trials and tribulations like you are happy with ease.&#8221;Allaah the Exalted states in Surah Al-Zumar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>&#8220;Verily the patient will get their reward without it being estimated, without it being calculated. It can&#8217;t be counted. O­ne is waiting for reward, for that o­ne who is patient.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Sabr, patience Akhee Msulim, my brother Muslim, upon when you are put to trial, upon when you are put to test, upon when you go through sadness, upon when you go through hardship, upon when you go through difficulties, patience – As Sabr, then it is a sign that you are upon Khair. It is the sign that you are upon good. It is a distinguishing characteristic, or it is a distinguishing matter that shows that you are upon good. It is narrated in Abu Dawud :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Then it is saheeh, the happy o­ne, is the o­ne who can avoid trials and tribulations especially those that lead him astray or take him away from his deen, but the o­ne who is tested and is patient, so greater reward for him, unimaginable reward for him.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also it has been related by Bukhari and Muslim : Abbas said to Ibn Rabah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Shall I show you o­ne of the women of Jannah? Saudah, this black woman who told the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) : Verily I have seizures and I become uncovered, make dua to Allaah for me.&#8217; The Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: <em>If you are patient you will have Jannah. And if you want I&#8217;ll make dua for you that you be healthy.</em> She said : &#8216;I&#8217;ll be patient, I&#8217;ll be patient but make sure that I don&#8217;t become uncovered.&#8217; So the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) made dua to Allaah that she does not become uncovered.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is how the Salaf were. Because of this some of the salafs used to say : If a difficulty happens to you, a hardship happens to you, if you are put to trial and tested and you are patient, then you have got o­nly o­ne difficulty. You have o­nly got o­ne hardship. You have o­nly got o­ne problem. Whenever a difficulty or hardship or trial comes your way and you are not patient, then you have two problems, and two hardships. And particularly if it is a loss of a child, or a loss of a loved o­ne. You are not patient with that then you have two difficulties.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The loss of the o­ne you love plus the loss of the reward you would have got if you had been patient. To be patient upon the tests, and the trials, and the hardships and the difficulties as a worship for Allaah, is a worship for Allaah. Many of us know that salaah is a worship, Zakah is a worship, and ruku is a worship and sujud is a worship, and reading Quraan is a worship , how many of us know that being patient upon a hardship, upon a sadness , being patient upon a difficulty, upon a test, upon a trial is a worship for Allaah. Allaah says in Surah Al-Hajj (22:11) :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>&#8220;And among mankind is he who worships Allâh as it were, upon the very edge; if good befalls him, he is content therewith; but if a trial befalls him, when fitnah comes to him, or a hardship befalls him, if something that brings about grief comes his way, if he is tested, if he is put to the test, when sadness comes his way, if a hardship befalls him, what happens? He flips upon his face. He loses both this world and the Hereafter. There is no doubt that this is the clear loss.&#8221;</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Walhamdulillah. The greater the test, the greater the reward, the greater the hardship the greater the reward, the greater the difficulty, the greater the reward from Allaah (tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala). And the Salaf understood this. Urwah Ibn Zubair, a well known from the Salaf had a problem with his foot. So the doctors decided that they had to cut it off, cut the foot off. When the doctors cut it off he didn&#8217;t say anything except these words: &#8216;O Allaah, for you are Full praise. For if you have taken some, you have left some. And if you have tested, and put through difficulty you have also put in good condition. If you have tested and tried and put through difficulty you have also put good health, good circumstances and good conditions.&#8217;The next day his son was riding a horse or mule and fell off of it and died. So they came to Urwah with the information of the death of his son, he didn&#8217;t say anything except : &#8216;O Allaah, for you is full praise. For if you have taken some, you have left some. And if you have tested and tried you have also placed us in good situations and good condition.&#8217; So when he was asked about this he said: &#8216;I had 4 limbs (meaning 2 arms and 2 legs) and Allaah took some and left some. &#8216;I had 4 limbs 2 arms and 2 legs Allaah took o­ne and left me three. I had 7 sons, Allaah (tabrak wa tala) took o­ne and left six. And he gave me good condition, or good situation my whole life up until this time. Then he tested me. Should I not praise Allaah for that? Should I not praise Allaah for that?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tests, trials, difficulties, hardships, grief, sadness, pain it raises the level of the believer. It raises the level of the believer. It is an expiation for sins. It removes sins, these difficulties and it raises o­ne&#8217;s level higher with Allaah. Raises o­ne&#8217;s level higher, places o­ne in His station or circumstance that he might not have met, he would never have reached if he had not gone through that test. It is related in Saheeh also Muhammad bin Khalid Abi An Jaddi, his grandfather was a companion that he went out visiting a brother. Then he heard that the brother was sick. So he entered upon the brother and he said : &#8216;I came to you as a visitor, and now I am also o­ne visiting the sick and also someone giving you glad tidings.&#8217; The person said: &#8216;how do you gather all this, i.e. somebody who is a visitor, somebody who is visiting a sick, somebody who is giving glad tidings? How do you gather all that?&#8217;He said : &#8216;I came out, I wanted to visit you, it reached me that you were sick, then it became that I am visiting the sick person also I give you glad tidings of something that I heard from the Messenger (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) : If Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) has decreed or wants for his servant a certain Manzala, a certain position in the Jannah, a high position in the Jannah, and the servant is not going to reach it, he&#8217;s going like he&#8217;s going, he&#8217;s not going to reach it, Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) would test him, put him through hardships, would put him through difficulty regarding his body – may be he will get sick or something; or regarding his wealth – may be he will lose something; or regarding his children &#8212; may be o­ne of them will pass away or become sick or whatever. So that this person can become patient, have this Ibadah of worship, then what ? So that this person can reach the position that Allah wanted him to reach. So that he can reach the position Allaah wanted for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Same Hadith : &#8216;Who are the people who will receive the most difficulties, trials and tribulations? He said: the prophets, then those most like them, then like them, a man will be tested in accordance with his deen. A man will go through difficulties in according with his deen. A man will go through hardship in according with his deen. A man will experience sadness and grief in accordance with his deen. If his deen is strong, then his difficulties will be great. His trials will be hard. If he has in his deen some ease, or some lightness then he will be tested in accordance with the likeness of his deen. Because trials and tests want leave a servant until his sins are forgiven. That is, because the servant, he undergoes so many trials and tests, his sins are forgiven and it will be as if he is walking upon the earth without a sin. That he is walking upon the earth without a sin. In another Hadith (listen to this brother) : If you have a difficulty in your life brother, if you have a difficulty in your life sister, if there is some sadness in your household, if you lost a child, if that child has been hurt, if there is a sickness in your family or whatever the case, whatever difficulty or trial, whatever problem you are going through, listen to the words of Messenger (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), it will make it clear. Listen to the words of Rasoolullah (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), it will cool your heart, it will take you to that which is right, it will correct you, it will guide you, it will increase your faith, and your patience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;There is no difficulty that happens to a Muslim except that Allaah removes a sin because of it even if a thorn pricks him and even to that degree.&#8221;<br />
</em><br />
If Allaah removes to that degree what about some other sadness? Or some other loss or some other trial or some other difficulty? Lastly Abu Huraira (radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu) that he heard the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and also Abu Said Al Khudri : <em>&#8216;No pain, or sickness affects a believer. No tiredness (this is also sickness), or grief nor any worry except that Allaah removes from that person a sin because of it.&#8217;<br />
</em><br />
This should tell us to be patient. This should tell us that our pathways are not going to be full with rose petals and life is not always going to give you that which you want or think you deserve, that they are going to come down your way or into your life things that are sad, things that bring you grief, things that bring difficulty but your test is shown, your character is shown, whether you can weather the storm by being patient with the decree of Allaah, in praising Allah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala), in hoping a reward from Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala), for no o­ne can reward what Allah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) will give the person who has patience. Allah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) has granted it and he will grant it without calculation. Will grant it without it being something that we could calculate or imagine. So any difficulty brother reflect upon this issue that is khair for you, is good for you, if you are a believer and if you are patient and if you praise Allah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) and it is a way to remove your sins and a way that you have no understanding of what Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) may be preparing you for a better station, a better status in the Hereafter that you would not have reached if He had left you in that state that you were in. But when he tested you, you were patient and therefore Insha-Allaahu wa ta&#8217;ala that position or that status will be their Haada</p>

</a></span></span></strong>Posted by Abdur-Raqeeb @ <a href="http://insightaudio.com/pub/?p=419" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://insightaudio.com/pub/?p=419</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Salaamu Alaykum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakaatuh. May Allah have mercy upon me, you and all of the Muslims. Aameen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once, I entered the masjid for our class with our Shaykh Hasan Abdul-Wahhaab Marzouq Al-Bannaa (may Allah preserve him, and his family upon good), I found him praying. After I offered my prayer of greeting the masjid, I greeted the Shaykh, and kissed his head. We talked about how each of us spent our Eid and the conditions of our families. After this the Shaykh began to drink his tea, which was prepared for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked the Shaykh, <strong>how does one become a strong student, treading the path of seeking knowledge?</strong> The Shaykh replied, Patience (Sabr). He said this 3 times. He said patience with Allah, in good and bad times. Patience with yourself, patience with ease and with hardships. Patience with your family and friends. Patience with knowledge. Patience with the Qur’aan. Patience with learning the Arabic language. I thanked the Shaykh and returned to my place of sitting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After a short while, the Shaykh motioned to me to come to him. <strong>He told me, not to waste time</strong>. He told me to guard my time from the time wasters. He told me not to waste my time with that which wont bring about any benefit. Guard your time against your desires. Give knowledge all of your time. Tire yourself with seeking knowledge. Do not become distracted by those who want to take your knowledge. Once again I thanked the Shaykh and returned to my place of sitting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After a short period, the Shaykh motioned to me again to come to him. <strong>He told me to engulf myself in reading the Qur’aan</strong>. He said to read the Qur’aan in abundance. Over and over and over. He said to read the Qur’aan when you wake from your sleep, read the Qur’aan before you go to bed. The more you read the Qur’aan, the better you will become in the Arabic language. So constantly read the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>He also told me to listen to the tapes of the Ulamaa (major scholars),</strong> from the likes of Shaykh Al-Albaanee, Shaykh Al-Uthaymeen, Shaykh Ibn Baaz, and Shaykh Saalih Aali Shaykh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Later on the Shaykh was asked about <strong>the rights of the Qur’aan</strong>. Is it better to read it or to memorize it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">He, the Shaykh (may Allah preserve him, and his family) said, one should read the Qur’aan. The Qur’aan is to be read. To memorize it is good. But if it cant be memorized, so read it. Read it in your prayers, before you sleep, when you wake. Before prayer and after prayer. Always have a mushaf (copy of the Qur’aan) near you, everywhere. In Shaa Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah have mercy upon us all.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: </strong>What is the ruling on one who becomes discontented when he is afflicted by calamity?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A: </strong>In times of calamity, people divide into four different levels:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First Level:</strong> Discontent and there are different types of discontent:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1.</strong> In the heart, as if he is angry with his Lord, and so he rails against what Allāh has ordained for him, and this is forbidden and could even lead to disbelief. Allāh, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَعْبُدُ اللَّهَ عَلَى حَرْفٍ فَإِنْ أَصَابَهُ خَيْرٌ اطْمَأَنَّ بِهِ وَإِنْ أَصَابَتْهُ فِتْنَةٌ انقَلَبَ عَلَى وَجْهِهِ خَسِرَ الدُّنْيَا وَالْآخِرَةَ ذَلِكَ هُوَ الْخُسْرَانُ الْمُبِينُ</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And among mankind is he who worships Allah as it were upon the edge (i.e. in doubt): if good befalls him, he is content therewith; but if a trial befalls him he turns back on his face (i.e. reverts to disbelief after embracing Islam). He loses both this world and the Hereafter.” </span>(Al-Hajj 22:11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2.</strong> That it is spoken, such as invoking woe, destruction and the like and this is forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3.</strong> That it is physical, such as striking the cheeks, tearing the clothes and pulling out the hair and the like, and all of this is forbidden, because it negates the patience which is required.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second Level:</strong> Patience and this is as the poet says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Patience is like its name, its taste is bitter,</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>But the end result s of it are sweeter than honey.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, he considers this burden heavy, yet he bears it, even though he hates that it should occur, and his faith protects him from discontent. So, its occurring or not occurring are not the same to him. This is an obligation, because Allāh, the Most High has commanded him to be patient, saying:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> وَاصْبِرُواْ إِنَّ اللّهَ مَعَ الصَّابِرِينَ</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“and be patient. Surely, Allah is with those who are As-Sabirun (the patient).”</span> (Al-Anfal 8:46)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Third Level: </strong>Acceptance: That a person accepts misfortune, so that its presence or absence are the same to him. Its presence is not hard on him, and he does not bear a heavy burden due to it, and this is highly preferred, although not obligatory, according to the most authoritative opinion. The difference between it and the last level is clear, because the presence of misfortune and its absence are the same in the acceptance of this person, whereas in the level before it, misfortune is difficult for him, yet he bears it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Fourth Level:</strong> Gratitude, and this is the highest level: It is by him thanking Allah for the misfortune which has befallen him, because he knows that this misfortune is a cause of his sins being remitted and  and it might also be a cause of his reward being increased. The Prophet <em>salAllahu alayhi wasallam </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“There is no misfortune that afflicts a Muslim except that Allah remits a sin from him because of it, even the prick he receives from a thorn.”</em></strong> (Reported by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed from: </strong><em>Fatawa Arkan-ul-Islam | </em>Islamic Verdicts on the Pillars of Islam, Volume 1 – Creed and Prayer | Shaykh ‘Uthaymeen | Darussalam English Publications</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tafseer Ibn Katheer &#8211; Suratul Baqarah [Surah No.2]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;">(155. And certainly, We shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits, but give glad tidings to As-Sabirin (the patient).)</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966;"> (156. Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: &#8220;Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.&#8221;)</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966;"> (157. They are those on whom are the Salawat (i.e., who are blessed and will be forgiven) from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His mercy, and it is they who are the guided ones.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah informs us that He tests and tries His servants, just as He said in another Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And surely, We shall try you till We test those who strive hard (for the cause of Allah) and As-Sabirin (the patient), and We shall test your facts (i.e., the one who is a liar, and the one who is truthful).)</strong> (47:31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, He tests them with the bounty sometimes and sometimes with the afflictions of fear and hunger. Allah said in another Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So Allah made it taste extreme of hunger (famine) and fear.) (16:112)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The frightened and the hungry persons show the effects of the affliction outwardly and this is why Allah has used here the word `Libas&#8217; (cover or clothes) of fear and hunger. In the Ayat above, Allah used the words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(with something of fear, hunger,) meaning, a little of each. Then (Allah said),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(loss of wealth,) meaning, some of the wealth will be destroyed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(lives) meaning, losing friends, relatives and loved ones to death,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and fruits,) meaning, the gardens and the farms will not produce the usual or expected amounts. This is why Allah said next:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(but give glad tidings to As-Sabirin (the patient).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then explained whom He meant by `the patient&#8217; whom He praised:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: &#8220;Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.&#8221;)</strong> meaning, those who recite this statement to comfort themselves in the face of their loss, know that they belong to Allah and that He does what He wills with His servants. They also know that nothing and no deed, even if it was the weight of an atom, will be lost with Allah on the Day of Resurrection. These facts thus compel them to admit that they are Allah&#8217;s servants and that their return will be to Him in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(They are those on whom are the Salawat (i. e., who are blessed and will be forgiven)</strong> from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His mercy,) meaning, Allah&#8217;s praise and mercy will be with them. Sa`id bin Jubayr added, &#8220;Meaning, safety from the torment.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(and it is they who are the guided ones.)</strong> `Umar bin Al-Khattab commented: &#8220;What righteous things, and what a great heights.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(They are those on whom are the Salawat from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His mercy) are the two righteous things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and it is they who are the guided ones) are the heights.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The heights means more rewards, and these people will be awarded their rewards and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are several Ahadith that mention the <strong>rewards of admitting</strong> that the return is to Allah by saying:(&#8220;Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.&#8221;) when afflictions strike.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For instance, Imam Ahmad reported that Umm Salamah narrated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once, Abu Salamah came back after he was with Allah&#8217;s Messenger and said: I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger recite a statement that made me delighted. He said:(No Muslim is struck with an affliction and then says Istirja` when the affliction strikes, and then says: `O Allah! Reward me for my loss and give me what is better than it,&#8217; but Allah will do just that.) Umm Salamah said: So I memorized these words. When Abu Salamah died I said Istirja` and said: &#8220;O Allah! Compensate me for my loss and give me what is better than it.&#8221; I then thought about it and said, &#8220;Who is better than Abu Salamah&#8221; When my `Iddah (the period of time before the widow or divorced woman can remarry) finished, Allah&#8217;s Messenger asked for permission to see me while I was dyeing a skin that I had. I washed my hands, gave him permission to enter and handed him a pillow, and he sat on it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then asked me for marriage and when he finished his speech, I said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! It is not because I do not want you, but I am very jealous and I fear that you might experience some wrong mannerism from me for which Allah would punish me. I am old and have children.&#8221; He said: (As for the jealousy that you mentioned, Allah the Exalted will remove it from you. As for your being old as you mentioned, I have suffered what you have suffered. And for your having children, they are my children too.) She said, &#8220;I have surrendered to Allah&#8217;s Messenger.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Messenger married her and Umm Salamah said later, &#8220;Allah compensated me with who is better than Abu Salamah: Allah&#8217;s Messenger .&#8217; [ Muslim reported a shorter version of this Hadith]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id=":1nu">
<div dir="ltr">
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;">Source: From  &#8220;al-Waabil as-Sayyib&#8221;</span></p>
<p>On the authority of Suhaib (may Allaah be pleased with him) he said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;Amazing is the affair of the believer, verily all of his affair is good and this is not for no one except the believer. If something of good/happiness befalls him he is grateful and that is good for him. If something of harm befalls him he is patient and that is good for him&#8221;</em> </span>(Saheeh Muslim #2999)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this we understand that the state of affairs for the believer changes in the life of this world. Shaykhul Islaam ibn Qayyim al-Jawzeeyah (may Allaah have mercy upon him) said regarding the state of affairs for the believer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>One of them</strong> is the state of (receiving a) blessing. It&#8217;s obligatory upon him (the believer) in this state (to display) the gratitude.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second</strong>: is the state (of being) tested. It is obligatory upon him (the believer) in this state (to observe) the patience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third:</strong> is the state (of committing) a sin. It is obligatory upon him (the believer) in this state to seek the forgiveness from it (the sin).</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The servant does not go outside of the fluctuation between these three states.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of them is either a blessing or a virtue from Allaah of good health, wealth, a child to other than that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">It is obligatory upon him that he thanks Allaah for this bounty. Let the servant contemplate over the statement of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;padding-left:30px;">&#8221; ٱعۡمَلُوٓاْ ءَالَ دَاوُ ۥدَ شُكۡرً۬اۚ وَقَلِيلٌ۬ مِّنۡ عِبَادِىَ ٱلشَّكُورُ &#8221;<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;Work you, O family of Dâwud (David), with thanks!&#8221; But few of My slaves are grateful.&#8221;</em> </span>(surah Sabaa: 13)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">So how many of those whom Allaah has favored them:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;padding-left:30px;">&#8220;وَإِن تَعُدُّواْ نِعۡمَةَ ٱللَّهِ لَا تُحۡصُوهَآ‌ۗ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَغَفُورٌ۬ رَّحِيمٌ۬&#8221;<br />
<em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And if you would count the favours of Allâh, never could you be able to count them. Truly! Allâh is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221;</span> </em>(surah an-Nahl: 18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">How many show thanks to Allaah for these favours? Less than a few!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or there is a (state of being) tested.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">It is obligatory upon him in this state (to observe) the patience. Meaning that Allaah from His overwhelming wisdom He could test the believing servant from the different types of test. It&#8217;s obligatory upon him to (observe) the patience because this is from the belief in the divine decree and from submitting the the decree of Allaah. Also (the servant must know) that what has befalling him was never going to pass him by. All of that is written in the book of Allaah (al-Lawhul-Mahfooth). <span style="color:#ff6600;">Verily Allah doesn&#8217;t test him (the servant) to destroy him. He only test him in order to test his patience and servitude</span>. Verily there is for Allaah upon the servant servitude in times of hardship just as there is for Him (Allaah) upon the servant servitude in times of happiness. There also is for Him (Allaah) upon the servant servitude in that which he (the servant) dislikes just as there is for Him (Allaah) upon the servant servitude in that which he (the servant) loves. Most of the creation give the servitude in that which they love. However the matter is giving the servitude in that which there is his hardship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other state is (a state of) sin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">It is obligatory upon him (the servant) in this state to seek the forgiveness this is clear with regards to the obligation of turning to Allaah (repentance) displaying ones need for him.&#8221;</p>
