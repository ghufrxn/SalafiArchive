<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allah Alone! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are repeated questions about some who claim that Allah is incarnate among His creation and mingles with them. <strong><span style="color:#993300;">They claim that</span> </strong>this is the meaning of the general Ma`iyyah (association or being with). They take as evidence the Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse): &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(O Muhammad sallallaahu alaihi wasallam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> were not on the western side</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (of the Mount)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;</span></strong> and:  &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">You were not with them, when they cast lots with their pens as to which of them should be charged with the care of Maryam </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Mary)</span>; <strong><span style="color:#008000;">nor were you with them when they disputed&#8221;</span></strong>. They claim that the two Ayahs denote that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) was not with them, but Allah was there in His Self ­Entity, as he exists everywhere.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since those people misunderstand the whole point and made a big mistake, opposing the true `Aqidah (creed) as shown in the Holy Qur&#8217;an and the Prophetic Sunnah and as adopted by the Salaf (righteous predecessors) of the Muslim nation, I think I should show the right opinion on such a false belief and what seems to be confusing about this point pertaining to Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (may He be Exalted and Glorified) can be described only with the Names and Attributes with which He has described Himself and the Names and Attributes with which His Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) described Him, which suit His Majesty without Takyif (questioning Allah&#8217;s Attributes), Tamthil (likening Allah&#8217;s Attributes to those of His Creation), Tahrif (distortion of the meaning), or Ta`til (denial of Allah&#8217;s Attributes). This is because Allah (Exalted be He) says: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him; and He is the All­ Hearer, the All­ Seer&#8221;</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As stated in the Holy Qur&#8217;an and the Prophetic Sunnah and unanimously agreed upon by the Salaf of the Muslim nation, Allah (Glorified be He) is above His creatures and is seated on His Throne in a manner that suits His Majesty, unlike the seating of His creation. Allah (Exalted be He) is among His creatures with His knowledge and nothing is concealed about them from Him. This is what has been proven by the Holy Qur&#8217;an with its rhetoric Ayahs and by the Prophetic Sunnah with its direct authentic Hadiths.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>There are many Qur&#8217;anic proofs</strong></span> that Allah exists in the heavens above His creatures and is seated on His Throne. Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">To Him ascend </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(all)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> the goodly words, and the righteous deeds exalt it (i.e. the goodly words are not accepted by Allâh unless and until they are followed by good deeds) ; </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">I will take you and raise you to Myself ; </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The angels and the Rûh</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> [Jibrîl (Gabriel)]</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> ascend to Him ; </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Then He </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Istawâ)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> rose over the Throne </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(in a manner that suits His Majesty)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">. The Most Gracious </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Allâh)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">! ; </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Allâh)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, will not cause the earth to sink with you Or do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Allâh)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, will not send against you a violent whirlwind? ; </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The Most Gracious </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Allâh)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> rose over </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Istawâ)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> the </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Mighty)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> Throne </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(in a manner that suits His Majesty)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">. and: O Hâmân! Build me a tower that I may arrive at the ways The ways of the heavens, and I may look upon the Ilâh </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(God)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> of Mûsâ </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Moses)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">: But verily, I think him to be a liar.</span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">As for the proofs from the Prophetic Sunnah</span></strong>, there are uncountable numbers of Sahih (authentic) and Hasan (good) Hadiths, such as: the Hadith about the Prophet&#8217;s Mi`raj (Ascension to the heavens) to his Lord and the Hadith about the Ruqyah (reciting Qur&#8217;an and saying supplications over the sick seeking healing) which was reported by Abu Dawud and others: &#8220;<strong>Our Lord is Allah Who is in the heaven; Holy is Your Name, Your command reigns supreme in the heaven and the earth</strong>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Hadith about the mountain goats, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;</strong></span><strong>..and the Throne is above this; Allah is above the Throne; and He knows your states</strong><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;</strong></span>. (Related by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and others)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In an authentic Hadith he (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) said to the bonds woman: &#8220;Where is Allah?&#8221; She replied: &#8220;In the heaven.&#8221; He (peace be upon him) asked her: &#8220;Who am I?&#8221; She replied: &#8220;You are the Messenger of Allah.&#8221; Then he (peace be upon him) said to her master: &#8220;Release her for she is a believer.&#8221; (Related by Muslim in his Sahih book of Hadith)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are other Hadiths that were authentically reported from the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) stating that Allah&#8217;s Messenger said that Allah is above His Throne and that He is above the heavens, as naturally known by all nations, Arabs and non­-Arabs both in the pre­Islamic period and under Islam, except those whom Satan has allured. Also, there are hundreds or thousands of statements by the Salaf on the same topic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing in the Holy Qur&#8217;an, the Prophetic Sunnah or the statements of the Salaf, neither from among the Prophet&#8217;s Companions nor those who followed their guidance or the Imams who lived in the age of allurement and difference, that opposes what has been mentioned above whether explicitly or implicitly. None of them ever said that Allah is not above the heavens, not above the Throne, not exist anywhere in His Self ­Entity, all places are the same to Him, or not exist in the world nor outside it, not permissible to use your fingers, etc. to point at Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Contrarily, it was authentically reported in the Sahih book of Hadith on the authority of Jabir Ibn `Abdullah that on concluding a famous sermon by Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) on the Day of `Arafat in the biggest gathering attended by Allah&#8217;s Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam), he said: &#8220;<strong>Haven&#8217;t I conveyed Allah&#8217;s message to you, haven&#8217;t I conveyed Allah&#8217;s message to you</strong>.&#8221; They said: &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then He (peace be upon him) raised his finger to the sky and pointed at the people and said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;</strong></span><strong>O Allah! Bear witness to this</strong>.&#8221; There are many similar Hadiths on this point.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was also discussed by Shaykh­ul ­Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and others who were well ­versed in such matters (see Al ­Fatawa, v., p. 14).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Generally, the corrupt belief adopted by the impairing <strong><span style="color:#993300;">Jahmiyyah</span> </strong>(a deviant Islamic sect denying some Attributes of Allah, claiming they are ascribed to people and cannot be ascribed to Allah) and those following them from among the people who introduced innovations to the religion is one of the most wicked and harmful beliefs. It detracts from Allah&#8217;s Majesty ­ we seek refuge in Allah from our hearts&#8217; deviation from the right path! There are many pieces of evidence of such misleading and corrupt beliefs. There can be no doubt that a sound mind and upright natural disposition deny such corrupt beliefs. Besides, there is hard legal evidence that denies such corrupt beliefs. Regarding the practice of taking the above ­mentioned Ayahs as evidence to support their corrupt belief, it is a wicked practice, as they claim that Allah was incarnate in the earth beside Mount Sinai, taking as evidence the Qur&#8217;anic Ayahs on such an event. May Allah be Glorified and High from their grave falsehood!</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those claiming Allah is incarnate among His creation do not know that Ma`iyyah is of two types; general and private.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Examples of the <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>private Ma`iyyah</strong></span> are the Ayahs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Truly, Allâh is with those who fear Him (keep their duty unto Him), and those who are Muhsinûn (good­doers)&#8221;</strong></span>. See the footenote of V.9:120). ;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Be not sad (or afraid), surely Allâh is with us&#8221;</span></strong>. and:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>I am with you both, hearing and seeing&#8221;</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are similar Ayahs on the private Ma`iyyah that Allah (Exalted be He) is with His prophets and pious believing servants through support, help, guidance and care. This is confirmed by Allah (Glorified be He) in a Qudsi Hadith related by His Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;<strong>My slave keeps on coming closer to Me through performing Nawafil (praying or doing extra deeds besides what is obligatory) until I love him, so I become his sense of hearing with which he hears; his sense of sight with which he sees; his hand with which he grips; and his leg with which he walks&#8221;</strong>. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, this does not mean that Allah becomes a servant&#8217;s extremities ­ may Allah be Glorified and High from such meaning! Conversely, it denotes that Allah becomes with a servant through support and guidance, as explained in another narration of the Qudsi Hadith mentioned above:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>With Me he hears, with Me he sees, with Me he grips, and with Me he walks</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the second narration Allah explains the meaning of His saying, &#8220;<strong>I become his sense of hearing, etc.<span style="color:#000000;">,</span></strong>&#8221; which implies Allah&#8217;s guidance to and support of His servants and protecting them from committing what displeases Him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <strong><span style="color:#993300;">general Ma`iyyah</span></strong>, it means perfect knowledge. Such a type of Ma`iyyah is mentioned in many Qur&#8217;anic Ayahs, such as:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is no Najwâ </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(secret counsel)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> of three but He is their fourth </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(with His Knowledge, while He Himself is over the Throne, over the seventh heaven)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, nor of five but He is their sixth </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(with His Knowledge)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, nor of less than that or more but He is with them </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(with His Knowledge)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> wheresoever they may be&#8221;</span></strong>. ;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He is with you (</strong>by His Knowledge)<strong> wheresoever you may be&#8221;</strong></span>. ;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Then surely, We shall narrate unto them (</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">their whole story) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">with knowledge, and indeed We have not been absent</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">Neither you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(O Muhammad sallallaahu alaihi wasallam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> do any deed nor recite any portion of the Qur’ân, ­ nor you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(mankind)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> do any deed </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(good or evil)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> but We are Witness thereof, when you are doing i</span></strong>t.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many similar Ayahs on such a type of Ma`iyyah. Allah (Glorified be He) is seated on His Throne in a manner that suits His Perfection and Majesty. Also, He is All ­Knowing of His creation and a Witness over them wherever they exist; on land or in the sea, by night or by day, at their homes or in the open desert. All are equal with regard to Allah&#8217;s Knowledge, as He surrounds them all in His Knowledge and they all are under His Sight and Hearing that He hears their speech, sees them wherever they are, and knows their secrets and private counsel.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">No doubt! They did fold up their breasts, that they may hide from Him. Surely, even when they cover themselves with their garments, He knows what they conceal and what they reveal. Verily, He is the All ­Knower of the </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(innermost secrets) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">of the breasts.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Allah (Exalted be He) says:<strong><span style="color:#008000;"> It is the same </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(to Him)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> whether any of you conceal his speech or declares it openly, whether he be hid by night or goes forth freely by day</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">that you may know that Allâh has power over all things, and that Allâh surrounds all things in </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(His)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> Knowledge. There is no god or lord but Allah</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) begins the Ayahs on general Ma`iyyah with knowledge and finishes them with knowledge so that His servants may know that Allah is All ­Knowing of their affairs, not that He is incarnate among them in their dwellings, etc. Allah is Exalted above such falsehoods.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">The falsehood that the general Ma`iyyah means that Allah is incarnate among His creation is adopted by those believing in incarnation</span>. They claim that Allah exists everywhere in His Self­ Entity and that He is Exalted above being seated on His Throne and existing in the heavens over His creation. They never exalt Him above being existent in the dirtiest places ­may Allah disgrace them all!</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Great scholars from among the Salaf fought such falsehoods such as Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, `Abdullah Ibn Al­Mubarak, Ishaq Ibn Rahawayh, Abu Hanifah Al­Nu`man and others. Similarly, scholars from among the Imams of Guidance did the same such as Shaykh­ul ­Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, the great scholar Ibn Al­Qayyim, Al­ Hafiz Ibn Kathir and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since this point has been clear, the Ayah: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">And He is with you (by His Knowledge)</span></strong> and similar Ayahs do not denote that Allah is incarnate among His creation, neither explicitly nor implicitly. The preposition &#8220;with&#8221; in these Ayahs does not mean this at all, but it only denotes Ma`iyyah and association. Such Ma`iyyah has a different meaning in each situation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As said by Abu `Umar Al­ Tallamanky (may Allah be merciful with him), Muslims from among Ahl­ul­Sunnah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim main body) unanimously agree that the meaning of the Ayah: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">And He is with you (by His Knowledge) wheresoever you may be</span></strong>. and similar Qur&#8217;anic Ayahs is that Allah is with His creation by His knowledge and that He, may He be Exalted, is established on His Throne above the heavens.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, great scholars and Imams from among the Salaf were of the opinion that Allah is established on His Throne above the heavens.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Nasr Al­Sijzy said our great Imams, such as Sufyan Al­Thawriy, Malik, Hammad Ibn Salamah, Hammad Ibn Zayd, Sufyan Ibn `Uyaynah, Al­Fudayl, Ibn Al­Mubarak, Ahmad, and Ishaq unanimously agree that Allah (Glorified be He) is established on His Throne by His Self­ Entity and everywhere by His Knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu `Umar Ibn `Abdul­Bar said: &#8220;Great scholars from among Sahabah (Prophet&#8217;s Companions) and Tabi`un (Followers, the generation after the Companions of the Prophet) known for Ta&#8217;wil (allegorical interpretation) were of the opinion that the Ta&#8217;wil of the Ayah: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There is no Najwâ (secret counsel) of three but He is their fourth</strong></span> (with His Knowledge, while He Himself is over the Throne, over the seventh heaven) is that Allah is seated on His Throne above the heavens in His Self­ Entity and that He exists everywhere by His Knowledge. It is worth mentioning that no notable scholar opposed their opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al­ Hafizh Ibn Kathir (may Allah be Merciful with him) said, &#8220;The Ayah: &#8216;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And He is with you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(by His Knowledge) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">wheresoever you may be. And Allâh is the All ­Seer of what you do&#8217;</span></strong>. means that Allah is a witness of our deeds wherever and whenever we exist; on land or in the sea, by night or by day, in our homes or in the open desert, as we are all equal with regard to Allah&#8217;s Knowledge because He surrounds us all with His Knowledge. We are all under His Sight and Hearing that He hears our talk and sees us wherever we are, and knows our secrets and private counsels. Allay (Glorified be He) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">No doubt! They did fold up their breasts, that they may hide from Him. Surely, even when they cover themselves with their garments, He knows what they conceal and what they reveal. Verily, He is the All ­Knower of the (</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">innermost secrets) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">of the breasts</span></strong>. Allah (Exalted be He) also says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">It is the same (to Him) whether any of you conceal his speech or declares it openly, whether he be hid by night or goes forth freely by day. There is no God or lord but Him</span></strong>. Regarding the Tafsir (explanation) of the Ayah quoted from Surah Al­Mujadalah in which Allah says: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is no Najwâ (secret counsel) of three he said that there are no three persons with a secret but He is their fourth (with His Knowledge, while He Himself is over the Throne, over the seventh heaven), nor of five but He is their sixth (with His Knowledge), nor of less than that or more but He is with them (with His Knowledge) wheresoever they may be&#8221;</span></strong>. that He is All­Knowing of their affairs, hearing their talk and knowing their secrets and private counsels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Allah&#8217;s messengers write down people&#8217;s private counsels though Allah is All­ Knowing of such private counsels and hears them. Allah (Glorified be He) says: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Know they not that Allâh knows their secret ideas, and their Najwa (secret counsels), and that Allâh is the All­ Knower of things unseen&#8221;</strong></span>. and: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsel? (Yes We do) and Our messengers (appointed angels in charge of mankind) are by them, to record&#8221;</span></strong>. As said, many scholars reported consensus over the meaning of this Ayah is that Allah exists among His creation by His Knowledge. There can be no doubt with regard to this point. In addition, His hearing as well as His Knowledge encompasses them. Moreover, they are under His Sight, as He (Exalted be He) is All­ Knowing of the affairs of His creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There can be no doubt that the statements of the Salaf about such a point are too many to be counted. Therefore, the belief that Allah is incarnate among His creation, the claim that Allah exists among His creation in His Self­ Entity according to the Ayah: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">And He is with you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(</span><span style="color:#008000;">by His Knowledge)</span> and that it is not permissible to point at Him are totally wrong and false as shown from the many direct proofs mentioned here and the consensus of Muslim scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consequently, it becomes clear that those who say that Allah is incarnate among His creation and those who follow them are not right at all. Rather, they ascribe to Allah what does not suit His Majesty. In addition, they give the Ayahs on Ma`iyyah explanations that are different from those given by great scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah protect us from disgrace and from ascribing to Allah that which does not suit Him, out of ignorance! We ask Allah (Glorified be He) to make us adhere to the right path, as only He is Able to do all things! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>37- Merits of learning Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: A questioner from Hadhramaut is asking about &#8216;Aqidah (creed): Your Eminence, is learning the Attributes of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) Wajib (obligatory) or Mustahab (desirable)? Does learning these Attributes make any difference? What is the ruling on those who believe that it is not Wajib to learn the Attributes because this might entangle one into asking why and what? What are the books you recommend in this regard?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Ans by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah):</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Learning Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes from the Noble Qur&#8217;an and the purified Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet) is <strong>one of the best acts of worship that brings us nearer to Allah</strong>. Learning Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes <strong>helps one to glorify, praise and call on Allah by His Names and Attributes</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allâh, so call on Him by them)&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates that we should know Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes and use them while calling on Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Allah has ninety-nine Names; anyone who learns them will be admitted to Jannah (Paradise).&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p>This Hadith indicates that Allah is Witr (&#8216;Odd&#8217;, i.e. He is one) and He loves odd numbers.  It also indicates that scholars and believers should learn the Names and Attributes of Allah to invoke and praise Him and act upon them so that they enter Jannah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A believer should know that to Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) belongs all Magnificent Names and that He has no peer, equal or rival. He is Perfect in His Essence, His Names, His Attributes and His Deeds and none is comparable to Him. Allah (Glorified be He) says: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him; and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer</span></strong>.) None of Allah&#8217;s Attributes such as His Mercy, Highness, Istiwa&#8217; (Allah&#8217;s rising over the Throne in a manner that befits Him), Wrath , Laughter etc, is similar to ours.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">As for the books we recommend in this regard,</span> </strong>the Noble Qur&#8217;an is the greatest Book. We advise you and all Muslims to adhere to it and recite it frequently because it is the Book of Allah which contains light and guidance. Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Verily, this Qur&#8217;ân guides to that which is most just and right</strong>&#8220;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: &#8220;It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing.&#8221;</strong></span>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(This is) a Book (the Qur&#8217;an) which we have sent down to you, full of blessings, that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may remember</strong></span>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do they not then think deeply in the Qur&#8217;ân, or are their hearts locked up (from understanding it)?)&#8221;</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We advise all Muslims to frequently recite, ponder over, and memorize the entire Qur&#8217;an or parts thereof. It is the Book of Allah and the source of light and guidance. It calls for adopting good morals, performing righteous deeds, following that which Allah has enjoined, and avoiding that which He has forbidden. It contains the stories of the prophets, messengers, and the righteous so that people may follow in their footsteps and the stories of the wrongdoers, so people may avoid their deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also recommend those who are versed to read the books of Hadith such as the Two Sahihs (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) and the four Sunan (Hadith compilations classified by jurisprudential themes) books (of Imams Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhy, Al-Nasa&#8217;y and Ibn Majah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, we recommend novices to read the abridged versions of these books which can be easily memorized, such as, Bulugh Al-Maram by Al-Hafidh ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani, Kitab Al-Tawhid, Thalathat Al-Usul, Al Qawa&#8217;id Al &#8216;Arba&#8217;, and Kashf Al-Shubuhat by Shaykh Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdul-Wahhab (may Allah be merciful to him), Al-`Aqidah Al-Wasatiyyah by Shaykh Al-Islam ibn Taymiyyah, and Umdat Al-Hadith by Shaykh Al-Hafidh Abdul Ghani Al-Maqdisi. These are some important books which should be read and studied because they are useful.</p>

<h2></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قُل لَّوْ كَانَ الْبَحْرُ مِدَاداً لِّكَلِمَـتِ رَبِّى لَنَفِدَ الْبَحْرُ قَبْلَ أَن تَنفَدَ كَلِمَـتُ رَبِّى وَلَوْ جِئْنَا بِمِثْلِهِ مَدَداً </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: &#8220;If the sea were ink for the Words of my Lord, surely, the sea would be exhausted before the Words of my Lord would be finished, even if We brought like it for its aid.</strong></span>&#8221; [Surah Kahf 18:109]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#003300;"><strong>[Tafseer Ibn Kathir]</strong></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Words of the Lord can never be finished</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says: `<strong>Say, O Muhammad, if the water of the sea were ink for a pen to write down the words, wisdom and signs of Allah, the sea would run dry before it all could be written down.</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَوْ جِئْنَا بِمِثْلِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(even if We brought like it)</strong> means, another sea, then another, and so on, additional seas to be used for writing. The Words of Allah would still never run out. As Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَوْ أَنَّمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ مِن شَجَرَةٍ أَقْلَامٌ وَالْبَحْرُ يَمُدُّهُ مِن بَعْدِهِ سَبْعَةُ أَبْحُرٍ مَّا نَفِدَتْ كَلِمَاتُ اللَّهِ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if all the trees on the earth were pens and the sea </strong>(were ink)<strong>, with seven seas behind it to increase it, yet the Words of Allah would not be exhausted. Verily, Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.</strong></span>) (31:27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said, &#8220;<strong>The parable of the knowledge of all of mankind, in comparison to the knowledge of Allah, is that of a drop of water in comparison to all of the oceans</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah revealed that:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قُل لَّوْ كَانَ الْبَحْرُ مِدَاداً لِّكَلِمَـتِ رَبِّى لَنَفِدَ الْبَحْرُ قَبْلَ أَن تَنفَدَ كَلِمَـتُ رَبِّى</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: &#8220;If the sea were ink for the Words of my Lord, surely, the sea would be exhausted before the Words of my Lord would be finished,</strong></span>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says that even if those oceans were ink for the Words of Allah, and all the trees were pens, the pens would be broken and the water of the sea would run dry, and the Words of Allah would remain, for nothing can outlast them. For no one can comprehend the greatness of Allah or praise Him as He deserves to be praised, except the One Who praises Himself. Our Lord is as He says He is and He is beyond what we can say. The blessings of this world, the beginning and end of it, in comparison to the blessings of the Hereafter, are like a mustard seed compared to the entire world.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">لِمَن شَاءَ مِنكُمْ أَن يَسْتَقِيمَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>For whoever wills among you to take the straight path </strong></span>(Surah al-Takwir Verse 28)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>For whoever wills</strong>&#8221; is connected to what came before it, &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">It is only a reminder to the worlds, for whoever among you wills to take the straight path</span>&#8220;. As for those who choose not to take the straight path, they neither accept the reminder, nor do they gain any benefit from it. Allah says about those who do accept the reminder:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لَذِكْر َ لِمَن كَانَ لَهُ قَلْبٌ أَوْ أَلْقَى السَّمْعَ وَهُوَ شَهِيدٌ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>In that is surely a reminder for whoever has a heart or listens while he is heedful.</strong> </span>[Sūrah Qāf, 50:37]</p>
<p>For anyone who does not want to take this straight path, there is no way to benefit such a person with this Qur&#8217;an.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Issue of Freewill:</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here is a question: <strong>Do people actually have freewill to do as they choose?</strong> Yes, people have the freedom to choose as they will. Allah (عزّ وجل) has allowed each person the freedom of choice and freewill; if he wants, he does something, if not he does not do it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this were not the case—if people had no freewill—then anyone to whom the messengers were sent would have an excuse against Allah to plead (because they disbelieved): “<strong>We had no choice in the matter</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So yes, people certainly have the freedom to act on their choices. Each individual knows that if he decides, for example, to visit Mecca, Medina, or some other place, it is by his choice. Anytime a person makes a choice, it is by his own decision. He neither feels others force his choice on him or force him to prefer one thing over another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, if an individual chooses to obey Allah, it is by his own choice. And should someone choose to commit a sin, it is also by his own choice. So people do have freewill yet we know with total certainty that people will never “will,” or actually make something happen (including his own actions), unless Allah has willed it to happen before it happens. For this reason, after &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">For whoever wills among you to take the straight path</span>&#8221; Allah then clarifies: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">And you do not will unless Allah wills</span>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We do not will for anything to happen unless Allah has already allowed it to happen. So when anything happens, we know Allah has obviously allowed it to take place. If Allah had not allowed it to happen, we could not have willed it to occur ourselves as Allah  (تعالى) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ مَا اقْتَتَلَ الَّذِينَ مِن بَعْدِهِم مِّن بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَتْهُمُ الْبَيِّنَاتُ وَلَكِنِ </span><span style="color:#000000;">اخْتَلَفُوا فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ آمَنَ وَمِنْهُم مَّن كَفَرَ ۖ وَلَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ مَا اقْتَتَلُوا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">If Allah had willed, those (generations) succeeding them would not have fought each other after the clear proofs had come to them. But they differed, so some of them believed and some of them disbelieved. And if Allah had willed, they would not have fought each other.</span> [Sūrah al-Baqarah, 2:253]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So after we have done anything, we know we chose to do it based on our will and choice, but we also know that this occurred by the will of Allah (عزّ وجل), If he had not willed it, we would not have accomplished it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Now we come to another question:</strong></span> Based on the points above, we then have an excuse to commit sins because whatever happens, Allah allows it and has willed it. We say no, we have no justification for sinning because we have no way of knowing whether Allah has willed something or not until after we have done the deed – after we have chosen to do it. We cannot say, “Allah has willed this for me,” until the sin has already taken place. So once the sin does take place, once it is committed, why was it committed? Because of our freewill and our choice to do it. Therefore, sinners have no justification or excuse before Allah. He nullifies this claim by saying:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">سَيَقُولُ الَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُوا لَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ مَا أَشْرَكْنَا وَلا آبَاؤُنَا وَلا حَرَّمْنَا مِن شَيْءٍ </span><span style="color:#000000;">ۖ كَذَلِكَ كَذَّبَ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ حَتَّى ذَاقُوا بَأْسَنَا </span></h2>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">Those who associated others (in worship) with Allah will say, “If Allah had willed, we would not have associated partners with him, nor would our fathers, and we would not have forbidden anything (against his will).” Likewise, those before them denied until they tasted our punishment.</span> [Sūrah al-An’ām, 6:148]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If they had any justification for making their Shirk (worshipping others with Allah), then they would not have been punished by Allah; they would have been spared the punishment. But they had no right or excuse to worship others, so they were punished. As another example, consider that if someone were informed about a land, safe and peaceful, with sufficient provision and affluence for everyone, everywhere and with successful commerce and a strong economy not found in another land. At the same time, the person is also told of a land where people constantly fear for their lives, live in chaos, having no reliable economy, no law and order, no guaranteed safety for anyone. To which land would he choose to travel? Of course, he travels to the first land and he does not imagine someone, somewhere has forced him to make his decision. He chose the first land based on his own determination and freewill.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have before us now a similar choice: a path to good and a path leading to evil. Allah has already clearly simplified the two for us: this is the path to Paradise, this one to Hell.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, he explained some of what is waiting for us in Paradise of blessings and enjoyment and some punishments that await us in the fire. Which path do we take? Clearly, we would choose the path to Paradise just like we would choose to move to the peaceful land over the land in turmoil. Had we chosen the path to the fire, we alone would have justifiably been to blame. We would have made the worst, most foolish choice just as if we had decided to move to the land of fear and instability. Everyone would understandably hold us responsible for our own choice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, in Allah’s statement &#8220;<strong>For whoever wills among you</strong>&#8220;, he confirms that each individual has the choice and will to decide his actions; he has freewill. Still, we know that even before we do or will anything, once it has happened, we know full well that Allah willed it to happen. Otherwise, it would not have occurred.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many times, people become determined to do something, yet at the last minute they find themselves unable to do it for whatever reason. This is because Allah did not will such an action to take place. For example, we may decide to go to the mosque to attend a lecture, yet on our way there, we may then remember we have some other obligations which prevent us from attending.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a final example, it is said that a common Bedouin, knowing little about the details of religion, was asked, “<strong>How do you know you have a Lord?</strong>” he answered, “<strong>By unfulfilled determination and changes in plans</strong>.” In other words, a person may be fully determined to do something, completely resolved and able to do it. Yet, something totally contradictory to his intentions occurs. Who changed his resolve? He does not think someone made him prefer something over his original decision. Instead, Allah simply did not will it to happen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, a person may plan to do something and sets out to accomplish his plans, but he then finds within himself some reason not to carry out his plans. It may be something physically preventing him or simply a change of mind; he decides to do something else instead. All of this is from Allah (عزّ وجل).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">The Explanation of Verse 1 of Sooratul Faatiha</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">(<span style="color:#008000;">al-Ḥamdu lillāhi Rabbil-‘Ālamīn</span>)<br />
<strong>All praise and thanks are for Allah, the lord of all creations.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>&#8220;All praise and thanks&#8221; (al-Ḥamd):</strong></span> This word الْحَمْدُ (<strong>al-Ḥamd</strong>) is used only to describe someone, out of love and honor, with complete perfection of self, attributes, and actions. So, Allah is perfect in his self, his attributes, and his actions. This praising, however, must be with a condition, it must be made with love and honor. The people of knowledge say that simply describing someone with perfection yet not out of real love and honor for the praised one is not called حَمْدُ (Ḥamd). Rather, in that case it would only be called مَدْح (<strong>Madḥ</strong>) (a lesser degree of praise or admiration). Therefore, this (second) type of praising occurs often from people while they may not really love the one they are praising. Often, they only want to gain something from them. For example, some poets stand before their government leaders and recite poetry of amazing praiseworthy descriptions of them yet void of any real love for them. The poets’ love is for the wealth they are given or they do this out of fear of the leaders. On the contrary, our praise for our lord is a form of praise out of love and honor.<strong> So, &#8220;All praise and thanks&#8221; is to praise the one described with total perfection out of love and honor for him</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ال (al-) in الْحَمْدُ (al-Ḥamd) is inclusive, meaning that it includes all forms of praise and thanks.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;are for Allah&#8221; (lillāhi):</span> </strong>The لِ (li) is to show possession and a sense of deserving. The name “Allah” is the proper name of our lord ( عزّ وجلّ ) and no one else is given this name; it means the one god that is worshipped out of love and honor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;the lord&#8221; (Rabb):</span></strong> The word “lord” here includes three main descriptions: the creator, the owner, and the controller of all affairs. So, he is the creator of all that exists, the owner of all that exists, and the controller of everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;of all creations&#8221; (al-‘Ālamīn):</span> </strong>As for the word “‘Ālamīn”, the scholars say it refers to anything and everything other than Allah. Everything else besides Allah is described with this word because the very existence of everything is a sign or indication (in Arabic: Ālam) that they have a creator (سبحانه وتعالى) In every form of creation there is a sign indicating the existence of its creator, his capability, wisdom, mercy, power, and the rest of his attributes of lordship.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Points of Benefit of al-Fātiḥah, Verse 1:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. One of the beneficial points we gain from this verse is the affirmation of praise of perfection to Allah ( عزّ وجلّ ). This is shown by the “al-” in the word “al-Ḥamd” because this definite article in Arabic grammar is inclusive to include all forms or praise and gratitude.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. It also shows that Allah alone deserves all forms of praise and gratitude. For this reason, the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) used to say whenever something happened he was happy with:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">الحَمْدُ للهِ الَّذِي بِنِعْمَتِهِ تُتِمُّ الصَّالِحَات</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>All praise and thanks are for Allah by whose favor righteous deeds are fulfilled.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he would say when if something did not please him:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">الحَمْدُ للهِ عَلَى كُلِّ حَالٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>All praise and thanks are for Allah in all situations</strong>.[<span style="color:#ff0000;">18</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Another point of benefit from the verse is the description of Allah with his sole right to worship first before describing him with his lordship. This is either indicated because the name “Allah” is his proper name, specific to him and the source of all the rest of His names; or it is due to the fact that the people the messengers were sent to used to only deny Allah’s sole right to worship. Most of the people did not deny Allah’s lordship (that he is the creator, owner, and controller of everything).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. This verse also proves Allah’s complete lordship over all of the creations due to his statement: &#8220;<strong>The lord of all creation</strong>s.&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">18</span>] Recorded by Ibn Mājah (no. 3803) and al-Ḥākim in his “Mustadrak” (1/449) and he said, “This ḥadīth has an authentic chain of narrators.” adh-Dhahabī agreed with him. The famous ḥadīth scholar, al-Albānī, said it is “ḥasan” in “Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan Ibn Mājah” (no. 3066).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>Ibn Rajab al-Ḥanbalī’s book, “Jāmi’ al-‘Ulūm wal-Ḥikam,” is an explanation of the forty-two famous ḥadīth collected by Imām an-Nawawī. The part of the  ḥadīth explained in this article is ḥadīth number twenty-four of that book.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The Explanation of:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا عِبَادِي إِنَّكُمْ لَنْ تَبْلُغُوْا ضُرِّي فَتَضُرُّوْنِي، وَلَنْ تَبْلُغُوْا نَفْعِي فَتَنْفَعُوْنِي</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“<span style="color:#993300;">Oh my servants, you will never be able to harm me, and you will never be able to benefit me</span>.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People are incapable of ever reaching a state in which they could benefit or harm Allah, for Allah is the Self-Sufficient, the Praiseworthy. He neither needs the obedience of his servants, nor does any benefit of such obedience reach him. It is only the servants who benefit from their obedience. Likewise, he is not harmed in any way by their disobedience, but it is they who harm themselves therewith. Allah ( تَعَالَى ) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلا يَحْزُنكَ الَّذِينَ يُسَارِعُونَ فِي الْكُفْرِ إِنَّهُمْ لَن يَضُرُّوا اللَّهَ شَيْئًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">And do not be grieved by those who hasten into disbelief. They will certainly never harm Allah at all.</span>[Sūrah Āli ‘Imrān, 3:176]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يَنقَلِبْ عَلَى عَقِبَيْهِ فَلَن يَضُرَّ اللَّهَ شَيْئًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">And he who turns back on his heels will never harm Allah at all.</span>[Sūrah Āli ‘Imrān, 3:144]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allah ( عَزَّ وَجَلَّ ) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِن تَكْفُرُوا فَإِنَّ لِلَّهِ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الأَرْضِ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَنِيًّا حَمِيدًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">But if you disbelieve, then to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on earth. And ever is Allah free of need, praiseworthy.</span> [Sūrah al-Nisā, 4:131]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he says, quoting the prophet Moses:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَالَ مُوسَى إِن تَكْفُرُوا أَنتُمْ وَمَن فِي الأَرْضِ جَمِيعًا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَغَنِيٌّ حَمِيدٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">And Moses said, “If you should disbelieve, you and whoever is on the earth entirely, indeed, Allah is Free of need, praiseworthy.”</span> [Sūrah Ibrāhīm, 14:8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن كَفَرَ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَنِيٌّ عَنِ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever disbelieves, certainly Allah free of need from all creations.</span>[Sūrah Āli ‘Imrān, 3:97]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَن يَنَالَ اللَّهَ لُحُومُهَا وَلَا دِمَاؤُهَا وَلَٰكِن يَنَالُهُ التَّقْوَىٰ مِنكُمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">Neither their meat, nor their blood (e.g., of animals slaughtered for charity) reaches Allah; but what reaches him is piety from you</span>.[Sūrah al-Ḥajj, 22:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah ( تَعَالَى ) loves his servants to remain conscious of him and obey him, just as he dislikes them to disobey him. For this reason, Allah is happier with people’s repentance than the happiness felt by a person who, having lost his riding animal in a vast desert upon which are his food and drink, searches desperately for his mount to the point of exhaustion and finally, giving up all hope of ever finding it, gives in to certain despair that his life is as an end, and he abandons himself to death. As he succumbs to his exhaustion and sleeps, he later wakes up to find his riding animal standing right before him. This is one of the highest levels of happiness imaginable among creation.[<span style="color:#ff0000;">51</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah is even happier than such a person despite the fact that he is in no way in need of his servants’ obedience or their repentance. Rather, he returns the benefit thereof back to them out his generosity and kindness toward his servants and his love for their well-being and his desire to prevent harm from reaching them. And in return, he loves for his servants to know him, love him, fear him, remain constantly aware of him, and to obey him and exert effort in getting closer to him. He loves for them to know that no one else can forgive their sins and that he is fully capable of showing forgiveness for the sins of his servants.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration of this ḥadīth from ‘Abdul Raḥmān Ibn Ghanam from Abū Dharr, it is reported that Allah said, “<strong>Whoever among you knows that I am capable of showing forgiveness and were he to ask for my forgiveness, I would forgive him and would not mind at all</strong>.”</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation of:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا عِبَادِي لَو أَنَّ أَوَّلَكُمْ وآخِرَكُمْ وَإِنْسَكُمْ وَجِنَّكُمْ كَانُوْا عَلَى أَتْقَى قَلْبِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ مِنْكُمْ مَا زَادَ ذَلِكَ فِي مُلْكِي شَيْئًا، يَا عِبَادِي لَو أَنَّ أَوَّلَكُمْ وآخِرَكُمْ وَإِنْسَكُمْ وَجِنَّكُمْ كَانُوْا عَلَى أَفْجَرِ قَلْبِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ مِنْكُمْ مَا نَقَصَ ذَلِكَ مِنْ مُلْكِي شَيْئًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“Oh my servants, if the first of you and the last of you, the people and jinn among you, were all to have hearts as righteous as the most righteous man among you, that would not increase my kingdom in anything. Oh my servants, if the first of you and the last of you, the people and jinn among you, were to have hearts as wicked as the most wicked man among you, that would not decrease my kingdom in anything.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This shows that the kingdom of Allah will not increase in anything even if all creatures were as pious and had hearts as the most righteous person among them. Similarly, his kingdom will never decrease by the sins of sinners even if all the jinn and humans were to be as cruel and evil, having hearts as evil as the most wicked person among them. Allah ( سُبْحَانَهُ ) is self-sufficient, having no need whatsoever of anyone else. There is absolute perfection in his self, his characteristics, and in his actions. His dominion and authority is also perfect with no weakness or flaws to diminish it in any way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people believe that the creations brought about by Allah – those present now – are the most perfect forms than had Allah created them in any other way. And the evil we witness among creation is a conditional type of evil dependent on some things within creation; it is not an absolute evil existing in creation such that its nonexistence would be better than its current existence under all circumstances. Rather, the fact that such aspects of evil are present is actually better than if they were not. They say that such an understanding is the meaning of Allah’s statement:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">بِيَدِكَ الْخَيْرُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">In your hand is all good.</span> [Sūrah Āli ‘Imrān, 3:26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is the meaning of the prophet’s ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ ) statement:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">الشَّرُّ لَيْسَ إِلَيْكَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">Evil is not to be attributed to you.</span> [Muslim (no. 771)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Absolute evil – that which the absent thereof would be better than its presence – is not present in your dominion. This kind of absolute evil is not to be found in Allah’s kingdom because Allah ( تَعَالَى ) brings about his creation and what it requires of wisdom and justice. Sometimes he distinguishes particular people (perhaps in this life or the next) with favors which he does not give others out of his justice and what that necessitates of complete wisdom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet in such an understanding there is an issue which contradicts the point being made in the ḥadīth in that were all creations to have the best characteristics of piety and righteousness, that would not increase and improve his dominion at all. And were all the creations to have wicked characteristics that would lower the status and manner in which they were initially created, that would still not decrease the dominion of Allah in any way. [In other words, perhaps it is possible to become better or worse than one’s initial creation due to belief or disbelief in Allah, obedience or disobedience, etc.] And this (the fact that people have the choice to become better or worse) shows that Allah’s dominion and kingdom are still perfect in every way; it can neither be improved, nor perfected or completed even by obedience just as it cannot be decreased by disobedience. Nothing at all affects its perfection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These statement (of the ḥadīth) mentioning the heart also indicate that the source of righteousness and wickedness is the heart. When the heart is pious and conscious of Allah, the (actions of the) limbs will be righteous, and when the heart is evil, the limbs will be likewise.[<span style="color:#ff0000;">54</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of this, the prophet (صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">التَّقْوَى هَا هُنَا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">Righteousness is right here.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he pointed to his chest.[Muslim (no. 2564)]</p>
<hr />
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">51</span>] This comparison is taken from a <em>ḥadīth</em> in which the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَلَّهُ أَشَدُّ فَرَحًا بِتَوْبَةِ عَبْدِهِ حِينَ يَتُوبُ إِلَيْهِ مِنْ أَحَدِكُمْ كَانَ عَلَى رَاحِلَتِهِ بِأَرْضِ فَلاةٍ فَانْفَلَتَتْ مِنْهُ وَعَلَيْهَا طَعَامُهُ </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَشَرَابُهُ، فَأَيِسَ مِنْهَا، فَأَتَى شَجَرَةً فَاضْطَجَعَ فِي ظِلِّهَا قَدْ أَيِسَ مِنْ رَاحِلَتِهِ فَبَيْنَا هُوَ كَذَلِكَ إِذَا هُوَ بِهَا قَائِمَةً عِنْدَهُ فَأَخَذَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">بِخِطَامِهَا ثُمَّ قَالَ مِنْ شِدَّةِ الْفَرَحِ: اللَّهُمَّ أَنْتَ عَبْدِي وَأَنَا رَبُّكَ! أَخْطَأَ مِنْ شِدَّةِ الْفَرَحِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Allah is happier with the repentance of his servant when he repents to him than if one of you were traveling on his riding animal in a vast desert but it escapes while carrying his food and drink. After giving up all hope of catching it, the man then reclines in the shade of a tree, having despaired of finding his mount. While in such a state, he suddenly finds it standing right next to him so he takes its reins and cries out from sheer joy, “Oh Allah, you are my servant and I am your lord!” He makes such a mistake only from extreme happiness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Recorded by Muslim (no. 4939) and al-Bukāhrī” (no. 5863).]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">54</span>] This point has been reported in a <em>ḥadīth </em>in al-Bukāhrī (no. 52) and Muslim (no. 1599) in which the prophet ( صلّى الله<br />
عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَلا وَإنَّ فِي الْجَسَدِ مُضْغَةً إذَا صَلَحَتْ صَلَحَ الْجَسَدُ كُلُّهُ ، وَإِذَا فَسَدَتْ فَسَدَ الْجَسَدُ كُلُّهُ ، ألا وَهِيَ القَلْبُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">There is within the body an organ, if it is pure the entire body will be purified, and if it is corrupt, the entire body will be corrupted. It is certainly the heart.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Fifteenth Event</strong></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Believers See Their Lord</strong></span></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ نَّاضِرَةٌ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهَا نَاظِرَةٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Some) faces that day will be radiant, looking at their Lord</span>. [Sūrah al-Qiyāmah, 75:22-23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To explain the verse, &#8220;<strong>faces that day</strong>&#8221; means on the last day, the Day of Resurrection. &#8220;<strong>radiant</strong>&#8221; here includes beauty because the word used in the verse comes from the Arabic word نَضَارَة (naḍārah) which means beauty. This meaning is also indicated in the statement of Allah (in which a similar form of the same word is used):</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَوَقَاهُمُ اللَّهُ شَرَّ ذَٰلِكَ الْيَوْمِ وَلَقَّاهُمْ نَضْرَةً وَسُرُورًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">So Allah will protect them from the evil of that day and give them radiance and happiness.</span> [Sūrah al-Insān, 76:11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In other words: beauty in their faces and happiness in their hearts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for &#8220;<strong>looking at their Lord</strong>&#8220;, it is real sight which occurs from the faces and by the eyes. This is different from insight that may occur within the heart (similar to the English usage, “I will look into it.”) which means thinking about or considering something. Here, however, the looking occurs from the faces and is directed toward the Lord (عزّ وجلّ) just as is explicitly indicated by &#8220;<strong>at their Lord</strong>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This noble verse means that these radiant, beautiful faces will be looking directly at their Lord (عزّ وجلّ) and, consequently, will increase in beauty. Look at how these faces were prepared, made ready to look at Allah (عزّ وجلّ) – they will have been made bright and beautiful in preparation to look upon the face of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse is a clear proof that Allah will actually be seen with actual eyes and this is the position of mainstream Muslims who follow the Sunnah (<em>Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamā’ah</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They have proven this with the same verses mentioned herein and they also learn this from the numerous statements of the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) transmitted to the companions and to their followers and so on. So these texts are explicitly clear as evidence confirming this (the believers seeing Allah in the hereafter) because they are within the book of Allah (تعالى) and the Sunnah of his messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) and they are reported by many different chains of narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So mainstream Muslims who follow the Sunnah hold the belief that the looking, the sight mentioned here, is real. It does not mean “perception” or “complete awareness” because Allah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">لَّا تُدْرِكُهُ الْأَبْصَارُ وَهُوَ يُدْرِكُ الْأَبْصَارَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Vision does not perceive him. </span>[Sūrah al-An’ām, 6:103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as knowing with one’s heart does not necessarily equate to perceiving his true reality. Allah (تعالى) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِهِ عِلْمًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">But they do not encompass him with knowledge. </span>[Sūrah ṬāHā, 20:110]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We know our Lord with our hearts yet we still do not know exactly how he is. Similarly, on the Day of Resurrection we will see our Lord with our own eyes, yet our sight will still not completely perceive him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second verse indicating that believers will see their Lord is the statement of Allah:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">عَلَى الْأَرَائِكِ يَنظُرُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">On thrones, looking. </span>[Sūrah al-Muṭaffifīn, 83:23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah did not mention in this verse specifically what they are looking at so it is general, including anything that is pleasing to look at. The greatest and most pleasing sight is to look upon Allah (تعالى) as he says in the very next verse:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">تَعْرِفُ فِي وُجُوهِهِمْ نَضْرَةَ النَّعِيمِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">You will recognize in their faces the radiance of pleasure.</span> [Sūrah al-Muṭaffifīn, 83:24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the context of the verse is similar to the first one, &#8220;faces that day will be radiant, looking at their Lord&#8221; and they will be looking at everything that pleases them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third verse regarding the believers looking at Allah is:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لِّلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُوا الْحُسْنَىٰ وَزِيَادَةٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">For those who have done good is the best (reward) and even more.</span> [Sūrah Yūnus, 10:26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for &#8220;the best&#8221;, it is Paradise and &#8220;even more&#8221; is the believers looking at the face of Allah. This is how the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) explained this verse as is confirmed in the ḥadīth recorded by Muslim and others:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا دَخَلَ أَهْلُ الْجَنَّةِ الْجَنَّةَ ، قَالَ : يَقُولُ اللَّهُ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى : تُرِيدُونَ شَيْئًا أَزِيدُكُمْ.؟ </span><span style="color:#000000;">فَيَقُولُونَ : أَلَمْ تُبَيِّضْ وُجُوهَنَا ؟ أَلَمْ تُدْخِلْنَا الْجَنَّةَ وَتُنَجِّنَا مِنْ النَّارِ ؟ قَالَ : فَيَكْشِفُ</span><span style="color:#000000;"> الْحِجَابَ فَمَا أُعْطُوا شَيْئًا أَحَبَّ إِلَيْهِمْ مِنْ النَّظَرِ إِلَى رَبِّهِمْ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">When the people of Paradise have entered Paradise, Allah (تبارك وتعالى) will ask, “Do you want me to give you something more?” They will say, “Have you not brightened our faces? Have you not already admitted us into Paradise and saved us from the fire?” He will then remove the covering and they will not have been given anything more beloved to them than looking at their Lord (عزّ وجلّ)</span> [Recorded by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After saying that, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) then recited the verse, &#8220;For those who have done good is the best (reward) and even more.&#8221; So this verse is evidence of seeing Allah as the messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) has explained, and no doubt, he is the most knowledgeable person of the Quran’s meanings. He explained that it means looking at the face of Allah and this is the &#8220;even more&#8221; reward the believers will be given in addition to the previous delights of Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, this blessing is not the same types of blessing as are well-known of Paradise. Many of the delights of Paradise are physical in nature: rivers to enjoy, physical rewards, fruits, pure spouses, etc. Then the blessings and pleasures of the heart follow. But looking at Allah is a direct delight pleasing to the heart. The people of Paradise will have never seen anything more enjoyable or satisfying than that. We ask Allah to make us those who see him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This blessing is in no way comparable to anything else, not the fruits of Paradise, its rivers, or anything else. Because of this, Allah said &#8220;For those who have done good is the best (reward) and even more.&#8221; because it is in addition to even the best rewards of Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth verse is:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَهُم مَّا يَشَاءُونَ فِيهَا وَلَدَيْنَا مَزِيدٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">There they will have all that they desire and with us is even more.</span> [Sūrah Qāf, 50:35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many scholars have explained &#8220;but with us is even more&#8221; just how the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) explained it – that it is looking at the face of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So those are the four verses the author (Ibn Taymiyyah) mentions as proof of the believers seeing Allah. There is also a fifth verse from which Imam al-Shāfi’ī deduced that the believers will see Allah. It is the statement of Allah (تعالى) about the wicked sinners:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">كَلَّا إِنَّهُمْ عَن رَّبِّهِمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ لَّمَحْجُوبُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">No! Surely, they will be veiled from (seeing) their Lord that day.</span> [Sūrah al-Muṭaffifīn, 83:15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point he makes from the verse is that since such people will be veiled from Allah due to his anger with them, then it can be understood that those with whom he is pleased will not be veiled. So if the people who gain his anger are veiled from Allah then the people who gain his pleasure will see Him (عزّ وجلّ)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This deduction of Imam al-Shāfi’ī is definitely very strong because if everyone was going to be veiled, prevented from seeing their Lord, then there would have been no reason to specifically mention only the wicked people in the verse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also believe that seeing Allah in this life is impossible. This is because the current nature and condition of humans is one that cannot bear looking at Allah (عزّ وجلّ). How could it when the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) told us about his Lord:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">حِجَابُهُ النُّورُ ، لَوْ كَشَفَهُ لأَحْرَقَتْ سُبُحَاتُ وَجْهِهِ مَا انْتَهَى إِلَيْهِ بَصَرُهُ مِنْ خَلْقِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">His veil is light. If he were to remove it, the splendor of his face would burn his creation, consuming it as far as his sight reaches.</span>[Recorded by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for seeing Allah in the hereafter, it is certainly possible because people that day will be in a different world. Their nature and condition will be different than they are in this life. And this is known from all the texts of the Quran and Sunnah that tell about how people will be, what they will experience during the events of the resurrection and of their final abode in either the home of bliss or Hell.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">About the believers seeing their Lord, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) was once with his companions on a night when the full moon was out. He looked up at the moon and said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّكُمْ سَتَرَوْنَ رَبَّكُمْ كَمَا تَرَوْنَ هَذَا الْقَمَرَ ، لا تُضَامُونَ فِي رُؤْيَتِهِ ، فَإِنْ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ أَنْ  لا تُغْلَبُوا عَلَى صَلاةٍ قَبْلَ طُلُوعِ الشَّمْسِ وَصَلاةٍ قَبْلَ غُرُوبِ الشَّمْسِ فَافْعَلُوا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">You will certainly see your Lord just as you can see this moon; you will have no trouble in seeing him. So if you can avoid missing a prayer before the sun rises and a prayer before it sets, then do so.</span> [Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The statement, “You will certainly see your Lord” is addressed to the believers. As for “just as you can see this moon,” this is a real, actual seeing because when we see the moon, it is actual sight with our eyes. The comparison here is between the sight of the moon and the sight of Allah, and it is not a comparison between the moon and Allah because there is nothing like or comparable to Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) would sometimes try to bring the meaning of what he is talking about closer to people by mentioning what they understand of perceptible things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, Abū Razīn al-‘Uqaylī, a companion of the messenger, once asked him, “Messenger of Allah, will each one of us see his Lord, individually on the Day of Resurrection? And what is a sign similar to that among his creation?” He ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم .) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَبَا رَزِينٍ ، أَلَيْسَ كُلُّكُمْ يَرَى الْقَمَرَ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ مُخْلِيًا بِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Abū Razīn, do you not each individually see the full moon?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abū Razīn answered, “Yes.” The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) then told him:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَاللَّهُ أَعْظَمُ ، فَإِنَّمَا هُوَ خَلْقٌ مِنْ خَلْقِ اللَّهِ ، فَاللَّهُ أَجَلُّ وَأَعْظَمُ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Allah is even greater. That (the moon) is only a single creation from Allah’s creation, but Allah is even more exalted and greater.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[Recorded by Imām Aḥmad (4/11) and Abū Dāwūd (no. 4731). al-Albānī said it is authentic in “Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan Abī Dāwūd” (3957)</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for “<strong>you will have no trouble in seeing him</strong>” in the earlier ḥadīth, different wordings have come in similar narrations, but the point is that no one will prevent another from seeing Allah due to crowding or anything else. Each person will see him ( (سبحانه وتعالى while he is in the utmost state of tranquility and peace.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for “<strong>So if you can avoid missing a prayer before the sun rises and a prayer before it sets, then do so</strong>,” the prayer before sunrise is Fajr, the morning prayer, and before sunset is ‘Aṣr, the afternoon prayer. ‘Aṣr is even better than Fajr because it is the middle prayer which Allah has specifically told us to safeguard after mentioning prayers in general.[167] But Fajr is better than ‘Aṣr from a different perspective in that it is the prayer that is specifically witnessed by the angels as Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَقِمِ الصَّلَاةَ لِدُلُوكِ الشَّمْسِ إِلَىٰ غَسَقِ اللَّيْلِ وَقُرْآنَ الْفَجْرِ ۖ إِنَّ قُرْآنَ الْفَجْرِ كَانَ مَشْهُودًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Keep up prayer from the declining of the sun till the darkness of night and the morning recitation; surely the morning recitation is witnessed</span>. [Sūrah al-Isrā, 17:78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There also occurs in an authentic ḥadīth:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَنْ صَلَّى الْبَرْدَيْنِ دَخَلَ الْجَنَّةَ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Whoever prayers the two cool ones will enter Paradise.</span>[Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The two cool prayers are Fajr and ‘Aṣr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What practical benefit do we gain from knowing these verses (and ḥadīth) about the believers seeing their Lord in Paradise? There is no greater effect on a person’s behavioral approach and direction in life than this. When anyone realizes that his main objective, the height of his reward is to look upon the face of his Lord, this life and everything in it then becomes almost worthless to him in comparison. Nothing else would compare or be as precious to him as reaching that moment of seeing Allah (عزّ وجلّ). It is the goal of every seeker; it is the final achievement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you know that you will one day see your Lord with your own eyes, then by Allah this life would not mean a thing to you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everything of this world is nothing in comparison because the sight of Allah’s face is the prize for which the competitors compete, the goal to which the racers race, and it is the greatest triumph of everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if you know this, will you strive to reach it or not?</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[167] This occurs in Sūrah al-Baqarah, 2:238:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">حَافِظُوا عَلَى الصَّلَوَاتِ وَالصَّلَاةِ الْوُسْطَىٰ وَقُومُوا لِلَّهِ قَانِتِينَ</span></h2>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Our Lord&#8217;s Descent</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said in an authentic ḥadīth:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَنْزِلُ رَبُّنَا تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى كُلَّ لَيْلَةٍ إِلَى السَّمَاءِ الدُّنْيَا حِينَ يَبْقَى ثُلُثُ اللَّيْلِ </span><span style="color:#000000;">الآخِرُ ، يَقُولُ : مَنْ يَدْعُونِي فَأَسْتَجِيبَ لَهُ ؟ مَنْ يَسْأَلُنِي فَأُعْطِيَهُ ؟ مَنْ يَسْتَغْفِرُنِي </span><span style="color:#000000;">؟ فَأَغْفِرَ لَهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Our Lord, the blessed and exalted, descends every night to the sky of this world when the last third of the night remains. He asks, “Who is calling on me so I can answer him? Who is asking me (for anything) so I can give (it to) him? Who is asking for my forgiveness so I can forgive him?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Recorded by al-Bukhārī (no. 1145) and Muslim (no. 758)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This ḥadīth is a proof confirming the descent of Allah to the lowest heaven, the sky of this world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people of knowledge said this ḥadīth has come with many different chains of narration, and the scholars have always agreed that it is one of the famous ḥadīth often mentioned by the scholars of the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) says,  &#8220;<strong>Our Lord descends every night to the sky of this world</strong>.&#8221; Allah’s descent is real and actual because, as we have mentioned before, anything mentioned with a pronoun that refers back to Allah, it must be attributed to him in a real, actual manner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we should believe in it and accept it as truth, saying just as the ḥadīth says, “<strong>Our Lord descends to the sky of this world</strong>,” to the lowest heaven closest to the earth. There are seven heavens, and Allah (عزّ وجلّ) descends at this time during the night to be near his worshippers just as he does during the afternoon on the Day of ‘Arafah (during the pilgrimage), praising and boasting to the angels about his worshippers. [<span style="color:#ff0000;">41</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for &#8220;<strong>every night</strong>&#8221; it is general to include every single night of the year. &#8220;<strong>when the last third of the night remains</strong>&#8220;. In Islamic legislation, the night begins at sunset and this is unanimously agreed upon. The difference (among scholars) however comes with regards to when the night ends. Does it end with the appearance of first light or the actual rising of the sun? Apparently, the night, according to legislation, ends with the appearance of first light, and the common, “astral” night ends with sunrise. Allah asks, &#8221; “Who is calling on me…”. This is a question yet really intended as an encouragement and motivation rather than expecting an actual answer. It is like his statement (in the Qur&#8217;an):</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">هَلْ أَدُلُّكُمْ عَلَى تِجَارَةٍ تُنجِيكُم مِّنْ عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Shall I guide you to a transaction that will save you from a painful punishment?</span> [Sūrah al-Ṣaf, 61:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>…calling on me…</strong>” saying, “Oh Lord…”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>…so I can answer him?</strong>” This is the result and reward for doing the first part – calling on Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> “<strong>Who is asking me (for anything) so I can give (it to) him?</strong>” such as saying, “I ask You for Paradise,” or similar things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>Who is asking for my forgiveness…</strong>” saying, “Oh Allah, forgive me,” or “I seek your forgiveness, Allah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>…so I can forgive him?</strong>” Forgiveness means to conceal one’s sins and overlook them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With this, it should be clear to every person who reads this ḥadīth that what is meant by “<strong>descends</strong>” here is that Allah Himself descends. We do not even need to say He descends “<strong>personally</strong>” because as long as the verb is associated with Him, then He himself does it. Still, some scholars did say, “He personally descends.” They resorted to saying that, compelled to adding “personally” only because there are those people who twist the meaning of ḥadīth, claiming that what really descends is the decision and decree of Allah. Others say it is Allah’s mercy that descends, and even others say it is one of his angels that descends.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of these are incorrect. For one thing, Allah’s decision and decree are constantly descending, and not only during the last third of night as he ( تعالى ) says generally:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يُدَبِّرُ الأَمْرَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ إِلَى الأَرْضِ ثُمَّ يَعْرُجُ إِلَيْهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">He arranges each matter from the heaven to the earth then it will ascend to him</span>.[Sūrah al-Sajdah, 32:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِلَيْهِ يُرْجَعُ الأَمْرُ كُلُّهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And to him the matter will return, all of it</span>.[Sūrah Hūd, 11:123]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for their statement that it is really only the mercy of Allah that descends to the worldly sky when the last third of night remains, Allah is above such deficiencies and insults! Mercy does not descend except at that time?! Allah ( تعالى ) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا بِكُم مِّن نِّعْمَةٍ فَمِنَ اللَّهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And whatever you have of blessing, it is from Allah</span>. [Sūrah al-Naḥl, 16:53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every blessing and favor is from Allah, and they are the results of his mercy; they can be witnessed at all times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We could then ask: What good does it do for us if mercy descends only down to the sky (and no further)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who say it is really only an angel that descends, we ask: Does it make sense that an angel would say, “Who is calling on me so I can answer him? Who is asking me for anything…”?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is clear that these claims are distorted meanings, they are incorrect and proven so by the ḥadīth itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By Allah, such people who claim these things do not know more about Allah than Allah’s messenger, they are certainly not more sincere in advising the servants of Allah than his messenger, and they are not more precise and eloquent in speech than the messenger of Allah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people also ask: How can you say Allah descends? If He does so, then what about His being high above everything? What about His being over the throne? If He descends, this would involve movement and relocation. Also, if He descends, this would be an action that happens and anything that happens must have a cause.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To this we say: This is baseless and pointless arguing. There is no reason not to say that Allah’s descent is real. Do you know what Allah deserves (of characteristics and descriptions) more than the companions of the messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The companions never made any of these false assumptions and conjectures. Instead they listened, they believed, they accepted, and they trusted it as absolute truth. Yet now, you people come and challenge the meanings, arguing for the sake of falsehood, asking, “How? Why?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We say Allah descends, and we do not delve into asking, “What about his throne? Does this mean he leaves it or not?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his being above, we say he descends and yet he is still high above his creation because “descent” here does not necessarily mean that he is surrounded by the lowest heaven to which he descends while the other heavens are above him. Rather, he is not contained within anything of his creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allah actually descends in a real manner while he is actually high above in a real manner, and nothing is similar to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rising over the throne is an action, not a permanent, personal characteristic. We should not, as far as I am concerned, begin asking whether he leaves the throne or not. Instead, we should keep silent about it just as the companions did, may Allah be pleased with them all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the scholars of those who follow the Sunnah take one of three positions regarding the issue of whether Allah leaves his throne during his descent. Some say he leaves the throne, others say he does not leave it, and others say we should remain silent and not delve into the issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah says in his <em>al-Risālah al-‘Arshiyyah</em> that Allah does not leave the throne (during his descent) because the evidence confirming he is on the throne is strong and explicit just as this ḥadīth is also a strong, explicit proof of his descent. The actions and characteristics of Allah (عزّ وجلّ) are not to be measured by those of creation. So we should leave the texts of his being on the throne confirmed as they are just as we leave the text of his descent confirmed as it is. We say he is established on his throne and yet he still descends to the sky of this world; Allah alone knows the “how” of it. Our minds are too deficient and incomplete to know everything about Allah, the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second position is that Allah leaves the throne during his descent and the third position is to remain silent – in other words, not to say whether he does or does not leave his throne.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people more recently bring up yet another point of confusion. <strong>Since the earth is round and revolves around the sun, they ask how Allah can descend during the last third of the night when the last third is a constant time</strong>. For example, when the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia leaves this time, Europe and surrounding countries enter it. So is Allah constantly and forever descending?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In reply, we say: First and foremost, you should simply believe and accept that Allah descends during this specific time. If you do believe in it, then there is nothing else required from you. Do not go into asking, “How?” Instead, accept that when the last third of night remains in Saudi Arabia, then Allah descends, and when it remains in America, Allah also descends. And His descent finishes when the light of morning appears in any place, respective to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To conclude, our position is that we believe and accept everything that has come to us from Allah’s messenger, Muhammad ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) in that Allah comes down to the sky of this world, the lowest heaven, when the last third of night remains and he asks, “Who is calling on me so I can answer him? Who is asking me (for anything) so I can give (it to) him? Who is asking for my forgiveness so I can forgive him?”</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Beneficial Points We Learn from This Ḥadīth</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>This amazing ḥadīth:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Confirms that Allah is high above creation based on the words, &#8220;<strong>Our Lord descends</strong>.&#8221;</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Confirms that Allah does actions by his choice and will—these are known as “action” characteristics (see footnote no. 7 of the <a href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2012/06/22/in-the-company-of-allaah-confirming-that-allaah-is-with-his-creation-shaykh-ibn-al-uthaymeen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">main article</a>)—based on the statement, &#8220;<strong>Our Lord descends…when the last third of the night remains.</strong>.&#8221;</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Confirms that Allah speaks based on the statement, &#8220;<strong>He asks…</strong>&#8220;</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Confirms Allah’s kindness and generosity based on his questions, <strong>“Who is calling on me…? Who is asking me…? Who is asking for my forgiveness…?”</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People should take advantage of this part of the night, asking for whatever they need from Allah, calling upon him, and asking his forgiveness as he asks, “Who is calling on me…? Who is asking me…? Who is asking for my forgiveness…?” And again, the word “Who” here is presented in the form of a question but is actually intended to motivate rather than ask.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we should take advantage of this chance because nothing that has passed of your life is in your favor except the times you spent in obedience to Allah. Perhaps more days may pass you by, but when death comes it will be as if you were only born that minute. At that time, everything of one’s past life will mean nothing to him.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">41</span>] The ḥadīth about this is recorded by Muslim (no. 1348). The prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَا مِنْ يَوْمٍ أَكْثَرَ مِنْ أَنْ يُعْتِقَ اللَّهُ فِيهِ عَبْدًا مِنْ النَّارِ مِنْ يَوْمِ عَرَفَةَ وَإِنَّهُ لَيَدْنُو ثُمَّ يُبَاهِي بِهِمْ الْمَلائِكَةَ ، فَيَقُولُ :  مَا </span><span style="color:#000000;"> أَرَادَ هَؤُلاءِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">There is no day on which Allah frees more servants from the fire than the Day of ‘Arafah. He comes near (them) and praises and boasts about them to the angels, saying, “What do these want?” (or “Anything they want!”)</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">For certain, contemplating over these signs, studying the diverse and amazing creations of Allaah such as the sky, the earth, the sun, the moon, planets and stars, night and day, mountains and trees, rivers and oceans and the many other creations of Allaah that cannot be enumerated, is without doubt one of the greatest causes for eemaan and the most beneficial reasons behind its fortification.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Contemplate the creation of the sky, look back up at it time after time. See how it is the greatest sign in its elevation and height, and in its extent and stationeries, whereby it does not climb up like fire or fall descending like a heavy object. It has no pillars and is neither connected from above. Rather, it is held by the might of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Next, contemplate its evenness and levelness, there is no rift, split or fissure within it. It does not have any curvature or crookedness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then consider the color it has been given, which is the best of colors, the most agreeable to one&#8217;s sight and that which strengthens it the most.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ponder on the creation of the earth and at its construction. You will notice that it is one of the greatest signs of its Maker and Originator. Allaah created it as a resting place and a bed. He made it subservient to His slaves. Allaah placed within it their livelihood and nourishment. He laid down pathways so that they may wander about the land in search for their needs and disposals. He established the earth firmly with mountains, making them pegs, protecting the earth from shaking along with its inhabitants and He expanded its sides and spread it out.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He extended the earth, spread it out and enlarged it from all its sides. He made it a receptacle for the living, containing them from above as long as they are alive and He made it a receptacle for the dead, containing them from underneath when they die. Thus, its outer is a homeland for the living and its inner is a homeland for the dead.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereafter look at it when it is dead, barren and humbled. When Allaah sends down the rains upon it, it stirs and grows. Thus, it rises and turns green and produces every type of lovely growth. It brings forth wondrous vegetation in appearance and sensation, which are delightful to the onlookers and amicable to the feasters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Next, consider how Allaah has perfected the sides of the earth with mountains that are unshakeable, towering, stern and solid. Consider how He has erected them so perfectly. How he elevated them and made them the most solid parts of the earth, so that they would not dwindle away with the stretch of years and continual succession of rain and wind. Rather, He perfected its creation, fortified its foundation and deposited within them such benefits, metals, minerals and springs, of which He desired.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now ponder on this delicate and fine air that is held captive between the sky and earth. It is sensed through feeling when blown; its substance is felt and its form cannot be seen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It runs between the sky and earth and the birds circle and fly in it, swimming with the aid of their wings just as the fish of the sea swim in water. Its sides and ripples collide against each other when in commotion just as the waves of the ocean clash.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consider how Allaah forms with this wind, clouds that are held between the sky and earth. The wind excites the clouds causing them to rise and become dense, Allaah then combines them together and merges them. The winds then impregnate it; these winds are those that Allaah named <em>lawaaqih</em>, (i.e., impregnators [Refer to <em>Soorah al-Hijr</em> (15):22]). Allaah then drives it by the wind to the land in need of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When it rises and ascends above the land, its water falls upon it. Allaah dispatches the winds whilst the clouds are in the atmosphere; the winds scatter and separate the clouds so that they do not harm or destroy something if the water were to descend upon it in its entirety. Once the land takes its fill and need, the clouds leave off the land and disperse. Thus, these clouds water the earth and are carried by the winds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Next, consider these oceans surrounding the land regions, which are gulfs of one great sea of water surrounding the whole earth such that even the lands, mountains and cities that are visible, are in relation to the water, like a small island in a massive ocean. The rest of the earth is submerged in water. If the Lord did not hold it with His power and will and if He did not hold back the water, it would overflow onto the lands and rise above it all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Contemplate on the night and day; they are amongst the most amazing signs of Allaah. See how He made the night for resting and as a covering. It coats the world causing the cessation of activities. Animals retire to their dwellings and the birds to their nests. The souls relax and take rest from the pains of their labor and tiredness until when the souls are reposed and have taken sleep and now look forward to their livelihood and its disposal, the Splitter of the morning (Allaah) brings forward the day, His army giving glad tidings of the morning. It vanquishes that darkness and tears it asunder, unveiling the darkness from the world, thereafter, the inhabitants are able to see. The animals then circulate about the land and proceed to manage their livelihood and welfare and the birds depart from their nests.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What a returning and arising, which is so indicative of the capability of Allaah towards the major return!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ponder on the condition of the sun and moon when rising and setting to establish the state of night and day. If it were not for the rising of the sun and moon, the affair of this world would become inoperative. How would the people attend to their livelihood and dispose of their affairs whilst the world upon them is dark? How would they take pleasure in their life with the absence of light? So:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>تَبَارَكَ الَّذِي جَعَلَ فِي السَّمَاءِ بُرُوجًا وَجَعَلَ فِيهَا سِرَاجًا وَقَمَرًا مُّنِيرًا وَهُوَ الَّذِي جَعَلَ اللَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَارَ خِلْفَةً لِّمَنْ أَرَادَ أَن يَذَّكَّرَ أَوْ أَرَادَ شُكُورًا</strong> </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Blessed be He who has placed in the heaven huge stars and has placed therein a great lamp (i.e., the sun) and a moon giving light. He is the one who placed the night and day in succession, for such who desires to remember or desires to show his gratitude.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah al-Furqaan (25):61-62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Examine the creation of the animals, with all their diverse characteristics, species, forms, usefulness, colors and endowed marvels. Some of them walk upon their bellies, some on two legs and some on four. Some of them have feet as weapons in the form of claws; some have beaks as weapons, like the eagle, vulture and the crow. Others have teeth as weapons and yet others have horns as weapons for use in defense of themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reflect and take heed in general from the setting of this world, the formation of its parts and the excellence of its arrangement and order, proving most cogently the perfection of the capability of its Creator and the perfection of His knowledge, wisdom, benevolence and delicateness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you do reflect on the world, you will notice it to be like a house that has been built and prepared with all of its apparatus, interests and all that it is in need of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, the sky is its roof that is hoisted above it. The land is its bed; it is a mat, bedding and an abode for the occupant. The sun and moon are two lamps that shine within it. The stars are lights, an adornment and guide for those who move about along the paths of this house. Gems and minerals are stored within it, like the provisions and storehouses that have been prepared and set; each and every thing of it is for its own specific purpose and use that befits it. All kinds of vegetation have been prepared for the purposes of the house. Varieties of animals have been laid out for its welfare, for mounting; providing milk; nourishment; clothing; enjoyment; employment and keeping guard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, the human being has been declared as the king, being commissioned with all of this. He is the one who rules and disposes by his actions and commands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Within all this, is the greatest sign and strongest proof of the Creator, the All-knowing, the Wise and fully cognizant, who has set proper measure and order for his creation in the finest way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In fact, reflect and take heed in particular, from Allaah&#8217;s creation of yourself, O person.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consider the start, middle and end of your creation. Look with all insight at the beginning of your creation, from a trickle of dirty despised fluid; whereby the Lord of all lords extracted this fluid from between the back-bone and ribs, guided it by His might with the narrowness of its channels and the diversity of its passages up until Allaah brings it to its abode and place of assembly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">See how Allaah united the male and female and placed love between them and how He led them with the chain of desire and love to come together, which is the cause behind the synthesis and formation of a child.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look at how He predestined those two fluids despite the distance apart from each person. He brought them from the depth of veins and organs and gathered them to one place. He prescribed for them a firmly established dwelling. Air cannot get to it to spoil it; cold cannot get to it to harden or congeal it and no accidentals extend to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah then transforms that white saturated trickle into a red clinging-like substance (that resembles a leech), which inclines towards a black color. Allaah then makes it into a chewed lump (of flesh) completely different to the clinging-like substance in its color, essence and form. Allaah then fashions it into bare bones without any clothing, which is contrary to the chewed lump in form, look, proportion, feel and color and so on, the stages of a person&#8217;s creation make a gradual process up until he emerges upon these forms that Allaah has fashioned him with; He originated for him, hearing, sight, a mouth, nose and the rest of the openings. He extended and spread out his legs and arms and separated their ends into fingers and toes and then further split them into phalanxes. He also assembled the inner organs such as the heart, stomach, liver, spleen, lungs, womb, intestines; each one has a proportion and benefit specific to it, so how perfect is, the One Who created (everything) and then proportioned (each thing appropriately) and Who measured and guided, Who said:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَفِي أَنفُسِكُمْ ۚ أَفَلَا تُبْصِرُونَ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;And also in your own selves, will you not then see?&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah adh-Dhaariyaat (51):21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;All of creation, from the atom to the Throne, are connected pathways to acquiring knowledge of Allaah and are profound evidences pointing to His eternality. The Universe, in totality, is made up of tongues uttering the oneness of Allaah. The world, in its entirety, is a book, of which the letters of its particulars are read by the discerning, all according to the level of their insights.&#8221; [See Dhayl Tabaqaat al-Hanaabilah of Ibn Rajab, 1/307. This is a saying of &#8216;Uthmaan Ibn Marzooq al-Qurashee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, reflect on these and other signs, which Allaah has created within the Heavens and earth. Contemplation, close examination and meditation on these signs yield immense benefits in the strengthening and steadfastness of one&#8217;s eemaan, because he apprehends through these signs, the oneness of his King and Creator and His perfection. Consequently, his love, glorification and veneration of Allaah will increase as will his obedience, submission and humbleness before Him. These are amongst the greatest benefits resulting from this reflection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy upon him, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;If you consider what Allaah has invited His servants to reflect on in His Book, it will impart you with knowledge of Allaah, of his oneness, His attributes of perfection and qualities of magnificence such as the extensiveness of His capability and knowledge and the perfection of His wisdom, mercy, benevolence, kindness, compassion, justice, pleasure, anger, reward and punishment. Thus, with this (all), He introduced Himself to His servants and encouraged them to reflect on His signs.&#8221;</strong></span> [Miftaah Daar as-Sa’aadah of Ibn al-Qayyim, page 204]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn as-Sa&#8217;dee, may Allaah have mercy upon him, states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;"> &#8220;&#8230; and one of the causes and incentives for eemaan is reflecting on the universe; on the creation of the heavens and earth and on the diverse types of creation contained within them; to look at the human himself and the attributes he possesses, for this is a strong incentive for eemaan.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">This is because of the greatness of creation found within these present entities, which points towards the might, capability and greatness of their Creator.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">It is also because of the prevalent beauty, order and perfection that baffles the learned, which point to the vastness of Allaah&#8217;s knowledge and the comprehensiveness of His wisdom and it is also because of the assorted benefits and abundant blessings that cannot be counted and are innumerable, which point to the magnitude of Allaah&#8217;s mercy, generosity and benevolence.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">All of this calls to the glorification of its originator and maker, to gratitude of Him, to becoming attached to His remembrance and having sincerity of religion to Him alone; this is the spirit  and secret of eemaan.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[At-Tawdeeh wa al-Bayaan, page 31. See or-Riyaad an-Naadhirah also by Shaykh as-Sa&#8217;dee, pages 238-280]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For this purpose, Allaah, <em><strong>al-Kareem</strong></em>, encourages His servants in His book to contemplate on these signs and indications and He directs them to study and reflect in many places within His Book. This is because of the many advantages for the slaves and the immense returns they attain from it. Allaah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِنَّ فِي خَلْقِ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَاخْتِلَافِ اللَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ وَالْفُلْكِ الَّتِي تَجْرِي فِي الْبَحْرِ بِمَا يَنفَعُ النَّاسَ وَمَا أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مِن مَّاءٍ فَأَحْيَا بِهِ الْأَرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا وَبَثَّ فِيهَا مِن كُلِّ دَابَّةٍ وَتَصْرِيفِ الرِّيَاحِ وَالسَّحَابِ الْمُسَخَّرِ بَيْنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ لَآيَاتٍ لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Verily, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day, and the ships that sail through the sea with that which is of use to mankind, and the water which Allaah sends down from the sky and makes the earth alive therewith after its death, and the moving </b>(living)<b> creatures of all kinds that he has scattered therein, and in the veering of winds and clouds which are held between the sky and the earth, are indeed signs for people of understanding&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah al-Baqarah (2):164]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ أَنْ خَلَقَكُم مِّن تُرَابٍ ثُمَّ إِذَا أَنتُم بَشَرٌ تَنتَشِرُونَ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;And among His signs is that He created you from dust and behold, you are human beings, becoming widespread.&#8221;</b> </span>[Soorah ar-Room (30):20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ خَلْقُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَمَا بَثَّ فِيهِمَا مِن دَابَّةٍ ۚ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ جَمْعِهِمْ إِذَا يَشَاءُ قَدِيرٌ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;And among His signs is the creation of the heavens and earth, and of all the creatures He has dispersed within them. And He is ever-potent over assembling them all if He so desires&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah ash-Shooraa (42):29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>أَفَلَا يَنظُرُونَ إِلَى الْإِبِلِ كَيْفَ خُلِقَتْ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَإِلَى السَّمَاءِ كَيْفَ رُفِعَتْ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَإِلَى الْجِبَالِ كَيْفَ نُصِبَتْ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَإِلَى الْأَرْضِ كَيْفَ سُطِحَتْ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Do they not look at the camels: how they have been created? And at the heaven: how it is raised? And at the mountains: how they have been rooted and firmly fixed? And at the earth: how it has been spread out?&#8221;</b></span>[Soorah al-Ghaashiyah (88):17-20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are other numerous similar <em>aayaat</em> in the Qur&#8217;aan, in which Allaah calls His servants to look at His signs and manifestations of his actions that represent the most supreme evidence of His oneness and singularity and for His might, will and knowledge. It is also evidence of His benevolence, gentleness and generosity. This is the greatest invitation of His servants towards having love of Allaah, thanking Him, glorifying Him, obeying Him and being attached to His remembrance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In conclusion, it becomes evident that study and contemplation of the Universe remains as one of the greatest causes of eemaan and the most beneficial incentives for it.</p>

<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ رَبَّكُمُ اللَّهُ الَّذِي خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ فِي سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ ثُمَّ اسْتَوَىٰ عَلَى الْعَرْشِ يُغْشِي اللَّيْلَ النَّهَارَ يَطْلُبُهُ حَثِيثًا وَالشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ وَالنُّجُومَ مُسَخَّرَاتٍ بِأَمْرِهِ ۗ أَلَا لَهُ الْخَلْقُ وَالْأَمْرُ ۗ تَبَارَكَ اللَّهُ رَبُّ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed your Lord is Allaah, Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then He ascended upon the Throne. He causes the night to cover the day, it follows it swiftly, and the sun and the moon and the stars are subservient to His command. Certainly creation and commandment are His alone. Exalted is Allaah, the Lord of the whole of the creation.</span> [7:54] <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>8</sup></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">8</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><em>Inna</em></strong>”: this is a particle for emphasis and it brings about the accusative case, and it is an introduction for an oath. An oath is to be understood as coming before it, which is taken to be, “By Allaah!”. “<strong><em>Inna Rabbakum</em></strong>”, (indeed your Lord): so this is the complement of the understood oath. “<em>Inna Rabbakum</em>”: meaning, your Creator and the One Who nurtured you with favours.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>… is Allaah</strong>”: not anyone else besides Him, He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then He mentioned the proof for that saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِي خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The One Who created the heavens and the earth</span> </strong>[7:54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the clear proof for the Lordship of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, that He created the heavens and the earth. No-one else created anything from either of them, and no-one helped Him, He the Perfect and Most High upon that. Rather He is alone in creating.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">He created the heavens and the earth</span> </strong>[7:54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Does anyone from the people of shirk or the atheists oppose this and say, “Allaah did not create the heavens and the earth, rather the one who created them was so-and-so”, or, “I created them”, or “Such-and-such idol created them”? Has anyone from the creation said this in previous times or lately, even though this <em>aayah</em> is recited night and day, and no-one can oppose it, and nor will anyone ever be able to oppose it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> فِي سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ &#8211; </span></strong>“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>In six days</strong></span>”: these awe-inspiring and tremendous created things were created by Allaah in six days, and He was able to create them in a single moment, however He created them in six days for a wise purpose which is known to Him, He the Perfect and Most High. And the six days, the first of them was Sunday and the last of them was the day of Friday. So on the day of Friday the creation was completed, and therefore this day became the greatest of the days of the week. And it is the noblest one of the days, and it is the <em>‘Eed</em> of the week and it is the most excellent of the days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallaam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">خير يوم طلعت فيه الشمس يوم الجمعة</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The best day on which the sun has arisen, is the day of Friday”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;"><a style="color:#999999;" href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Muslim and Aboo Daawood and At-Tirmidhee and An-Nasaa’ee from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhu</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because the creation of the creation was completed on it, and on it Aadam was created, and he was entered into paradise and he was sent down from it and on it the Last Hour will be established, all of that will be on the day of Friday, so it is the most excellent of the days, and it was the last of the days of the creation of the heavens and the earth and whatever they contain.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> ثُمَّ اسْتَوَىٰ عَلَى الْعَرْشِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Then He ascended upon the Throne</span> </strong>[7:54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This (i.e. <strong><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ  </span></strong>“<em>thumma</em>”) is a particle which joins and which indicates sequence, meaning that His Ascending upon the Throne came after the creation of the heavens and the earth because it is from the Attributes which are actions which Allaah does whenever He wishes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the meaning of <em>Istawaa’ </em>(He ascended upon) is: He ascended and was High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Al-‘Arsh</em></strong>: it is the ceiling of the created things. And it is in the language: <strong><em>as-Sareer</em> (</strong>a throne), and it is a Throne which has supports and is carried by the Angels and it is the greatest and most tremendous of the created things, and the highest one of the created things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Al-Istiwaa’</em> </strong>(ascending): is an Attribute from the Attributes of Allaah which are actions, as befits His Majesty, He the Perfect and Most High. It is not like the mounting of one created being upon another created object, and He has no need of the Throne since He is the One Who holds and maintains the Throne and other than it:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُمْسِكُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ أَن تَزُولَا ۚ وَلَئِن زَالَتَا إِنْ أَمْسَكَهُمَا مِنْ أَحَدٍ مِّن بَعْدِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah holds the heavens and the earth lest they should move away from their places, and if they were to move away from their places, then no-one else besides Him could hold them</span>. </strong>[35:41]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Throne is in need of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, since it is something created, and Allaah has no need of the Throne or anything else. However, He ascended upon it for a wise purpose which is known to Him, He the Perfect and Most High. And <strong><em>Al-Istiwaa’</em> </strong>(Ascending) is a type of <strong><em>Al-‘Uloow</em></strong> (being High and Exalted), however <em>Al-‘Uloow</em> is an Attribute of His Self. As for <em>Al-Istiwaa’</em> then it is an Attribute which is an action which He does whenever He wishes He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> يُغْشِي اللَّيْلَ النَّهَارَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He causes the night to cover the day </strong></span>[7:54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He causes the night to be covered over with the day, and He causes the day to be covered over with the night so you see the creation being in light and then the night covers it over and it becomes dark, and the night is covered over by the day so it becomes bright.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> يَطْلُبُهُ حَثِيثًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>It pursues it swiftly </strong></span>[7:54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This one comes after that one immediately and is not delayed. So when the night departs the day comes, and when they day departs the night comes right away, this one is not delayed after this one. And this is from the completeness of His Ability, He the Perfect and Most High, that this one does not lag behind that one. And the sun is the tremendous star which is well-known, and the moon is likewise a celestial body from the seven major celestial bodies which orbit around each one of them floats and orbits around the earth, and the earth is fixed and still, He made it settled – meaning settled and firm for the welfare of the servants, and the sun and the rest of the celestial bodies orbit around it, not as is said by the people of conjecture who now say, those who claim to have knowledge, they say that the sun is fixed and the earth orbits around it, this is the opposite of what occurs in the Qur’aan.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَالشَّمْسُ تَجْرِي لِمُسْتَقَرٍّ لَّهَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the sun runs on its fixed course to its appointed term </strong></span>[36:38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whereas they say the sun is fixed, O how Perfect is Allaah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the stars</strong></span>”: they are the stars, <strong>“they are subservient to His command</strong>”: they are subservient in their moving around and their orbiting continually and not slackening, and this a refutation of those who worship the sun and the moon and the stars, because they are subservient to the command of Allaah, they are under command. Allaah is the One Who causes them to move, and it is Allaah who can cause them to stop if He wishes, He the Perfect and Most High. So they are subservient, under control, they have no control at all over the affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He the Perfect commands them, so they proceed, and they orbit and they give off light in accordance with His creational command, He the Perfect and Most High. This one rises and this one sets, and they follow each other in  succession.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Ash-Shams</em> (the sun), and <em>Al-Qamar</em> (the moon) and <em>An-Nujoom</em> (the stars) are in the accusative case because of being conjoined, because <em>As-Samaawaat</em> (the heavens) was in the accusative case, because it was the object of the verb, and the sign that it is in the accusative case is that it has a <em>kasrah </em>upon it in place of the <em>fat-<u>h</u>ah, </em>because it is a sound feminine plural. And <em>Al-Ar<u>d</u></em> (the earth) is in the accusative case as is shown by the <em>fat-<u>h</u>ah, </em>then He said, “and the sun and the moon” &#8211; they are joined grammatically to something <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> which is in the accusative case and what is joined to something in the accusative case is itself in the accusative case.</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;"><a style="color:#999999;" href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a>  i.e. they are ‘joined’ to the heavens grammatically.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>Musakhkharaatin</em></strong></span>”, (they are subservient): is the accusative case because it is the accusative of state or condition, meaning their condition is that they are subservient. And the sign that it is in the accusative case is a <em>kasrah</em> in place of a <em>fat-<u>h</u>ah</em>, because it is joined to a sound feminine plural.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَلَا لَهُ الْخَلْقُ وَالْأَمْرُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Certainly creation and commandment are His alone </strong></span>[7:54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><em>Alaa</em></strong>”: is a term to draw attention and to affirm something.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“For Him”: meaning He the Perfect and Most High, not for anyone else besides Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Creation”: it is to bring something into existence, so He is the One Who is Fully Able to create whenever He wants to, He the Perfect and Most High, He creates whatever He wishes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And the command”: His command, He the Perfect and Most High, and it is His speech, He the Perfect and Most High, His creational command and His legislational command.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>His Creational Command:</strong> that which He has commanded the created beings with and they obey Him in it and respond to Him, such as His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَقَالَ لَهَا وَلِلْأَرْضِ ائْتِيَا طَوْعًا أَوْ كَرْهًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So He said to it </strong>(the heavens)<strong> and to the earth, come about both of you willingly or unwillingly </strong></span>[41:11]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He commanded the two of them He the Perfect, and this was a creational command which He commanded the heavens and the earth with, so they came into being.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّمَا أَمْرُهُ إِذَا أَرَادَ شَيْئًا أَن يَقُولَ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>His command is just that when He wants something He says to it “Be!”, and it is.</strong></span> [36:82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is Allaah’s Creational Command.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>As for His Legislational Command: </strong>then it is His revelation which was sent down by which He commands His servants. He commands them to worship Him, He commands them with the prayer, He commands them with the <em>Zakaat</em>, He commands them with dutifulness to the parents, this is His Legislational Command. Entering into it are His commands and prohibitions which are in the honourable Qur’aan and in the Prophetic <em>Sunnah</em>. This is from the command of Allaah the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And since creation and commandment are for Him, then what remains for other than Him, He the Perfect and Most High? And therefore Ibn ‘Umar said when he recited this <em>aayah</em>, “Whoever has  something then let him seek after it”. And the <em>aayah</em> proves the difference between creating and commanding, so it contains a refutation of those who say that the Qur’aan is created, because the Qur’aan is from the command, and Allaah’s command is not a created thing, since Allaah made a difference between creating and between commanding. So He made them two separate things, and the Qur’aan enters into His command, so it is not something created.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is what Imaam Ahmad used to overcome the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> in argument when they requested from him that he should say that the Qur’aan was something created. He said, “Is the Qur’aan from the creation or from the command?” They responded, “<strong>The Qur’aan is from His command</strong>.” He said, “The command is something different to the creation. Allaah made a difference between this and between the creation. So He made the creation one thing and His command something else.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The command is His speech, and as for the creation then it is His bringing into existance and making something. There is a difference between them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>Tabaarak Allaah</em></strong></span>”: means: tremendously great is the One whose actions are these, He the Perfect and Most High. And whose Ability is such and these are the things which He has created, He the Exalted and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“<em>Tabaarak</em>”</strong></span>: is a verb which is used specifically for Him, He the Perfect, so it cannot be applied to anyone besides Him. And <em>al-Barakah</em> (blessing) it means abundance of good and its increase, and the blessings which come from Allaah the Majestic and Most High do not end. As for a created being, it cannot be said about him, “<em>tabaarak</em>”. Rather it can be said to him, “<em>mubaarak</em>” meaning, “May you receive blessing”, meaning may Allaah put blessing into him and make him blessed. And all blessing is from Allaah the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>The Lord of the whole of creation</strong>”: just as preceded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this <em>aayah</em> contains affirmation of <em>at-Taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of Allaah’s Lordship and <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of Allaah’s right to worship, as has preceded.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Proof for His Lordship and His Divinity and Right to All Worship, He the Perfect and Most High</strong></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ اللَّيْلُ وَالنَّهَارُ وَالشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ ۚ لَا تَسْجُدُوا لِلشَّمْسِ وَلَا لِلْقَمَرِ وَاسْجُدُوا لِلَّهِ الَّذِي خَلَقَهُنَّ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And from His signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon. Do not prostrate to the sun nor to the moon, but rather prostrate to Allaah, the One Who created them if you truly worship Him.</span> </strong>[41:37] <sup>7</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a proof for His <em>Ruboobiyyah</em> (Lordship) and <em>Ilaahiyyah</em> (Divinity and Right to Worship), He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ اللَّيْلُ وَالنَّهَارُ وَالشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And from His signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon </strong></span>[41:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sun and the moon: the sun is the tremedous star which gives light to the creation, as a lamp burning and shining, just as Allaah the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَجَعَلْنَا سِرَاجًا وَهَّاجًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We have made it</strong></span> <span style="color:#008000;">(the sun)<strong> a lamp, burning and shining.</strong></span> [78:13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the moon is a light which brightens the night-time and gives light to the pathway of the people. And from their benefits also is the well-being of the creation through its trees and its fruits and oceans. So if the sun were hidden away from the creation, then the creation would suffer harm, and many of the means of livelihood and their welfare would be corrupted and if the moon were hidden away, then likewise. The moon also brings about benefit for their fruits and their trees, along with what it contains also from awareness of reckoning (of time periods). He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">هُوَ الَّذِي جَعَلَ الشَّمْسَ ضِيَاءً وَالْقَمَرَ نُورًا وَقَدَّرَهُ مَنَازِلَ لِتَعْلَمُوا عَدَدَ السِّنِينَ وَالْحِسَابَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We made the moon a light and appointed set phases for it so that you should know the number of years and the reckoning of the months days and hours. </strong></span>[10:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْأَهِلَّةِ ۖ قُلْ هِيَ مَوَاقِيتُ لِلنَّاسِ وَالْحَجِّ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They ask you about the crescent moons, then say: They are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the Hajj </strong></span>[2:189]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the crescent moons bring benefit for awareness of time-periods and deadlines, deadlines for debts and deadlines for the waiting periods of the women, and the set times for acts of worship and fasting and Hajj, all of them are known by reckoning based upon these two lights, the sun and the moon. So the solar reckoning and the lunar reckoning contain many benefits for all of the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from those things which He has created are the seven heavens. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُ الَّذِي خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَاوَاتٍ وَمِنَ الْأَرْضِ مِثْلَهُنَّ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah is the One Who created seven heavens, and their like from the earth. </strong></span>[65:12]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِي خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَاوَاتٍ طِبَاقًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah the One Who created seven heavens in levels </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(one above the other)</span> [67:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Each being above the other, the lowest heaven, then the one which follows it up until the seventh one. And above them all is the Throne of the Most Merciful, He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the earths are seven just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> الْأَرْضِ مِثْلَهُنَّ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And their like from the earth </strong></span>[65:12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they are seven levels or layers also, and every level from the levels of the seven heavens and the earths have inhabitants and occupants. And whatever planets and stars are in the heavens the sun and the moon and whatever is in the earth from created things from animals with their different types and from mountains and trees and rocks and minerals and oceans. These are from the signs of Allaah the Perfect and Most High, the creational signs, which are seen and witnessed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said: and the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ اللَّيْلُ وَالنَّهَارُ وَالشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ ۚ لَا تَسْجُدُوا لِلشَّمْسِ وَلَا لِلْقَمَرِ وَاسْجُدُوا لِلَّهِ الَّذِي خَلَقَهُنَّ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And from His signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon. Do not prostrate to the sun nor to the moon, but rather prostrate to Allaah, the One Who created them if you truly worship Him.</span> </strong>[41:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from His signs is the night: meaning from His signs which prove Lordship and His Ability and His sole right to worship to the exclusion of all else besides Him, is the night which brings darkness, and the daytime which brings light to the whole of the creation. This is from the amazing signs of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So who can make the whole of the creation dark, all at once, and then make the whole of the creation bright, all at once? He is Allaah the Perfect and Most High. If all of the creation were to gather together to make one part of the earth bright, they would not be able except to make a restricted area bright, if they brought all the electrical generators which are in the world, all of them, they could not make bright except a restricted portion of the earth. As for the sun and the moon then they bring light to the whole of the earth, the night and the day follow each other in succession, and the sun and the moon likewise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَا تَسْجُدُوا لِلشَّمْسِ وَلَا لِلْقَمَرِ وَاسْجُدُوا لِلَّهِ الَّذِي خَلَقَهُنَّ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do not prostrate to the sun nor to the moon, but rather prostrate to Allaah, the One Who created them, if it is He that you truly worship. </strong></span>[41:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a nullification of <em>shirk</em>: Do not prostrate to created things. Since from the greatest of the created things are the sun and the moon, and because the people of shirk, they used to worship the sun and prostrate to it, and from them were those who used to worship the moon and the stars, such as the people of Ibraaheem, they would build for them temples in the form of the stars and they would worship them. So His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَا تَسْجُدُوا لِلشَّمْسِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do not prostrate to the sun</span> </strong>[41:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>As-Sujood</em> means placing the forehead upon the ground in humble submission to the one who is worshipped, and it is the greatest of the types of worship, and Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallaam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أقرب ما يكون العبد من ربه وهو ساجد</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The closest that the servant comes to his Lord is whilst he is in prostration” </strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a>  Reported by Muslim (482) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhu</em>. [And the narration of Muslim has a completion at the end, “So therefore make plentiful supplication.”]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the greatest of the types of worship is prostration upon the ground, since your face is the thing which you cherish the most, you have placed it for Allaah upon the ground, as an act of worship for Allaah and in submission before Him, He the Perfect and Most High. This is true prostration, and it is not befitting to perform it as worship except for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for prostrating to the sun and the moon, then it is prostration to a created thing, which does not have the right to be prostrated to. So it is not permissible to prostrate to created things, but rather prostration is only for the Creator of the created things. As for the created things, then they are just like you, something created, something managed and controlled. Would you prostrate to a created being who is incapable, just the same as you? This is not permissible. Where have the intellects gone?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Prostration is only deserved by the Creator, He the Perfect and Most High, who is not rendered incapable by anything. So prostration is the right of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, it is not the right of the creation, no matter how great and large the created being is, it is still a created being who is weak and managed and controlled.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَا تَسْجُدُوا لِلشَّمْسِ وَلَا لِلْقَمَرِ وَاسْجُدُوا لِلَّهِ الَّذِي خَلَقَهُنَّ إِن كُنتُمْ إِيَّاهُ تَعْبُدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do not prostrate to the sun nor to the moon, but rather prostrate to Allaah, the One Who created them, if it is He that you truly worship.</strong></span> [41:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is obligatory is that we do not worship except Allaah. So if you make prostration to Him and you also prostrate to other than Him, then you are not worshippers of Allaah with correct worship. Rather you are worshipping Him along with <em>shirk</em>, and <em>shirk</em> corrupts and destroys worship.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فإذَا قيلَ لكَ بما عرفْتَ ربَّك؟ فقُل بآياتِه ومخلوقاتِه</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>So if it is said to you, “How did you come to know of your Lord”, then say, “through His Signs and those things which He has created” </strong></span><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><sup>5</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">5</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You have said, “<strong>My Lord is Allaah</strong>”, or, “<strong>My Lord is Allaah Who nurtured me with His favours</strong>”. So what is the proof that Allaah is your Lord who nurtured you with His favours? So the Shaikh brought proofs from the revelation and from the intellect as will follow. So if it is said to you, “<strong>How did you come to know of your Lord?”</strong>, because whoever claims something, then he must establish proof upon his claim:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>And claims if the people do not establish proof</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em> For them, then their people are mere claimants</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everyone who makes a claim must establish the proof for his claim, otherwise his claim will not be correct. You have said, “<strong>My Lord is Allaah who nurtured me and nurtured the whole of the creation through His favours</strong>”. What is the proof? Then say, “<strong>The proof is His Signs and those things which He has created</strong>”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Aayaat</em> is the plural of <em>aayah </em>and the word <em>aayah</em> in the language is a sign showing something and indicating something, just as he <em>sallallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">آية المنافق ثلاث</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The <em>aayah</em> (sign) of the hypocrite is in three”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by al-Bukhaaree (33) and by Muslim (59) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhu</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning his sign.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>through His Signs</strong></span>”: meaning the Signs and the proofs which indicate Him, He the Perfect and Most High. So all of these created beings which you see, all of them were non-existent, and then Allaah produced them and created them by His Ability, He the Perfect and Most High. And from them are created beings which are constantly renewed such as plants and the newborn, and things which were not present and then they came about, and you look upon them – who is the one who created them? He is Allaah the Perfect and Most High. Do they create themselves?, did anyone from mankind create them? No-one can claim this, and no-one is able to claim it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَمْ خُلِقُوا مِنْ غَيْرِ شَيْءٍ أَمْ هُمُ الْخَالِقُونَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَمْ خَلَقُوا السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ ۚ بَل لَّا يُوقِنُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Or were they created without any creator, or are they themselves the creators, or did they create the heavens and the earth? Rather they do not have certain faith </strong></span>[52:35-36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These things did not produce themselves, nor were they produced by others from the created beings at all, and no-one can ever create a tree or a gnat or a fly:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ لَن يَخْلُقُوا ذُبَابًا وَلَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا لَهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Those whom you call upon besides Allaah, they can never create even a fly, even if they gathered together to do it</span> </strong>[22:73]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this creation proves the Creator, He the Perfect and Most High, and therefore, <span style="color:#333399;">when it was said unexpectedly to the bedouin man, “How did you come to know about your Lord?”. He responded, “The piece of camel dung proves that there is a camel, and the footprint proves that there is a man who is travelling. Does not this creation prove, the One Who is Subtle and Kind, the One Who is All-Aware?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when you see a footprint upon the ground, does it not prove to you that someone has walked upon this ground, if you see a piece of camel dung does it not prove to you that there are camels upon this land or that a camel has passed by? A piece of camel dung proves that there has been a camel, and a footprint prove that somebody has passed by.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ومِنْ آياتِه الليلُ والنهارُ والشمسُ والقمرُ، ومِنْ مخلوقاتِه السمواتُ السَّبْعُ والأَرْضُونَ السَّبع ومَا فيهنَّ وما بينهما</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And from His Signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon, and from that which He has created are the seven heavens and the seven earths and whatever is within them and whatever is between them.</strong></span><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><sup>6</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">6</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And from His Signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon</strong>”: so the <em>aayaat</em> (Signs) are of two categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first category: <span style="color:#000000;"><em>Ayaatun Kawniyyah</em></span></strong>, His Signs within the creation which we can see, such as the heavens and the earth and the stars and the sun and the moon and the mountains and the trees and the oceans. They are called Signs because they contain signs proving their Creator, He the Perfect and Most High, and therefore poet Abul-Ataahiyah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>So how strange, how can the One deserving worship be disobeyed</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Or how can the one who denies deny Him?</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em> </em><em>When everything contains a Sign for Him</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em> Proving that He is One</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>And there is a witness for Allaah in every movement</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em> And every stillness of the creation</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can anyone deny Allaah the Majestic and Most High and saying there is no Lord for this whole creation, and that these created beings came about without any creator. And if they did come about through a creator, then who is this creator besides Allaah the Majestic and Most High, explain to me. You will not find a creator besides Allaah the Perfect and Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَمْ جَعَلُوا لِلَّهِ شُرَكَاءَ خَلَقُوا كَخَلْقِهِ فَتَشَابَهَ الْخَلْقُ عَلَيْهِمْ ۚ قُلِ اللَّهُ خَالِقُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَهُوَ الْوَاحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Or do they set up partners for Allaah who create with the like of His creation so that the creation is obscured for them. Say: Allaah is the Creator of everything and He is the One, the Overwhelming Subduer </strong></span>[13:16]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second category: <span style="color:#000000;"><em>al-Aayaat-ul-Qur’aaniyyah</em></span></strong>, <em>aayahs</em> of the Qur’aan which are recited from the revelation which has been sent down to the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam, </em>all of these prove the existence of the Lord, the Perfect and Most High, and His Perfection and His Attributes and His Names, and that He is the One deserving of worship, He alone with no partner, all of them prove that, the creational Signs and the <em>aayahs</em> of the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The creational Signs prove their Creator, and the One Who brought them into existence and the One Who controls them. And the <em>aayahs</em> of the Qur’aan contain the command to worship Allaah and they contain affirmation of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of Lordship and using it as a proof for <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of worship. And the command to worship Allaah the Perfect and Most High, all of the Qur’aan is concentrated upon this meaning and it was sent down for this meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from His Signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon, these are from the greatest Signs of Allaah the Perfect and Most High, the dark night which covers this creation, and the bright day which brings light to this creation, so that they can go about for their work. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِن جَعَلَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْكُمُ اللَّيْلَ سَرْمَدًا إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ مَنْ إِلَٰهٌ غَيْرُ اللَّهِ يَأْتِيكُم بِضِيَاءٍ ۖ أَفَلَا تَسْمَعُونَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِن جَعَلَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْكُمُ النَّهَارَ سَرْمَدًا إِلَىٰ يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ مَنْ إِلَٰهٌ غَيْرُ اللَّهِ يَأْتِيكُم بِلَيْلٍ تَسْكُنُونَ فِيهِ ۖ أَفَلَا تُبْصِرُونَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِن رَّحْمَتِهِ جَعَلَ لَكُمُ اللَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَارَ لِتَسْكُنُوا فِيهِ وَلِتَبْتَغُوا مِن فَضْلِهِ وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: Do you see if Allaah made the night continuous upon you until the Day of Resurrection, what deity besides Allaah could bring you light? Will you not then listen? </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: Do you see if Allaah made the day continuous upon you until the Day of Resurrection, what deity besides Allaah could bring you night-time in which you could rest? Will you not see? </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And from His Mercy upon you is that He has made the night and the day so that you may rest therein and seek of His bounty and that you should be thankful. </strong></span>[28:71-73]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is from the greatest of the Signs of Allaah, this night and this day. The whole time is not night and the whole of time is not day, because if that were the case then the welfare of the people would be lost and they would become fatigued.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah made the night and the day to follow each other in succession for them and then the night and the day are ordered, neither of them clashes nor do they alter, upon a single ordered system which proves the wisdom of the All-Wise One, He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The actions of the servants and that which they make end in destruction, and they clash with each other whatever they may be and they stop working.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the things created by Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, then they do not become destroyed, except at the time when Allaah permits their destruction. So the night and the day continue, neither of them ceases working, whereas things made by the creation stop working and come to destruction and perish no matter how strong they are and how large they are.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how many abandoned cars do you see and planes and ships even though they were strong and had been taken care of, yet they end in destruction and they stop working. Does the night-time stop working or does the day-time stop working? No, because its maker has full Ability and is All-Wise, He the Majestic and Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">صُنْعَ اللَّهِ الَّذِي أَتْقَنَ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The creation of Allaah who has made everything firmly and precisely. </strong></span>[27:88]</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وكلُّ ما سِوَى اللهِ عالََمٌ وأنا واحدٌ من ذلكَ العالَمِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And everything besides Allaah is a created being, and I am one of those created beings.</strong></span><strong><sup>4</sup></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Shaikh <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullah</em>, explained the manner in which this <em>aayah</em> is used as an evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So his saying, “<strong>And everything besides Allaah is a created being, and I am one of those created beings</strong>.”: so therefore Allaah is my Lord, because Allaah is the Lord of all of the created beings and I am one of the created beings. So no-one is able to say, “I have a lord besides the Lord of the creation”, neither an unbeliever nor a Muslim. This will not be possible ever and no person with intellect will say it. This is a proof for the <em>Ruboobiyyah</em> (Lordship) of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and since He is the Lord of the whole of the creation, then therefore He is the One deserving worship, and this nullifies the worship of others besides Him, He the Perfect and Most High, and therefore after it He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You alone do we worship and Your aid alone do we seek. </strong></span>[1:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates restriction, because the fact that the governed word is brought forward, “<em>Iyyaaka</em>”, and the governing verb <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>نَعْبُدُ</strong> </span>is put back, indicates restriction. So, “You, we worship”, is different to, “we worship you”, because saying, “we worship”, this is merely affirmation. However, “You, we worship”, this includes negation and affirmation, meaning, “we do not worship anyone else besides you”. And worship will not be correct except with negation and affirmation, and it is the meaning of <em>Laa ilaaha illallaah</em>, for it contains negation and affirmation, a negation for the right to be worshipped from everything else besides Allaah, and affirmation of it for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فإذا قيلَ لكَ: مَنْ رَبُّكَ؟ فقلْ ربي اللهُ الذي ربّاني ورَبَّى جميعَ العالمينَ بنعمِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>So if it is said to you, “Who is your Lord?”, then say, “My Lord is Allaah who nurtured me and all of the creation with His favours.”</b></span></span><b> </b><strong><sup style="font-weight:bold;">2</sup></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> having explained the three fundamental principles in general terms, wanted to explain them in detail one by one, with their evidences from the Book and the Sunnah, and from Allaah’s signs within the creation, and from the intellectual evidences. And it is likewise obligatory to base creed and belief upon proofs from the Book and the Sunnah, and upon examination of the signs which Allaah has placed within the creation so that it should be firmly grounded and firmly established in the heart and so that all doubts are removed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for creed and beliefs based upon <em>shubuhaat</em> (incorrect suspicions) and upon doubts and upon sayings of the people and upon blind-following, then these will be beliefs which are short-lived and will not remain firmly established, and they will be open to being disproven and they will be open to being totally refuted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So creed and belief and the rest of the rulings of the legislation are not established except with proofs of the Book and the Sunnah and with accepted intellectual proofs. And therefore the Shaikh <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> he quoted many proofs for these three fundamental principles, so no principle from them occurs except that he has support it with evidences and proofs about which there is certainty which repel doubts and false desires and which firmly implant the creed and belief in the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, “<strong>So if it is said to you</strong>”: meaning if you are asked about your Lord, and this is a question which will occur, you will be indeed asked about it in this world and in the hereafter, so it is essential that you have knowledge of your Lord the Mighty and Majestic, and that you respond with the correct response based upon <strong>certainty</strong> and <strong>clear proof</strong>. So then say, “<strong>My Lord is Allaah</strong>”, this is the answer, “<strong>the One Who nurtured me and nurtured the whole of the creation with His favours</strong>.” This is using an intellectual proof.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <strong><em>Ar-Rabb</em></strong>, the Lord the Majestic and Most High, He is the One who nurtures all of His servants with His favours and nourishes them with the provision which He gives. He creates them after they were previously nothing mentioned, they were in the wombs of their mothers, in one form of creation after another within three depths of darkness. And He causes provision to reach them, even in the wombs of their mothers, and therefore the body of the fetus develops in the womb of the mother and grows larger, because the provision from Allaah the Perfect and Most High reaches it and nourishment reaches it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the soul is breathed into it so it moves and it comes to life, by the permission of Allaah. This is <em>tarbiyyah</em> (nurturing) in the womb. Then when it comes out, then Allaah the Perfect nurtures it with His favours giving it health and well-being and He causes the milk of its mother to flow for it, so it is nourished until it can eat food and can do without milk. Then little by little its intellect grows and its hearing and seeing develops, it develops little by little until it reaches puberty then it develops further until it reaches its full strength, until it reaches forty years old and it is at the limit of its strength.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So who is it that nourishes it from the day when He created it in the womb of its mother until it dies, who is it who nourishes it, then who is it who causes this food and this drink to be digested and absorbed in its body so that it reaches every cell and every muscle and every place in its body, who is it who makes food and drink appetizing for it, who is it who causes that to pass through and who removes what is harmful from it, who is it who does this and nurtures this human being, is it not Allaah the Perfect and Most High? This is the Lord the Perfect and Most High, the one who nurtures, He is the one who nurtured me and nurtured all of the created beings by His favours.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everything upon the face of the earth from the realms of humans and animals and the realm of the land and the sea, from the greatest created thing to the smallest created thing upon the land and the sea, all of them are nourished by His favours and His provision. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَمَّنْ هَٰذَا الَّذِي يَرْزُقُكُمْ إِنْ أَمْسَكَ رِزْقَهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Or who is it that could give you provision if your Lord were to withold the provision which He gives to you?</span> </strong>[67:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا مِن دَابَّةٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ إِلَّا عَلَى اللَّهِ رِزْقُهَا وَيَعْلَمُ مُسْتَقَرَّهَا وَمُسْتَوْدَعَهَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And there is no creature upon the earth except that its provision is dependent upon Allaah and He knows its dwelling place and its resting place.</span> </strong>[11:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَكَأَيِّن مِّن دَابَّةٍ لَّا تَحْمِلُ رِزْقَهَا اللَّهُ يَرْزُقُهَا وَإِيَّاكُمْ ۚ وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And how many a creature there is which does not carry its own provision. Allaah provides for it and for you. He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.</span> </strong>[29:60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Lord, the One free of all imperfections:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">ذَٰلِكُمُ اللَّهُ رَبُّكُمْ فَاعْبُدُوهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">That is Allaah your Lord so worship Him alone.</span> </strong>[10:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for other than Allaah the Majestic and Most High, then it does not possess and have ability over anything from that, neither the idols nor anything else, no-one else possesses and has ability over granting provision, rather it is one who is provided for, it is a created being like yourself.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And He is the One Whom I worship and there is no other whom I worship besides Him, and the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</span></strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">All praise is for Allaah the Lord of the whole of creation</span> </strong>[1:2]<strong> <sup>3</sup></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And He is the One Whom I worship</strong>”: the Lord, the One who is like this He is the One who deserves worship from me and from other than me. Then the Shaikh also draws attention to the fact that it is not sufficient to affirm <em>Ruboobiyyah</em> (Allaah’s Lordship), it is not sufficient that you say, “My Lord is Allaah who nurtured me with His favours.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is not sufficient, you must acknowledge His right to all worship, and you must make all worship purely and sincerely for Him. And this is the difference between the person of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and the person of <em>shirk</em>. So the person of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> affirms the Lordship of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and he affirms His sole right to worship, He alone with no partner, whereas the person of <em>shirk, </em>he affirms the Lordship of Allaah, however he is one who associates others along with Him in his worship of Him. He associates along with Him those who do not create and do not provide provision and do not possess anything. This is the difference between the person of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and the person of <em>shirk</em>. The person of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> says, “My Lord is Allaah and He is the One Whom I worship, and I have no other one whom I worship besides Him.”, whereas the person of <em>shirk</em>, he says, “My Lord is Allaah.” However worship with him is not solely for Allaah, so he worships along with Allaah, trees and rocks and beloved servants of Allaah and righteous people and graves. So he becomes a person of <em>shirk</em>, and the affirmation of Lordship does not benefit him, and it does not enter him into Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So his saying, “<strong>And He is the One Whom I worship</strong>”: meaning the Deity Whom I worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, “<strong>And I have no other whom I worship besides Him</strong>”: neither from the Angels nor from the Messengers nor from the righteous people nor from trees nor rocks nor anything else, I have nothing which I worship besides Him, He the Perfect and Most High. This is affirmation of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> with the proof, and this is an intellectual proof, and then he mentioned the textual proof the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">All Praise is for Allaah, the Lord and Nurturer of the whole of the creation.</span> </strong>[1:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This aayah is the start of the Qur’aan in the <em>Mus-haf </em>(written copy of the Qur’aan), there is nothing before it except for, “In the Name of Allaah, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.” And it is the conclusion of the speech of the people of Paradise, He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَآخِرُ دَعْوَاهُمْ أَنِ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And the conclusion of their call will be that all Praise is for Allaah, the Lord of the whole of creation</span> </strong>[10:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah the Majestic and Most High began this creation with this phrase.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِي خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ وَجَعَلَ الظُّلُمَاتِ وَالنُّورَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">All praise is for Allaah He Who created the heavens and the earth and made the darkness and the light.</span> </strong>[6:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He will conclude the creation with it. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَقُضِيَ بَيْنَهُم بِالْحَقِّ وَقِيلَ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And judgement will be passed upon them all with justice, and judgement will be concluded by its being said that all praise is for Allaah the Lord of creation</span> </strong>[39:75]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He began the creation with it and He concluded with it, so it is a tremendous saying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying He the Most High, “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>Al-<u>H</u>amd</em>”</strong></span>: it is praise of the One Who is being praised along with love of Him and veneration of Him. And the, “<em>Al-</em>”, in, “<em>Al-<u>H</u>amd</em>”, is to make it totally comprehensive, meaning all praise is for Allaah, it belongs to Him and He is deserving of it, so He is the One Who deserves total and unrestricted praise. As for other than him, then he can be praised in accordance with the level of the fine and good things which he does. As for total and unrestricted and complete praise then it is for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, because favours, all of them are from Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And even the created being if he does something good to you, then it is from Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, He is the One Who caused this created being to do something useful for you, and He is the One Who enabled him to do good for you, so indeed praise returns to Allaah the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, “<strong><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Lillaah</em></span></strong>”: the <em>jaar</em> and the <em>majroor</em> are connected to something left unmentioned which is the predicate for the subject. So the phrase means: praise exists or is confirmed for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And, “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allaah</strong></span>”: means, the One possessing Divinity and the right to be worshipped over the whole of His creation. And this Name, no-one else besides Him, He the Perfect can be called it, no-one can be called Allaah. Even the Pharoah, he did not say, “I am Allaah”, rather he said, “I am your Lord”. So this Name is particular to Allaah, no-one can ever be called it, and no-one has the audacity to say, “I am Allaah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Rabbi</em></span></strong>”: this is a qualifying noun for Allaah’s Name, and it is in the genitive case and it is a governing noun.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Al-‘Aalameen</em></span></strong>”: is a governed noun in the genitive case, and the sign that it is in the genitive case is the, “<em>yaa</em>”. Because it it joined to the sound masculine plural.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is clear that praise, all of it, and extolling, all of it, is for Allaah the Lord of the whole of creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the world of the Angels and the world of inanimate objects and of birds and the world of beasts of prey and the world of animals and the world of insects and of ants and the many worlds or realms of creation that there are upon the land and in the sea, they are not known except to Allaah, and no-one can enumerate them except Allaah. All of them, Allaah is their Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><span style="color:#000000;"><em>Rabb-ul-‘Aalameen</em></span></strong>”, (the Lord of all of the creation): this cannot be applied except to Allaah the Perfect the Mighty and Majestic. It is not possible for anyone to be called, “<em>Rabb-ul-‘Aalameen</em>”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if it said, “<strong><em>Ar-Rabb</em></strong>”, (<em>The</em> Lord): then this cannot be used except for Allaah the Majestic and Most High, it cannot be used except for Him. As for a created being, then the term can be used restrictedly so that it is said, <em>Rabb-ad-Daar</em> “the master of the house”, or, “the owner of the animal”, meaning its owner and its master.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>[11:33 minutes]</strong><br /><strong>Sharh-ul-Usool-ith-Thalaathah : Lesson 01 : Part B</strong><br /><strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>



<p><strong>The Author’s Introduction</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">قال رحمه الله:<span style="color:#008000;"><strong> بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمَـٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</strong></span></h3>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#993300;">He, may Allaah have mercy upon him, said: <strong>In the Name of Allaah, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy</strong>.<sup>1</sup></span></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p class="has-text-align-justify">[1]: He began, may Allaah have mercy upon him, this treatise with the <strong><em>Basmalah</em></strong>, following the example of the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, since the first thing which you see in the <em>mus-<u>h</u>af</em> (the printed copy of the Qur’aan), and before every <em>soorah</em> of it is, <em>Bismi Allāhi Ar-Raĥmāni Ar-Raĥīm</em> (In the Name of Allaah, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy).</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">So therefore it is used to begin treatises, or letters and books and works following the example of the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. And likewise the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wasallam</em> used to write it at the start of his letters when he wrote to the governors and the chiefs and to those who were in the different regions of the earth, calling them to Islaam, he would begin his letter with,&nbsp; <em>Bismi Allāhi Ar-Raĥmāni Ar-Raĥīm</em>.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wasallam</em> used to begin his talks and his speech with,&nbsp; <em>Bismi Allāhi Ar-Raĥmāni Ar-Raĥīm (</em>“In the Name of Allaah, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy”), which shows that beginning with,&nbsp; <em>Bismi Allāhi Ar-Raĥmāni Ar-Raĥīm</em>, is the sunnah of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wasallam, </em>just as Sulaymaan <em>‘alaihissalaam</em> when he wrote to Bilqees, the Queen of Saba’, he began his letter with, <em>Bismi Allāhi Ar-Raĥmāni Ar-Raĥīm</em>:</p>



<h3 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;">قَالَتْ يَا أَيُّهَا الْمَلَأُ إِنِّي أُلْقِيَ إِلَيَّ كِتَابٌ كَرِيمٌ</span><br /><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّهُ مِن سُلَيْمَانَ وَإِنَّهُ بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ</span><br /><span style="color:#000000;">أَلَّا تَعْلُوا عَلَيَّ وَأْتُونِي مُسْلِمِينَ </span></h3>



<p><strong><span style="color:#008000;">She said: O chiefs, a noble letter has been delivered to me, it is from Sulaymaan, and it reads, “<em>In the Name of Allaah, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy</em>”. Do not be haughty, and refuse what I call you to, but rather come to me in submission”</span>. </strong>[27:29-31]</p>



<p>So it is befitting to begin with, <em>Bismi Allāhi Ar-Raĥmāni Ar-Raĥīm</em>, in every important affair and in every work which has importance and value, and in every letter.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">So therefore those people who do not begin their works and their letters with, <em>Bismi Allāhi Ar-Raĥmāni Ar-Raĥīm</em> , those people have <strong>left the Prophetic sunnah</strong> and <strong>left following the example of the Book of Allaah</strong> the Mighty and Majestic and perhaps because of that these books of theirs and these letters of theirs do not contain blessing and do not contain benefit, because they are deprived of, <em>Bismi Allāhi Ar-Raĥmāni Ar-Raĥīm</em>. So therefore, they are deprived of benefit.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Why did they abandon,&nbsp;Bismi Allāhi Ar-Raĥmāni Ar-Raĥīm? They abandoned it because it is a sunnah, and <strong>they flee away from the sunnah</strong>, or they <strong>blindly follow those people who flee away from the sunnah</strong>. So it is befitting that attention is given to the like of this.</p>



<p>So the meaning of, Bismi Allāhi Ar-Raĥmāni Ar-Raĥīm, is seeking aid through the Name of Allaah.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">So his saying, <strong><span style="color:#008000;">Bismi Allāh</span></strong> (With the Name of Allaah), this is a preposition, and a word which is governed by the preposition, connected to something which is left unmentioned, whose meaning is taken to be, “<strong>I seek aid through the Name of Allaah, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy</strong>”, or, “<strong>I begin with the Name of Allaah, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy</strong>”, seeking blessings by means of it and seeking the aid of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">So therefore it is a tremendous preface for speech and for books and for letters, so a person seeks the aid of Allaah in its beginning and seeks blessing by means of His Name, He the Perfect and Most High.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">Compiled &amp; Translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 – <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaykh AbdulMuhsin bin Hamd al-Abbaad al-Badr</strong> </span>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">‘All praise belongs to Allaah the Lord of all the Worlds, and the praise, peace and blessings of Allaah be upon His Messenger and upon his Family and his Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In response to the question about the Asha’irah: Are they from the Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah or not?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: ‘The Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah are the Noble Companions <i>–</i><i>Radi Allaahu anhum</i>, and those who followed their path, just as the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> said in explaining the ‘Firqat an-Najeeyah’ (the Saved Sect): ‘They are those who are upon what I am upon and my Companions.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their belief in the Names of Allaah – the All-Mighty and the Magnificent – and His Characteristics (Sifaat) is that they affirm for Allaah –Azza wa Jal- what is affirmed in the Book and the Sunnah from the Names and Characteristics in the way which they befit Allaah -Subhanahu Ta’ala- without explaining how they are, or resembling them with anything else, or with Tamtheel (to liken Allaah or His Characteristics to that of the creation), or Tahreef (alteration and distortion of wording or meaning), or Ta’weel (metaphorical interpretation) of them or cancelling them.  Just as Allaah -Azza wa Jal- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; لَيۡسَ كَمِثۡلِهِۦ شَيۡءٞۖ وَهُوَ ٱلسَّمِيعُ ٱلۡبَصِيرُ &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; T<strong><span style="color:#008000;">here is nothing like unto Him and He is the All-Hearing the All-Seeing</span></strong>&gt;&gt; [Shura : 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this Ayaah there is the affirmation that Allaah Ta’ala has the two Sifaat (Characteristics) of Hearing and Seeing, which is in His statement: &lt;&lt; <strong>and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.</strong>&gt;&gt;, and not likening Allaah to resembling anyone with Him as is in His statement: &lt;&lt;<strong>There is nothing like unto Him</strong>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Asha’irah are those who ascribe to the Madhab (School of Thought) of Abul-Hasan al-Asha’ari <i>-Rahimullaah-</i> who was born in the year 270 A.H. and died in the year 330 A.H.  That Madhab on which he was before he came back to the Madhab of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah.  That Madhab which was on <em>Ta’weel</em> (metaphorical interpretation) of most of the <em>Sifaat</em> (Characteristics of Allaah), which is opposite to the Madhab of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the Asha’irah are from the deviated Islaamic sects, they are deviated from what Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah are upon.  It is not perceivable to the intellect that the truth was hidden from the Companions, and the Successors but then after that the truth had occurred in following a belief which was born after their time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajr in his book ‘Fath al-Bari’ (13/407) quoted many statements from the Salaf about the authentic Aqeedah which is established upon the Book and the Sunnah and the understanding of the Salaf of the Ummah, he summed it up by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Many quotes have preceded from the people of the third period of time and they are the Fuqaha (scholars) of the different lands, like Thawri, al-Awzaiee, Malik, al-Layth and those who lived at their time, and likewise those who took from them, from the other Imams. So how can a person not trust what the people of the first three generations agreed upon, and they are the best generations, with the testification of the owner of the Sharia?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hajr also quotes from al-Hasan al-Basari that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If what al-Ja’ad is saying is true, then the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </i>would have conveyed it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Ja’ad is Ibn Dirham the founder of the Madhab al-Jahmeeyah.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I will say the like of what al-Hasan al-Basari <i>-Rahimullaah-</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If what the al-Asha’irah and other than them from the philosophers say is true, then the Messenger <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> would have conveyed it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Takeed al-Musalamaat as-Salafeeyah’ p. 5]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaykh Ahmad Yahya an-Najmi</strong></span> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The truth of which there is no contention about, is that the Asha’irah and Matroodeeyah are from the groups of the Ahl-ul-Bida’.  It is not allowed for anyone to say that they are from the Ahl-ul-Sunnah and whoever claims that these two groups are from the Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah then he has squeezed himself between a grave and serious mistake, and a humiliating danger, and he will be questioned on the Day of Judgement about his statement before he is freed to go on his path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah said in Majmoo’ al-Fatawa in (3/347) after speaking about this issue:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘With that it becomes clear that the people with the most right to be the Firqat Najeeyah (the saved sect) are the Ahl-ul-Hadeeth and Sunnah those who do not have someone they biasedly follow except the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> and they are the most knowledgeable of the people regarding his statements, his situations, and they are the greatest in distinguishing between the authentic and weak of those statements and situations. Their Imams are scholars regarding those statements and situations and they are the people of knowledge of its meanings, and they follow them, with truth, action, love, with loyalty to the one who is loyal to it and have enmity to the one who has hatred to it. . . . [until he said]… and whatever the people differed over in regards to the issues of Sifaat (Characteristics of Allaah), al-Qadr (pre-destiny), al-Waeed (threat of punishment), Names of Allaah, enjoining the good, forbidding evil and other issues, then here they would return those issues to Allaah and His Messenger. They would refer to the Tafseer (explanation) of those general wordings of which the people of sects and differences differed over and whatever was in agreement with the Book and the Sunnah they would affirm that, and whatever was in opposition to the Book and the Sunnah they would regard that as false. They would not follow speculation or what their souls inclined and desired, because following speculation is ignorance, and following one’s desires without guidance from Allaah is oppression, and together that is evil: ignorance and oppression.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">How can those who apply the intellect in issues of al-Eemaan, which are well-established in the Book and the Sunnah be from the Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah, when they accept what they want from the Book and the Sunnah and reject what they want?!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why the Asha’irah and Matroodeeyah only affirm seven Sifaat of Allaah from His Sifaat, and they metaphorically interpret all the other Sifaat of Allaah, which in turn leads to cancelling out the Sifaat of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can that person be from the Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah when he metaphorically interprets the saying of Allaah Ta’ala: &lt;&gt; by saying [Isteewa means] Allaah conquered His Throne, so it is as if this person is saying that someone else had taken Allaah’s Throne and then after that Allaah had to conquer it?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">How can that person be from the Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah when he metaphorically interprets the hadeeth that Allaah descends the last third of the night which is established in the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> saying:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Allaah –Azza wa Jal- descends every night to the heavens of the Dunyaa, at the second half of the night, or at the third of the night and says: who is making Dua’ to Me so that I can respond to him; who is asking of Me so that I can give him it; who is seeking forgiveness from Me so that I can forgive him until Fajr comes in.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ahmad, and it is originally in Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the person who metaphorically interprets this, says it means: ‘Allaah’s command descends,’ [and not Allaah Himself] even though Allaah’s –Azza wa Jal- command descends at every time and moment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can that person be from Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah who metaphorically interprets Allaah’s Two Hands to mean Allaah’s blessings, even though Allaah –Subhana wa Ta’ala- connected/linked/explained that thing which is specific for the hand, which is spending, Allaah –the Most Magnificent- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَقَالَتِ ٱلۡيَهُودُ يَدُ ٱللَّهِ مَغۡلُولَةٌۚ غُلَّتۡ أَيۡدِيهِمۡ وَلُعِنُواْ بِمَا قَالُواْۘ بَلۡ يَدَاهُ مَبۡسُوطَتَانِ يُنفِقُ كَيۡفَ يَشَآءُۚ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<b> </b><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The Jews say: ‘Allaah’s Hand is tied up (i.e. He does not give and spend of His Bounty).’ Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for what they uttered. Nay, both His Hands are widely outstretched. He spends (of His Bounty) as He wills.</strong></span> &gt;&gt;[2]  knowing that the blessings which the Noble (Jaleel) Lord confers upon His worshippers are so many they cannot be enumerated?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah the Magnificent said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt; وَإِن تَعُدُّواْ نِعۡمَةَ ٱللَّهِ لَا تُحۡصُوهَآۗ  &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;<b> </b><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if you would count the graces of Allaah, never could you be able to count them.</strong></span> &gt;&gt;[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">How can that person be from Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah when he metaphorically interprets the Hadeeth: ‘Allaah does not look at the one who drags his garment below his ankles out of pride.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Agreed upon by Bukhari and Muslim] and other Hadeeth with this meaning; he metaphorically interprets ‘Allaah looking’ in this Hadeeth that the meaning of ‘looking’ is metaphorical for mercy, meaning that Allaah will not have mercy upon them?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are other deviated metaphorically interpretations, which transfer the texts present from Allaah –Azza wa Jal – in His Book or upon the tongue of His Messenger, which comprise of lofty meanings, which are befitting Allaah –Azza wa Jal- and they metaphorically interpret them with a false interpretation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we think about it, what has obligated them to metaphorically interpret the Sifaat like this, then we find that they claim that the condition and state of the intellect is that this is how Allaah should be characterized with those [distorted] characteristics; because they made and took the foundations of the people of Kalam (rationalistic theology &amp; philosophy) as the foundation, and they used this foundation above that of the texts of the Sharia’, which came in the Book of Allaah, and in the Sunnah of the Messenger <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> which affirm for Allaah –Azza wa Jal- Names and Characteristics which befit His Majesty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Asha’irah and Matroodeeyah made those foundations rationalistic theology (Kalam), which was taken from the philosophers, and the people of logic (<i>Mantiq</i>) those who were drowned in knowledge of rationalistic theology, and they spent their time in it, and wasted their lives in it, and their end result was confusion.’</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 57: Point 100</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that the ruin of the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> was that they pondered about the Lord, the Mighty and Majestic. They introduced &#8216;Why?&#8217; and &#8216;How?&#8217;. They abandoned the narrations. And they applied analogy , they weighed the religion according to their opinion. So they came with disbelief openly .They disbelieved and declared the rest of the people to be disbelievers. And the affair led them necessarily to stating <em>Ta&#8217;teel</em> (outright negation).</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-jahmiyyah-were-ruined-due-to-their-pondering-about-allah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And know that the ruin of the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> came about because they pondered about the Lord, the Mighty and Majestic,” </strong>the reason which caused the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> to become misguided to this great extent of misguidance is that they entered into the affair of the Lord, they began searching into it. So it is not permissible for the Muslim to search into the matter of the Lord. Rather, what is upon him is to have eemaan in Him and His Names and in His Attributes and not to enter into the <em>kayfiyyah</em> (how). Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, no-one knows about His Self and about how His Names and Attributes are except for Him, He, the Perfect. He, the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِهِ عِلْمًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah knows whatever is before them and whatever is behind them and they do not encompass Him with Knowledge.</span> </strong>(Soorah-<u>T</u>aa Haa (20), <em>aayah </em>110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, no-one can encompass Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic; He is the one who knows best about Himself and about other than Himself. So, therefore, we do not speak about the affair of Allaah except for that about which there is a proof from the <em>Qur·aan</em> and the Sunnah. And we withhold from whatever does not occur; whatever is not reported.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Jahmiyyah</em> denied the <em>Qur·aan</em> and the <em>Sunnah</em> and they entered with their intellects into the affair of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High to the extent that they said that: ‘<em>He is not within the Universe nor is He outside the Universe, He is not above nor is He beneath, He is not to the right nor is He to the left.</em>’ Therefore, He would not exist then &#8211; Highly Exalted is Allaah above what they say. They said: ‘<em>He does not have hearing, He doesn’t hear and He doesn’t see and He doesn’t have knowledge and He doesn’t have will</em>.’ Therefore, He would be inanimate; non-living thing because an inanimate object is that which is described with these characteristics. So He would in that case be like the idols &#8211; Highly Exalted is Allaah above that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“They imagined and made analogies with regard to the religion based upon their own opinion,” </strong>They followed false analogy, they drew analogy between Allaah and His creation and therefore they denied His Names and His Attributes because in their view they necessitated resemblance. And they did not know that the Names of Allaah and His Attributes are particular to Him, He the Perfect and that the names of the created being and the attributes of the created being are specific to them and there is no resemblance between this and that. So, just as Allaah has a self, which does not resemble the selves of creation then likewise He has Names and Attributes, which do not resemble the names and attributes with the created being. Whoever takes hold of this will be at ease and proceed upon the correct way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“So they came with disbelief openly, it was not hidden.” </strong>They disbelieved in Allaah on account of these ugly sayings concerning Allaah, the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“So they disbelieved and they declared the rest of the creation to be disbelievers.” </strong>They declared as disbelievers those people who describe Allaah with His Names and His Attributes because they say they are <em>mushabbihah</em> (they are ones who claim that Allaah resembles His creation) and <em>tashbeeh</em> (declaring the creator resembles the creation) is disbelief; <em>kufr</em>. So we say no, this is not <em>tashbeeh</em> (resemblance). Allaah the Majestic and Most High, He, the Perfect has said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"> لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ ۖ وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Allaah and He is the All Hearing, the All Seeing.</span> </strong>(Sooratus-Shooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, He negated from Himself <em>tashbeeh</em> (resemblance) and yet He affirmed for Himself Hearing and Seeing even though hearing and seeing are present amongst the created beings. So this shows that this does not resemble that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>&#8220;And the affair unnecessarily led them to stating total negation.” </strong><em>At-Ta`<u>t</u>eel</em> is to deny the Creator, the Perfect and Most High. Because this leads to negation because one who does not hear and he does not see and he does not speak and has no will and has no wish and also is not inside the Universe nor is he outside the Universe and is not above and is not below. Therefore, there was no God who is worshipped in existence at all. So the affair ended up for them with apostasy and total negation.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> <strong>Translator’s side-point</strong>: If you read the story of Jahm ibn Safwaan exactly what happened to him. They say he debated with some people who doubted his Lord and he ended up doubting that they had a Lord so he even abandoned the prayer for a period of 40 days or something. They confused him so much with regard to his Creator, who are you going to pray to then? So the Shaykh said they refer the affair of Jahm and the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>, that’s what it lead to, it leads to this; <em>Ta`<u>t</u>eel</em> (negation of the Creator) altogether; denial of the Creator.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah affirmed speech; <em>al-Kalaam</em> for Himself in many <em>aayahs</em>, from them is the saying; He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُل لَّوْ كَانَ الْبَحْرُ مِدَادًا لِّكَلِمَاتِ رَبِّي لَنَفِدَ الْبَحْرُ قَبْلَ أَن تَنفَدَ كَلِمَاتُ رَبِّي وَلَوْ جِئْنَا بِمِثْلِهِ مَدَدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “If the water of the ocean were ink to write down the words of My Lord then the ocean would be exhausted before the words of My Lord were finished&#8230;”</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Kahf (18), <em>aayah</em> 109)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, the words of Allaah with which He commands and forbids and manages the creation with. Who can then enumerate the words of Allaah, He, the Perfect and Most High? They could not be written down by the oceans nor by all of the pens.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the speech of Allaah, the <em>Kalaam</em> is as said by the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“With respect to its type; eternal, with respect to its individual instances, it newly comes about.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Qadeemun-Nau`</em> means that Allaah, the Most High has always had the attribute of speech. However, with regard to individual instances, for example, Allaah, the Most High speaking to Aadam or Allaah, the Most High speaking to Moosaa <em>`alayhissalaam</em> or Allaah, the Most High speaking to Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> or speaking to Jibreel with the <em>Qur·aan</em> then these individual instances of the speech of Allaah; they newly occur.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the <em>Qur</em>·<em>aan</em> is from the newly occurring instances of the speech of Allaah and some individual instances of the speech of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the speech of Allaah is confirmed by the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em> of His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.</em> And there is no doubt that sound intellect affirms speech for Allaah because it is <em><u>S</u>ifatul Kamaal</em> (hidden attribute of perfection) and negation of it is an attribute of deficiency.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> and they are the followers of Al-Jahm ibn Safwaan who was a foul person who appeared amongst the people and tried to cause them to doubt about the religion of Allaah and he commanded them with apostasy and disbelief. And from that is that he tried to cause them to doubt about the fact that Allaah speaks and he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The speech of Allaah which is present is something created; <em>makhlooq</em>. He created it in the Preserved Tablet or He created it in Jibreel or He created it in Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So it is therefore just an ascription of a created thing to its creator just like saying <em>Baitullaah</em> (the House of Allaah) or <em>Naaqatullaah</em> (the she camel of Allaah).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what he said  ̶ may Allaah disfigure him. He said Allaah does not speak and the ascription of speech to Him is just an ascription of a created thing to its Creator. This is from his <em>mathhab</em> (position). And he also had the position of <em>Al</em>&#8211;<em>Jabr</em> with regard to <em>Qadr</em> (predecree); that people are compelled to do their deeds, no free will. And he had the position of with regard to denying the names and attributes and he also had a position with regard to denying the Sunnah of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and denying the <em>Qur·aan</em> also. So he was a filthy apostate who appeared with the likes of this falsehood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this <em>mathhab</em> was derived from the Jews as was mentioned by Shaykh-ul-Islaam Ibnu Taymiyyah in the introduction to <em>Al-Hamawiyyah</em>. And Al-Jahm, he was not the one who began this <em>mathhab</em>. Before him, there was Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham; he is the one who initiated this repulsive saying. And he took it from <u>T</u>aaloot; the Jew and <u>T</u>aaloot took it from Labeed ibn al-`A`a<u>s</u>am, the Jew who did sorcery upon the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this saying is derived from the Jews, those who distort the speech of Allaah, away from its correct meaning, so this foul <em>mathhab</em> should not be considered something inexplicable when its source is known that it is from the Jews. They infiltrated it amongst the Muslims by means of this foul man Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham, the one who was killed by Khaalid al-Qasree on the Day of <em>Eid ul-A<u>d</u>haa</em> as Ibn-ul Qayyim mentioned.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span style="color:#ff0000;">[1]</span></a> So therefore Ibn-ul Qayyim said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>And on account of that, Khaalid Al–Qasree slaughtered </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>Ja`ad on the Day of the Sacrifice </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>Since he said Ibraaheem was not Allaah’s chosen beloved one</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>No, and nor was Moosaa one who He spoke to and drew close </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>So every person of Sunnah is thanked for that sacrifice</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808080;">What an excellent thing Allaah has brought about through the sacrifice of this brother</span> </em><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span style="color:#ff0000;">[2]</span></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This saying was taken from him by Al-Jahm ibn Safwaan and it became ascribed to him because he is the one who propagated it but he is not the one who initiated it.<span style="color:#ff0000;"><a style="color:#ff0000;" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the people of the Sunnah rebuked and criticized them severely (the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>). And they spoke sternly in that regard and this will follow inshaaAllaah, the part that comes after. However, with us now we have a part of this foul <em>mathhab</em>, which is negation of speech for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, a problem arose with the People of the <em>Sunnah</em>, should it be said, “My recital of the <em>Qur</em>·<em>aan</em> is created or is not created?” This is something which they introduced also amongst the Muslims. So should you say: “My recital of the <em>Qur·aan</em> is created or should you say my recital of the <em>Qur·aan</em> is not created or should you <em>tatawaqqaf</em> (withhold)? And say if what you mean is what is recited, that which is recited, then it is the speech of Allaah, it is not created. And if what is meant is a person’s own particular recital of the <em>Qur·aan</em> then his own recital is a created thing and his voice is created. So therefore it must be mentioned with detail and it must be given then with detail.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is the detail, which was stated by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad and Al-Bukhaariyy and a group of the verifiers. So do not say: my recital of the <em>Qur·aan</em> is created unrestricted and do not say it’s not created unrestrictedly and do not withhold. Rather, mention the answer with detail that <span style="color:#333399;">if what you mean is what I’m reciting then that is the speech of Allaah, that is not created or if what is meant is the person’s own particular recitation, his own particular voice then that is created. That is the detail</span>. <span style="color:#ff0000;"><a style="color:#ff0000;" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Translator’s side-point: And he quotes three famous lines from the Nooniyyah of Ibn-ul Qayyim, poem on `<em>aqeedah</em>, each line ending in <em>noon</em>, concerning this event that this man Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham that he was killed by Khaalid Al-Qasree.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Translator’s side-point: They mention this happened around the year 118 AH in Kufa that Khaalid Al-Qasree who was the governor in Iraq at that time that he slaughtered this evil person Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Translator’s side-point: Some of the people of Knowledge mention is that this saying that we heard was taken by Jahm from Al-Ja`ad and he took it from Taaloot and he took it from Labeed. Then this Labeed ibn al-`A`a<u>s</u>am was a Jew. As we heard he did sorcery upon the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his saying was taken from him by Taaloot; the Jew and from him, his student Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham took this saying, the saying of the Jahmiyyah. And from Al-Ja`ad was taken by his student Al-Jahm ibn Safwaan and each was executed. We saw Al-Ja`ad being executed here and likewise Al-Jahm ibn Safwaan, he was killed as well; his student but before that, each time before the person was executed or killed, he had a famous student who took the saying from him. So, Al-Jahm ibn Safwaan, this saying was taken from him by Bishr al-Marisee and then he, Bishr al-Marisee, he taught this to A<u>h</u>mad ibn Abee Du`aad, the one who was at the head of those who tortured Imaam A<u>h</u>mad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And just briefly with regard to the event; before the event that Khalid al-Qasree slaughtered Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham on the Day of Sacrifices. He gave a <em>khutbah</em> to the people on the `<em>Eid</em> and he said: May Allaah accept your sacrifices for indeed I am going to sacrifice Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham and he came down and he slaughtered Al-Ja`ad ibn Dirham.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Shaykh al-Albaaniyy said with regard to this report: “There’s some speech from the scholars, is it established or not? This is reported by a number of the scholars in their books Ad-Daarimee in <em>Ar-Radd `alal-Jahmiyyah</em> and Al-Bukhaariyy in his book <em>Khalq Af`alul-`Ibaad</em> and other books as well. Then Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy in <em>Mukhta<u>s</u>ar al-`Uluw</em>, Ath-Thahabee’s book <em>Al `Uluw</em>, the originate of it, Shaykh al-Albaaniyy comments, he mentions that the first chain of narration for this that there is weakness in it, there is unknown people in the chain. But then he said, however, the narration that comes after it, another narration with a different chain is better than it and perhaps therefore that is why the scholars state that this story definitely happened. Meaning, there is more than one chain of narration before it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> Translator’s side-point:  With regard to the explanation of Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad An-Najmee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> then he said after mentioning a number of evidences from the <em>Qur·aan</em> affirming that the <em>Qur·aan</em> is indeed the speech of Allaah, not created and the speech of Allaah is an attribute of His. Then he said: ‘And whoever says that anything from the attributes of Allaah is a created thing then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever). This is what the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em> have affirmed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Al-Laalikaa’ee referring to here Imaam Al–Laalikaa`ee in his book <em>Sharh Usool I`tiqaad Ahlus-Sunnah</em>; famous book of `<em>aqeedah</em> mentioned from 550 scholars from the <em>Salaf</em> that they said: ‘Whoever says that the <em>Qur·aan</em> is a created thing then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) and whoever says that his recitation of the <em>Qur·aan</em> is something created then he is an innovator, a <em>Jahmi</em> (he is astray). And likewise, one who remains silent and doesn’t say whether it’s created or not created, he is also a <em>Jahmi</em> (astray). So what Allaah has informed is very clear that the <em>Qur·aan</em> is the speech of Allaah and whoever will not say that then he has belied Allaah in what He has informed of.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Translator’s side point: Obviously the last part of the text here is taken from the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> that’s come a number of times, <strong><em>“Whoever lives long amongst you will see great differing</em></strong>…<strong>”</strong> and the rest of the point taken from the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of Al-Irbaa<u>d</u> Ibn Saariyah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em> reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad, Abu Daawood, At-Tirmithee and Ibn Maajah and declared authentic by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy, the famous <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> that’s come a number of times.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 56: Point 98 (Start of Volume 2)</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that the scholars did not cease refuting the saying of the Jahmiyyah until in the <em>Khilaafah</em> of <em>Banul `Abbaas</em>, the lowly and despicable folk  (<em>Ruwaybi<u>d</u>ah)</em> spoke concerning public affairs. And they spoke against the narrations from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And they adopted analogy and opinion and they declared those who disagreed with them to be disbelievers.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/jahmiyyah-and-ruwaybidah-the-lowly-despicable-folk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And you should know that the People of Knowledge did not cease refuting the saying of the Jahmiyyah,” </strong></span>the Jahmiyyah; a definition of them has preceded already that they are the followers of Al-Jahm ibn <u>S</u>afwaan who propagated the foul saying that the Qur&#8217;aan is a created thing and who openly proclaimed negation of the names of Allaah and His attributes and he had the saying of <em>Al-Irjaa`</em> (taking actions out of <em>eemaan</em>) and he had a foul <em>ma<u>dh</u>hab</em> (path).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So his followers are called the Jahmiyyah as an ascription to al-Jahm. And from the worst, most ugly of their sayings is the saying that the Qur&#8217;aan is a created thing and denying the names and attributes of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, and distorting the speech of Allaah and the speech of His Messenger with falsehood; explaining it and distorting it with falsehood. So they (Jahmiyyah) are the most dangerous of the sects and the most ugly of the sects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore, the People of the <em>Sunnah</em> and the People of Knowledge did not leave them alone, rather, they rebutted their doubts and refuted their sayings and demolished them. And this is present in the books of the People of Knowledge. From them is the refutation of Imaam A<u>h</u>mad ibn <u>H</u>anbal <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> upon the Jahmiyyah and this is present and is printed. And from them is the refutation of `Uthmaan ibn Sa`eed ad-Daarimee upon Bishr al-Mareesee al-`Aneed and it is printed also. And from them is <em>Bayaanu Talbeesil-Jahmiyyah</em> of Shaykh ul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah and from them is<em> Ijtimaa`ul Juyoosh Islaamiyyah `alaa Ghazwal Mu`attillah w’al Jahmiyyah</em> of Ibnul Qayyim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“until in the <em>Khilaafaa </em>(caliphate) of <em>Banul `Abbaas </em>(`Abbaasids),” </strong></span>in the <em>Khilaafah</em> of Al-Ma`moon who was from the <em>Banul `Abbaas</em>, evil occurred. And those who are not suitable to speak, spoke. They spoke with regard to knowledge and with regard to the fundamentals; those who are not suitable to speak. And if a person speaks about something other than his own speciality, then the affairs will be corrupted. So it is essential that no-one speaks about the affairs of the religion and of knowledge except the people who are specialised in it and the People of Knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the affairs will not be rectified by chaos; by everyone speaking and claiming to have knowledge as is present now from those <em>muta`aalimeen</em> (pretenders to knowledge); those who ruminate (think deeply) upon questions of <em>`aqeedah</em> and speak about <em>eemaan</em> and what is the reality of <em>eemaan</em>. And they speak about things which they have no right to speak about at all. They have no knowledge and they do not learn with the scholars. Rather, they just learned by themselves and they rely upon their own understandings and they start laying down principles from themselves and from their own understandings. So, the affair is very dangerous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“so then in the <em>Khilaafah</em> of <em>Banul `Abbaas</em>, the <em>Ruwaybi<u>d</u>ah</em> (the lowly, despicable folk) started speaking about <em>amaril `aammah</em> (affairs of the masses and the people).”</strong></span> This occurs in a narration; meaning this will be from the signs of the Last Hour that public affairs are spoken about by those who are not known for `<em>ilm</em> (knowledge).<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> This is the <em>Ruwaybi<u>d</u>ah</em> (the lowly, despicable folk) and their speaking is one of the signs of the Hour. So it is not right that such a person should speak about the public affairs and about the general matters, which affect everybody. No-one should speak about that except for the People of Knowledge; those who are firmly grounded in knowledge. And this should not be entered into by everyone just as He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَإِذَا جَاءَهُمْ أَمْرٌ مِّنَ الْأَمْنِ أَوِ الْخَوْفِ أَذَاعُوا بِهِ ۖ وَلَوْ رَدُّوهُ إِلَى الرَّسُولِ وَإِلَىٰ أُولِي الْأَمْرِ مِنْهُمْ لَعَلِمَهُ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَنبِطُونَهُ مِنْهُمْ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And if some matters relating to public safety or fear come to them, they broadcast it, and if only they had referred it back to the Messenger and to those in charge with authority amongst them, then the reality of the matter would be known to those who are able to verify and deduce.</span> </strong>(Sooratun-Nisaa·(4), <em>aayah</em> 83)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So public affairs affecting the nation (<em>ummah)</em> are not to be spoken about except by the people who are specifically qualified to do so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And they spoke against the narrations of Allaah’s Messenger<em><u> s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.”</span> </strong>They interfered even in the <em>A<u>h</u>aadeeth</em>, they make attacks upon them and they write works and declare things authentic and declare things weak. And they are not known for knowledge and they did not learn knowledge and they are not from the narrators of <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> nor from the Imaams of <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em>. So they are therefore, <em>Ruwaybi<u>d</u>ah</em>; these lowly despicable folk. They stand up and they start speaking about the most dangerous thing, which is the science of <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> and the knowledge of narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And they adopted analogy and opinion and they declared anyone who disagreed with them to be disbelievers.” </strong></span>What is meant by <em>qiyaa<u>s</u></em> (analogy) here is <em>al-qiyaas ul-baa<u>t</u>il</em> (false analogy). As for <em>al-qiyaas u<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (correct analogy) then that is from the underlying fundamental evidences with the People of Knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, false analogy such as drawing analogy between the Creator and the creation or making analogy between a matter and another matter, which has no connection to it and does not have a common underlying factor. The like of that is false analogy. Because <em>al-qiyaas</em> (analogy) is joining a matter (<em>far·`a)</em> which we do not find a text for, joining it to a matter which there is a text for (<em>asl)</em> and so applying a ruling to it on account of there being an underlying factor (`<em>illah)</em>, common to both of them. So if there is no <em>`illah</em> (common underlying factor) common to both things then it will be a false and futile analogy.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Point Number 98 continued]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>So the ignorant, the inattentive and the ones having no knowledge entered into their saying. So therefore they entered into disbelief without knowing. And the <em>ummah</em> was ruined in a number of ways, committed disbelief in a number of ways, committed heresy in a number of ways and went astray in a number of ways and it split and innovated in a number of ways. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Except for those who remained firm upon the sayings of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and upon what he was upon and what his companions were upon who did not go beyond what they had been upon and did not overstep their affair. Whatever sufficed them sufficed him and he did not wish to turn away from their way and their position. He knew that they were upon the correct Islaam and the correct true faith (<em>eemaan)</em>. So he followed them in his religion and found peace. And he knew that the religion lies in following; <em>taqleed</em> and that those who are meant to be followed are the companions of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So the ignorant people, the inattentive ones and the one having no knowledge entered into their saying.” </strong></span>Meaning, the door was opened for everyone. They began speaking about the affairs of knowledge right until now as you know on account of these satellite channels and this speech and this chaos with regard to knowledge has reached the extent that the common masses of people speak about the matters of knowledge and they raise doubts about the matters of knowledge. They raise doubts about the Islamic rulings. They raise doubts about the verdicts of the Imaams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as has preceded, they declare those who disagree with them to be disbelievers to the extent that they declare the earlier Imaams to be disbelievers and to being ignorant people and to the extent that some of them say, “I am a person and A<u>h</u>mad ibn <u>H</u>anbal was a person. We are men and they were men. Maalik was a man and I am a man!” This is the level that the situation has reached with them that there is no special distinction for the saying of the Imaams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“To the extent that they committed disbelief in a way which they did not know.”</span> </strong>They committed disbelief in a way that they did not know. So a person may say a saying of <em>kufr</em> (disbelief) and he does not know that it is a saying of disbelief on account of his being ignorant. So he says that which is disbelief and he promotes disbelief and he doesn’t even know that it is disbelief (<em>kufr)</em> on account of his having entered into something which he is not proficient in. So the danger is very great for him and for the nation (<em>ummah)</em>. If the danger were just restricted to him; the one who is speaking, it would be easier but the problem is that this spreads throughout the <em>ummah (</em>nation).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So the <em>ummah</em> (nation) became ruined through a number of different ways and committed disbelief in a number of different ways,” </strong></span>meaning, they confused and deceived the <em>ummah</em> (nation) and they entered weaknesses into it until there came to be from them those people who adopt sayings of disbelief and they say, “<em>these are sayings of scholars</em>” just as they say about the saying of Al-Jahm and the Mu`tazilah to the extent that they write in the newspapers, then they say about the true scholars (`<em>ulemaa)</em>, “<em>you people, you restrict the truth to just yourselves and you throw away the sayings of the Imaams such as Ibn Seenaa and Ibn `Arabee and Al-Jahm Ibn <u>S</u>afwaan. And those people are scholars who have their value</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and they committed heresy in different ways and went astray in different ways and they split and they innovated in different ways.” </strong></span>All of these calamities were on account of the ignorant people entering into the matters of knowledge and on account of having little fear of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. So when they had very little fear of Allaah, they entered into these matters. And therefore one of the <em>Salaf</em> said: &#8220;<em>Their wara`(piety) was very slight so that is why they spoke</em>.” As for a person who fears Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, then he doesn’t enter into anything if he is not proficient in it and not from its people, in particular the affairs of the religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Except for those who remained firm upon the sayings of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and upon what he was upon and upon what his companions were upon and do not step beyond any of them.” </strong></span>They were not secure from these calamities, from disbelief and deviation and misguidance and diverting from the correct way and from mutual enmity and from cutting off ties with each other. No-one was safe from these calamities <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>except</strong> </span>those who adhered to that which Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his companions were upon just as he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“And my nation will split into 73 sects, all of them will be in the Fire except for one. They said, “Who is it, O Messenger of Allaah?” He said, “Those who are upon that which I and my companions are upon.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And who found sufficiency in whatever sufficed them,” </strong></span>and it is the Book and the Sunnah and that which the <em>Salaf-us-<u>S</u>aali<u>h </u></em><u>(</u>the righteous predecessors) were upon, from the companions and the <em>taabi`een </em>and the most excellent generations and the Imaams. However, the problem lies in those people who say, “<em>They were men and we are men. And their speech has no distinction over our speech</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And he knows that they were upon the correct Islaam and upon the correct <em>eemaan</em> (true faith).” </strong></span>Just as He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَالسَّابِقُونَ الْأَوَّلُونَ مِنَ الْمُهَاجِرِينَ وَالْأَنصَارِ وَالَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوهُم بِإِحْسَانٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And the first and foremost ones from the <em>Muhaajireen</em> and the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em> and those who followed them upon goodness.</span> </strong>(Sooratut-Towbah (9), <em>aayah </em>100)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He `<em>alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu</em> <em>wassalaam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Adhere to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly guided orthodox Khulafaa after me.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever wants salvation then this is the path to it. And the one who does not want salvation will have whatever he chooses for himself but the harm is not restricted to him; rather, he will also carry the sins of the people along with his own sin. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>لِيَحْمِلُوا أَوْزَارَهُمْ كَامِلَةً يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ ۙ وَمِنْ أَوْزَارِ الَّذِينَ يُضِلُّونَهُم بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ ۗ أَلَا سَاءَ مَا يَزِرُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So they will carry their burdens of sin completely on the Day of Resurrection and they will carry from the sins of those whom they misled also without knowledge. Indeed what an evil burden they will bear! </strong></span>(Sooratun-Na<u>h</u>l (16), <em>aayah </em>25)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that the companions and the most excellent generations are the ones who were upon correct Islaam and the correct religion. So how can you abandon them and go instead for those for whom there is no guarantee that he is upon the correct religion and that he is upon the truth?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“So this person followed them in his religion and was at peace.”</span> </strong><em>Qalladahum</em>; meaning he followed them, <em>ittaba-’ahum</em>.</p>
<p><strong> وَالَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوهُم بِإِحْسَانٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>… and those who followed them upon good. </strong></span>(Sooratut-Towbah (9), <em>aayah </em>100)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is meant by <em>taqleed</em> here is <em>ittibaa</em>`; following.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And this person knows that the religion is just in following and that the ones to be followed are the companions of Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.” </strong></span>As we have mentioned, what is meant by <em>taqleed</em> here is correct <em>taqleed</em>; following, which is <em>ittibaa`</em> just as Yusuf `<em>alayhissalaam</em> said:</p>
<p><strong> إِنِّي تَرَكْتُ مِلَّةَ قَوْمٍ لَّا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَهُم بِالْآخِرَةِ هُمْ كَافِرُون</strong></p>
<p><strong>وَاتَّبَعْتُ مِلَّةَ آبَائِي إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">I have left the religion of a people who do not truly believe in and worship Allaah alone and who deny the Hereafter. And I have followed the religious way of my forefathers; Ibraaheem and Is<u>h</u>aaq and Ya`qoob.</span> </strong>(Soorah-Yusuf (12), <em>aayah </em>37 and 38)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>ittibaa</em>` (following) of the righteous predecessors (<em>Salaf-us-<u>S</u>aali<u>h)</u></em>, this is the truth and there is no blame at all for following them. Indeed blameworthiness is only for those who follow the people who are not deserving of being followed and who take as an example those who are not befitting to be taken as examples.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad in the <em>Musnad</em> and by al-Bazzaar in his <em>Musnad</em> and by at-Ta<u>h</u>aawiyy in <em>Shar<u>h</u> Mushkil ul-Aathaar</em> from a <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of Anas that he said: Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Before the Last Hour, there will be years of deception in which a liar will be believed and a truthful person will be taken to be a liar and in which a treacherous person will be trusted and in which a trustworthy person will be taken to be treacherous. And in it the <em>Ruwaybi<u>d</u>ah</em> will speak. So it was said, “Who are the <em>Ruwaybi<u>d</u>ah</em>?” So he said, “The little evil one who speaks about the public affairs.”</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafi<u>dh</u> ibn Katheer said in <em>an-Ni<u>h</u>aayah fil-Fitan w`al-Milaa<u>h</u>im</em>; its chain of narration is good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> As for one of the verifiers of the <em>Musnad</em> of Imaam A<u>h</u>mad; Shuayb al-Arna`ut, he said in his checking of the <em>Musnad</em> of A<u>h</u>mad, the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> is <em><u>h</u>asan</em>, this particular chain is weak as it contains Mu<u>h</u>ammad bin Is<u>h</u>aaq who is <em><u>h</u>asan</em> in <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> but he was a <em>mudallis</em> and he reports it here, he just says, “from”, he doesn’t say that he directly heard it from his Shaykh, he said, “from him”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As an addition to what occurs here, this <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> also occurs as a <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>, reported by Ibn Maajah (4,042) and by Al-<u>H</u>aakim and by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad also and declared <em><u>h</u>asan</em> by Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy in <em>A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (1,887) because it has a number of chains which support it. He also authenticates a <em>hadeeth</em> of Aws ibn Maalik <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> with a similar wording, reported by al-Bazzaar and a<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>abaraaniyy and he brings that in <em>A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>aheehah</em> (2,253).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> As for the explanation of <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> then he said, literally the beginning here that, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“the people of knowledge continue rebutting the saying of the Jahmiyyah until it was the <em>Khilaafah</em> of <em>Banul `Abbaas</em>,” </strong></span>he was here narrating the condition that was present and the <em>Khilaafah</em> of <em>Banul Abbaas</em>, the beginning of it was upon good but then the affairs changed after the year 200 when the <em>Khaleefah</em> Al-Ma`moon accepted the call of the Mu`tazilah and became convinced that the Qur&#8217;aan is something created and he called the People of Knowledge to accept this innovation and to accept this saying, which is <em>kufr </em>(disbelief).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, therefore fitnah; tremendous trial occurred, which continued from the year 200 onwards and for 12 years of the <em>Khilaafah</em> of Al-Ma`moon and Al-Mu`ta<u>s</u>im and Al-Waathiq until the <em>Khilaafah</em> was taken on by Al-Mutawakkil `ala-Allaah and then the People of the <em>Sunnah</em> and the <em>Jamaa</em>`<em>ah</em> and the carriers of <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> had some respite then and it was the People of Falsehood who were then curbed of doubt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, after Al-Mutawakkil passed away, after that time then the <em>Khaleefas</em> began to lose their authority and the <em>Khilaafah</em> became just a name without any reality. They became an outer form without a true reality behind it and that was because the Turks gained ascendancy and they took hold of the reality of authority and came to actually control the <em>Khulafaa</em>·. They could bring whoever they wanted and appoint him and they could kill this one as they wished and then after that authority passed away from the Turkish people and passed to <em>Banu Booyaa</em>. [Translator’s side point: <em>Banu Booyaa</em> ruled roughly from the year 325 AH till about the year 450 AH.]. Then to <em>Al-Jaraakisaa</em> (the Circassians) until the <em>Khilaafah</em> was ended in the year 656.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then the saying of `Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> was realised that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“We are a people who used to be the most humiliated people but then Allaah gave us strength and honour through Islaam so whenever we seek to attain honour by other than that which Allaah gave us honour through, then Allaah will humiliate us.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Al-<u>H</u>aakim in his <em>Mustadrak</em> and he declared it authentic from `Umar and likewise Ath-<u>Th</u>ahabee agreed.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad finished by saying, “Except for the fact that the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al-Jamaa`ah</em> and the people of <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> and the people of true `<em>aqeedah</em> have not ceased to be established upon their `<em>aqeedah</em>, not being harmed by whoever opposes them. And therefore, he (meaning the author; al-Barbahaaree <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) therefore made an exception by saying,<span style="color:#993300;"> <strong>“Except for those who remained firm upon the saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his command what he was upon and his prohibition…”</strong></span> to the end of the saying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Checking has preceded and the <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> as we had before was reported by at-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee and al-<u>H</u>aakim and others and declared <em><u>h</u>asan</em> by Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> <em><u>H</u>adeeth</em> being part of the famous <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of `Irbaa<u>d</u> ibn Saariyah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>, reported by A<u>h</u>mad and Aboo Daawood and Ibn Maajah and being declared <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> by Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5">[5]</a> Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> makes a point here, he said the point of slight objection to a wording, he said, the author’s saying here, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and you should know that the religion is just <em>taqleed</em>,” </strong></span>the point of objection is to be raised against here for the wording because <em>taqleed</em> means to follow without a proof. So if he had said the <em>deen</em> is <em>ittibaa</em>`; used this word, the religion is to follow the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and the Sunnah of His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> upon the understanding of the <em>Salaf</em> of this <em>ummah</em> from the companions and <em>taabi`een</em> and those who followed them upon good from the bearers of <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> and narrations. This wording would’ve been what is correct because it conforms to what Allaah has commanded with in His Book when He said:</p>
<p><strong>وَأَنَّ هَٰذَا صِرَاطِي مُسْتَقِيمًا فَاتَّبِعُوهُ ۖ وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا السُّبُلَ فَتَفَرَّقَ بِكُمْ عَن سَبِيلِهِ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ وَصَّاكُم بِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And this is My straight way so therefore follow it and do not follow the divergent paths, which will take you away from His path. He has enjoined you with that so that you are a people who are dutiful to Him.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-An`aam (6), <em>aayah</em> 153)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p><strong>اتَّبِعُوا مَا أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكُم مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا مِن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَاءَ ۗ قَلِيلًا مَّا تَذَكَّرُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Follow what is being sent down to you from your Lord and do not follow any others besides Him in disobedience to Allaah. Little it is that you take admonition.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah</em> 3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>ittibaa</em>`; following for the <em>Salaf</em>, those who were before us; upon the narration, upon proof, upon the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, this is the truth and Allaah is the one who grants success.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَهُوَ الْقَاهِرُ فَوْقَ عِبَادِهِ</strong><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He</strong> [Allaah] is <strong><em>al-Qaahir</em></strong> </span><span style="color:#008000;"><em> </em><strong>above His slaves</strong>.</span><br />
[Qur’aan<em>, Soorat Al-An’aam </em>(6:18)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allaah is <em>al-Qaahir</em></strong>: The Most Mighty and the Magnificent, is <strong>dominant</strong> over all his slaves being Himself above creation, the Ever-living, the Mighty, and the AllPowerful. He is the One who <strong>subdued</strong> all of his creatures; everything in the upper and lower worlds is subservient to His Will, and Authority; whatever He willed to happen will certainly occur and as He wanted it to be, and whatever He willed not to occur will never take place; All creatures are in need of Him, they have no control of good or harm to themselves; nor can they control death nor life nor Resurrection. The most powerful creature is nothing before the domination and power of Allaah, the AllMighty; the creatures which people have taken as “gods” besides Allaah, cannot protect themselves let alone to dominate others. Allaah, the perfect is His domination deserves to be worshipped alone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allaah</strong> is the ‘<em>alam</em> (identifying name or title) of the majestic, sole, and true God. This noun, which is the name of Allaah, applies to none other than Him. He, Most Majestic and High, has other names all of which follow on from His name Allaah. The meaning of the name “Allaah” is the <em>ma’looh</em> (that which is worshipped out of love, magnification, deification, and longing).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[See Shaykh Muhammad Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s <em>Sharhul ‘Aqeedah Al-Waasitiyyah</em> (Dammaam, KSA: Daar Ibnul Jawzi, 2d. ed. 1415/1994], p. 38, and <em>Sharh Lum’at Al-’Itiqaad</em> (<em>Ismaa’eeliyyah</em>, Egypt: MaktabatulImaam al-Bukhaari (checked by Ashraf Maqsood), 1412/1992)], p. 29.]</span></p>
<p><b>Source</b> : From the eBook: <b><a href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Tafseer Ayatul-Kursi</a></b> – By Shaykh Muhammad bin Saalih Al-’Uthaymeen (<em>rahimahullah</em>). With Related Points of Benefit From the Shaykh’s Commentary on Imaam ibn Taymeeyah’s <em>Sharhul ’Aqeedatil-Waasitiyyah</em>, Prepared by Dr. Saleh As-Saleh (<em>rahimahullah</em>)</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the name <em>Allaah,</em> <strong>Ibn ul-Qayyim</strong> said in <em>Midaarij us-Saalikeen:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“The name <em>Allaah</em> indicates all of the perfect names and lofty attributes in all three ways of indication since it indicates His Divinity, which indicates affirmation of all the characteristics of divinity for Him along with negation of their opposites for Him. So, the attributes of divinity are the attributes of perfection being free from any likeness with the creation and free of any deficiency or imperfection.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the author of the explainer of <em>Kitaab at-Tawheed</em> in <em>Tayseer ul-`Azeez al-<u>H</u>ameed</em>, brings a quote from Ibn ul-Qayyim also with regard to the excellent qualities of the name <em>Allaah</em> that Ibn ul-Qayyim <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the particular virtues of the meaning of this name <em>Allaah</em> then in this regard the most knowledgeable of the creation <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> himself said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“I could not praise You enough as You deserve, You are as You have praised Yourself.”</span></strong></p>
<p>[Reported by Muslim from the <u>h</u>adeeth of A’ishah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anha</em>.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, so how could we enumerate the special virtues of the name of the One Who comprises every perfection unrestrictedly and every praise and commendation and every laudation and exaltation and all splendour and all perfection and all glory and all beauty and all good and all eminence and all generosity, excellence and goodness is for Him and is from Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this name <em>Allaah</em> is not mentioned upon a small amount of something except that it causes it to increase. Nor is it mentioned in a state of fear except that it removes it. Nor is it mentioned upon any misfortune except that it relieves it. Nor in any state of anxiety and distress except that it brings relief. Nor upon any state of difficulty except that it brings ease to it. None who is weak resorts to it except that it brings strength to him. Nor anyone in a state of humiliation except that it brings honour to him. Nor anyone in poverty except that he is enriched. Nor anyone who feels estranged and uneasy except that it causes him to feel at ease. Nor is it mentioned by one who has been overcome except that it brings aid and victory for him. Nor by one who is in straitened circumstances except that his difficulty is removed. Nor is it mentioned by a fugitive except that he finds refuge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is the name, meaning Allaah’s name <em>Allaah</em>, it is the name through which distress is removed through which the descent of blessings is sought and through which supplications are answered. Through it slips are corrected, sins are warded away and good deeds are brought closer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the name with which the earth and heavens were established and with which the revealed books were sent down and with which the messengers were sent. With it the legislated laws were prescribed, through it the prescribed punishments were established and with it <em>jihaad</em> was prescribed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Through this name the creation will become divided into the fortunate and the wretched. With it the true and tremendous day is established and with it, the scales of justice are set up, the bridge laid down and the Paradise and the Fire established. With it, the Lord of all creation is worshipped and praised, for its right the messengers were sent and it will be asked about in the grave and for it, there will be the resurrection. Dispute is regarding it and judgement is to it and alliance and enmity are for it. Through it those who know it and establish its rights will be the fortunate ones and through it those who are ignorant of it and leave its rights will be the wretched ones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is the reason for creation and command and through it, they are established and confirmed and to it they arrive at a conclusion. So, the creation comes about through it, returns to it and exists because of it. So, there is nothing in creation and no command nor reward and no punishment except that it starts from it and ends with it. That is what brings it about and its reason. Then he quotes the <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>رَبَّنَا مَا خَلَقْتَ هَٰذَا بَاطِلًا سُبْحَانَكَ فَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O our Lord, You have not created all of this without purpose, free and far removed are You from that. So save us from the punishment of the Fire.</span> </strong> (Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah</em> 191)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then with regard to the name <strong>الله</strong>  <em>Allaah</em>, brief indication of the meaning which is – <strong>t</strong><strong>he One Who is truly venerated and worshipped, the One deserving that He be singled out with all worship because of His perfect attributes of divinity.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"> <strong>الرَّحْمَان</strong> <strong><em>Ar-Rahmaan</em></strong> (the Extremely Merciful), the Merciful One Who has as His attribute mercy, the One possessing tremendous and extensive mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <strong>الرَّحِيم</strong>  <strong><em>Ar-Raheem</em></strong> (the Bestower of mercy), the One Who has mercy upon the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As the verifier has mentioned, the difference between <em>Ar-Rahmaan </em>and <em>Ar-Raheem</em> is <em>Ar-Rahmaan</em> is with regard to the attribute of Allaah’s self, the attribute He has Himself of extreme mercy and <em>Ar-Raheem</em> is His bestowing mercy upon the creation with regard to His action.</p>
<p><strong>[Source</strong>: <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2018/01/28/the-ninety-nine-names-of-allaah/">The Ninety-Nine Names of Allaah </a>– Dawud Burbank [Audio|En] &amp; Transcribed PDF]</p>
<p><strong>&#8212;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><strong>ar-Rahmaan</strong></em> (The One Who is Most Merciful): This is one of Allaah’s particular names and which denotes the attribute of very great and extensive mercy that exists with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">[<span style="color:#808080;">See Ibnul Qayyim’s Badaai’ Al-Fawaa’id (Beirut, Lebanon: Daarul Khayr, 1st. ed. 1414/1994)], vol. 1, pp. 23-24, and Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s Sharhul <em>‘Aqeedah Al-Waasitiyyah</em>, ibid.</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>ar-Raheem</strong> (The One Who Bestows Mercy): This name denotes that the attribute is related to the <em>marhoom</em> (i.e. the one whom Allaah chooses to receive His <em>Rahmah</em> (Mercy).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the difference between <em>ar-Rahmaan</em> and ar-Raheem is that in the case of the former, <em>ar-Rahmah</em> is His attribute, and in the latter, <em>ar-Rahmah</em> is His act, meaning that He is the One Who bestows <em>ar-Rahmah</em> upon others. So, when both names come together [i.e. <em>ar-Rahmaan</em>, <em>ar-Raheem</em>], then the meaning in this context is that Allaah’s Mercy is very great and extensive, and that His Mercy reaches His creation. This is what is meant by those who say that <em>ar-Rahmaan</em> is the One Whose Mercy encompasses everything (general Mercy), and <em>ar-Raheem</em> is the One who has Mercy upon the believers (special Mercy). Since Allaah’s Mercy upon the <em>kaafir</em> is a special one in this life only, then it is as if they have no mercy upon them, because in the Hereafter when they will ask Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) to save them from Hell and admit being wrong, Allaah will deal with them with His Justice, not His Mercy, Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>اخْسَئُوا فِيهَا وَلَا تُكَلِّمُونِ</strong><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Remain you in it [Hell] with ignominy! And speak not to Me!”</strong></span><br />
[Qur’aan, <em>Soorat Al-Mu’minoon</em> (23:108)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The name <em>ar-Raheem</em> is applied to Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) and may be applied to others. Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) has described His Messenger Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) as <em>Raheem</em> (Soorat At-Tawbah, 9:128).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer (رحمه االله) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“Some of the names of Allaah تعالى are restricted to Him only like the names: Allaah, <em>ar-Rahmaan</em>, <em>al-Khaaliq</em>, <em>ar-Raaziq</em> and so forth. Some other names, however, may be applied to other than Him.” </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[See <em>Badaai’ Al-Fawaa’id</em>, p. 24, <em>Sharhul ‘Aqeedah Al-Waasitiyyah</em>, pp. 38-39, <em>Lum’atul I’tiqaad</em>, p. 29, <em>Tafseer Ibn Katheer</em> (1:21), <em>Sharh Thalaathat Al-Usool</em> within Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s <em>Majmoo’ Fataawaa</em> (Riyadh, KSA: Daar Ath-Thuraya, 1st. ed. 1414/1993)], vol. 6, p. 11.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following is excerpted from the Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s explanation of <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Aayatul-Kursi</a>, Translated by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/audio-saleh-as-saleh/">Dr. Saleh as-Saleh</a> rahimahullaah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong>Six</strong>]: In the sixth statement, Allaah (تعالى) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلَّا بِمَا شَاءَ</strong><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He wills.<br />
</strong></span>[Qur’aan, Aayatul-Kursi , Surah Al-Baqarah 2:255]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The pronoun of the verb { <strong>يُحِيطُونَ </strong>}<strong> &#8220;compass</strong>” refers to either all that is in the heavens and the earth or to the letter haa’ (ـهـ) in Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{ <strong>مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ</strong> ] “<strong>What happens to them [the creatures] in the future and what happened to them in the past</strong>.” In the latter case, the meaning would be “Those who Allaah knows what happens to them in the future and what happened to them in the past, will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He Wills.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this statement, Allaah (تعالى) makes clear the perfection of His knowledge and the imperfection of the creature’s knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And thus, He (تعالى) compares His Attributes to that of His ‘<em>ibaad</em> in order that His perfection and the imperfection of the creatures become clearly evident. This is also clear in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>كُلُّ مَنْ عَلَيْهَا فَانٍ</strong><br />
<strong>وَيَبْقَىٰ وَجْهُ رَبِّكَ ذُو الْجَلَالِ وَالْإِكْرَامِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Whatsoever on it </strong>(the earth)<strong> will perish. And the Face of your <em>Rabb</em>, full of Majesty and Honour will abide forever.</strong></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Ar-Rahmaan (55:26-27)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As far as the word ‘<em>ilm</em> (knowledge) in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <strong>عِلْمِهِ </strong>]<br />
“<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>His Knowledge</strong></span>,”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">it is an infinitive (verbal noun) denoting either</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) the ‘<em>ilm</em> of His <em>thaat</em> (Essence) and <em>sifaat</em> (Attributes), or<br />
(b) His <em>ma’loom</em> (What Allaah Knows).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, the meaning of the aayah: {<strong>وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلَّا بِمَا شَاءَ</strong>} &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He wills</strong></span>&#8220;, means either</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) that we do not know anything about Allaah, His <em>thaat</em>, and His <em>sifaat</em> except that which He willed for us to know, or</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) that we do not know of what Allaah knows except that which He willed to be known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The aayah implies both meanings, and both are correct since we do not know of Allaah’s <em>thaat</em> or <em>sifaat</em> except that which He willed for us to know. Indeed, He is the One Who made it known to us that He ascended upon the ‘<em>arsh</em> (Throne); and He is the One Who taught us on the tongue of His Messenger [Muhammad صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم] that He descends to the lowest heaven [in the last third of the night]; and this is the case with the rest of His <em>sifaat</em>: We have no knowledge of them except that He wills. Similarly, what Allaah knows regarding what is in the heavens and what is on the earth, our knowledge thereof is restricted to that which He willed for us to know. After all, He is the One Who informed us of the existence of the angels in the heavens and that there are seven heavens. So it is with respect to the rest of what Allaah knows, we are aware of that which He willed for us to know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even that which He has made known, many of us are unaware of it; the knowledge thereof are attained only if He wills. In the human being, there are many things which people [i.e. scientists] are not yet fully aware of. They gradually attained the knowledge that they knew not before. So, the aayah comprises both of the meanings discussed above.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus we do not know anything of what Allaah knows even that which concerns ourselves except that which He wills, and that we do not compass anything about Allaah’s <em>thaat</em> and <em>sifaat</em> except that which He wills. Therefore, whatever Allaah wills for His creatures to know, whether in relation to His <em>thaat</em>, <em>sifaat</em>, <em>asmaa</em>’ (Names), or Actions; or with respect to His creation or His legal ways which He revealed to His Messengers, then He (تعالى) will make it known for them.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following is excerpted from the Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s explanation of <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Aayatul-Kursi</a>, Translated by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/audio-saleh-as-saleh/">Dr. Saleh as-Saleh</a> rahimahullaah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Five]: Then Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى ) said in the Fifth Statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And Allaah Knows what happens to them (His creatures) in this world, and what will happen to them in the Hereafter.<br />
</strong></span>[Qur’aan, Aayatul-Kursi , Surah Al-Baqarah 2:255]<span style="color:#008000;"><strong><br />
</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowledge, according to the scholars of <em>usool</em> (the fundamental principles of <em>deen</em>), is the definitive comprehension of a thing in conformity with its true nature.Thus, the lack of comprehension is ignorance, the indecisive comprehension is doubt, and the assertive comprehension that does not concur with reality is compounded ignorance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, if you were asked, “When did the expedition of Badr [59] take place?” And you say, “I do not know,” then this is <strong>ignorance</strong>. If you were asked the same question and you said, “It happened in the second or the third year of <em>hijrah</em>,” then this is <strong>doubt</strong>.[60] And if your answer to the same question was, “The fifth year,” then this is <strong>compounded ignorance</strong>.[61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most Mighty and Most Majestic, knows things comprehensively and with perfection, overall and in detail. His knowledge is unlike the knowledge of ‘<em>ibaad</em>. That is why He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ</strong></span><br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And Allaah knows what happens to them [the creatures] in the future and what happened to them in the past.</span></strong>[62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The conjunctive noun {<strong>ما</strong>} is a form of generalization (gram.) This comprises everything be it small or great, or whether it is from the actions of Allaah or from the creatures’ deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowing what happens to them in the future implies that Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) is not unaware of the future, and that His knowledge of the past necessitates that He does not forget the past. That is why when Fir’awn said to Mûsa (<em>alaihissalam</em>):</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#008000;">قَالَ فَمَا بَالُ الْقُرُونِ الْأُولَىٰ</span><br />
</strong><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“What about the generations of the old?”</strong> </span>[Qur’aan, Soorat Taha (20:51)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mûsa (<em>alaihissalam</em>) replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>قَالَ عِلْمُهَا عِندَ رَبِّي فِي كِتَابٍ ۖ لَّا يَضِلُّ رَبِّي وَلَا يَنسَى</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The knowledge thereof is with my Rabb, in a Record. My Rabb is neither unaware nor He forgets.</strong></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Taha (20:52)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) is neither unaware of the future nor does He forget the past.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[59] The Battle of Badr occurred between the army of the believers lead by Prophet Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and the polytheists of Quarysh and it took place on the 17th of Ramadaan of the second year of Hijrah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[60] Because you give another answer, which you think has the same possibility of being the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[61] This is known as <em><strong>al-jahlul-murakkab</strong></em>, which is to comprehend something in a way contrary to its true reality. [See Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s <em>Sharh Thalaathat Al-Usool</em> (Burmingham, UK: Al-Hidaayah Publication, 1st. ed. 1418/1997)], p. 37.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[62] This is one of the meanings of this great aayah. It signifies that Allaah’s knowledge encompasses everything in the past, present, and the future; nothing escapes Allaah’s knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Note</strong>: One of the Names of Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>العليم</strong> </span><strong>al-&#8216;Aleem</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The One Who knows what has been and what will be; Who ever has known, and ever will know, what has been and what will be; His knowledge comprehends all things, the covert and the overt, the small thereof and the great, the possible and the impossible, the lofty and lower spheres, etc. in the most complete manner. Nothing is concealed from Him in the earth or in the heavens.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following is excerpted from the Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s explanation of <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Aayatul-Kursi</a>, Translated by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/audio-saleh-as-saleh/">Dr. Saleh as-Saleh</a> rahimahullaah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Seven]: Then Allaah, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong> وَسِعَ كُرْسِيُّهُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ ۖ وَلَا يَئُودُهُ حِفْظُهُمَا ۚ وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْعَظِيمُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>His kursi extends over the heavens and the earth encompassing them all, He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them. And He is the Most High, the Most Great.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>kursi</em> [literally: footstool] is <em>mawdi’ul qadamayn</em> (place of the Feet) of Allaah, Most Mighty and Most Majestic, and it is before the ‘<em>arsh</em> like a front to it. This was authentically related by ibn ‘Abbaas (رضي االله عنهما) in a <em>mawqoof</em> [63] type of narration. This is agreed upon by the majority of <em>ahlussunnah wal jamaa’ah</em>. In fact, this is asserted by Shaykh-ulIslam Ibn Taymeeyah, [Imaam] Ibnul Qayyim, and others from the people of knowledge and from the verifying scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some have said that <em>al-kursi</em> is the ‘<em>arsh</em> itself. However, this is not true because the ‘<em>arsh</em> is greater, more spacious, and more profound in its extent of encompassing than <em>al-kursi</em>. It has also been narrated on the authority of ibn ‘Abbaas (رضي االله عنهما) that <em>al-kursi</em> represents Allaah’s Knowledge. But I do not think that this narration is authentic because this meaning (i.e. knowledge) is not the true meaning for the word al-kursi in the classical Arabic language nor in the common (‘urfi) language. In fact, it is very unlikely that this transmission from ibn ‘Abbaas (رضي االله عنهما) is an authentic one [64]. Hence, <em>al-kursi</em> is <em>mawdi’ul qadamayan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The greatness of <em>al-kursi</em> is clearly stated in the hadeeth in which the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The seven heavens and the seven earths by the side of <em>al-kursi</em> are naught but as a ring thrown down in a desert land, and such is <em>al-kursi</em> with respect to <em>al-’Arsh</em> (the Throne).”</strong></span> [65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth indicates the vastness of these immense creations and which are, with respect to us, from the world of <em>al-ghayb</em>. That is why Allaah سبحانه و تعالى says:</p>
<p><strong>أَفَلَمْ يَنظُرُوا إِلَى السَّمَاءِ فَوْقَهُمْ كَيْفَ بَنَيْنَاهَا وَزَيَّنَّاهَا وَمَا لَهَا مِن فُرُوجٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Have they not looked at the heavens above them, how We have made it and adorned it, and there are no rifts in it.</strong></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Qaaf (50:6)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He سبحانه و تعالى did not say: “<strong>Have they not looked at al-kursi (or al- ‘arsh)&#8230;</strong>,” because this is something that is not seen by us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Had it not been that Allaah had informed us about it (<em>al-kursi</em> or <em>al-‘arsh</em>), we would not have known of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s saying: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>His kursi extends over and encompasses the heavens and the earth&#8221;</strong></span>, supports the opinion held by Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymeeyah and by other verifying scholars that the heavens and the earths all have a spherical shape, because this is a matter acknowledged by sensory perception, and through information, though the latter method may have been hidden from many of the preceding people. The proof for this from the Qur’aan is in the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>إِذَا السَّمَاءُ انشَقَّتْ</strong><br />
<strong>وَأَذِنَتْ لِرَبِّهَا وَحُقَّتْ</strong><br />
<strong>وَإِذَا الْأَرْضُ مُدَّتْ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">When the heaven is split asunder [on the Day of Resurrection], and listens and obeys its Rabb,—and it must do so; And when the earth is stretched forth&#8230;</span></strong>[Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Inshiqaaq (84:1-3)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s saying: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And when the earth is stretched forth,&#8221;</span> </strong>necessitates that it is now unstretched. In addition, the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said that on the Day of Resurrection, the earth will be stretched forth like stretched leather, the example of which is drawn for emphasis. [66]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another proof is the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p><strong>يُكَوِّرُ اللَّيْلَ عَلَى النَّهَارِ وَيُكَوِّرُ النَّهَارَ عَلَى اللَّيْلِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong><em>Yukawwiru</em> the night around the day </strong>[making it to be a covering upon the day]<strong> and <em>Yukawwiru</em> the day around the night.</strong></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Az-Zumar (39:5)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Yukawiru</em> means: “to wind round,”[67] like in our saying, “the <em>akwaar</em> (singl. <em>kawr</em>) of the turban,” meaning the turns of the turban upon the head.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We know that the day and night succeed each other upon earth and in doing so, this entails that the earth is spherical, because a thing would not be wound around in a round form except upon something ball-shaped. Nowadays, it is witnessed that the earth is spherical in form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fact that <em>al-kursi</em> extends over and encompasses the heavens and the earth is evidence that it is wound round in a round form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding <em>al-‘arsh</em>, it has been reported that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) described it as being like a dome above the heavens.[68] The dome-shape being round but neither fully spherical nor flat, and its middle is high like that of a tent. [69]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, Allaah, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَلَا يَئُودُهُ حِفْظُهُمَا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He</strong> [Allaah سبحانه و تعالى]<strong> feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them </strong>[i.e. the heavens and the earths]<strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This attribute of Allaah [feeling no fatigue] is an Attribute of negation. So, what are the Attributes required for guarding and preserving [the heavens and the earths] such that we know that this negation [of fatigue] is in fact an affirmation of their perfection? It is essential that the guarding and preserving require Life, Knowledge, Ability, Might, Mercy, and possibly other attributes. What is important is that the negation implies the perfection of Allaah’s Knowledge, Ability, Might, and Mercy as well as the other related Attributes that are entailed by His (سبحانه و تعالى) preserving and guarding.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[63] <em>Mawqoof</em>: lit. “stopped”. It is a narration from a companion only. The hadeeth attributed to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) is called <em>marfoo</em>’. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) commented, “Had it not been that Ibn ‘Abbaas (رضي االله عنهما) is one whom it is said that he takes from the Israelite transmissions (<em>israa’eeliyyaat</em>: narrations from the traditions of the People of the Book), we would have said that this transmission (regarding <em>al-kursi</em>) takes the form of <em>marfoo</em>’ tradition, because it deals with knowledge of <em>al-ghayb</em> (the world of unperceived realities). When it comes to this kind of knowledge, there is no room for <em>ijtihaad</em> (scholarly deductions). When a <em>sahaabi</em> (companion) says or does something which is not within the scope of <em>ijtihaad</em>, then it takes the <em>marfoo</em>’ type of tradition. The exception, however, is that if the narration from the <em>sahaabi</em> is of the form of <em>akhbaar</em> (news telling, relating information), then, if it is known that a <em>sahaabi</em> narrates from Bani Israa’eel, his transmission would not be <em>marfoo</em>’ because of the possibility that its source may be from Bani Israa’eel (an Israelite transmission). Knowing that the scholars are scrupulous in their inspection of what is attributed to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), they do not rule that a particular transmission is <em>marfoo</em>’ except when all of the possibilities that may hinder this ruling are ruled out.” Tafseer Aayat Al-Kursi, pp. 19-20.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Note: This report from Ibn ‘Abbaas is related by ‘Abdullaah Ibn al-Imaam Ahmad (As-Sunnah: 586), Ibn Abee Shaybah (al-&#8216;Arsh: 61), Ibn Khuzaymah (At-Tawheed: 248), and by alHaakim (Al-Mustadrak: 2:282) who said it is saheeh according to the conditions of alBukhaari and Muslim. Imaam ath-Thahabi agreed to the authentication of al-Haakim. Ad-Daaraqutni reported it in his book As-Sifaat (36) as mawqoof from Ibn ‘Abbaas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani said: “Its <em>isnaad</em> is <em>saheeh</em>, and its narrators are all reliable.” (Mukhtasar Al-’Uluw: 45).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[64] Shaykeh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymeeyah (Al-Fataawaa, 6:584), and Shaykh al-Albaani (AsSilsilah As-Saheehah, no. 109), stated the weakness of this narration from Ibn ‘Abbaas (رضي االله عنهما).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[65] Reported by Ibn Abee Shaybah (Al-&#8216;Arsh, 58), and by Al-Baihaqi (Al-Asmaa’ wasSifaat, 862) with both narrations being from the way of Abee Thar (radhi Allaahu anhu). Shaykh al-Albaani (As-Silsilah As-Saheehah, no. 109) stated that there is no single authentic hadeeth attributed to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) regarding <em>al-kursi</em> except this one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[66] Reported by Ibn Jareer at-Tabari (Tafseer at-Tabari, 30:115-116) on the authority of ‘Ali Ibn al-Hussain. The transmission, however, is mursal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Note: A hadeeth is categorized as <em>mursal</em> when the link between the <em>taabi’ee</em> (successor of the <em>sahaabah</em>) and the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) is missing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[67] The infinitive noun is <em>takweer</em>, which means to round a thing in a round form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[68] This has been reported in Sunan Abee Daawood (English Translation), no. 4708 and in the Sunnah by Ibn Abee ‘Aasim, no. 575, and by others. There is disagreement regarding the authenticity of its isnaad. Imaam ath-Thahabai and other scholars of hadeeth including al-Albaani graded its isnaad as weak. Imaam Ibn al-Aye supported its authenticity. The text describing al-&#8216;Arsh as a dome over the heavens is supported by the context of an authentic narration reported by Imaam al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh (Arabic/English), vol. 9, no. 519 and in which the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“There are one-hundred degrees in al-Jannah which Allaah has prepared for those who carry on jihaad in His Cause. The distance between every two degrees is like the distance between the sky and the earth, so if you ask Allaah for anything, ask Him for the Firdaws for it is the middle and highest part of al-Jannah and at its top is al-&#8216;Arsh of ar-Rahmaan (Allaah), and from it gush forth the rivers of al-Jannah.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The &#8216;Arsh being the roof of the Firdaws, which is the middle and highest part of alJannah, indicates that it has a dome-shape because a thing cannot be at the middle and at its highest point (peak) unless it is round. [See Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymeeyah’s <em>Al-Fataawaa</em>, vol. 5, pp. 150-155, and the book of <em>Al-&#8216;Arsh</em> by Muhammad Ibn ‘Uthmaan Ibn Abee Shaybah (Riyadh, KSA: Maktabat ar-Rushd (checked by Dr. Muhammad Ibn Khaleefah at-Tameemi), 1418/1998), p. 333].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[69] This is based upon additional explanation of the translated text which the author, Shaykh Ibn ’Uthaymeen, may Allaah&#8217;s Mercy be upon him, directly related to me on Wednesday the 16th of Safar 1419Hj, corresponding to the 10th of June 1998. He stated that this explanation fits with that of the hadeeth on the Firdaws as mentioned above. And Allaah knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><em>The following is excerpted from the Shaykh Uthaymeen’s explanation of <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Aayatul-Kursi</a>, Translated by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/audio-saleh-as-saleh/">Dr. Saleh as-Saleh</a> rahimahullaah</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <i>aayah</i> contains <i>ismullaahi al-aa’tham</i> (Allaah’s Most Greatest Name) affirmed in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[<b> الحيُّ الَقيُّوم</b> ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>Allaah, there is no god worthy of worship except He, the one who possesses the perfect living, and Who is established on His Own, Self-subsisting, and by Whom all things subsist.</b></span>[88]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These two Names were mentioned in three places in the Qur’aan, in the two soorahs known as <i>az-zahraawayn</i> [89] (AlBaqarah and Aal-’Imran), and in Soorat <i>Taha</i>.[90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of <i>‘ilm</i> (<i>ahlul-‘ilm</i>) said: The Most Great Name of Allaah is only in these two Names since they comprise the Most Beautiful Names in their entirety, and hence the attribute of Perfection is implied in the Name [ <b>الحيُّ </b>]and the attribute of <i>ihsaan</i> (beauty) is entailed in the Name: [ <b>الَقيُّوم</b>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[88] Allaah is the one who sustains, protects, prepares, and runs the affairs of all things as He wills in accordance with His Knowledge, Wisdom, and Justice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[89] <em>Zahraawayn</em> (dual form of <em>zahra</em>): The bright ones. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><b>“Recite the Qur’aan, for on the Day of Resurrection it will come as an intercessor for those who recite it. Recite the two bright ones, Al-Baqarah and Soorat Aal-’Imraan, for on the Day of Resurrection they will come as two clouds or two shades, or two flocks of birds in ranks, pleading for those who recite them. Recite Soorat Al-Baqarah, for to take recourse to it is a blessing and to give it up is a cause of grief, and the magicians cannot confront it.”</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported in <em>Saheeh Muslim</em> (English Translation), vol. 2, no. 1757.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[90] In Al-Baqarah (2:255), in Aal-’Imraan (3:2), and in Taha (20:111).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Umaamah (رضي االله عنه) reported that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><b>“Allaah’s Most Great Name is in three soorahs in the Qur’aan, in Soorat Al-Baqarah and in Aal-’Imraan and in Soorat Taha.”</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Qaasim bin ‘Abdur-Rahmaan, one of the narrators of this hadeeth, searched the Qur’aan and found</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Aaytul-Kursi in Soorat Al-Baqarah (2:255):<br />
<strong>[ االلهُ لا إله إلاَّ ُ هوَ الحَيُّ القَيُّوم ]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">And in Soorat Aal-’Imraan (3:2):<br />
<strong>[ اللَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الْحَيُّ الْقَيُّومُ ]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">And in Soorat Taha (20:111)<br />
<strong>[ وَعَنَتِ الْوُجُوهُ لِلْحَيِّ الْقَيُّومِ ]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by al-Haakim, Ibn Maajah, at-Tabarani, at-Tahaawi, and others. Shaykh al-Albaani authenticated its isnaad (<i>As-Silsilah As-Saheeha</i>), vol. 2, no. 746.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following is excerpted from the Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s explanation of <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Aayatul-Kursi</a>, Translated by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/audio-saleh-as-saleh/">Dr. Saleh as-Saleh</a> rahimahullaah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[FOURTH]: In the fourth statement, Allaah, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>مَن ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ<br />
Who is it that can intercede with Him except with His Permission?</strong></span><br />
[Qur’aan, Aayatul-Kursi , Surah Al-Baqarah 2:255]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word { ْ<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>مَن</strong></span> } &#8220;Who” is an interrogative noun [46] and the intended use of the interrogation in the sentence is to assert the <strong>negation</strong> [that there is none who can intercede] as evident in the <strong>affirmation</strong> phrase which followed it: { ِ<span style="color:#008000;"><strong> إإِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</strong> </span> } “<strong>Except with His Permission</strong>.” Whenever a negation takes the form of an interrogative construct, then the statement is infused with the meaning of challenge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Intercession (<em>Ash-Shafaa’ah</em>):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">{ <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>يَشْفَعُ </strong> </span>}<br />
“<strong>Intercedes</strong>,”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">know that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 . Linguistically, the term “<em>shafaa’ah</em>” means to make an odd number an even one.[47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 . Traditionally, it refers to the laying of a petition (interceding, mediating) with someone in favor of another, in procuring a benefit or warding off harm. Thus the <em>shafaa’ah</em> of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) for <em>ahlul-mawqif</em> [48] after the worry and distress which befalls them and which they are unable to bear is an intercession to ward off a harm. On the other hand, the Prophet’s <em>shafaa’ah</em> for <em>ahlul-Jannah</em> [49] to enter <em>al-Jannah</em> is aimed at procuring a benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. None can intercede except by Allaah’s Permission: { <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</strong></span> } His Leave is <em>kawni</em>. [50] Even Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) who has the greatest rank with Allaah cannot intercede except with the prior leave from Allaah. He will be granted this permission after he (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) prostrates before Allaah and praises Him with the great praises and glorifications which Allaah guides him to it on that day. Then it will be said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8220;ارفع رأسك وقل يُسمَع واشفَعْ تُشَف َّع.&#8221;<br />
<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Raise your head and speak; you will be listened to, intercede and your intercession will be accepted.”</strong> </span>[51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[It is known] that no one have a rank with Allaah greater than that of the Messenger [Muhammad صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم], nevertheless, he (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) cannot intercede except with the prior leave of Allaah. It is so because of Allaah, Most Majestic and Most High’s, perfection of Authority and <em>hayybah</em>.[52] The more a king’s authority becomes fully established, the more reverent and respected he becomes. People would not even speak in his court unless he speaks. Consider the Prophet’s (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) relation with his companions and which Quraysh’s [53] emissary [‘Urwah bin Mas’oud] described [after finalizing the treaty of AlHudaybiyah]: &#8220;<em>And when they spoke to him they would lower their voices</em>.&#8221; [54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this is out of respect. You find that if a king is revered by his flock, then no one can speak in his court and in his presence because of the might of his authority. [55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[The Conditions of Confirmed Intercession]:</strong></span> [56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, (تعالى ), has made it clear that He does not permit intercession except for the one whom He approves of and whose word is acceptable to Him, and for the one He is pleased with and on whose behalf intercession shall be made. It is inevitable that Allaah is pleased with <em>ash-shaafi</em>’, the intercessor, and al-<em>mashfoo’i lahu</em>, the one on whose behalf intercession is sought.[57] Consequently, the idols of the polytheists could not intercede on their behalf with Allaah because Allaah does not approve of them. The Prophets and the righteous do not intercede on behalf of the polytheists because the latter are not approved with Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, the conditions for the confirmed <em>shafaa’ah</em> are three:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Allaah’s permission of it.<br />
2. Allaah being pleased with the <em>shaafi</em>’.<br />
3. His approval of the one on whose behalf intercession is sought (<em>al-mashfoo’i lahu</em>).[58]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[46] In the grammatical sense, the noun { ْ<strong>مَن</strong> ] is the subject, and the term { <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>ذَا</strong> </span>] is omitted for being redundant. The term { <strong>الَّذِي</strong> } &#8220;<em>he that</em>&#8221; is a relative pronoun standing as the predicate of the subject {مَن } &#8220;<em>Who</em>.” [Author’s note].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[47] Allaah (تعالى) said: { <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>وَالشَّفْعِ وَالْوَتْرِ </strong></span> }, [which means], <strong>And by the <em>shaf’a</em></strong> (even) <strong>and the <em>witr</em> </strong>(odd) [of all the creations of Allaah]. [Qur’aan <em>Soorat Al-Fajr</em> (89:3)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[48] <strong>Ahlul-Mawqif:</strong> All human beings gathered on one plane on the Day of Resurrection awaiting their accounts to be taken by Allaah. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said, “<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The sun will come so close to the people that they will suffer such distress and trouble as they will not be able to tolerate it or to bear it</strong></span>.” The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) intercedes with Allaah to pronounce His Judgment among the people of <em>al-Mawqif</em>. They will be relieved from their long standing by virtue of his interceding with Allaah on their behalf. [See <em>Saheeh alBukhaari</em> (Arabic/English)], vol. 6, no. 236.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[49] <em>Ahlul-Jannah:</em> The believers who will be admitted to reside forever in <em>al-Jannah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[50] <em><strong>Kawni</strong></em>: Pertaining to the Universal Will of Allaah, the Most Majestic and Most Magnificent, and which is in accordance with His Foreknowledge and Wisdom. Creation, provisions, life, death, permission to intercede, and so forth exists by the Will of Allaah. Everything that Allaah Wills is certain to occur. He Willed that <em>eemaan</em> (belief in Allaah) and <em>kufr</em> (disbelief) occur, although He Loves <em>eemaan</em> and Hates <em>kufr</em>. On the other hand, the Legislative Decree (<em>al-hukm ash-shar’i</em>) comprises the Revealed Laws (<em>sharee’ah</em>) which the Messengers came with and what is stated in the Revealed Scriptures. Under this Decree, Allaah Loves that mankind believe in Him (<em>eemaan</em>) and does not Love for them to commit <em>kufr</em>. Mankind, however, may or may not believe in Allaah. In short, under His Universal Will, everything Allaah Wills is certain to pass while under the Legislative Will, what is beloved to Allaah may or may not take place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[51] Part of a long and agreed upon <em>hadeeth</em>. [See <em>Saheeh al-Bukhaari</em> (Arabic/ English)], vol. 6, no. 3 and no. 236.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[52] <em>Hayybah</em>: An attribute inspiring reverence, or veneration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[53] Quraysh is the tribe of the Prophet Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[54]This is part of a long hadeeth detailing the story of the treaty of Al-Hudaybiyah. [See <em>Saheeh al-Bukhaari</em>, vol. 3, hadeeth 891 (English/Arabic).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[55] Kings are in need of intercessors because of the imperfection of their knowledge, might and authority. Allaah, Most Perfect in His Might, Knowledge, and Authority, is in no need for intercessors. That is why intercession with Allaah takes place only if He permits it. With kings, however, intercession is permitted with or without a king’s permission. Those close to the king, for example, may intercede without permission. [See Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s<em> Al-Qawlul Mufeed ‘Alaa Kitaabit-Tawheed</em> (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: Daarul ‘Aasimah, 1st ed. 1415/1994)], vol. 1, p. 330, 332.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[56]The intercessions permitted by Allaah تعالى are six. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) will have the privilege of making three of these intercessions. They are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The Prophet’s intercession for <em>ahlul-mawqif</em>. This is known as the Prophet’s greatest <em>shafaa’ah</em> and it is part of the highest station of praise and honour (<em>almaqaam al-mahmood</em>) with which the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) is distinguished, and for which he will be praised by all creatures. It is mentioned in the Qur’aan [17:78].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The Prophet’s intercession for <em>ahlul-Jannah</em> to enter <em>al-Jannah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The Prophet’s (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) intercession with Allaah تعالى to reduce the punishment of his uncle, Abu Taalib because of his protection and support of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). He will be placed in a shallow part of Hell-Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other intercessions are not restricted to the Prophet Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). They include:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The Prophet’s intercession with Allaah تعالى that He does not cast into Hell the one who deserves it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. His intercession of taking out from Hell those admitted to it because of their sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. The intercession to raise the ranks of the believers. This is the du’aa of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) to believers and by the believers for each other.</p>
<p>[See (1) Shaykh bin Baaz’s commentary on Ibn Taymeeyah’s <em>Al-’Aqeedah Al-Waasitiyyah</em> which Shaykh ‘Ali Hasan ‘Abdul Hameed compiled in his verification of Shaykh ‘AbdurRahmaan As-Sa’di’s book <em>At-Tanbeehaat Al-lateefah ‘Ala Al-Waasitiyyah</em> (Dammaam, Saudi Arabia: Daar Ibnul Qayyim, 1409/1989), p. 73, and (2) Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s <em>Al-Qawlul-Mufeed</em>, pp. 332-335].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The intercessions mentioned above are the ones approved by Allaah (تعالى). The annulled intercession is any intercession not approved by Allaah(تعالى ).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[57] The conditions are stated in the following aayaat:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Allaah (تعالى) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>مَن ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Who is he that will intercede with Him except by His permission.</strong> </span><br />
[Qur’aan, <em>Soorat Al-Baqarah</em> (2:255)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Allaah (تعالى) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>يَوْمَئِذٍ لَّا تَنفَعُ الشَّفَاعَةُ إِلَّا مَنْ أَذِنَ لَهُ الرَّحْمَٰنُ وَرَضِيَ لَهُ قَوْلًا</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>On that day, no intercession shall avail, except the one for whom ar-Rahmaan has given permission and whose word is acceptable to Him.</strong> </span>[Qur’aan, <em>Soorat Taha</em> (20:109)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Allaah (تعالى) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> وَلَا يَشْفَعُونَ إِلَّا لِمَنِ ارْتَضَىٰ</strong></span><br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they cannot intercede except for him with whom He is pleased.</span> </strong>[Qur’aan,<em>Soorat Al-Anbiyaa’</em> (21:28)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[58] The case of intercession on behalf of the Prophet’s uncle, Abu Taalib, is excluded and in a very limited sense from the ruling stated in Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>فَمَا تَنفَعُهُمْ شَفَاعَةُ الشَّافِعِينَ</strong></span><br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">No intercession of intercessors will be of any use to them</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> [unbelievers, polytheists]</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">.</span></strong>[Qur’aan, <em>Soorat Al-Muddathir</em> (74:48)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Taalib stood in support of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and protected him from his enemies of Quraysh. The intercession on behalf of Abu Taalib is special for the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). Other than this special intercession, none is allowed to intercede for a kaafir. Even Abu Taalib is not saved from the Fire of Hell. Had it not been for the intercession of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), Abu Taalib “<strong>would have been in the bottom of the (Hell) Fire</strong>,” as the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said. “<strong>Perhaps my intercession will be helpful to him on the Day of Resurrection so that he may be put in a shallow fire reaching only up to his ankles with which his brain will boil</strong>,” he (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) added. [See <em>Saheeh al-Bukhaari</em>, vol. 5, no. 222 and no. 224, and Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s <em>Al-Qawlul Mufeed</em>, vol. 1, p. 334].</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following is excerpted from the Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s explanation of <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Aayatul-Kursi</a>, Translated by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/audio-saleh-as-saleh/">Dr. Saleh as-Saleh</a> rahimahullaah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[THIRD]: In the Third statement, Allaah (تعالى) said:</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>لَّهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>To Him belongs whatever </strong>(maa)<strong> is in the heavens </strong></span>[44]<span style="color:#008000;"><strong> and whatever is on the earth. </strong></span>[Qur’aan, Aayatul-Kursi , Surah Al-Baqarah 2:255]<span style="color:#008000;"><strong><br />
</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The name {<strong>ما</strong>} &#8220;maa&#8221; here is a conjunctive noun (gram. <em>ism mawsool</em>) taking a form of generalization. The term is used in this form in order to indicate that it comprises both the beings and their states. The meaning, therefore, is that Allaah is the One Who masters the affairs of everything in existence in the heavens and the earth: <strong>creating</strong>, <strong>sovereignty-kingship,</strong> and <strong>management</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sentence <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;<strong>لَّهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ</strong> &#8221; <strong>&#8220;To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth&#8221;</strong></span> is a declarative clause in which the predicate (gram. khabar) { <strong>له</strong> } “To Him” has preceded the subject (gram. <em>mubtada</em>’) which is the conjunctive noun {ما} &#8220;Whatever”. In this way, there is a grammatical state of <em>hasr</em> (exclusivity, restriction) which signifies that to Him (Allaah) alone belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. Accordingly, since creating, sovereignty-kingship, and management of affairs belong to Allaah alone, it is incumbent that we should surrender to Him alone because we are His slaves, and a slave must surrender to the One Who Owns and Masters him, Allaah, the One free of all imperfection, the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, we must stand to <strong>persevere Allaah’s pre-decree</strong> because we are His possession and anything that is owned by Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, then it follows that is His right to administer its affairs as He Wills. This right is the same whether His pre-decree applies to the person himself, his family, wealth, friends, country, or the rest of mankind. The important thing is that since the dominion belongs to Allaah, then it is His exclusive right to do whatever He Wills.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the saying of Allaah (which means),<span style="color:#008000;"> <strong>“To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth,”</strong> </span>the term “heavens” came in the <strong>plural form</strong> [45] while the word “earth” was stated in the <strong>singular</strong> though what is meant is the plural. In this regard, the intended usage of the term “earth” refers to the <em>jins</em> (kind).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[44] From the angels, jinn, and all that which exists, including which we have no knowledge of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[45] The Qur’aan has stated that there are seven heavens:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>قُلْ مَن رَّبُّ السَّمَاوَاتِ السَّبْعِ وَرَبُّ الْعَرْشِ الْعَظِيمِ</strong><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: Who is the Rabb of the seven heavens and the Rabb of the great &#8216;Arsh?</strong></span><br />
[Qur’aan, <em>Soorat Al-Mu’minoon</em> (23:86)].</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following is excerpted from the Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s explanation of <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Aayatul-Kursi</a>, Translated by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/audio-saleh-as-saleh/">Dr. Saleh as-Saleh</a> rahimahullaah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">[ <strong>لَا تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ وَلَا نَوْمٌ </strong>]<strong><br />
</strong></span><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Neither slumber, nor sleep overtakes Him,<br />
</strong></span>[Qur’aan, Aayatul-Kursi , Surah Al-Baqarah 2:255]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah did not say (what means): “<strong>He does not sleep</strong>,” instead He said<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/asma-wa-sifaat-com/">:</a><span style="color:#008000;">{<strong> لَا تَأْخُذُهُ</strong> }</span> (which means) “<strong>does not overtake Him</strong>” in order to comprise the sleep that overcomes and that arising by choice. If you say, “Does not sleep,” it would imply that He does not sleep by choice. However, Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, does not sleep neither by <em>ghalabah</em> (overcoming) nor by choice, because sleep is an imperfect attribute which contradicts both the perfection of the Self and the perfection in relation to others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The person who is given to sleep misses a lot of his work because of His sleeping. Consider, for example, the case of a person who has many people working for him and he sleeps a lot. He is unable to neither reckon with nor manage the business or other related matters. This is an imperfection with respect to others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regard to self-perfection, sleep is a deficiency because it indicates that the person’s body got tired and thus he needed the sleep as a rest from what has passed, as well as a means to renew his activity to engage in what will come ahead. That is the why <strong>the people of <em>al-Jannah</em> do not sleep</strong>—because of the perfection of their lives and bodies. No illness or the like touches them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If someone says, <span style="color:#993300;">“We know that the person who does not sleep is unable to do so because of some kind of sickness or a defect, while you say that the lack of sleep is perfection. Explain.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We say, “This applies to the creature, and in this case perfection is a relative matter [with respect to Allaah it is perfection]. There is no doubt that the person who does not sleep because of an illness has a defect, and that is why he stays always in a state of languor and exhaustion. Thus, his welfare will not be established. This is evident from the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <strong>وَجَعَلْنَا نَوْمَكُمْ سُبَاتًا </strong>]<br />
<strong style="color:#008000;font-size:1rem;">And have made your sleep as a thing for rest<br />
</strong>[Qur’aan, Soorat An-Naba’ (78:9)],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">meaning that sleep is something that will discontinue the hardship and tiredness. If Allaah would sleep, and far is He above such imperfection, then this would necessitate that He needs to rest. In addition, the creation will be ruined because they are in need of Him; even the sleeping person is in need of Allaah. In fact, the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) used to invoke Allaah at night when he was about to sleep:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>فَإِنْ أَمْسَكْتَ نَفْسِي فَارْحَمْهَا، وَإِنْ أَرْسَلْتَهَا فَاحْفَظْهَا، بِمَا تَحْفَظُ بِهِ عِبَادَكَ الصَّالِحِين</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“If You take my soul, bestow mercy on it [and forgive it, as in another narration], and if You release it then protect it as You protect your righteous slaves.”</strong></span> [38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In short, it is impossible that Allaah, the One free of all imperfections and the Most High, sleeps. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَنَامُ وَلاَ يَنْبَغِي لَهُ أَنْ يَنَامَ</strong><br />
<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>&#8220;Verily Allaah does not sleep and it does not befit Him to sleep.&#8221;</strong></span> [39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word [ ”<strong>لا يَنبَغِي</strong> &#8220;] does not befit] when used in the Qur’aan and sunnah means “the thing which is absolutely impossible to be,” as Allaah (تعالى ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <strong>وَمَا يَنبَغِي لِلرَّحْمَٰنِ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَدًا </strong>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>But it is not befitting for </strong>(the Majesty of) <strong>ar-Rahmaan </strong>(Allaah)<strong> that He should beget a son </strong>(or offspring or children)<strong>.</strong></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Maryam (19:92)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[It should be noted] that Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <strong>لَا تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ وَلَا نَوْمٌ</strong> ]<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Neither slumber, nor sleep overtakes Him,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">signifies <em><strong>as-sifaat as-salbiyyah</strong></em> (attributes of negation: negating any imperfection and implying perfection). The rule with respect to the Names and Attributes of Allaah, the Most High, is that there is no such thing as a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">pure</span> attribute of negation.[40] Indeed, when <em>as-sifaat as-salbiyyah</em> are mentioned, it is because they imply the perfection of the attributes that are in contradiction to those of negation.[41] So, because of the Perfection of Allaah’s Life and <em>qayyoumiyyah</em>,[42] then neither slumber nor sleep overtake Him.[43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[38] Saheeh al-Bukhaari (Arabic/English), vol. 8, no. 332.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[39] Saheeh Muslim (English Translation), vol. 1, no. 343.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[40] This is because mere negation does not denote any attribute, and therefore it is not considered praise. In addition, the attributes of negation are of two kinds:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. General, and<br />
2. Specific.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of generality in negation is that Allaah, Most High, negates all imperfections implicitly denoting that all Perfection is His. For example: Allaah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ <strong>لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ</strong> ], [which means], “<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There is nothing like unto Him</strong></span>.” So, there is nothing unto Him in His Knowledge, Ability, Hearing, Seeing, Might, Wisdom, Mercy, and so forth. In this general negation, Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) did not specify the negation. Accordingly, all imperfections are denied and all perfections are denoted, and it is stated that there is <strong>nothing like unto Him</strong> in all of His Perfection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, the specificity in negation is to negate specific allegations of imperfection. For example to deny that defects and drawbacks like forgetfulness, sleep, ignorance, having son or partner, etc. are associated with Allaah, the Exalted. Again, the Perfection is implied as against the negation. [See Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s <em>Sharhul Waasitiyyah</em>], vol. 1, pp. 145-146.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[41] For example, the negation of ignorance stands for the affirmation of Allaah’s unlimited knowledge. The negation of death, which is in contradiction of life, implies the perfection of Allaah’s attribute of Life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[42] <em>Qayyoumiyyah</em>: The Attribute denoted by Allaah’s Name <em>al-Qayyoum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[43] The Perfection of His Life negates that Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) needs to sleep and the same is due to the Perfection of His <em>qayyoumiyyah</em>, as the created living creatures due to their imperfection need sleep. Although sleeping and eating may be considered as attributes of perfection with respect to man, as a person who does not sleep or eat is considered ill, they are perfection from one angle and defects from another. They are perfection in the sense that they indicate that the body is sound and healthy, and are defects because the body needs them to function. In reality, therefore, they are defects. Accordingly, the &#8220;perfection&#8221; in the created is only relevant, i.e. particular to the created, not shared by the Most Perfect, i.e. Allaah. Eating, drinking and sleeping are relative “perfections” with respect to the created and negated defects with respect to Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why Allaah, the Most High, said about Himself:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <strong>وَهُوَ يُطْعِمُ وَلَا يُطْعَمُ </strong>]<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And it is He </strong>(Allaah) <strong>Who feeds and is not fed.</strong></span><br />
[Qur’aan, Soorat Al-An’aam (6:14)].</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#808080;"><i>Related Points of Benefit from the Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s Commentary on Imaam ibn Taymeeyah’s Sharhul ’Aqeedatil-Waasitiyyah, Prepared by Dr. Saleh As-Saleh (rahimahullah)</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Affirming Five Names of the Names of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Allaah</b></i><i>, </i><i><b>al-Hayy</b></i><i>, </i><i><b>al-Qayyoum</b></i><i>, </i><i><b>al-’Aliyy</b></i><i>, </i><i><b>al-’Atheem</b></i>. [85]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Affirming that Allaah is singled out with all worship (<i>al-uloohiyyah</i>): He is the One Who alone has the right to be worshipped, or that He is the One who is worshipped rightfully and deservingly:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">{<b> لا إلهَ إلاَّ ُ هوَ</b> }<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">None has the right to be worshipped but He [Allaah].</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Refuting the claim of the polytheists who affirm other gods beside Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Affirming the <i>sifah</i> (attribute) of <i>hayaat</i> (Life) for Allaah, and that His life is one of perfection, neither preceded by <i>‘adam</i> nor coming come to naught nor characterized by imperfection. On the contrary, our life originates in <i>‘adam</i> and will come to an end, and it is accompanied by imperfection. If fact, all of our life is imperfect, and that is why Allaah described it by <i>ad-dunya</i>. [86] The Life of Allaah, however, is perfection from all angles because of His saying: {<b><span style="color:#008000;">الْحَيُّ</span></b>}The Living, where the particle <b>ال</b> is for <i>al-istighraaq</i>, which comprises all the meanings of the qualities of the perfect life, as if He says, <b>“There is no one who is truly living except He.”</b> In fact, this is the case because there is none qualified with the life of perfection except Allaah, the Most Mighty and most Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Affirming the <i>al-qayyoumiyyah</i> [87] for Allaah (عزَّوجَلََّّ) because He said: {<b><span style="color:#008000;"> القَيُّوم </span></b>}. Such a description does not apply to the human being. There is not any person who is established on his own nor is there anyone who takes full charge of others by whom they subsist, because there is no human being except that he is in need of others. We need workers, and they need us. We need [our] women and they need us. We need our sons and daughters and they need us. There is no one who is absolutely in full charge (giving them care, maintenance, providing for them, etc.) of others. I may be able to take charge of someone else, but in a limited sense. That is why Allaah تعالى said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[<b> أَفَمَنْ هُوَ قَائِمٌ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ </b>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>Is He </b>[Allaah]<b> Who takes charge </b>(guards, maintains, provides, etc.) <b>of every person and knows all that he has earned </b>(like any other deities who know nothing)<b>?</b></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Ar-Ra’d (13:33)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. The <i>aayah</i> contains <i>ismullaahi al-aa’tham</i> (Allaah’s Most Greatest Name) affirmed in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[<b> الحيُّ الَقيُّوم</b> ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah, there is no god worthy of worship except He, the one who possesses the perfect living, and Who is established on His Own, Self-subsisting, and by Whom all things subsist.</span></b>[88]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These two Names were mentioned in three places in the Qur’aan, in the two soorahs known as <i>az-zahraawayn</i> [89] (AlBaqarah and Aal-’Imran), and in Soorat <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><i>Taha</i></span>.[90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of <i>‘ilm</i> (<i>ahlul-‘ilm</i>) said: The Most Great Name of Allaah is only in these two Names since they comprise the Most Beautiful Names in their entirety, and hence the attribute of Perfection is implied in the Name [ <b><span style="color:#008000;">الحيُّ </span></b>]and the attribute of <i>ihsaan</i> (beauty) is entailed in the Name: [ <b><span style="color:#008000;">الَقيُّوم</span></b>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. The perfection of Allaah’s Life and qayyoumiyyah such that they are free from the slightest imperfection. The evidence is in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[<b> لَا تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ وَلَا نَوْمٌ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">Neither slumber, nor sleep overtakes Him.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perfection may be generalized considering what is predominant or more numerous although it may be deficient in certain aspects. However, negation of imperfection means that the perfection is absolute and in every respect is free from deficiency. In this sense, the negation occurred in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[<b> لَا تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ وَلَا نَوْمٌ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">Neither slumber, nor sleep overtakes Him.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. Affirming <i>as-sifaat as-salbiyyah</i> for Allaah because of His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[<b> لَا تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ وَلَا نَوْمٌ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">Neither slumber, nor sleep overtakes Him.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَلَا يَئُودُهُ حِفْظُهُمَا</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <i>sifaat as-salbiyyah</i> are those attributes that Allaah has denied for His Self and which imply affirming the perfection of their opposites.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. Affirming that Sovereignty of Allaah comprehends everything. The evidence is in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>لَّهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. This Sovereignty is exclusively His. The evidence lies in the same aayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>لَّهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ</b> ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">To Him</span></b><b> belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth</b>, in which the predicate (gram. <i>khabar</i>) { <b>له</b> } &#8220;To Him” has preceded the subject (gram. <i>mubtada</i>’) which is the conjunctive noun { ما } &#8220;Whatever”. In this way, there is a grammatical state of <i>hasr </i>(exclusivity, restriction) which signifies that: “<b>To Him (Allaah) </b><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">alone </span></b><b>belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth</b>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. Affirming the heavens and the earth, as in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>لَّهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The “<b>heavens</b>” is a number. They are seven in number and similarly is the number of the earths as proven from other texts.[91]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. The Perfection of the Kingship of Allaah, as evident in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>مَن ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His Permission?</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Kingship of Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى ) is not the same as His all comprehensive Sovereignty. In fact, power and full kingship are more perfect than just all-comprehensive sovereignty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. Affirming the intercession that is approved by Allaah as evident in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</b> ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[None can intercede] <b>except by Allaah’s Permission</b>, otherwise, the exception would not be correct. Hence, had the approved intercession been not affirmed, the exception would not be correct.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. Affirming the “Permission” which is His Command:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</b> ]<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">[None can intercede]<b> except by Allaah’s Permission.</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15. Affirming the ‘<i>ilm</i> (Knowledge) for Allaah and that His Knowledge comprehends the past, the present, and the future. The evidence is in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[<b> يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ</b> ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>And Allaah Knows what happens to them</b></span><span style="color:#008000;"> (His creatures)</span><span style="color:#008000;"><b> in the future and what happened to them in the past.</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16. Refuting the claims of the extremists from the <i>Qadariyyah</i>[92] by affirming Allaah’s all-encompassing Knowledge as in the statement. This constitutes a rebuttal of the extremist from the <i>Qadariyyah</i> who say that Allaah knows the actions of His salves only after they are carried out, denying that Allaah knowledge comprehends everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">17. The rebuttal of the two sects, the <i>Khawaarij</i> [93] and the <i>Mu’tazilah</i> [94] by affirming the <i>shafaa’ah</i>. Both sects deny the general intercession approved for the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and for others and which applies to the people who committed sin. This negation is based upon their doctrine that the person who commits a major sin and die without repenting from it will be punished in the Fire forever. The two sects differed, however, as to whether such a person is considered a <i>kaafir</i>, or neither a believer nor a <i>kaafir</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <i>Kharijites</i>, courageous against the truth and for it, said, “<i>The one who commits a major sin is kaafir and no longer belongs to the fold of Islam</i>.” The <i>Mu’tazilites</i> were fearful to oppose the people of <i>ahlus-sunnah</i> and the <i>kharijites</i>. They took a cowardly position and said, “<i>We will sit in the middle of the road and say that the one who has committed a grave sin is in a position somewhere between the two; we neither say he is a believer nor a kaafir!</i>” Both sects, however, agreed that in the hereafter he would be in the Fire of Hell forever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why they denied the <i>shafaa’ah</i> (intercession). The generality of the aayah refutes the position held by both sects:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>مَن ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِه</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">Who is he that can interceded with Him except with His Permission?</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">18. None will ever encompass anything of Allaah’s knowledge nor of His Hearing or His Sight:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلَّا بِمَا شَاءَ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He wills.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19. We comprehend no knowledge about Allaah or about His creation except that which He wills for us to know.[95]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">20. Forbidding the <i>takyeef</i> (assigning a manner or a “how”) to the Attributes of Allaah, because He did not inform us of the how they are. So if we claim the knowledge of the <i>kayfiyyah</i> (i.e. the condition or the “how”) of His Attributes, then we are lying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">21. Rebutting the <i>Mu’attilah</i>, due to His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ </b>]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is evidence against the <i>Mu’attilah</i> because they say, for example, that Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) has no real Hand. This necessitates that they encompass the negation of one of His Attributes. In this respect, both sects, the <i>Mu’attilah</i> and the people of <i>takyeef</i> (<i>Mukayyifah</i>) lied because Allaah affirmed this Attribute (i.e. the Hand) to Himself. Accordingly, their claim that the true and real Attributes like the Hand, the Face, the Eyes, and so forth do not befit Allaah is false and void. The basis for this fact is that knowledge is of two kinds: (a) Affirmation, and (b) Negation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, you cannot negate anything as being a quality of someone (something) except with knowledge, just like you cannot affirm anything for someone (something) except with knowledge. So if those sects would deny the realities of the aforementioned Attributes of Allaah then they must bring forth their proofs, if they are truthful. For example, Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) did not negate that the Attribute of the Hand from His Self, not even in one single aayah in the Qur’aan, nor did the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) negate this Attribute in any hadeeth, nor did the righteous predecessors (<i>as-salaf-us-saalih</i>). Those sects, however, utter the negation of Allaah’s true and real Hand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">22. Rebutting the position of the <i>Mumathilah</i> (those who liken Allaah to His creation). Since the aayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ</b> ]<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><b>And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge.</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">implies a rebuttal of the <i>Mukayyifah</i>, then by all reason it is a rebuttal of the <i>Mumathilah</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">23. Affirming the <i>mashee’ah</i> (Will) for Allaah because of His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>إِلَّا بِمَا شَاءَ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">Except that which he Wills.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">24. Rebutting the <i>Qadariyyah</i> and the <i>Mu’tazilah</i> who say that Allaah, the Most High, does not Will anything as far as man is concerned.[96] This is evident in Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ</b> ]<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><b>And they will never compass&#8230;</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowing that man’s compassing of something is from his qualities and his qualities are a creation of Allaah, [and hence man’s will is not independent from the Will of Allaah].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">25. The greatness of the <i>kursi</i>, for His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَسِعَ كُرْسِيُّهُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">His </span></b><b><i>kursi</i></b><b> extends over and encompasses the heavens and the earth.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">26. The Greatness of the Creator of the <i>kursi</i> because the greatness of the created implies the Greatness of the Creator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">27. The <i>kufr</i> of the person who denies the heavens and the earth because this necessitates accusing Allaah of lying. As far as the earth is concerned, I believe that no one denies it [its existence]. However, as regard to the heavens, there are those who deny them saying that what is above us is boundless and limitless space, and that there is only stars and diffused dust (<i>sadoom</i>) or the like. There is no doubt that the one who holds to this belief is a <i>kaafir</i>, whether he himself believes in this or he imitates those whom he reveres from the people who hold to this belief—while knowing the truth implied from the proofs of the Qur’aan and the sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">28. Affirming the Strength of Allaah, and the proof is His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَلَا يَئُودُهُ حِفْظُهُمَا</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">29. Denying the <i>mashaqah</i> (fatigue) from Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, because of His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَلَا يَئُودُهُ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">He feels no fatigue.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is one of the <i>sifaat as-salbiyyah</i> just like saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[<b> وَلَقَدْ خَلَقْنَا السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا فِي سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ وَمَا مَسَّنَا مِن لُّغُوبٍ </b>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#008000;">And indeed We created the heavens and the earth and all between them in six Days and nothing of fatigue touched us.</span></b> [Qur’aan, Soorat Qaaf (50:38)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">30. Affirming what is implied by the above statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:1rem;">[ <b>وَلَا يَئُودُهُ حِفْظُهُمَا</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them,</span></b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:1rem;">from the attributes of Knowledge, Ability, Life, Mercy, Wisdom, and Strength.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">31. Affirming that the heavens and the earth are in need for someone who guards them, as stated in Allaah’s saying (which means): He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them. Had it not been for the guarding and preserving of Allaah, they would have been ruined. Allaah Says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>وَلَوْلَا دَفْعُ اللَّهِ النَّاسَ بَعْضَهُم بِبَعْضٍ لَّهُدِّمَتْ صَوَامِعُ وَبِيَعٌ وَصَلَوَاتٌ وَمَسَاجِدُ يُذْكَرُ فِيهَا اسْمُ اللَّهِ كَثِيرًا</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#008000;">Had it not been that Allaah checks one set of people by means of another, monasteries, churches, synagogues, and masaajid (mosques), wherein the Name of Allaah is mentioned much would surely have been pulled down.</span></b><b> </b>[Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Hajj (22:40)].[97]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>وَيُمْسِكُ السَّمَاءَ أَن تَقَعَ عَلَى الْأَرْضِ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</b><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><b>He withholds the heavens from falling on the earth except by His Leave.</b></span><br />
[Qur’aan, Sooart Al-Hajj (22:65)].</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُمْسِكُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ أَن تَزُولَا ۚ وَلَئِن زَالَتَا إِنْ أَمْسَكَهُمَا مِنْ أَحَدٍ مِّن بَعْدِهِ</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>Verily! Allaah grasps the heavens and the earth lest they move away from their places, and if they were to move away from their places, there is not one that can grasp them after Him.</b></span> [Qur’aan, Sooart Faatir (35:41)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">32. Affirming <i>al-’uluw ath-thaati</i> (the Transcendence of Allaah in His Essence) and <i>al-’uluw as-sifaati</i> (the Transcendence of Allaah’s Attributes) because of His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">And He [Allaah] is the Most High, above everything.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">33. Rebutting both the <i>Hulooliyyah</i> [98] and the <i>Mu’atilah</i> who negate this Attribute of Allaah تعالى. The Hulooliyyah say, “<i>Allaah is not above everything but rather He is everywhere</i>.” And the Mu’attilah, the people who deny Allaah’s Attributes, say, “<i>He cannot be described as being High or low, to the left or the right, or as being separated from or associated with His creation</i>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">34. Warning against transgression upon others because of His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْعَظِيمُ</b> ]<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><b>And He is the Most High, above everything, and He is the Most Great.</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why Allaah (تعالى) said in Soorat An-Nisaa’ [(4:34)]:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>فَإِنْ أَطَعْنَكُمْ فَلَا تَبْغُوا عَلَيْهِنَّ سَبِيلًا ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيًّا كَبِيرًا</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>And if they </b>[women] <b>return to obedience </b>[to their husbands]<b>, then seek not against them means </b>[of annoyance]<b>. Surely, Allaah is ever Most High, above everything, Most Great.</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if you think proudly of yourself, then remember the Highness of Allaah above everything, the Most Mighty and Majestic. And if you think of yourself as being great, then remember the Greatness of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">35. Affirming the Greatness of Allaah because of His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>الْعَظِيمُ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">The Most Great.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">36. Affirming the Attribute of Perfection that is implied in the combined Attribute of Transcendence and Greatness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">37. Knowing that the <i>mulk</i> (Sovereignty) belongs to Allaah then:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We must not behave or act in His kingdom except in accordance with that which He is pleased, because of His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>لَّهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ</b> ]<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><b>To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth.</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The judicial rulings and decreeing amongst the people must be based upon the Judgment of Allaah. Indeed the reliance of man upon the judicial decrees laid by the created and the system of laws laid down by man is one kind of setting up rivals with Allaah (<i>shirk billaah</i>)[99], the Most Mighty and Most Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Contentment with the Pre-decree of Allaah, the Most Mighty and Most Majestic, because if you know that the Sovereignty exclusively belongs to Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى ) then you would say, “This is the disposal of affairs by a Sovereign in His Kingdom, and He has the right to do whatever He wants.”</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>لَا يُسْأَلُ عَمَّا يَفْعَلُ وَهُمْ يُسْأَلُونَ</b> ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#008000;">He cannot be questioned as to what He does, while they [the creation] will be asked</span></b>. [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Anbiyaa’ (21:23)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, this understanding was part of the condolence of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) to his daughter [following the death of her child] when he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><b>“Whatever Allaah takes belongs to Him, and to Him belongs what He grants, and everything with Him has an appointed fixed term </b>[in this world]<b>.”</b> </span>[100]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Man should not act conceitedly upon accomplishing something because this accomplishment is from Allaah and the Sovereignty is exclusively His.</p>
<p><b><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></b></p>
<p>[85]The Shaykh Uthaymeen also stated that he is in doubt whether the word إله is a Name of Allaah because it is an indefinite noun (gram. nakirah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[86] Ad-Dunya (fem. of adna): Denoting what is low or inferior.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[87] Qayyoumiyyah: One of Allaah’s Attributes implied in His Name Al-Qayyoum.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[88]Allaah is the one who sustains, protects, prepares, and runs the affairs of all things as He wills in accordance with His Knowledge, Wisdom, and Justice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[89] Zahraawayn (dual form of zahra): The bright ones. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><b>“Recite the Qur’aan, for on the Day of Resurrection it will come as an intercessor for those who recite it. Recite the two bright ones, Al-Baqarah and Soorat Aal-’Imraan, for on the Day of Resurrection they will come as two clouds or two shades, or two flocks of birds in ranks, pleading for those who recite them. Recite Soorat Al-Baqarah, for to take recourse to it is a blessing and to give it up is a cause of grief, and the magicians cannot confront it.” </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported in Saheeh Muslim (English Translation), vol. 2, no. 1757.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[90] In Al-Baqarah (2:255), in Aal-’Imraan (3:2), and in Taha (20:111).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Umaamah (رضي االله عنه) reported that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><b>“Allaah’s Most Great Name is in three soorahs in the Qur’aan, in Soorat Al-Baqarah and in Aal-’Imraan and in Soorat Taha.” </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Qaasim bin ‘Abdur-Rahmaan, one of the narrators of this hadeeth, searched the Qur’aan and found</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Aaytul-Kursi in Soorat Al-Baqarah (2:255):<br />
<span style="font-size:1rem;">[<b> االلهُ لا إله إلاَّ ُ هوَ </b><span style="color:#008000;"><b>الحَيُّ القَيُّوم </b></span>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">And in Soorat Aal-’Imraan (3:2):<br />
<span style="font-size:1rem;">[ ال<b>لَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ</b><b><span style="color:#008000;"> الْحَيُّ الْقَيُّومُ</span></b></span> <span style="font-size:1rem;">]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">And in Soorat Taha (20:111)<br />
<span style="font-size:1rem;">[<b> وَعَنَتِ الْوُجُوهُ</b><span style="color:#008000;"><b> لِلْحَيِّ الْقَيُّومِ</b></span><b> </b></span><span style="font-size:1rem;">]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by al-Haakim, Ibn Maajah, at-Tabarani, at-Tahaawi, and others. Shaykh al-Albaani authenticated its isnaad (<i>As-Silsilah As-Saheeha</i>), vol. 2, no. 746.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[91] The Shaykh (رحمه االله) made the above statement in his explanation of Soorat Al-Kahf, in the month of Rabee’ al-Awwal,1419. Evidence from the Qur’aan is in Soorat AtTalaaq (65:12) and from the sunnah as in the agreed upon hadeeth, &#8220;<b><span style="color:#808000;">Whoever usurps the land of somebody unjustly, his neck will be encircled with seven earths [on the Day of Resurrection].</span></b>&#8221; [See Saheeh Al-Bukhaari (Arabic/English)], vol. 3, no. 632.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[92] Those who say that whatever man does it is entirely of his own ability and free will, and that Allaah’s <i>mashee’ah</i> (Will) and <i>qudrah</i> (Ability) have no influence whatsoever on what man does. They also claim that the knowledge of Allaah does not comprehend the actions of the creation until after they are executed.</p>
<p>[93] Khaarijites (Ar.<i>Khawaarij</i>, sing. <i>Khaariji</i>). See <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2018/01/19/brief-overview-of-the-khaarijites-khawaarij/">Appendix B</a>.</p>
<p>[94] The <i>Mu’tazilah</i> (from <i>i’tazala</i>: “to remove oneself” or “to withdraw”). See <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/11/06/the-mutazilites/">Appendix C</a>.</p>
<p>[95] See both interpretations of this <i>aayah</i> (which means): <b>And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He wills</b>, pp. 60-61.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[96] Meaning that man has a totally independent free will and that Allaah’s Will and Power has no effect in this.</p>
<p>[97] See <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2015/02/11/the-call-for-the-unity-of-religions-wahdatul-adyaan-a-false-and-dangerous-call-dr-saleh-as-saleh/">Appendix D</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[98] <i>Hulooliyyah</i> [from <i>hulool</i> (lit. “settling,” “alighting,” “lodging,” “descent,” and by extension “incarnation”]. The most common definition is that it refers to the doctrine of Divine incarnation in the human form. In mystic <i>sufism</i>, it refers to the Divine incarnation in the <i>sufi</i> saints.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Taymeeyah classified the <i>Hulooliyyah</i> into two kinds. The first is the <b>specific hulool</b> like the claim of the Christians that Allaah is incarnated in ‘Eesa (alaihissalam) and like that of the extremist <i>raafidah</i> and <i>sufi</i> mystics who claim that Allaah is incarnated in ‘Ali Ibn Abee Taalib (رضي االله عنه) and in special <i>sufi</i> saints, respectively. The second kind is the <b>general hulool</b> and it is the saying that “Allaah, in His Essence, is everywhere.” [See <i>Al-Fataawaa</i>], vol. 2, pp. 171-172.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[99] It could be a major or a minor form of <i>shirk</i> depending upon the motive behind his reliance. <i>Al-Hamdullilaah</i>, the author, Shaykh Muhammad bin ‘Uthaymeen (رحمه االله ) personally affirmed this explanation to me in Jamaada Al-Aakhirah, 1419Hj.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 48: Point 79</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that the first ones who will see Allaah, the Most High, in Paradise are the blind then the men then the women with the eyes of their heads just as Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said, “You shall certainly see your Lord just as you see the moon on the night when it is full. You will not have any difficulty in seeing Him. It is obligatory to have <em>eemaan</em> in this and denying it is disbelief.”</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The topic of affirmation of <em>ar-ru&#8217;yah</em> (seeing Allaah, the Most High, in the Hereafter) has <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/12/03/true-believers-will-see-their-lord-on-the-day-of-resurrection/"><strong>preceded</strong> </a>and this is re-emphasis of what has preceded and as for this order, which the author mentioned then it needs a proof. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Listen/Read @<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/12/03/true-believers-will-see-their-lord-on-the-day-of-resurrection/"><br />
<strong>The true believers will see their Lord on the Day of Resurrection openly with their eyes</strong></a></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> The <u>h</u>adeeth in that regard that we had before in the book with regard to seeing Allaah, the Most High in the Hereafter, not with regard to the order is the <u>h</u>adeeth of Jaabir <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>, reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (554) and Muslim (633).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And on this specific point, the point of this order that those who will see Allaah first are the blind then the men then the women, the one doing the footnotes in one of the versions Khaalid ar-Raddaadi, he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There occurs in this regard a <u>h</u>adeeth which is traced back to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> but it is not authentic. It was mentioned by Ad-Dailamee in his book <em>Firdaws ul-Akhbaar</em> from Samurah ibn Jundub from him tracing back to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> but it’s not authentic. And also al-Laalikaa`ee in his book <em>As-Sunnah</em> quoted this with a weak chain of narration as being the saying of Al-Hasan al-Basree; the Taabi`ee.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong> <em><u>h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said in explanation of this point,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The author <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> made clear that <strong>whoever denies seeing the Creator has disbelieved</strong>. This ruling is a general ruling because whoever denies a matter which is known necessarily from the religion then he’s a disbeliever. As for the person who is overcome by a false doubt (<em>shubhah)</em> and he doesn’t know how to resolve this doubt or he resolves it with a mistake then this is a different matter. Those matters that a person does based upon a false doubt that comes upon him and is not able to arrive at what is correct in the matter then we leave his affair to Allaah. However, if he is a person who knowingly denies these matters then he has disbelieved.”</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 47: Point 77</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And Allaah, the Exalted and Most High Hears, Sees and Knows. His two Hands are outstretched. He knew that the creation would disobey Him before He created them. His Knowledge takes effect upon them, however, His Knowledge of them did not prevent Him from guiding them towards Islaam. He favoured them with it out of His Generosity, Munificence and Favour so all praise is for Him.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/affirmation-of-attributes-of-allaah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And Allaah, the Perfect and Most High Hears, Sees and Knows.”</span> </strong>This is the third type from the types of Tawheed; to affirm <em>Al-Asma Wa-<u>S</u>ifaat</em> (Names and Attributes) for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, just as they occur in the Book and the Sunnah, along with believing in their meanings and whatever they indicate and not entering into the <em>kayfiyyah</em> (how they are) because how they are is not known except to Allaah but as for their meaning then it is something known. So, it is obligatory upon you to affirm them and to hold as your creed what they indicate just as Imaam Maalik said, “Allaah, the Most High ascended over His Throne.” The ascending is something known. Known in its meaning and how is unknown.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“He knew that the creation were going to disobey Him even before He created them.”</span> </strong>Allaah has knowledge of everything. He knew what was going to occur &#8211; from <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) and from <em>kufr</em> (disbelief) and from obedience and from disobedience; nothing is hidden from Him. He knew it before He created the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“His Knowledge of them did not prevent Him from guiding them towards Islaam.” </strong></span>Even though He knew what they would commit from disbelief and from <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) then Allaah called them to Islaam and He called them to true faith; <em>eemaan</em> and He sent the Messengers and He sent down the Books for their guidance and He knew what they would do. However, from His mercy, He did not just leave them and entrust them to His Knowledge about them. Rather, He established the proof upon them and He gave them <em>ikhtiyaar</em> (choice) and <em>mashee&#8217;ah</em> (will) and <em>qudrah</em> (ability). So, they are able to act. So, if they leave action then the sin is their sin and the shortcoming is their shortcoming.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, guides all of the creation; the believers and the disbelievers. With the meaning that He makes the affair clear to all of them. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>.. وَأَمَّا ثَمُودُ فَهَدَيْنَاهُمْ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">As for Thamood then We showed them the way ..</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah-Fu<u>ss</u>ilat (41), <em>aayah </em>17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>We guided them, showed them the way: </strong>meaning, We made it clear to them and directed them towards it. However, they did not accept this. They obstinately rejected and were haughty.</p>
<p><strong>فَاسْتَحَبُّوا الْعَمَىٰ عَلَى الْهُدَىٰ فَأَخَذَتْهُمْ صَاعِقَةُ الْعَذَابِ الْهُونِ بِمَا كَانُوا يَكْسِبُونَ ..</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">.. However, they loved blind error over and above guidance so the awful blast of humiliating torment seized them on account of the sins that they used to earn.</span> </strong>(Soorah-Fussilat (41), <em>aayah </em>17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, on account of what they earned and it was not just because Allaah knew that and decreed it for them but rather because of what they actually earned by their choice and their will and their action. So, guidance; <strong><em>hidaayah</em> </strong>is of two kinds:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>Hidaayatul Irshaad</strong> (the guidance of giving direction) and this is general to the believer and the disbeliever,</li>
<li><strong>Hidaayatut-Tawfeeq</strong> (the guidance of being granted the success of accepting that guidance). This is specific to the believers, those who accepted the guidance of Allaah and His direction. So, Allaah grants them the success of its attainment and He makes them firm.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So He guided them towards Islaam. And He favoured them with it from His Generosity and His Munificence and His Favour. So all praise is for Him.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“From His Generosity,” </strong>meaning that He called them and made clear to them and clarified to them from His Generosity and He bestowed favour because of their need of that. And as for Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, then He has no need at all of them whether they disbelieve or whether they believe, whether they obey or whether they disobey, they will not harm Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, nor will they benefit Him because He is <em>Ghaniyy</em> (independent), He has no need at all of them and this, its benefit or harm only rebounds upon them. So from His mercy upon them, He made clear to them the way of good and the way of evil, and He gave them strength and He gave them ability, and He gave them intellects with which they could distinguish between what harms and what benefits.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 46: Points 75</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And you should know that Allaah has favoured some of the servants over others in this world and in the Hereafter, He has done so justly. It cannot be said that He acted unjustly or has shown undue favour. Whoever says that Allaah has favoured the true believer and the disbeliever equally then he is a person upon innovation. Rather, Allaah has favoured the believer over the disbeliever, the obedient one over the sinner and the one He has rendered secure from error over the one who is humiliated; doing so justly. It is His favour, which He bestows upon whomever He wishes and withholds from whomever He wishes.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/allaah-has-favoured-some-of-the-servants-over-others-he-has-done-so-justly" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And you should know that Allaah has favoured the servants; some of them over others in this world and in the Hereafter,”</strong></span> Allaah has favoured some of the people over others. He has bestowed favour upon the believer over the disbeliever with that which Allaah has given him from <em>eemaan</em> on account of his having <em>eemaan</em> and He withheld from the disbeliever on account of his disbelief. And Allaah favoured the believers, some over others and the Messengers (the <em>Rusul); </em>Allaah favoured some of them over others.</p>
<p><strong>تِلْكَ الرُّسُلُ فَضَّلْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Those Messengers, We favoured some of them over others.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>253)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the <em>fa<u>d</u>l</em> (favor/bounty) of Allaah, which He gives to whomever He wishes, He, the Perfect and Most High and no-one may raise any objection to Allaah because this is His <em>mulk</em> (kingdom), that which belongs to Him, He, the Perfect, He can give it to whomever He wishes. So, the kingdom belongs to Him, He can give it to whomever He wishes, He, the Perfect. And the favour that is bestowed is His favour, He may give it to whomever He wishes. So, there could be no objection raised against Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whereas, the <em>Mu`tazilah</em>; this deviant sect, they say, “<em>It is obligatory that Allaah treats the people equally and gives them all the same</em>.” This is to show evil manners towards Allaah and is to raise objections against Him, High and Tremendously Exalted is Allaah above that which they say. So, Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, bestows favour on some of His creation over and above others and this is His kingdom, it belongs to Him so there can be no objection to Him. He does not punish anyone except for a crime that He has actually committed since to do so would contradict justice and Allaah does not oppress. So, He does not punish anyone without his having committed a crime or punish anyone for somebody else’s crime.</p>
<p><strong>وَلَا تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَىٰ ۚ وَإِن تَدْعُ مُثْقَلَةٌ إِلَىٰ حِمْلِهَا لَا يُحْمَلْ مِنْهُ شَيْءٌ وَلَوْ كَانَ ذَا قُرْبَىٰ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And no bearer of sin will bear the sins of another and if someone weighed down with sins were to call someone else to bear his sins for him then he will not be able to find anyone to bear any of them for him even if it be a close relative.</span> </strong>(Soorah-Faa<u>t</u>ir (35), <em>aayah </em>18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, with regard to the aspect of <em>al-jazaa</em>· (recompense) that He gives then His recompense is <em>adl</em> (just) and as for the aspect of <em>al-a<u>t</u>aa·</em> (what He gives freely) then this is <em>fa<u>d</u>l</em> (favour) from him, He, the Perfect and Most High and it is not for anyone to raise any objection to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And whoever says that the favour of Allaah upon the believer and the disbeliever is just the same then he is a person of innovation.” </strong></span>This is the saying of the <em>Mu`tazilah</em>, they say that &#8211; <em>&#8220;It is obligatory upon Allaah to make all of the people believers and that He should not make just some of them disbelievers and some of them believers. He should make all of them rich, He should make all of them scholars.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is to raise an objection against Allaah, the Perfect and Most High because Allaah is <em>Hakeem</em> (All-Wise). And it is not from His wisdom that He should make all of the people the same in knowledge or in riches or in reward and punishment. And it is not from His wisdom that He should make all of mankind wealthy. If all of them were wealthy people then the creation would be ruined because they would not find anyone who would carry out any work and production would cease. And therefore, Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, has favoured some of the people over others with regard to provision. He has made this one rich and this one poor so that the creation can thrive. If they were all rich then they would not produce anything. And if they were all poor then they would not be able to work and produce. So, Allaah has caused them to vary so that the creation should operate and thrive.</p>
<p><strong>وَرَفَعْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ فَوْقَ بَعْضٍ دَرَجَاتٍ لِّيَتَّخِذَ بَعْضُهُم بَعْضًا سُخْرِيًّا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We raised some of them over others in levels so that some of them should employ others to work.</span> </strong>(Sooratuz-Zukhruf (43), <em>aayah </em>32)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, some of them employ others to work for wages. So, when that happens then the creation can grow and prosper and benefits are attained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Rather, Allaah has favoured the believer over the disbeliever and the obedient one over the disobedient one of the sinner and the one He has rendered secure from error over the despicable one,” </strong></span>Allaah favoured the believer over the disbeliever and He gave favour to the obedient one over the sinner; this is His justice (<em>adl</em>), He, the Perfect and His <em>fa<u>d</u>l</em> (favour) so no-one may raise any objection to Him.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Translator’s side point:  Briefly with regard to the explanation of <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> then he said after some speech, he said at the end,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Therefore this section, this part here necessitates from us that we have the <em>`aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) that Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, caused His servants to be of different levels as <strong>a favour from Him and as justice</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>لَا يُسْأَلُ عَمَّا يَفْعَلُ وَهُمْ يُسْأَلُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He is not to be questioned about that which He does. Rather, they are to be questioned. </strong></span>(Sooratul-Anbiyaa· (21), <em>aayah</em> 23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it cannot be said, “<em>Why did He make that one a Messenger and make that one a person who is humiliated and why did He make that one a believer who is granted success of correctness whereas He made that one a rejected one and humiliated?</em>” That should not be said. Rather, it is obligatory that we believe that Allaah is free of committing oppression (<em><u>dh</u>ulm)</em> and that He does whatever He wishes and He decrees whatever He wills. However, all His actions are based upon <em>hikmah</em> (wisdom) and <em>ra<u>h</u>mah</em> (mercy) and <em>fa<u>d</u>l</em> (favour) and <em>adl</em> (justice). That is what is obligatory upon us to believe with regard to our Lord, the Majestic and Most High. This is the creed that is supported by the texts of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Prophetic texts and it is that which the scholars of the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em> are agreed in consensus upon and Allaah is the one who grants success.”</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 45: Points 72</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) that it is Allaah who spoke to Moosaa ibn `Imraan `<em>alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> on the day of the mountain; <em>A<u>t-T</u>oor</em>. And Moosaa heard Allaah’s speech, which was with a voice, which he heard from Him not from other than Him. So, whoever says other than this has disbelieved in Allaah, the Tremendous.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F381540059&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/to-have-eemaan-that-it-is-allaah-who-spoke-to-moosaa-on-mount-toor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Affirming <em>kalaam</em> (speech) for Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, is from the fundamentals of `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) of the <em>Ahl us-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em> that Allaah speaks with real speech. Jibreel heard Him and Moosaa `<em>alayhissalaam</em> heard Him when he went towards the fire to take a fire brand and he found that Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, spoke to Him from the bush just as Allaah mentioned in the Qur&#8217;aan and Moosaa heard His speech. Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَكَلَّمَ اللَّهُ مُوسَىٰ تَكْلِيمًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And Allaah spoke to Moosaa with speech.<br />
</strong></span>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), <em>aayah </em>164)</p>
<p><strong>وَلَمَّا جَاءَ مُوسَىٰ لِمِيقَاتِنَا وَكَلَّمَهُ رَبُّهُ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And when Moosaa came to our appointed place and His Lord spoke to him.</strong></span>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah</em> 143)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was a second time when Allaah promised him that He would give him the Tawraat so Moosaa went to the appointed place and his Lord spoke to him and gave him the tablets with the Tawraat written upon them. So, Moosaa heard the speech of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He spoke to our Prophet Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> on the night of the <em>Mi`raaj</em> (night ascent) and He made the five daily prayers obligatory upon him. So, Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, speaks with speech that is heard and with letters and a voice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Jahmiyyah and the Mu`tazilah then they say, <em>“Allaah does not speak. Because if we were to affirm speech for Him then we would be causing Him to resemble the created being because the created being speaks.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And is analogy to be made between the speech of Allaah and the speech of the created being? There is a difference between the speech of Allaah and the speech of the created being. So, those people (Jahmiyyah and the Mu`tazilah) do not make a distinction between Allaah and between the created being, and Allaah’s refuge is sought, as a result of their stupidity in understanding and in intellect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, speaks in reality with speech that is heard and the Qur&#8217;aan is from the speech of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. Allaah spoke with it and He spoke with the Tawraat and He spoke with the Injeel and He speaks whenever He wishes if He wishes, He, the Perfect and Most High. So, His speech is from His actions, He, the Majestic and Most High. And His actions have no end and no beginning. He speaks whenever He wishes, when He wishes with whatever He wishes, He, the Majestic and Most High. So, <em>al-kalaam</em> (speech) is an attribute of His from His attributes, which are actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“It was from Him, He, the Perfect, not from anyone besides Him.” </strong></span>Not from the tree/bush, not from the preserved tablet, not from Jibreel and not from Muhammad. So it is speech which emanated from Allaah in reality and Jibreel and Muhammad only conveyed and transmitted from Allaah, the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And whoever says other than this then he has disbelieved in Allaah, the Tremendous.” </strong></span>Whoever says that the speech of Allaah is created and that Allaah does not speak and he deprives Allaah of speech then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) because he is denying the truth of what Allaah has said and His Messenger and the consensus of the Muslims unless he is an ignorant person or one who is performing incorrect interpretation or <em>muqallid</em> (blindly following) somebody he has good thoughts about, then this person, it is to be made clear to him and if he then persists then he is judged to be a disbeliever because Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, rebuked the people of <em>shirk</em> for the fact that they worshipped statues, which do not speak. Ibraaheem `<em>alayhissalaam</em> said:</p>
<p><strong> يَا أَبَتِ لِمَ تَعْبُدُ مَا لَا يَسْمَعُ وَلَا يُبْصِرُ وَلَا يُغْنِي عَنكَ شَيْئًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O my father, why do you worship that which cannot hear and not see and cannot benefit you with anything?</span> </strong>(Soorah Maryam (19), <em>aayah </em>42)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said to the disbelievers, those who worshipped the idols:</p>
<p><strong> فَاسْأَلُوهُمْ إِن كَانُوا يَنطِقُونَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So ask them if they are able to speak.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Anbiyaa· (21), <em>aayah </em>63)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High said:</p>
<p><strong>وَاتَّخَذَ قَوْمُ مُوسَىٰ مِن بَعْدِهِ مِنْ حُلِيِّهِمْ عِجْلًا جَسَدًا لَّهُ خُوَارٌ ۚ أَلَمْ يَرَوْا أَنَّهُ لَا يُكَلِّمُهُمْ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And the People of Moosaa after he had departed made from their ornaments the statue of a calf, which produced a mooing sound, could they not see that it could not speak to them?</span> </strong>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>148)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this proves that the Lord (<em>Rabb)</em> speaks, He, the Perfect and Most High. And the one who does not speak is not a Lord, how could he then command and how could he prohibit and how could he regulate affairs when he cannot speak? High and Exalted is Allaah above that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in Soorah <u>T</u>aa-Haa:</p>
<p><strong> أَلَّا يَرْجِعُ إِلَيْهِمْ قَوْلًا وَلَا يَمْلِكُ لَهُمْ ضَرًّا وَلَا نَفْعًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">It does not say anything to them in return and does not possess any harm or benefit for them.</span> </strong>(Soorah <u>T</u>aa-Haa (20), <em>aayah 8</em>9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Can they see that it can’t say anything to them in return? Meaning, it does not respond to them when they address it.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">&#8212;</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 41 : Point 65</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that no-one will enter Paradise except by the mercy of Allaah. And that Allaah will not punish anyone except according to the degree of his sins. And if He were to punish all the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth; the righteous and the wicked amongst them, then He will be punishing them without being unjust to them. And it is not permissible to say about Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, that He is unjust since the unjust is the one who takes something that is not his to take, whereas creation and decree is for Allaah. The creation is His creation and the world is His world. He is not to be questioned about what He does but they will be questioned. And it is not to be said, &#8216;Why?&#8217; and &#8216;How?&#8217; And no-one can enter between Allaah and His creation. </strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/know-that-no-one-will-enter-paradise-except-by-the-mercy-of-allaah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And you should know that no-one will enter Paradise except by the mercy of Allaah,” </strong><em>Al-Jannah</em> (Paradise) is expensive and exalted and it cannot be reached through deeds, no matter how much a person works and even if he does all the acts of obedience then his deeds will not meet up to the favours that have been bestowed upon him. So, if he were to be brought to account for those favours then no deed would remain for him. This is from one aspect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second aspect</strong> is that Paradise is expensive and it does not have a price that can be assessed in terms of deeds or wealth or other than that, no-one knows how tremendous it is except for Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. However, Allaah enters the believers into Paradise by His <em>ra<u>h</u>mah</em> (mercy) by means of their deeds. So, deeds are just a <em>sabab</em> (means) towards entry into Paradise but they do not necessitate entry into Paradise nor are they the price for Paradise. And therefore, he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“No-one from amongst you will enter into Paradise through his deeds.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is in order that a person should not become amazed and complacent at his own deeds. It is not stated so that he should abandon performing deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p><strong> ادْخُلُوا الْجَنَّةَ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Enter into Paradise on account of that which you used to do.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratun-Na<u>h</u>l (16), <em>aayah</em> 32)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Baa here does not show compensation or the price. Rather, the Baa here, <strong>“Bimaa Kuntum Ta’maloon”</strong> is to show a cause or a means, meaning by means of that which he used to do as is shown by the <u>h</u>adeeth that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“None of you will enter into Paradise through his deeds.” So, they said, “Not even you Oh Messenger of Allaah?” So, he said, “Nor even me unless Allaah covers me with His mercy.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, a person should not become amazed at his own deeds. However, a person will not enter into Paradise except by means of deeds. So, if a person did not perform any deeds, he will not enter Paradise because he has not carried out the means.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And Allaah does not punish anyone except in accordance with the degree of his sins,” </strong>Paradise is <em>fa<u>d</u>l</em> (a favour) from Allaah, the Majestic and Most High and is through the mercy of Allaah and deeds are a means for entry into it and the People of the Fire will not be punished except in accordance with their sins. They will not be punished because of the sins of other people and they will not be punished whilst not having any sins. So, this is from `<em>adl</em> (justice). So, Paradise is from <em>al-fa<u>d</u>l</em> (favour) and the Fire is from <em>al-`adl</em> (justice).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And if He were to punish the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth, the righteous ones of them and the wicked ones of them then He will be punishing them without being unjust to them.” </strong>This is just as has preceded that a person no matter how many deeds he performs then his deeds will not match up to even a part of the favours of Allaah upon him. If Allaah were to punish him that would be justice because of his falling short in giving thanks for the favours of Allaah upon him. And this speech which he mentioned is the text of a <u>h</u>adeeth from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“If Allaah were to punish the inhabitants of His heavens and the people of His earth then He would punish them and He would not be unjust to them. And if He were to be merciful to them then His mercy would be better than their deeds deserved.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because He would punish the evildoer on account of his evil acts and He would be punishing the righteous person because of the fact that his deeds did not qualify him for entry into Paradise because he did not match the favours of Allaah upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“It is not permissible to say about Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, that He is unjust,” </strong>Allaah, the Majestic and Most High has declared Himself free of <em><u>dh</u>ulm</em> (oppression, injustice).</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا رَبُّكَ بِظَلَّامٍ لِّلْعَبِيدِ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord is not unjust to the servants.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah Fu<u>ss</u>illat (41), <em>aayah </em>46)</p>
<p><strong>لَا ظُلْمَ الْيَوْمَ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ سَرِيعُ الْحِسَابِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There will be no injustice on this day. Allaah is quick in reckoning.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah Ghaafir (40), <em>aayah</em> 17)</p>
<p><strong>وَلَا يَظْلِمُ رَبُّكَ أَحَدًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord does not wrong anyone.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Kahf (18), <em>aayah </em>49)</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا ظَلَمْنَاهُمْ وَلَٰكِن كَانُوا هُمُ الظَّالِمِينَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">We did not oppress them. However, they were the wrongdoers.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Zukhruf (43), <em>aayah </em>76)</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا ظَلَمْنَاهُمْ وَلَٰكِن كَانُوا أَنفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We did not oppress them but rather they oppressed their own souls.</span> </strong>(Soorah Na<u>h</u>l (16), <em>aayah </em>118)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> reported the words of his Lord, He the Most High that He said: (Hadeeth Qudsi)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“O My servants I have made oppression forbidden for Myself and I have made it forbidden for you to oppress one another so do not commit oppression.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, is a just judge and oppression (<em><u>dh</u>ulm</em>) does not befit Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And oppression is only one taking that which is not His to take whereas creation and decree is for Allaah.” </strong><em>A<u>dh</u>&#8211;<u>dh</u>ulm</em> (oppression) is to wrongfully take the right of the people. And do the people have any right over Allaah? They have no right upon Allaah and no-one can make anything binding upon Allaah. Rather, the right of the servants with Allaah is that He should not punish one who does not associate anything with Him. <span style="color:#800080;">This is a right which He, the Perfect, has given as a favour</span>. And oppression (<em><u>dh</u>ulm)</em> is to put something in other than its due place. So, Allaah does not put punishment upon those who deserve bliss and He does not give bliss to those who deserve punishment. Rather, He gives bliss to those who deserve it and He gives punishment to those who deserve it and this is <em>al-`adl</em> (justice) but as for the opposite then that would be oppression. If He were to punish the people of <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) and bestow honour to the people of disbelief, this would be oppression and Allaah is free of that. It is not possible that He will punish the people of <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) and bestow honour upon the people of disbelief and that He will enter the disbelievers into Paradise and enter the believers into the Fire. This does not befit Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And Allaah; creation and decree are for Him and the creation is His creation and the world is His world.” </strong>Allaah, the Most High said:</p>
<p><strong>أَلَا لَهُ الْخَلْقُ وَالْأَمْرُ ۗ تَبَارَكَ اللَّهُ رَبُّ الْعَالَمِينَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Is not creating and commanding His? Exalted is Allaah, the Lord and nurturer of the whole of creation.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Alaa lahul- khalq,” </strong>Is creating not His?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is to bring things into existence from non-existence. So, all the created being were created by Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, no-one can create along with Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>اللَّهُ خَالِقُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah is the Creator of everything.</span><br />
</strong><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratuz-Zumar (39), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah </em><span style="font-size:1rem;">62)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>أَمْ جَعَلُوا لِلَّهِ شُرَكَاءَ خَلَقُوا كَخَلْقِهِ فَتَشَابَهَ الْخَلْقُ عَلَيْهِمْ ۚ قُلِ اللَّهُ خَالِقُ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ وَهُوَ الْوَاحِدُ الْقَهَّارُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Or do they set up partners for Allaah who they claim create with the like of His creation such that the creation is confused for them? Say, Allaah is the Creator of everything and He is the One, the Overpowering Subduer. </span> </strong>(Sooratur-Ra`d (13), <em>aayah </em>16)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Or do they set up partners for Allaah who create with the like of His creation such that the creation would be confused for them?”</strong> Such that that created by the servant resembles that created by Allaah, this is impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Say, “Allaah is the Creator of everything and He is the One, the Overpowering Subduer.”’</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُم مَّا تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَرُونِي مَاذَا خَلَقُوا مِنَ الْأَرْضِ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “Do you see that which you call upon besides Allaah? Show me what they have created upon the earth.”</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Ahqaaf (46), <em>aayah </em>4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“<em>al-khalq</em>,” creating is for Allaah alone, <em>w`al-amar,</em>” and the decree and the command is for Him,” </strong><em>al-amar</em> (command/decree) is legislating and sending down legislation. So, the Creator, He is the one who commands and forbids and legislates for His servants whatever is beneficial for them and He it is Who forbids whatever is harmful for them and it is not for anyone to command or forbid or to obligate an act of worship or to prohibit anything without a proof.</p>
<p><strong>أَمْ لَهُمْ شُرَكَاءُ شَرَعُوا لَهُم مِّنَ الدِّينِ مَا لَمْ يَأْذَن بِهِ اللَّهُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Or do they have partners who legislate things from the religion for them that Allaah has not given permission for.</span> </strong>(Soorah ash-Shooraa (42), <em>aayah</em> 21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the <em>amar</em> (decree/command) is for Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, the command relating to what occurs in creation and relating to what is pre-decreed, <em>w’al amrush-shar`ee</em> (and the command relating to what is legislated), He commands and He prohibits, He, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p><strong>أَلَا لَهُ الْخَلْقُ وَالْأَمْرُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Is not the creating and the command for Him?</span><br />
</strong><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah </em><span style="font-size:1rem;">54)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He made a distinction between <em>khalq</em> (creating) and <em>al-amar</em> (commanding). So, this shows the command is not something created and this contains a refutation of the <em>Jahmiyyah</em>; those who said that the Qur·aan is created and that the speech of Allaah is created. So, Allaah had made a distinction between the creating and between the command. The command is from His speech and His legislation and Allaah has made a distinction between the creation and between the command. So, this proves that the speech of Allaah is not created.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And the world is His world, He, the Majestic and Most High.” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the abodes are three;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly,</strong> <em>daarud-duniya</em> (the abode of this world),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second,</strong> <em>wa daarul-barzakh</em> (intermediate period in the grave),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And the third one,</strong> <em>wa daarul-qaraar wahiyaa al-aakhirah</em> (the abode of permanent residence and it is the Hereafter).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of them belong to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And He will not be asked about what He does but they will be asked,” </strong>He cannot be asked about what He does, He, the Perfect and Most High because His actions contain no deficiency and there is no shortcoming in them. So, they are perfect and precise and they never suffer from any deficiency or any shortcoming and questions are only to be asked about one who has deficiencies or shortcomings in his actions. So, Allaah cannot be asked about what He does because His actions are perfect and complete.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second reason;</strong> it is not just on account of His overpowering and His Lordship as is said by those who say it that He cannot be asked because of His tremendousness, He, the Perfect and Most High and because of His Majesty. However, it is not this alone, rather, He is not to be asked also because His actions are perfect and precise. They do not suffer from any deficiency at all or any flaws, contrary to the created being for he will be asked about his actions because he commits errors and his deeds are deficient and observations are to be made concerning him. So, he will be questioned because he is deficient from every aspect except for those who are rendered complete and aided and supported by Allaah. And therefore, he said, <strong>“But rather they will be questioned.”</strong> This is the difference between the Creator and the created being that Allah is not to be questioned whereas, the created being will be questioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“</strong><strong>And it is not to be said, &#8216;Why?&#8217; and &#8216;How?&#8217; And no-one can enter between Allaah and His creation.</strong><strong>” </strong>No objection is to be raised about Allaah such that it is said, “Why did Allaah create such and such and How did Allaah create these things?” This is not permissible with respect to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. Rather, it is upon us to submit and to comply and to believe that the actions of Allaah are perfect and complete and do not suffer any deficiency or shortcoming. So, even if some of the points of wisdom or the underlying reasons remain hidden to us then still we do not ask about them, rather, we submit. So, if we understand the wisdom and the underlying reason then this is fine but if we do not understand it then we submit and we do not raise objections to Allaah or withhold from action until we know the wisdom or the underlying reason.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Surely! Allah wrongs not even of the weight of a speck of dust, but if there is any good (done), He doubles it, and gives from Him a great reward. </strong></span>(Surah An-Nisa , aayah 40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah states that He does not treat any of His servants with injustice on the Day of Resurrection, be it the weight of a mustard seed or a speck of dust. Rather, Allah shall reward them for this action and multiply it, if it were a good deed. For instance, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(And We shall set up balances of justice)</strong></span> Allah said that Luqman said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(O my son! If it be (anything) equal to the weight of a mustard seed, and though it be in a rock, or in the heavens or in the earth, Allah will bring it forth)</span></strong>. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(That Day mankind will proceed in scattered groups that they may be shown their deeds. So whosoever does good equal to the weight of a speck of dust shall see it. And whosoever does evil equal to the weight of a speck of dust shall see it.)</span> </strong>The Two Sahihs recorded the long Hadith about the intercession that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri narrated, and in which the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">(Allah then says, &#8220;Go back, and take out of the Fire everyone in whose heart you find the weight of a mustard seed of faith&#8221;)</span></strong> In another narration, Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">(&#8220;Whosoever had the least, least, least speck of faith, take him out of the Fire,&#8221; and they will take out many people.)</span></strong> Abu Sa`id then said, &#8220;Read, if you will,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Surely! Allah wrongs not even of the weight of a speck of dust).&#8221;</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lessons 34 : Point 46</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> that Allaah, the Most High knew whatever was going to occur from the start of time and whatever was not going to occur. Whatever was going to happen then Allaah fully comprehended and enumerated it. And whoever says that He does not know except what has already occurred or what is occurring then he has disbelieved in Allaah, the Tremendous. </strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory to affirm the knowledge of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High and its encompassing everything. So, He has full knowledge of everything and He has full ability over everything and His <em>ilm</em> (knowledge) has no beginning and no ending. His <em>ilm</em> (knowledge) is just like the rest of the attributes established for Him forever. So, just as Allaah has no beginning then likewise, there is no beginning for His names and His attributes and His actions, He, the Perfect and Most High. And just as Allaah has no end, then likewise there is no end for His names and His attributes and His actions, He, the Majestic and Most High. So, He along with His names and His attributes is the First One with no beginning and He along with His names and His attributes is the Last One with no ending just as he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said addressing his Lord, He, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“You are Al-Awwal (the First One) so there is nothing before You and<br />
You are  Al-Aakhir (the Last One) so there is nothing after You and<br />
You are Az-Zaahir (the Uppermost One) so there is nothing above You and<br />
You are <em>Al-Baatin</em> (the Closest One) so there is nothing closer than You.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And to have <em>eemaan</em> that Allaah, the Most High knew whatever was going to be from the start of time and whatever was not going to be and whatever exists, He enumerated it and comprehended it all,” </strong>Allaah knew whatever was and has passed away in previous time and He knows whatever will be in the future and He knows whatever will not be, if it were to be; how it will be. So, Allaah’s knowledge comprehends everything and therefore He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَلَوْ رُدُّوا لَعَادُوا لِمَا نُهُوا عَنْهُ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">If they were to be sent back, they will return to doing whatever they had been forbidden from.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-An`aam (6), <em>aayah</em> 28)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah knew that if they were to be returned to the world, they would return to doing what they had been forbidden from, meaning if they were returned to the world then they would return to disbelief even though their returning to the world would never happen ever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And whoever says that He does not know except what has already occurred or what is occurring then he has disbelieved in Allaah, the Tremendous,” </strong>whoever restricts the knowledge of Allaah to events that have already occurred only and that He does not know what is going to occur before it actually happens then he has disbelieved in Allaah because he has denied the knowledge of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High and he has denied the comprehensiveness of the knowledge of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High and He has affirmed for Allaah deficient knowledge so he becomes a disbeliever on account of this, for the knowledge of Allaah cannot be restricted. As for the knowledge of the created being then it is restricted no matter what level it reaches.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَفَوْقَ كُلِّ ذِي عِلْمٍ عَلِيمٌ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And above every person possessing knowledge there is one who knows more.</span> </strong>(Soorah-Yoosuf (12), <em>aayah </em>76)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every person who has knowledge, there will be another person who knows more than him and above all of them is Allaah, the Most High with His knowledge. And He commanded His Messenger to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>رَّبِّ زِدْنِي عِلْمًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Oh my Lord, increase me in knowledge. </strong></span>(Soorah <u>T</u>aa-<u>H</u>aa (20), <em>aayah </em>114)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the person who restricts the knowledge of Allaah and says He knows such and such but He does not know such and such, this one is a disbeliever (<em>kaafir</em>) since he has belittled Him and denied the generality of His knowledge of everything.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Muslim (2,713) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“With regard to this sentence, there appears to be something missing in  the wording here and what is apparent that the meaning is <strong>“And He does not know what will be except after it has occurred”</strong> and this was the statement of Hishaam ibn Al-Hakam; the head of misguidance, the one who said Allaah does not know things until they actually happen. So, he clearly stated that He, the Perfect does not know anything until He brings about knowledge for Himself of it and this is clear disbelief. Refer to the book <em>Al-Fissal</em> of Ibn Hazm.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I,Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad, say, the saying that “Allaah does not know things until they have actually happened,” this is the saying of some of the Mu`tazilah and it is a false and futile saying. Whoever believes that then he has disbelieved. So, knowledge (<em>al-ilm)</em> is an attribute of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. Allaah knew whatever was and whatever will not be and whatever is. If something were to occur, how it will be and He wrote it down in the preserved tablet (a<em>l-Lawh al-Mahfudh)</em> before He created the heavens and the earth. So, therefore, whoever denies <em>al-ilm (</em>Allaah’s knowledge) then he is a disbeliever. It’s obligatory that his repentance should be sought and he’ll either repent or he’ll be executed for disbelief and apostasy. And the Salaf (predecessors) said with regard to the <em>Qadariyyah</em>, “Argue with them concerning Allaah’s knowledge for if they deny it, they are disbelievers.” And success is granted by Allaah.”</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lessons 34 : Point 45</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that reptiles, beasts of prey and all creatures such as the tiniest ant, flies and bees are all acting as they have been commanded and they not do anything except with the permission of Allaah, the Most High.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The whole of the creation is under orders relating to the creation. The sun proceeds and the moon proceeds and the stars and the planets orbit and the creatures and the bird, everything proceeds upon the order that Allaah has decreed for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>قَالَ رَبُّنَا الَّذِي أَعْطَىٰ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ خَلْقَهُ ثُمَّ هَدَىٰ</strong> &#8211; 20:50</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He gave everything its due form and nature and created an appropriate mate for it and then He guided it to acquiring its benefit. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Soorah <u>T</u>aa <u>H</u>aa (20), <em>aayah</em> 50)<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, He ordered the whole of this worldly life and whatever is within it from existing things and beings and planets and heavens and the earth, all of them proceed in accordance with preordainment and predecree of the Creator, the Perfect and Most High and they comply with His commands relating to the creation.</p>
<p><strong>إِنَّمَا أَمْرُهُ إِذَا أَرَادَ شَيْئًا أَن يَقُولَ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ</strong> &#8211; 36:82</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, His Command, when He intends a thing, is only that He says to it, &#8220;Be!&#8221; and it is!</span></strong> (Soorah Yaaseen (36), <em>aayah</em> 82)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they precede and pass along in accordance with the command of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High and in accordance with His pre-decree and His creation and His will and His wish in submission to Him, He, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p><strong>كُلٌّ يَجْرِي لِأَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Each running its course for an appointed time.</span> </strong>(Soorah Ra`d (13), <em>aayah</em> 2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And they not do anything except with the permission of Allaah, the Most High,” </strong>meaning with the permission of Allaah relating to the creation and it is <em>al-amrul kowniyy</em> (His creational command) and the <em>mashee-ah</em> (His wish), Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. So, they do not proceed on the basis of their own desires or upon control from someone besides Allaah, the Majestic and Most High and therefore when the tyrant king said to Ibraheem `<em>alayhissalaam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِي حَاجَّ إِبْرَاهِيمَ فِي رَبِّهِ أَنْ آتَاهُ اللَّهُ الْمُلْكَ إِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ رَبِّيَ الَّذِي يُحْيِي وَيُمِيتُ قَالَ أَنَا أُحْيِي وَأُمِيتُ ۖ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ يَأْتِي بِالشَّمْسِ مِنَ الْمَشْرِقِ فَأْتِ بِهَا مِنَ الْمَغْرِبِ فَبُهِتَ الَّذِي كَفَرَ ۗ وَاللَّهُ لَا يَهْدِي الْقَوْمَ الظَّالِمِينَ &#8211; 2:258</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;I give life and cause death.&#8221; Ibrahim (Abraham) said, &#8220;Verily! Allah causes the sun to rise from the east; then cause it you to rise from the west.&#8221; So the disbeliever was utterly defeated. And Allah guides not the people, who are Zalimun (wrong-doers, etc.). </span></strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah</em> 258)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the actions of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, no one is able to do them or to copy them. So, He is the one who controls the creation, He, the Perfect and Most High and He orders it in the best and most precise arrangement, it does not alter and it does not change.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>مَّا تَرَىٰ فِي خَلْقِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ مِن تَفَاوُتٍ</strong> &#8211; 67:3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You will not see any gap in that which the Most Merciful has created.</strong></span><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratul-Mulk (67), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> 3)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the sun and the moon and the stars and the heavens and the earth since Allaah created them until Allaah wishes the end of this world, they proceed in accordance with the pre-decreed and divinely arranged order that does not change and does not alter.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Explanation been taken from Tafseer A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>abaree as usual.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“These created beings, Allaah, the Perfect and Most High created them and for each one of them He appointed <em>ibaadah</em> (worship). So, each one of these creatures and wild animals and reptiles and other than that each one of them carries our <em>ibaadah</em> (worship); the worship that it is being commanded with. He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ اللَّهَ يُسَبِّحُ لَهُ مَن فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَالطَّيْرُ صَافَّاتٍ ۖ كُلٌّ قَدْ عَلِمَ صَلَاتَهُ وَتَسْبِيحَهُ ۗ وَاللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِمَا يَفْعَلُونَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>وَلِلَّهِ مُلْكُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۖ وَإِلَى اللَّهِ الْمَصِيرُ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do you not see that Allaah, whoever is within the heavens and the earth declare His Perfection and the birds spreading their wings. Each one knows its own prayer and glorification of Him and Allaah knows whatever they do and to Allaah belongs the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and return will be to Allaah.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Noor (24), <em>aayah</em> 41-42)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from this <em>aayah,</em> we know that these creatures and birds have different types of worship for which Allaah created them and they carry them out in compliance with command of their Lord. They do not do anything from themselves and Allaah is the One who grants success.”</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lessons 34 : Point 44</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And reflecting about Allaah is an innovation because of the saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, “Reflect upon the creation and do not reflect upon Allaah because reflecting about the Lord casts doubt into the heart.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F374566673&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/it-is-obligatory-to-avoid-reflecting-upon-the-self-of-allaah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory upon the Muslim to avoid reflecting upon the Self of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic and reflecting upon how (<em>kayfiyyah)</em>, how of His names and attributes and actions? Because Allaah, the Majestic and Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِهِ عِلْمًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He, Allaah knows whatever is in front of them and whatever is behind them and they do not encompass Him with knowledge. </strong></span>(Soorah <u>T</u>aa <u>H</u>aa (20), <em>aayah</em> 110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is upon you to have <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic and to venerate the Lord, the Perfect and Most High without reflecting upon His Self and how His names and attributes are.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Reflect upon the creation but do not reflect upon Allaah,”</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> reflect upon the things created by Allaah and upon the signs Allaah has put in the creation (<em>aayaat ul-kowniyyah)</em>.This will indicate to you the power of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he mentions some lines of poetry:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"><em>&#8220;So how can the One truly worshipped be disobeyed </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"><em>or how can the denier deny Him when in everything </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"><em>there is a sign for him proving that He is one.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So you should reflect upon the signs within the creation, in the heavens and the earth and the mountains and the rocks and the trees and the oceans and the created beings to derive proof from them for the tremendousness of the Creator, the Perfect and Most High and reflect upon the <em>aayahs</em> of Allaah in the Qur&#8217;aan. But as for your reflecting upon Allaah’s Self and how His names and attributes are, then you will not be able to reach that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِهِ عِلْمًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they do not encompass Him with knowledge.<br />
</strong></span><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Soorah </span><u style="font-size:1rem;">T</u><span style="font-size:1rem;">aa </span><u style="font-size:1rem;">H</u><span style="font-size:1rem;">aa (20), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> 110)</span><a style="font-size:1rem;" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by a<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>abaraaniyy in his book <em>Al-Awsa<u>t</u></em> and also by al-Laalikaa`ee in his book <em>Sharh Usool al-I’tiqaad</em> from a <u>h</u>adeeth of `Abdullaah ibn `Umar and the reality is some of the verifiers point out of those books that the chain of narration of that <u>h</u>adeeth is weak there and the <u>h</u>adeeth is also reported though by Aboo Shaykh in his book <em>Al-Adama</em> and by Abul Qaasim al-Asbahaaniyy in his book <em>At</em>&#8211;<em>Targheeb</em> as a <u>h</u>adeeth of Ibn Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhuma</em> and this <u>h</u>adeeth was declared to be <em>hasan</em> (good) by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy due to its having a number of narrations of support also from  a narration of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu </em>and so on. At the end Shaykh al-Albaaniyy mentioned the different narrations. In summary, he said in <em>As-Saheehah</em> no. 1,788, “The <u>h</u>adeeth when its chain of narrations gathered is <em>hasan</em> (good) in my view and Allaah knows best.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah </em>said:  <em>“Reflect upon the creation but do not reflect upon Allaah,”</em> The verifier of the book mentioned that the <u>h</u>adeeth has some weakness in it and he mentioned that Shaykh al-Albaaniyy authenticates the <u>h</u>adeeth as being a <u>h</u>adeeth that is <em>hasan</em> (good) due to supports and he gave the reference for that. I (Shaykh Ahmad)  say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This <u>h</u>adeeth, its authentication needs examination and it may be the case that it is the speech of some of the Salaf and I say that reflecting upon Allaah meaning with regard to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic’s Self, this is not befitting because a servant if he thinks, he reflects then he will only think and reflect based upon what his intellect pictures and based upon what crosses his mind with regard to things that he’s actually seen or heard or known whereas Allaah, the Perfect and Most High is above all of that. So, it is not befitting that anyone reflects upon His Self, He, the Most High because whenever a person imagines something then Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic will be contrary to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What will suffice us is to reflect upon Allaah’s creation and with regard to His tremendous and amazing ability and if a person were to reflect upon his own origin that will suffice him. So, let him reflect upon how Allaah caused that sperm drop to change, which He created him from into this tremendous being. How Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic changed that sperm drop from which He created an animal; one animal from another animal and how Allaah prepared everything from the created beings for that which He intended from it. So, Allaah prepared the cows for cultivation and He prepared the camels for carrying and so on and so forth as we can see and as we know. So, the One who is able to change that sperm drop into a person and a different one into an animal, is He not the Lord who has full ability over everything? Yes indeed and we bear witness over that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So, what is important is that reflection should be upon the creation of Allaah not about His Self</strong> and let us read the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ البَصِيرُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There is nothing like Him and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Sooratush-Shooraa (42), <em>aayah</em> 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is obligatory upon us to submit to this <em>aayah</em> so that our minds do not stumble into things that are not befitting and if it is the case that Paradise contains things that no eye has ever seen and no ear has ever heard of nor have ever crossed the heart, never crossed the mind of any human and it is a created thing created by Allaah then how about the Self of Allaah? And success is granted by Allaah.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lessons 34 : Point 43</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>ومن زعم أنه يرى ربه في دار الدنيا فهو كافر بالله عز وجل</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And whoever claims that he sees his Lord in this world then he is a disbeliever in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F374551685&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/whoever-claims-that-he-saw-his-lord-in-this-world-then-he-is-a-disbeliever-in-allaah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever claims that anyone can see Allaah in this world, seeing Him with their eyes not seeing Him in a dream then he is a disbeliever; <em>kaafir</em> because Allaah, the Majestic and Most High cannot be seen in this world and therefore when <em>kaleemullaah</em>, the one to whom Allaah spoke, Moosa <em>alayhissalam</em>:</p>
<p>قَالَ رَبِّ أَرِنِي أَنظُرْ إِلَيْكَ ۚ قَالَ لَن تَرَانِي وَلَٰكِنِ انظُرْ إِلَى الْجَبَلِ فَإِنِ اسْتَقَرَّ مَكَانَهُ فَسَوْفَ تَرَانِي</p>
<p>لَمَّا تَجَلَّىٰ رَبُّهُ لِلْجَبَلِ جَعَلَهُ دَكًّا وَخَرَّ مُوسَىٰ صَعِقًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Moosaa (`<em>alayhissalaam</em>) said, “Oh my Lord, show Yourself to me so that I may look upon You.” So He said, “You will not see Me, however look at the mountain and if it remains settled at its place then you will see Me.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah</em> 143)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So no one can see Allaah in this world (<em>dunya)</em>. This is a point of consensus (<em>ijmaa)</em> amongst the scholars. Rather, seeing Allaah will be in the Hereafter because the people in this world are weak, they are not able to see Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic because of their weakness and therefore when Allaah manifested Himself to the mountain, it shattered and became dust. So, how about the son of Aadam who is made of flesh and blood?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for in the Hereafter, Allaah will give to the believers strength through which they will be able to see Allaah and they will delight in seeing Him, He, the Perfect and Most High. So, seeing Allaah in the Hereafter is established and is <em>mutawaatir</em> (quoted by a huge number of people at each level of transmission) is established for the believers. But as for in this world then no one will see Allaah with His eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They disagree whether the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> saw Him on the night of the ascent through the Heavens or did not see Him. And what is correct or the great majority are upon is that the Messenger did not see Him with His eye but rather, he saw Him with his heart and with his insight because no one can see Allaah in this life, because Allah is greater than that anyone should see Him in this life and therefore when the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Did you see your Lord on the night of the ascent (mi`raaj), ascent through the Heavens?” He said, “Noorun Anna Araahu.” (Light, how could I see Him?) ”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Muslim <u>h</u>adeeth no. (178) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Tharr <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em> that the Prophet responded:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Light, how could I see Him?”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“His screen is light, if He were to uncover it then the shining light of His face would consume whatever his gaze came upon from His creation.</strong>”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><u>H</u>adeeth also reported by Muslim (179) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Moosaa <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“As for the saying of the author,  &#8216;<em>Whoever claims that he can see His Lord in the life of this world then he is a disbeliever in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic&#8217;</em>.  I say, this claim has been claimed by many of the <strong>heretic <em>Soofees</em></strong>, those who say that they see their Lord and they see the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and take from him and take from Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic directly and they believe that they are in a station higher than the station of Messengership and whoever claims this claim then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever). There is no doubt about his disbelief and Allaah is the one who grants success.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee</strong> <em><u>h</u></em><em>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> likewise mentions the same point that,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is the claim of the <strong>extreme <em>Soofees</em></strong>, those who claim that they can take knowledge directly from Allaah, the Most High by way of Kashf and who claim that they can obtain knowledge of the hidden and unseen (<em>ghaib)</em> directly from Allaah, the Most High, this point refers to the like of them and that claim is disbelief.”</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lessons 32 &amp; 33 : Point 42</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:right;">وكل ما سمعت من الآثار شيئا مما لم يبلغه عقلك نحو قول رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم قلوب العباد بين إصبعين من أصابع الرحمن عز وجل وقوله إن الله ينزل إلى السماء الدنيا وينزل يوم عرفة وينزل يوم القيامة وإن جهنم لا يزال يطرح فيها حتى يضع عليها قدمه جل ثناؤه وقول الله تعالى للعبد إن مشيت إلي هرولت إليك وقوله خلق الله آدم على صورته وقول رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم رأيت ربي في أحسن صورة وأشباه هذه الأحاديث فعليك بالتسليم والتصديق والتفويض والرضا ولا تفسر شيئا من هذه بهواك فإن الإيمان بهذا واجب فمن فسر شيئا من هذا بهواه ورده فهو جهمي</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And whenever you hear something from the narrations, which your intellect cannot fully comprehend such as the saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam : </em></span><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“The hearts of the servants are between two fingers from the fingers of the Most Merciful, the Mighty and Majestic”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">and His saying:</span>  <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Allaah descends to the lowest heaven and He descends on the Day of `Arafah and He will descend on the Day of Resurrection and that the Hellfire will continue to have people cast into it until He, the Majestic and Praise will place His foot upon it”</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">and the saying of Allaah the Most High to the servant: </span><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“if you come towards Me walking, I will comes towards you running.”</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And His saying <strong>“Allaah created Aadam upon His image.”</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And the saying of the Messenger of Allaah <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam : </em></span><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“I saw my Lord in the most excellent form” </strong></span><span style="color:#993300;">and the like of these <em>ahaadeeth</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Then upon you is to submit and to believe and to consign the how to Allaah and to be pleased and do not explain anything from this based upon your desires since having <em>eemaan</em> in this is obligatory so whoever explains anything from this based upon his desires and rejects it then he is a <em>Jahmee</em>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-attributes-of-allaah-the-creed-of-ahlus-sunnah-wal-jamaah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The texts of the <em>sifaat</em> (attributes) that are established for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, it is obligatory upon you to affirm them just as they come upon their reality without interfering with them with your intellect and saying this does not befit Allaah. Allaah is declared free of that and this is resemblance; <em>tashbeeh</em>, as is said by the <em>Mu’attilah</em>; deniers of the attributes or that you believe that Allaah resembles His creation as is said by the <em>Mumaththilah</em>; those who declare the Creator to be like the creation. So each of the two groups are upon misguidance.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong><em>Mu`attilah</em>;</strong> those who deny the attributes, they went beyond the limit in <em>tanzeeh</em> (declaring Allaah free) to such an extent that they denied the names and attributes in order to flee away from <em>tashbeeh</em> (resemblance) they claimed.</li>
<li><strong><em>Mumaththilah</em>;</strong> those who liken Allaah to the creation, they went beyond the limit in affirming to such an extent that they likened Allaah to His creation.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:left;">Both of these positions are <em>baatil</em> (false and futile).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the position of the Ahl-ul-Sunnah is <em>al-wasa<u>t</u></em> (the middle and justly balanced position), they affirm the names and attributes for Allaah with affirmation without <em>tashbeeh</em> (without likening Allaah to the creation) and they negate from Him any resemblance to a created being declaring Him free of imperfections but without denying the attributes. This is the position of the <em>Ahl-ul Sunnah W`al Jama`ah</em>. In accordance with His saying He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ ۖ</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratus-Shurah (42) <em>aayah</em> 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a refutation of the <em>Mumaththilah</em>; those who liken Allaah to the creation, <strong>“there is nothing like Him.” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And He, Allaah is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratus-Shurah (42) <em>aayah</em> 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a refutation of the <em>Mu`attilah</em>; those who deny the attributes and the <em>aayah</em> proves that affirming the names and attributes does not necessitate <em>tashbeeh </em>(resemblance) to the creation nor <em>tamtheel </em>(His being like) the creation and the fact that the people affirm whatever attributes He has affirmed for Himself or His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, we affirm those attributes and that in no way necessitates that we have likened Him to the creation or declared Him to be resemblance to the creation. This is the correct methodology with regard to the matter of <em>Al-Asma Wa-Sifaat</em> (names and the attributes).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Like such as <strong>“The hearts of the servants are between two fingers from the fingers of the Most Merciful, the Mighty and Majestic,”</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> you should affirm <em>a<u>s</u>aabi`</em> (the fingers) for the Most Merciful as occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth and you should not say that they are like the fingers of the created being for this is <em>tashbeeh</em> (likening) Him to the creation, we declare Allaah free of it. Rather, we affirm it as befits the Majesty of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High not like the fingers of the created beings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we affirm the <em><u>H</u>adeeth Qudsee</em> in which Allaah, the Majestic and Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Whoever comes to me walking, I come to him running.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning whoever hastens towards My pleasure and towards obedience to Me then I will hasten to forgive his sins and to carry out his needs. so the meaning of <em>harwalah</em> (running) is not the meaning that is well-known with us but rather it is explained by the end of the <u>h</u>adeeth by His saying, <strong>“If he were to ask Me, I would certainly give to him and if he were to ask My refuge, I would certainly grant him refuge.” </strong>So, the meaning of <em>al-harwalah</em> here is hastening to carry out the needs of His servant just as the servant hastens to the obedience to Allaah. So, does the servant run in reality or in meaning?<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this contains a refutation of some of those who are overhasty in affirming <em>al-harwalah</em> (running) for Allaah and this is the case of actions which are done as a response just as He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">فَيَسْخَرُونَ مِنْهُمْ ۙ سَخِرَ اللَّهُ مِنْهُمْ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So they (the disbelievers) mock at the believers, Allaah will mock at them.</span></strong>(Sooratut-Towbah (9), <em>aayah</em> 79)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High said:</p>
<p>إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُسْتَهْزِئُونَ</p>
<p>اللَّهُ يَسْتَهْزِئُ بِهِمْ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They (the hypocrites) say, “We were only mocking.” Allaah will mock them.</span></strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah</em> 14-15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَمَكَرُوا وَمَكَرَ اللَّهُ ۖ وَاللَّهُ خَيْرُ الْمَاكِرِينَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they plotted and Allaah planned.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah</em> 154)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is obligatory to have awareness of these tremendous principles so that a person may be upon clear insight and be aware of the position of the <em><strong>Salaf</strong> </em>with regard to it; those who are more firmly grounded than you and had more knowledge than you and a person should not try and make himself independent with his own understanding and his own intellect and affirm for Allaah things that he does not know about based upon what is apparent or based upon some unclear things, when there are decisive evidences, which explain and clarify them. So, it is obligatory to refer that which is unclear back to that which is clear and only those who are firmly grounded in knowledge will be guided to doing this. So, it is obligatory upon the student of knowledge and the beginner that he should not be hasty in these matters. Rather, he should withhold with regard to them and he should learn how he is to understand them upon the methodology of the <em>Salaf </em>and upon the clear, correct way. The <em>Salaf</em> (predecessors) did not fall short in making the truth clear and in laying down principles and regulations. However, this requires learning and understanding.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the like of this also is his saying <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Our Lord descends to the lowest heaven.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“And He descends on the evening of Arafah.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“He will come on the Day of Resurrection.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">هَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَّا أَن يَأْتِيَهُمُ اللَّهُ فِي ظُلَلٍ مِّنَ الْغَمَامِ وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ وَقُضِيَ الْأَمْرُ ۚ وَإِلَى اللَّهِ تُرْجَعُ الْأُمُورُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do they but await that Allaah should come to them screened by clouds and the angels come and the affair will be finished and to Allaah return all affairs. </strong></span>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah</em> 210)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise with regard to Allaah, the Most High’s coming on the Day of Resurrection, it occurs also as a side point in a <u>h</u>adeeth of Abu Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em>.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“He will come on the Day of Resurrection to carry out judgement upon His servants.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We affirm these matters for Allaah upon their reality (<em><u>h</u>aqeeqah)</em> without interfering by defining the <em>kayfiyyah</em> (how). So, we do not burden ourselves with awareness of how He will descend and how He will come. So, the <em>kayfiyyah</em> (how), we do not enter into it but as for the meaning then it is <em>ma’qool</em> (understood) and therefore, when Imaam Maalik was asked about how <em>al-istiwaa</em>; how the ascending is when the questioner said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">الرَّحْمَٰنُ عَلَى الْعَرْشِ اسْتَوَىٰ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The Most Merciful ascended over the Throne.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah <u>T</u>aa <u>H</u>aa (20), <em>aayah</em> 5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the questioner said to Imaam Maalik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“How did He ascend?”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was asking about <em>kayfiyyah</em> (how).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Maalik <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said to him:</p>
<p><strong>الاستواء معلوم</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The ascending is known.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning known with regard to its meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Maalik said:</p>
<p><strong>والكيف مجهول , والإيمان به واجب , والسؤال عنه بدعة</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And how is unknown and having eemaan in it is obligatory and asking about it is bid’ah (innovation).” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the sound methodology in the like of these affairs.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, affirmation of <em>a<u>s</u>&#8211;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">soorah</span></em> (a form) for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic in his saying <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Allaah created Aadam upon his image.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in a narration:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Upon the form of the Most Merciful one.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, we affirm <em>a<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>soo</u>rah</em> (a form or image) for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic just as His Messenger affirmed it for Him in his saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“I saw my Lord in the best form.”</strong></span> <a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">i.e this was in the world seeing Him in a dream in the best form. It contains affirmation of <em>a<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>soo</u>rah</em> (form or image) for Allaah, the Majestic and Most High as befits His Majesty, not like the images of the created beings but rather, it is the <em>a<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>soo</u>rah</em> (image or form) of the Most Merciful, the Majestic and Most High. So, these matters, we affirm them and we do not enter into them nor raise doubts about them nor delve further into them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>We consign or surrender the matter,” </strong>what is correct is to perform <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>tafwee<u>d</u></em> of the <em>kayfiyyah</em></span> (how) it is, not <em>tafwee<u>d</u></em> of the meaning.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>Do not explain anything from these with your desires,”</strong> rather you must explain them with the correct meaning that befits Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. It should not be said that they are not to be explained. Rather, they are to be explained and their meaning is to be made clear and <em>tafwee<u>d</u></em> (surrender, consigning) is just with regard to how only. So, therefore you affirm <em>an-nuzool</em> (His descending) but you negate the <em>kayfiyyah</em> (how). Allaah, the Majestic and Most High comes on the Day of Resurrection to carry out the judgement just as He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَجَاءَ رَبُّكَ وَالْمَلَكُ صَفًّا صَفًّا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord will come.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fajr (89), <em>aayah</em> 22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">هَلْ يَنظُرُونَ إِلَّا أَن يَأْتِيَهُمُ اللَّهُ فِي ظُلَلٍ مِّنَ الْغَمَامِ وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ وَقُضِيَ الْأَمْرُ ۚ وَإِلَى اللَّهِ تُرْجَعُ الْأُمُورُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do they but await that Allaah comes to them screened by clouds and the angels and the affair is concluded.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah</em> 210)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Perfect will come to carry out judgement upon His servants. However, it is not like the coming of the created being and the coming of one of the creation. Rather, it is coming as befits His Majesty however He wishes, He, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>You should not explain any of this <em>Bi Hawaaka</em> (with your desires),” </strong>meaning do not explain them without knowledge (`<em>ilm)</em> but as for your explaining them as necessitated by the evidences and referring that which is unclear back to that which is clear then there is no harm in it. But as for a person who is a beginner or an ignorant person then he should not enter into these very grave matters and these tremendous matters because this is a mistake and something very dangerous and I see many of the youth who feign knowledge being bold upon the matters of <em>`aqeedah</em> and they start to derive things from them and to speak about them and then they have enmity towards each other based upon these things and they break ties with each other when they disagree.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, oh brothers, Allaah did not burden us with these matters. Upon you is to proceed upon the methodology of the <em>Salaf</em> and to say what they said. The books of <em>`aqeedah</em> are precisely written and all praise is for Allaah and printed and corrected and being studied and carefully checked so do not introduce things from yourselves and understandings from yourselves, you have been  sufficed having to do this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>Having <em>eemaan</em> in this is obligatory,”</strong> having <em>eemaan</em> in the names of Allaah and attributes and His actions is obligatory. It is obligatory upon the servant and from having <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah is to have <em>eemaan</em> in His names and His attributes as befits His Majesty, He, the Perfect and Most High. So, the person who interferes in the matters of names and attributes, either with <em>ta`<u>t</u>eel</em> (negation) or with <em>tamtheel </em>(likening the Creator to the creation) or with <em>tafwee<u>d</u></em> (claiming ignorance about the meaning) or by bringing explanation from himself then this person has not believed in Allaah with true and full <em>eemaan</em>. Rather, his <em>eemaan</em> is deficient.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>So, whoever explains anything from this based upon his desires and rejects it then he is a Jahmee,” </strong>the Jahmiyyah negated the names and attributes because they explain them in accordance with what befits the created being. There is no doubt that Allaah is declared free of that which befits the created being. So, they <strong>initially</strong> likened Him and then <strong>secondly</strong>, they negated based upon their <em>tamtheel</em> (having likened Him to the creation) since nothing was apparent to them from these texts except that which resembles the created beings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, therefore they denied them on account of that but as for if they had just said these texts contain attributes and names of Allaah in reality, that they are as befit Him, they are not like the names of the created beings nor like the attributes of the created beings, if they’d just followed this methodology, they would have been safe and sound but they were afflicted on account of their understanding and their desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Jahmiyyah, this is an ascription to Al-Jahm ibn <u>S</u>afwaan at-Tirmidhiyy or As-Samar Qandee, this well-known deviant, ascribed to the town of Tirmidh or the area of Samar Qand and he was the first one who manifested the saying that the Qur&#8217;aan is created and who had the saying that the names and the attributes are to be negated and who said that <em>eemaan</em> is just merely awareness in the heart to the rest of his sayings of misguidance and disbelief. So, whoever holds this belief then he is ascribed to him or it is to be said this person is a Jahmee in ascription to Al-Jahm.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Part of a <u>h</u>adeeth reported by Muslim (2,654) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of `Abdullaah ibn `Amr ibn al-`Aas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhuma</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (7,405) and Muslim (2,675) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Abu Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> <strong>Side point:</strong> Whether <em>ar-harwalah</em> (running) is to be understood literally or it’s to be explained as Shaykh al-Fowzaan mentioned in the likes of what occurs at the end of the <u>h</u>adeeth then as Shaykh al-Fowzaan <em><u>h</u></em><em>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said, <span style="font-size:1rem;">This is also what was said by Shaykh ul-Islaam ibn Taymeeyah in </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">Majmoo` al-Fataawa</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> and likewise you’ll find in the explanation of Shaykh Saalih Aal ash-Shaykh upon </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">Al-Waasi<u>t</u>iyyah</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> of Ibn Taymeeyah, the same explanation, he explained it that here in this particular hadeeth </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">al-harwalah</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> means </span><strong style="font-size:1rem;">Allaah, the Most High’s hastening to carry out the needs of His servant and to forgive him.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, there are others from the People of Knowledge who affirm <em>al-harwalah</em> (running) as an attribute for Allaah, the Most High as is apparent. From them was Imaam Ad-Daranee in his refutation of Al-Mareesee. Likewise, from the present day scholars Shaykh bin Baaz <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> in his <em>fataawa</em>; <em>Fataawa Noor `Alaa al-Darb</em>. Likewise, Shaykh ibn `Uthaymeen in his fataawa and in his fataawa of al-`aqeedah in his book <em>Al-Qawaa`id al-Muthlaa</em> and Shaykh `Ubayd in his explanation, he agreed with that as well. Likewise, the <em>Saudi Lajna</em> also and likewise, Shaykh al-Albaaniyy in <em>Silsilatul Huda Wan-Noor</em> tape series, all of them affirming this as an attribute for Allaah as befits His Majesty.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, <strong>Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee</strong> <em><u>h</u></em><em>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said in his taped explanation &#8211; &#8220;So, the <em>Salaf</em> had a great deal of speech concerning it, however, what has most right in the matter is that we should have eemaan in it as befits the Majesty of Allaah, meaning we affirm it as an attribute for Allaah as it stands and it is a proof for His responding to His creation, we affirm the attribute and what’s necessitated by the attribute is that Allaah indeed responds to His creation. So what is indicated by the attribute and its affect is His reward. So affirming the attribute <em>ar-harwalah</em> has more right than the saying of those who say that it means giving reward alone.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (6,321) and Muslim (758) from Abu Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5">[5]</a> Reported by Muslim (1,348) from `Aa`ishah that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“There is no day when Allaah frees more slaves from the fire than the day of Arafah and He indeed draws close then He boasts about them to the angels and says “what do those people want?”</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref6" name="_ftn6">[6]</a> Reported by Al Bukhaariyy (806) and Muslim (182), a long <u>h</u>adeeth containing the wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“And Allaah will come to them, He, the Mighty and Majestic.”</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref7" name="_ftn7">[7]</a> He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَجَاءَ رَبُّكَ وَالْمَلَكُ صَفًّا صَفًّا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord will come and the angels in ranks.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Fajr (89), <em>aayah</em> 22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref8" name="_ftn8">[8]</a> <strong>Side point:</strong> Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee <em><u>h</u></em><em>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> in his explanation mentioned a number of attributes and he applied the same principle to each one with regard to Allaah’s hand for example, he says, “The hand the meaning is known, the how is unknown, having eemaan in it is obligatory and asking how is an innovation.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref9" name="_ftn9">[9]</a> Reported by Al Bukhaariyy (6,227) and reported by Muslim (2,841) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Abu Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref10" name="_ftn10">[10]</a> Reported by A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>abaraaniyy in <em>Al-Mu’jam al-Kabeer</em> and by Al-Haarith ibn `Abee Usaamah in his <em>Musnad</em> and by Ibn Khuzaymah in <em>Kitaab at-Taw<u>h</u>eed</em> from a <u>h</u>adeeth of `Abdullaah ibn `Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhuma</em> and it was declared authentic by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad and Is<u>h</u>aaq ibn Raahaweyh as occurs in <em>Meezaan al-I’tidaal</em> of Imaam a<u>th</u>&#8211;<u>Th</u>ahabiyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Side point:</strong> Some of the People of Knowledge such as Ibn Khuzaymah and some others declare this wording to be weak and likewise Shaykh al-Albaaniyy declared this wording weak in <em>A<u>d</u>&#8211;<u>D</u>a`eefah</em>, <u>h</u>adeeth number 1,176 because of four weaknesses in the chain of narration. Ibn Khuzaymah himself pointed out three of the weaknesses and Shaykh al-Albaaniyy mentions the 4<sup>th</sup> weakness as well, Allaahu `Aalam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref11" name="_ftn11">[11]</a> Reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad in his <em>Musnad</em> and it should be volume 5, page 243 and by At-Tirmidhiyy in his <em>Sunan</em> from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Mu`aadh <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and it was declared authentic by At-Tirmidhiyy and he mentioned Al-Bukhaariyy declared it authentic also and likewise it was declared  <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (authentic) by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref12" name="_ftn12">[12]</a> <strong>Side Point:</strong> The position of the People of the Sunnah is with regard to the attributes of Allaah, the Most High then we say just as Imaam Maalik said as for the meaning of the attributes then we affirm the meaning but as regards to how the attribute is then we do not know so that is what we consign to Allaah, we give up on that, how it is; we do not know, we leave that to our Lord, Allaahu `Aalam. Whereas, as regards to the <em>Mufawwidah</em>; the deviant group then they  do the <em>tafwee<u>d</u></em> of the meaning i.e  they say we don’t know what the meaning is.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 16 : Point 14</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And to have Eemaan in seeing Allaah on the Day of Resurrection. They will see Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, with the eyes of their heads. And He will bring them to account without any mediator </span></strong>[01]<strong><span style="color:#993300;"> or any interpreter.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F364407587&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-believers-will-see-their-lord-on-the-day-of-resurrection-openly-with-their-eyes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the tremendous and important matters of `<em>aqeedah</em> is: <span style="font-size:1rem;">Affirmation of the fact that the true believers will see their Lord on the Day of Resurrection openly with their eyes, just as they see the Moon on the night of the full Moon and just as they see the Sun clearly, not obscured by any clouds, as occurs in the authentic </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">ahaadith</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> which are </span><strong style="font-size:1rem;"><em>mutawaatir</em> </strong><span style="font-size:1rem;">(reported by huge numbers of people at every level of transmission, so many that it is impossible to could have got together upon lie) affirming the believers seeing their Lord.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Imaam Ibnul-Qayyim brought in Haadiyul-Arwah (ilaa Bilaadil-Afraah) the hadeeth occurring about this. And he did so at great length, quoting their chains of narration; and they are <em>mutawaatir</em> (reported by huge numbers of people at every level of transmission) affirming that the believers will indeed see their Lord openly with their eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the people of misguidance from the deviant sects, such as the Mu`tazilah and those who took their position, they opposed this and they denied ar-ru&#8217;yah (the Seeing, that the believers will indeed see Allaah on the Day of Resurrection). And it is something mentioned in the Qur&#8217;aan. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">For those who did well in the world, will be al-husnaa</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (the finest reward of Paradise)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> and <em>ziyaadah</em> </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(an increase)</span> [02] (Soorah Yoonus (10), aayah 26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There occurs in Saheeh Muslim that the ziyaadah, the increase, is looking at the Face of Allaah the Perfect and Most High. [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They shall have whatever they (the believers in Paradise) wish therein and with Us there is something extra.</span></strong>(Soorah Qaaf (50), aayah 35)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em><strong>al-mazeed</strong></em>, that which is extra, is looking at the Face of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. And there occurs in Sooratul-Qiyaamah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Some faces on that day (Day of Resurrection) will be radiant, looking at their Lord</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Qiyamah(75), aayahs 22-23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Naadirah</em> with a <em>daad</em> from <em>an-nudrah</em>, radiance, which means that which is shining and beautiful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You will recognise upon their faces <em>nadrah</em> (the radiance) of bliss</strong></span> (Sooratul-Mutaffifeen (83), aayah 24)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8230;looking at their Lord</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With a <em>zaa</em>· (<em>naazirah</em>) meaning with their eyes. They will be looking at Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, feeling more joy at that than the joy which they experience on account of the bliss in Paradise. This occurs in the Honourable Qur&#8217;aan. In Sooratul-Mutaffifeen He said with regard to the disbelievers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">But no, on that Day, the disbelievers will be screened away and prevented from seeing their Lord</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Mutaffifeen (83), aayah 15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning screened and blocked from seeing Allaah. So if the disbelievers are blocked from seeing Allaah, then this is a proof that the believers will see their Lord the Mighty and Majestic. [04] And that is because the believers believed in Him in this world, yet they did not see Him. Rather they relied upon the evidences and therefore believed in Him. And they believed in His Messengers. So they believed in Him even though they did not see Him in this world. So therefore Allaah will honour them in Paradise that He will show Himself to them, so that they will see Him openly because they believed in Him in this world and did not see Him. But as for the disbelievers, because of the fact that they disbelieved in Him in this world, therefore Allaah will block them from seeing Him on the Day of Resurrection as a recompense (punishment) for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">as a fully appropriate recompense.</span> </strong>(Sooratun-Naba· (78), aayah 26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the false doubts which the Mu`tazilah rely upon, and those who held their saying, is that Allaah said to Moosaa: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">You shall not see Me.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And when Moosaa came to Our appointed place and His Lord spoke to Him, he </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Moosaa)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> said O My Lord show Yourself to Me, so that I may look upon You. So He </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Allaah the Most High) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">said You will not see Me. However look at the mountain. So if it remains settled in its place, then You will see Me</span> </strong>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), aayah 143)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said, “And this is a proof that Allaah cannot be seen.” We say: Yes this is with regard to this world, because the event occurred in this world. We agree that Allaah cannot be seen in this world. So Moosaa asked to see Him in this world, so Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, said: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">He said You will not see Me </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8211;</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> </span></strong>Meaning in this life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And an-nafee, negation, with <strong><em>Lan</em> </strong>(in Arabic it is negation of something that is occurring in the future) does not necessitate <em>ta&#8217;beed</em> (its being something forever). Rather it is a negation for a certain time. So (His saying) : <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He said You will not see Me &#8211; </strong></span>Meaning, ‘You will not see Me in this world.’ And there occurs in the Arabic language that negating something with <em>Lan</em> does not necessitate its being forever (a negation forever). And therefore Ibnu Maalik [05] said in al-Kaafiyatush-Shaafiyah in nahw (Arabic grammar):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Whoever holds the opinion that negating something with Lan means forever, Then reject his saying and support other than it.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning that <em>Lan</em> does not necessitate a negation that is forever. And the proof is also that Allaah said with regard to the Jews:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Then wish for death if you are truthful. But they will never wish for it</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayahs 94-95)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet it occurs that in the Hereafter they will indeed wish for death in order to be relieved from the torment. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They will call out ‘O Maalik! Let Your Lord put an end to us’</span></strong> (Sooratuz-Zukhruf (43), aayah 77)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they will request death. So this proves that <em>Lan</em> does not mean negation without end. This is what is necessitated by the Arabic language and it is what is necessitated by what is indicated in the Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They say also that what proves that Allaah cannot be seen is His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Sight cannot encompass Him (Allaah) but He encompasses Sight</span></strong> (Sooratul- An`aam (6), aayah 103)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We say to them: this does not contain a negation of Seeing (ru·yah), rather it only negates totally encompassing (idraak). He did not say, “Sight will not see Him.” He said, &#8220;it will not encompass Him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And denying <strong>encompassing</strong> is something different to denying <strong>seeing</strong>. So sight will see Him, however it will not encompass Him. So idraak means encompassing Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. So Even though they will see Him in Paradise, they will not fully encompass Him, He the Perfect and Most High. So what is negated here is encompassing him. [06] So they will see Him but they will not fully encompass Him. They will see Him as is proven by the evidences. And harmonizing the texts is what is obligatory. If there are differences between texts, then as far as it is possible to harmonize between them, this must be done. And this is clear; and all Praise is for Allaah. And the Speech of Allaah can never contradict itself. Rather some parts of it explain other parts. As for the person who takes one aayah and abandons a different ayaah, then this is from the people of deviation. He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So as for those people in whose hearts is deviation, then they follow that which is unclear, seeking discord and seeking to falsely interpret it</span> </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), aayah 7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So evidence is taken from the Qur&#8217;aan in totality.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">All of it is from our Lord</span> </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), aayah 7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as the <em>raasikhoon</em> (those firmly grounded in knowledge) say. So the Qur&#8217;aan, some parts of it explain the rest. And there can never be any contradiction in it because Allaah has negated from it any contradiction. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Will they not ponder/reflect upon the Qur&#8217;aan. If it had been from other than Allaah, they would certainly would have found in it many contradictions</span> </strong>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), aayah 82)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if you have a problem in understanding an aayah, then you look into the Qur&#8217;aan for that which will explain it. And if you do not find that, then you go to the Sunnah to find that which will explain it in the Sunnah. And if you do not find its explanation in the Sunnah, then you go to the sayings of the Companions, those who narrated from the Messenger sallAllaahu ` alayhi wa sallam, to find in their sayings that which will explain the aayah which you have a problem in understanding. The Qur&#8217;aan, and all Praise is for Allaah, is preserved in its wording and in its meaning. It neither opposes nor contradicts itself, rather contradictions only occur in the understandings of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise those false claimants to knowledge, those who did not truly study knowledge and did not take the principles of deriving evidence and of how to reach conclusions, they derive proof without understanding (fiqh). And they affirm things which no-one before them affirmed from the people of knowledge because of jahl, ignorance, and because of ta`aalum, pseudo-knowledge/false knowledge. So these are tremendous matters which require learning and require precision and require careful consideration and require verification, because the `aqeedah (creed and belief) is the foundation. And if there are deficiencies in it, this will be a deficiency in the foundation (of your religion). So in summary, this is the disagreement of the people with regard to seeing Allaah the Mighty and Majestic on the Day of Resurrection. So Allaah cannot be seen in this world. He will only be seen by the believers in the Hereafter. And He will be screened away from the disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And having Eemaan in ar-ru&#8217;yah (seeing Him) on the Day of Resurrection.”</strong> Why did he say on the Day of Resurrection? Because He, the Majestic and Most High, cannot be seen in this world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, <strong>“They will see Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, with the eyes of their heads.”</strong> He said with the eyes of their heads to negate ta&#8217;weel, false interpretation/ misinterpretation, of those who say the meaning of ‘they will see their Lord’ means: with their hearts, not with their sight.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And He will bring them to account without any mediator and without any interpreter.”</strong> Meaning, on the Day of Resurrection at the <em>hisaab</em>, Reckoning, the servant will be in private with his Lord. And Allaah will call him to account for his deeds in his language which the servant will understand. There will be no interpreter between him and Him. The interpreter is one who conveys the meaning from one language to another language, like the one who conveys the meaning from the English language to the Arabic language or vice versa because the languages are many.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Muhammad ibn Jareer At-Tabaree, the famous mufassir of the Qur&#8217;aan, explained this part of the aayah by saying, “For those from His creation who performed the worship of Allaah well in this world, such that they obeyed Him with regard to what He commanded them and forbade them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] Reported by Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 181) (in the Book of Eemaan) (Hadeeth of) Suhayb radiAllaahu `anh, from the Prophet sallAllaahu ` alayhi wa sallam that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“When the people of Paradise enter Paradise, Allaah, the Exalted and Most High, will say, ‘Do you wish for Me to give you any increase?’ So they will say, ‘Have You not made our faces white? Have You not entered us into Paradise and saved us from the Fire.’ He said: So then He will uncover the screen and they will not have been given anything which is more beloved to them than looking at their Lord the Mighty and Majestic. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">And then he recited this aayah:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">For those who did well in the world, there will be the best reward (of Paradise) and an increase (looking upon their Lord).</span></strong> (Soorah Yoonus (10), aayah 26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> As Imaam ash-Shaafi`ee also said, that this is mentioned as being a punishment for the disbelievers that they will blocked, not able to see their Lord. So therefore the believers who will not be punished, this is affirmation that they will indeed see their Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[06] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Some of the people of knowledge mention a point that a person for example from a distance may see the walls of a town, but not see what is beyond the walls, he may see the town but he doesn’t see what is beyond the town, what is inside the town and all the details, all around the town from every aspect. He does not encompass the town he can just see the town. So there is a clear difference between idraak, totally encompassing something, and between seeing it.</p>

<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And the Qur&#8217;aan is the Speech of Allaah, His Revelation and His Light. It is not created, because the Qur&#8217;aan is from Allaah and that which is from Allaah is not created. This is what was stated by Maalik ibn Anas and by Ahmad ibn Hanbal rahimahumAllaah and by the jurists who came before them and after them. And disputation concerning it is disbelief.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-quraan-is-the-speech-of-allaah-and-it-is-not-created" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And the Qur&#8217;aan is the Speech of Allaah, and His Revelation sent down and His Light. And it is not created”</strong>. From the creed and belief of AhlusSunnah wal-Jamaa`ah, the People of the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah is that the Qur&#8217;aan is the Speech of Allaah. He spoke with it in reality and Jibreel heard it from Him and he descended with it to Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. No one disagreed about this creed and belief, (no-one) from the people of knowledge who proceeded upon the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. The only ones who disagreed about it were the people of misguidance from the Jahmiyyah, the followers of Al-Jahm ibn Safwaan, and the offspring of the Jahmiyyah who are the Mu`tazilah and the Zaydiyyah and the Shee`ah. All of those people took up this matter from the Jahmiyyah. And likewise the Ibaadiyyah; all of them proceeded upon the methodology which contradicts the methodology of the Ahlus-Sunnah walJamaa`ah. And they held that the Qur&#8217;aan is something created because, in their view, Allaah is not to be described as speaking, just as He is not described with the Attribute of Hearing or Seeing or Knowing or Willing and other than that, in their view. Nor is he described as having a Face or having two Hands to other than that. And their intent in this is to corrupt the `aqeedah (creed and belief). Even if they try to make it seem that their intent is actually to declare Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, free from any resemblance to the created beings. And this is a false claim, because the Attributes of the Lord, the Perfect, do not resemble the attributes of the created beings. So the Lord, the Majestic and Most High, has Names (asmaa·) and Attributes (sifaat) which befit Him and His Greatness. And the created beings have names and attributes/characteristics which are appropriate for them and for their human nature. So there is no resemblance between the two types from the aspect of true reality, haqeeqah and of the ‘how’, kayfiyyah, even though they share in the meaning and the wording. And this is called al-mutawaati·, different things which are covered by a common word. However, they do not share in the reality and in how they are (kayfiyyah). This is the position of the Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah, and their proof for this is from the Book of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And if anyone from the people of shirk seeks that you grant him protection then grant him protection so that he can hear the Speech of Allaah</span></strong> (Sooratut-Towbah (9), aayah 6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He ascribed Speech to Himself, He the Perfect and Most High, and said with regard to the hypocrites:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They wish to alter the Speech of Allaah</strong></span> (Sooratul-Fat.h (48), aayah 15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He ascribed it to Himself. And the proofs from the Sunnah and the <em>ijmaa</em>` (consensus of this nation) are many for this matter. So it is a matter of certainty without there being any doubt. And the disagreement of the people of misguidance does not affect the fact that the Qur&#8217;aan is the Speech of Allaah. And it is one instance of His Speech, He the Perfect. So Allaah speaks and He continues to speak whenever He wishes, if He wishes, with whatever He wishes. He has the Attribute of <em>Kalaam</em> (Speech) and this Qur&#8217;aan is one of the instances of the Speech of Allaah. So He spoke with the Tawraah and (He spoke) with the Injeel and with the Zaboor. He speaks with commands and with prohibitions. He says to something <em>kun</em>, be, and it is.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">His </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Allaah&#8217;s)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> command, when He wills something, is just that He says to it be, and it is.</span></strong> (Soorah Yaaseen (36), aayah 82)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He affirmed for Himself qawl (Saying).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>When Allaah said O `Eesaa</strong> </span>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), aayah 55)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He spoke to Moosaa, with Speech which Moosaa heard when He sent him to Fir&#8217;awn (the Pharaoh). So Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, has the Attribute of Speech and from His Speech is the honourable Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the saying of the people of misguidance, that its being ascribed to Allaah is ascribing a created thing to its Creator, like the she-camel of Allaah or the House of Allaah; so we say this is a lie, and it is a deception. That which is ascribed to Allaah is of two categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first category</strong> is ascription of abstract things or Attributes (ma`aanin) &#8211;  i.e non-material objects</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second category</strong> is ascribing material objects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abstract things or Attributes which are ascribed to Allaah: then this is to ascribe an Attribute to the One who has the Attribute. And it is a <strong>true and real ascription</strong>. So this will be from His Attributes, such as Speech and Hearing and Seeing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ascribing objects, such as the she-camel and the House of Allaah (the Ka`bah) this is ascription of a created thing to the One who created it. And it is an <strong>ascription to show honour</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But those people (those who say the Speech of Allaah means the speech created by Allaah) they have mixed up these two matters and they do not make a distinction between this and this. And therefore the People of the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah state this matter in the Books of creed and beliefs to refute the people of misguidance. And if Allaah did not have Speech, as those people claim, then how does He command and prohibit? And the meaning of this would be that the Islamic rulings are nullified. And it undermines the main foundation and it is the Qur&#8217;aan. So if this fundamental is undermined, then Islaam would collapse. However they take cover under the claim of <strong><em>tanzeeh</em> </strong>(declaring Allaah free from resemblance to the creation). But this is not <em>tanzeeh</em>, rather it is <strong><em>ta`teel</em> </strong>(purely striping Him of Attributes). And there is a difference between <em>ta`teel</em> denying Attributes and between <em>tanzeeh</em> (declaring Him free from resemblance). <em>At-tanzeeh</em> is that which Allaah mentioned in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him</span> </strong>(Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do you know of anyone similar to Him?</span></strong> (Soorah Maryam (19), aayah 65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is tanzeeh, declaring the Creator free of resemblance to the creation, which is mentioned by Allaah. And it is to deny any resemblance between the creation and the Creator or that the creation is equal to the Creator. That is what Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, is declared free of. But as for denying the Attributes, then that is just ta`teel, pure denial and negation, which comes about as a result of <strong><em>tashbeeh</em> </strong>[01] . So they imagine resemblance initially and then they deny the Attributes secondly. And this is not tanzeeh, declaring the Creator free of resemblance. So there is a difference between tanzeeh, declaring the Creator free of resemblance and between ta`teel, denying the Attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Ash`arees came with something astonishing</strong>, even more astonishing than the saying of the Jahmiyyah. So they said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“The Speech of Allaah is divided into two categories: the meanings and the words. The meanings, this is the Speech of Allaah. And Allaah has the Attribute that He has Speech, and it is the meaning which has existed eternally in Himself. But as for Allaah speaking with letters and with a voice, then this is to be denied for Allaah in their view. And they say it (His Speech) is just a meaning existing in Himself, He the Most Perfect and Most High. As for the words, then it is the speech of a created being meaning it is from the speech of Jibreel or from the speech of Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they made the Qur&#8217;aan to be composed of two things, from something created and from something not created. So they did not come to be with the People of the Sunnah and say that the Qur&#8217;aan is not created. And they were not with the Jahmiyyah and said that the Qur&#8217;aan all of it is created. Rather they were <strong>waverers (neither here nor there)</strong>. Just like the saying of the Christians with regard to the Messiah, that he was composed of two things, of the divine and the human. And they say that the human and divine became as one. [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in summary this matter is very great. And do not be intimidated by the traitors, those who claim that they are from the People of the Sunnah, and those who say, “This matter does not warrant all of this arguing. And Imam Ahmad went beyond the limit when he refused to say that the Qur&#8217;aan is created. And this matter does not warrant all of this.” This is present in the writings of some of those who ascribe themselves to knowledge, and some who say, “What happened between Imam Ahmad and his opponents was just a political disagreement.” But if you carefully reflect, you will find that this matter is not something slight. Because if it is denied that the Qur&#8217;aan is the Speech of Allaah, then what remains with us? If the Lord has the Attribute of Speech removed from Him, then this will be a deficiency in the Lord, the Perfect. Because the one who does not speak is not an ilaah (is not one who is deserving of worship). And Allaah, the Perfect, He rebuked the Jews when they worshipped the calf and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do they not see that it (the calf) does not speak to them.</span></strong> (Sooratul- A`raaf (7), aayah 148)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it must be the case that the Lord speaks. And He controls and He commands and He forbids. So therefore if Speech is negated for Allaah, then it would be the case that He is not deserving of divinity and the right to worship. High and Exalted is Allaah above what they say. So this is a tremendous matter. Therefore Imaam Ahmad rahimahullaah took the stance that he took, the stance of the unshakable mountains, and he would not give in, and he did not make any exceptions for himself. And he had patience upon the trial and he had patience upon imprisonment and upon being lashed and upon being demeaned by three khaleefahs (Caliphs), al-Ma·moon, al-Mu`tasim and al-Waathiq. Each one of them followed on in succession upon torturing him. They wanted him to give in, but he refused rahimahullaah and he remained firm. At the end of the time of al-Waathiq (the last of the three), it is said that he turned back from this, when there was a debate between a scholar from the People of the Sunnah and between Bishr al-Mareesee and (Bishr) al-Mareesee was defeated, and at that point al-Waathiq turned back. [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in summary, this is a tremendous matter and it is very important and must not be treated lightly. And it may not be said, as some of the ignorant people and some of the writers and the intellectuals say, or the Ash`arees or those who follow their way, they say, “This is a matter which does not warrant all of this importance and all of these refutations.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Imam Ahmad used as a proof against them His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So that he may hear the Speech of Allaah.</span></strong> (Sooratut-Towbah (9), aayah 6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Thus did Allaah say before.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fath (48), aayah 15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah said,” so He affirmed for Himself Speech and Sayings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and His Revelation sent down,”</strong> meaning the Qur&#8217;aan. He sent it down to His Prophet Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam through the intermediary Jibreel, `alayhis-salaam. He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The Trustworthy Spirit </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Jibreel, `alayhis-salaam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> descended with it </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the Qur&#8217;aan)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> to your heart </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(heart of Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> so that you should be from the warners in a clear Arabic tongue </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(language)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">.</span> </strong>(Sooratush-Shu`araa· (26), aayaat 193-195)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is clear and very apparent. Yet despite this there are some who come and say, “The Qur&#8217;aan is a created thing, not something sent down, and Allaah did not speak with it and Allaah is not described with Speech.” High and Exalted is Allaah above what they say.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and it is His Light.”</strong> The Qur&#8217;aan is described as being Light. He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">But rather We made it a Light, by which We guide whomever We wish from our servants</span></strong> (Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 52)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is called Rooh, life or spirit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We revealed to you a Rooh </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Spirit/Life/Soul)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> from our Command</span></strong>. (Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 52)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rooh, a Spirit or Life, because the hearts come to life through it (the Qur&#8217;aan), just as the bodies come to life through a spirit/soul. So it is a Spirit/Soul for the hearts. And the well-known soul is a soul for the bodies. So therefore it (the Qur&#8217;aan) is Light, and it is a Spirit and it is Guidance, and it is a Reminder and it is Admonitions, and it has many names, which shows its greatness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“because the Qur&#8217;aan is from Allaah and that which is from Allaah is not created.”</strong> Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, along with His Names and His Attributes, is not created. So He is the Creator and everything besides Him is something created. And it cannot be said that the Names and Attributes are created, because they are from Allaah, and that which is from Allaah is not created, meaning Allaah has them as His Attributes. So Allaah with His Names and His Attributes is the Creator and whatever is besides Him is created.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And likewise Maalik ibn Anas and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, may Allaah have mercy upon them, said,”</strong> This is the saying of the Imaams. And from them was Maalik, the Imaam of the abode of Hijrah (al-Madeenah), and Imaam Ahmad, the one who was tortured for that and who was harmed, may Allaah have mercy upon him, and he had patience; and others besides them from the Imaams of AhlusSunnah. This was their saying. [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and whoever came before them from the jurists (the scholars of fiqh) and whoever came after them.”</strong> Meaning, Imaam Maalik and Imaam Ahmad were not alone in this saying. Rather it was said by those who came before them from the Companions and the taabi`een and the successors of the taabi`een. And whoever came after them from the Imaams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And disputation about it is disbelief.”</strong> [05] Disputing about the Qur&#8217;aan, whether it is something created or whether it is something not created or a person having doubts and saying, “I don’t know, there is disagreement about this matter,” as people say now. So a manifestation has now appeared where they say, “The matter is khilaafiyyah/there is disagreement about this matter”. So we say: When there is disagreement, then what is to be followed is the daleel, the proof. We were not given the duty in the Religion of having to follow the disagreements of the people and sayings of the people. We have being given the duty in the Religion of following the proof. So when there is disagreement we test the disagreement against the proof. And whatever that is found to be supported by the proof, then it is the Truth. And whatever is contrary to the proof, then it is false. And Allaah did not abandon us to opinions and sayings and disagreements. Rather He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So if you disagree in anything, then refer it back to Allaah and to the Messenger.</strong> </span>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), aayah 59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad said in his book, Usoolus-Sunnah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“And the Qur&#8217;aan is the Speech of Allaah and it is not created. And a person should not be too weak to say, ‘It is not created.’ Because the Speech of Allaah is not something separate from Him. And there is nothing from Him that is created.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whatever you disagree about, then its judgement is to be referred back to Allaah. That is Allaah my Lord. Upon Him I place my reliance and to Him I turn constantly.</span> </strong>(Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory to refer back to the Book of Allaah and to the Sunnah of His Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And whatever is supported by proof is to be taken, and whatever is contrary to the proof is to be left. And as for the person who takes a saying which conforms to his desires or his whims, even if it goes against the proof, then he is one who is astray; and this one is worshipping his own desires. As for the person who is worshipping Allaah, then he takes that which is supported by the proof from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] Transcriber’s note: meaning resemblance</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Imaam ath-Thahabee, in his book Siyar A`laamin-Nubalaa· in volume 11, in the biography of <strong>Ibn Kullaab (the founder of what is called the Ash`aree creed)</strong>, said, “Abul-`Abbaas al-Baghawee said, “Thaythoon the Christian said to me, ‘May Allaah have mercy upon `Abdullaah (Ibn Kullaab). He used to come to me in the church and he used to take things from me and if he had lived, we would have turned the Muslims into Christians.’ So it was said to this Christian man Thaythoon, ‘What do you say about the Messiah (`Eesaa)?’ He said, ‘What the people of your way said about the Qur&#8217;aan.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> That story is mentioned in a footnote from Siyar A`laamin-Nubalaa· by Imaam ath-Thahabee</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Al-Laalikaa·ee reports in his book, Usool I`tiqaad Ahlis-Sunnah, from Aboo Uways who said, “I heard my maternal uncle, Maalik ibn Anas, and a group of the scholars mention the Qur&#8217;aan and they said, ‘<em>It is the Speech of Allaah, and it is from Him and there is nothing from Him which is created.</em>’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[05] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> There is a hadeeth which directly states it reported by Aboo Daawood as hadeeth 4603 declared hasan saheeh, good authentic, by Shaykh al-Albaanee from Aboo Hurayrah, from the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, that he said: “<em>Disputation about the Qur&#8217;aan is disbelief</em>.”</p>

<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And no one says regarding the Attributes of the Lord, the Most High, “How?” and “Why?” except for one who doubts about Allaah, the Exalted and Most High.</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The kayfiyya (how) is not to be asked about. And the reason why He said such and such, is not to be asked about. Rather one should submit to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, because no one knows the how except for Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee hafizahullaah said regarding this point, “No one will say, ‘Why (is that)?’ with regard to Allaah’s Attributes except one who doubts about the Attributes of Allaah, the Most High. A person who is always afflicted with ‘Why (is this)?’ and ‘How (is that)?’ and this saying comes out upon the slips of his tongue, this person is in danger. Indeed he is at the limit of danger. And for this reason the Companions, when revelation came down to them, they believed in it with certainty and they attested to it. And they did not ask ‘Why is this?’ and ‘How (is that)?’ Rather they submitted to everything which Allaah informed of open heartedly and accepting it fully. So therefore they did not ask ‘Why?’ and ‘How?’”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 14 : Point 11 (Part B)</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And know, may Allaah have mercy upon you, that speculative speech, kalaam, about the Lord, the Most High, is a newly introduced matter and it is an innovation and misguidance. Nothing is to be said about the Lord except what He, the Mighty and Majestic, described Himself with in the Qur·aan and what the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam explained to his Companions. So He, the Majestic in Renown, is One.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">There is nothing like Him; and He is The All Hearing The All Seeing.</span> (Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Our Lord is the First without any beginning, and the Last without any end. He knows whatever is secret and whatever is most hidden. He has ascended over His Throne, and His Knowledge is in every place. And no place is free of His Knowledge.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>[In this <strong>Part B</strong> audio, the last paragraph in the above point is covered. You can Listen to <a style="color:#808080;" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/12/02/speculative-speech-kalaam-about-allaah-is-an-innovation-and-misguidance/"><strong>Point 11 (Part A)</strong></a>]</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/our-lord-is-the-first-without-any-beginning-and-the-last-without-any-end" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Our Lord is The First, without any ‘when’. And He is The Last, without any end.”</strong> Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, is The First without any beginning and The Last without any end. He, the Most High, said</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He (Allaah) is The First and The Last and The Uppermost and The One who is Closest</strong></span> (Sooratul-Hadeed (57), aayah 3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are names which are opposites. ‘The First’ (Al-Owwal) is opposite to ‘The Last’ (Al-Aakhir). ‘The Uppermost’ (Az-Zaahir) is opposite to ‘The Closest’ (AlBaatin). And the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam explained this aayah in his saying: You are The First, and there is nothing before You. And You are The Last, so there is nothing after You. And You are The Uppermost One, so there is nothing above You. And You are The Closest One, so there is nothing closer than You. [01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the explanation of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. But then there came those people who explained it with other than the explanation of the Messenger (sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) who say, “Az-Zaahir means ‘one who became apparent to the intellects’ and ‘who became apparent through clear proofs’, and it does not mean that He is above the created beings or that He is above the Throne!” So this is false and futile, contrary to the explanation of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. The one from the people who knows best about Allaah is Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. And he has explained this aayah with a clear explanation, that ‘The First One’ means the One whom there is nothing before Him: “The First with no beginning.” And ‘The Last one’ He is the One whom there is nothing after Him: “The Last with no end.” And “The Uppermost” is the One whom there is nothing above Him. He is above all created beings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He is The Invincible Subduer above His servants. And He is The All Wise, The All Aware.</strong></span> (Sooratul-An`aam (6), aayah 18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And (Allaah) He is the Invincible Subduer above His servants. And He sends down guardians over you. (Sooratul-An`aam (6), aayah 61)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He has exaltedness (being above and exalted) with regard to His Self (Thaat). And He has exaltedness of Status (Qadr). And He has exaltedness in Supremacy (Qahr). <strong>“And You are The One who is Closest so there is nothing closer than you&#8230;”</strong> meaning that He knows everything. Nothing at all is hidden from Him. So He, along with the fact that He is above His created beings, then along with this, nothing is hidden from Him, from the innermost secrets and what their chests conceal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Nothing whatever is hidden from Allaah, in the earth nor in the heavens</strong> </span>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), aayah 5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then people come who say, “Allaah the Majestic and Most High is not above and He is not beneath, and He is not to the right and He is not to the left, and He is not inside the Universe and He is not outside the Universe.” The meaning of this would be that He does not exist as occurs in the books of the people of kalaam (people of theological rhetoric).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“He knows what is secret and what is most hidden. And He is ascended upon His Throne.”</strong> So His knowing whatever is upon the earth and whatever is beneath the earth and whatever is under the soil, this does not contradict His being above His Throne. Because Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, encompasses everything and nothing encompasses Him, He the Perfect and Most High. And the whole of the creation in comparison to Him is just tiny, like nothing at all. And He is Al-`Azeem, The Tremendously Great One; Al-Kabeer, The Incomparably Great One; Al-Muta`aal, The Supreme and Exalted One; Al-Jaleel, The Majestic and Supreme &#8211; He the Perfect and Most High. So we do not make analogy between Him and ourselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They have not given Allaah the respect and honour which is due to Him, and the whole earth will be grasped by Him on the Day of Resurrection, and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand. Perfect and Exalted is He and far removed from that which they associate with Him</strong></span>. (Sooratuz-Zumar (39), aayah 67)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All the created things are, in relation to Him, like nothing. Even if they are very great in the eyes of the people, but with respect to Him they are like nothing. (They are nothing) before His Tremendousness, He the Perfect and Most High. People, they do not give the honour and respect to Allaah that is His due when they deny His Ability and His Greatness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O mankind, a similitude has been struck for you so listen to it. Those whom you call upon besides Allaah could never create even a fly, even if they gathered together to do it. And if the fly were to take something from them (those idols) they cannot rescue it from it. Weak is the seeker and the one sought.2 They do not give Allaah His due honour and respect.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Hajj (22), aayahs 73-74)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They do not recognise the Tremendousness of Allaah and His Ability and His Supremeness and His Knowledge. So therefore they draw analogy between Him and themselves. Therefore they belittle Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. If you people, all of you together, from the first of you to the last of you, all the jinn and all mankind, were to gather together to create a fly, the smallest thing, they would not be able to do so. Particularly whom they call upon besides Allaah, from those objects of worship and those false lords.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They could never create a fly even if they all gathered together to do it. If the most proficient doctors gathered, and the cleverest people in the world and the craftsmen and the inventors, and you were to say to them, “Produce a fly for us,” they would not be able to do it &#8211; even though they are able to build huge ocean liners which contain airstrips and carry aeroplanes, and they can build huge aeroplanes. They are able to build these things. As for creating a fly and putting life into it, then they are not able to do it. They can draw a picture of a fly and of a person and of wild animals and the like, but they are not able to make any such thing walk and talk. They can just draw it with its details only. As for breathing life into it, then this is from the command of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. So therefore how can analogy be made between the Creator, the Majestic and Most High, and the creation. He is not reached by the intellects and people’s thoughts, and He cannot be imagined by their thinking, He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“He knows whatever is secret and whatever is most hidden. And He is ascended over His throne.”</strong> His being ascended over His Throne does not contradict His knowing whatever is hidden and whatever is most secret. So it may not be said that because He has ascended over His throne He is therefore distant from the people and He does not hear and does not see therefore, for this is claiming tashbeeh, that there is likeness between the Lord and the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, all things are the same to Him. Nothing is hidden from Him, He the Perfect and Most High; something close or something far, the first of the creation and the last of them, this world or the Hereafter. All of it is within the Knowledge of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. And therefore this gigantic creation is caused to proceed by Him, He the Perfect, and by His Ability and His Will and His Creating.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah holds the heavens and the earth, so that they do not move away. And if they were to move away, then no one besides Him, could hold them. Indeed He is Forbearing and He forgives extensively</span> </strong>(Soorah Faatir(35), aayah 41)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The orbit of the stars, the Sun and the Moon in its precise calculated manner which does not alter and does not err and does not slip, who is the One who ordered it with this arrangement? He is Allaah the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Moon and the stars proceed in an orderly manner until Allaah wishes the end of this world and moving on to the Hereafter. The One who ordered it is All Wise and All Knowing, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if you were to reflect upon this creation, then you would realise the greatness of Allaah the Perfect and Most High. So when the people see a precise machine they marvel at this skill, and at its maker, but it is a small thing; then how about this whole creation which does not fail. Who causes it to persist and who preserves it? Who is the One who preserves this creation, all of it, so that it does not alter and does not fail and does not miss out on anything? He is Allaah, the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these created things, the small ones and the large ones, who brings provision to them? Huge created things, who is the One who produced provision for them, for each one in accordance with its own condition? He is Allaah, the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is obligatory is that we should submit to that which came from Allaah, because He knows best about Himself, and that we submit to what came from Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam because the Messenger is the one from the creation who knows best about his Lord, He the Perfect and Most High; and that we do not raise objections and we do not interfere with our intellects and our own thinking. So there is no contradiction between the fact that “He knows whatever is secret and whatever is most hidden” and “He is ascended over His throne.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His Saying,<strong> “And His knowledge is in every place. And no place is free of His knowledge.”</strong> His knowledge is in every place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Nothing whatever is hidden from Allaah, in the earth nor in the heavens.</strong> </span>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), aayah 5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (Allaah) knows whatever is in the land and in the sea. And no leaf falls except that He knows it. And there is no grain in the darkest depths of the earth, nor anything fresh, nor anything dry, except that it is written in a clear book. (Sooratul-An`aam (6), aayah 59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (Allaah) is the One who takes your souls by night. Meaning in sleep.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He knows whatever you do&#8230;<br />
Meaning ‘whatever (deeds) you earn’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8230;in the day. Then He raises you up in it.</strong></span> (Sooratul-An`aam (6), aayah 60)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning you get up from sleep. Who caused you to sleep in the first place? And who is it that causes you to wake up? He is Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. So if you were to think about this creation, then this would lead you to realize the Greatness of Allaah and you would submit to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic; if you were to reflect upon the speech of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and what he informed about with regard to events of the past and of the future, things which have occurred just as he informed sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. Who guided him to know that? It was Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. He is the One who revealed it to him. It was not from himself; rather it was just from Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. If you were to compare the ahaadeeth (sayings of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) to the events that have occurred, you would be amazed. The Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam mentioned to us about the lives of the Prophets and the previous nations (he mentioned) a great deal (of that), even though his time was much later. Who made him aware of this? It was Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. So this is indeed a proof that he is a Messenger from Allaah. This tremendous Qur·aan, it is not possible that it could have come from other than Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say, if the whole of mankind and jinn were to gather together to bring the like of this Qur·aan, they could not bring its like, even if they all tried to help each other.</strong> </span>(Sooratul-Israa· (17), aayah 88)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is from the speech of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. And the Messenger was just one who conveyed the Message from Allaah, the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And this Qur&#8217;aan has been sent by Revelation to me to warn you with it and to warn whomever it reaches.</strong></span> (Sooratul-An`aam (6), aayah 19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he was one who conveyed the Message from Allaah, the Majestic and Most High.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 13 : Point 11 (Part A)</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know, may Allaah have mercy upon you, that speculative speech, kalaam, about the Lord, the Most High, is a newly introduced matter and it is an innovation and misguidance. Nothing is to be said about the Lord except what He, the Mighty and Majestic, described Himself with in the Qur·aan and what the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam explained to his Companions. So He, the Majestic in Renown, is One.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him; and He is The All Hearing The All Seeing.</span> </strong></span>(Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Our Lord is the First without any beginning, and the Last without any end. He knows whatever is secret and whatever is most hidden. He has ascended over His Throne, and His Knowledge is in every place. And no place is free of His Knowledge.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F363826523&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/speculative-speech-kalaam-about-allaah-the-most-high-is-an-innovation-misguidance" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Kalaam, speech/rhetorical theology/theological rhetoric, with regard to the Lord, the Most High, is something new and it is an innovation and misguidance.”</strong> Meaning, theological rhetoric, kalaam, with regard to the Self of the Lord, the Perfect and Most High, and with regard to His Names and His Attributes, is a newly introduced affair. It was introduced by the people of misguidance, those who do not submit to the texts and who do not have fear of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. So therefore they speak about the Self of the Lord, and they speak about His Names and His Attributes, and they deny and they negate that which Allaah affirmed for Himself or that which His Messenger affirmed for Him. And they bring opinions from themselves. (And they say) “This is what is correct.” They speak in explanation of the texts with other than their correct explanation, or they say, “We don’t understand them.” They say, “We leave and entrust them to Allaah.” And the Speech of Allaah and the speech of His Messenger becomes just like foreign/non-Arabic speech which the Arabs do not understand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is obligatory upon the Muslims is that they continue upon the correct path, upon the way of the Salaf and that they do not give any attention to those people who mislead others, those who argue about Allaah without any proof which He has given them. They dispute about the Qur·aan and they dispute about the Sunnah. Their affair is just argumentation. So it is obligatory to beware of those people. Those people are not people who are followers (of the Truth); rather they are innovators who are just following their desires. [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And nothing is to be said about the Lord except that which He described Himself with, He the Mighty and Majestic, in the Qur&#8217;aan.”</strong> Having forbidden argumentation about Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and arguments/debates about the Names of Allaah and His Attributes, he now explains what is obligatory. And it is that we affirm the Qur·aan and the Sunnah just as they came upon their meaning, the meaning taken from the Arabic language with which the Qur·aan and the Sunnah came down. So al `ilm, knowledge, its meaning is well known in the language. Likewise al-wajh, the face, is well known. And al-`ayn, eyes, and al-yad, hands, and al-istiwaa·, ascending, and al-`uloow, being high above, all of these and their like, their meaning is well known in the Arabic language in which the Qur·aan came down. Whereas the people of misguidance, they say “This speech is not in accordance with what is apparent from it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then they divide into two categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• A category who say, “We stop and withhold. And we say what is apparent is not what is meant; but then we do not understand what is actually meant by it.” And they are the <strong>Mufowwidah</strong> the people of <strong>tafweed</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• And the second category are the <strong>Mu&#8217;owwillah</strong>, the people of <strong>ta&#8217;weel</strong>, who give false interpretations. And they are more in number; they are the majority out of these two groups. They interpret with other than their correct meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they went astray and they lead others astray and they preoccupy the people. And they fill up books with these debates, with arguments and disputations which lead to nothing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is obligatory is to submit to what occurs in the Book and in the Sunnah with regard to the Names of Allaah and His Attributes as was meant by Allaah and His Messenger, because Allaah knows best about Himself, He the Perfect and Most High, and He knows best about other than Himself. And the most knowledgeable one from the creation about Allaah is the Messenger of Allaah sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. As for us, then our knowledge falls short. There are many things that we do not know related to our own selves with regard to the details of our bodies and the veins and the senses. There are things which we do not know. Do you know the rooh, about the soul? What exactly is it? The intellect, what is it? If you do not know something from your own body, nor something about your own self, then how can you speak about the Self of Allaah the Perfect and Most High, which is not known, except to Him, He, the Perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He (Allaah) knows whatever is in front of them and whatever is behind them and they do not encompass Him with knowledge</strong></span> (Soorah TaaHaa (20), aayah 110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is outside what they know and outside what they can imagine. And no analogy can be made between Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, and His creation. This would be a belittlement of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. So He knows best about His Self and about other than Himself. And He is the One who is truest in saying and better in speech than His creation, as Shaykhul-Islaam rahimahullaah said in al-Waasitiyyah [03].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and what Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam explained to his Companions.”</strong> The issue of the Names and Attributes hinges upon the Book and the Sunnah. And their explanation is also in the Book and the Sunnah, and the language of the Arabs in which the Legislation came down. And we do not go to the logic of Aristotle and Plato, or so and so, or such and such. This is a crime against the Legislation of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, and it is a case of replacing the Revelation with logic and `ilmul-kalaam, theological rhetoric. And what fruit did theological rhetoric and argumentation produce for those people with regard to misguidance and ruin and loss. And they did not reach any result. And this is by their own admission.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They expended their whole lives in debating and disputations, and in the end they acknowledged that they did not reached any result. And if only they had submitted to Allaah and to His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, they would have found relaxation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore one of them said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;"><em>“The result of using the intellects is just that the mind is tied in knots</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#800080;"><em> And most of the striving of the people is just misguidance</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#800080;"><em> And our spirits are forlorn strangers within our bodies</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#800080;"><em> And all the results that come about in this world for us are just harm and an evil climate</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we did not benefit from our studies through our whole lives except that we just gathered they said and such and such said (idle speech).” [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they came to a state of doubt and uncertainty. And as for those who submitted to Allaah and to His Messenger, then they were saved and at peace from this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the people of misguidance say also:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;"><em>“Upon my life, I have gone around all of the institutions of learning</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#800080;"><em> And I have looked upon all those places</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#800080;"><em> And I did not see except one who is putting his palm</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#800080;"><em> upon his chin in confusion or one who is striking his teeth in regret.”</em></span> [05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He went around all the institutes of learning, institutes of theological rhetoric and logic and debating and he examined them and did not find in them that which could remedy the need to know. And he said [06]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I have carefully considered the different paths of theological rhetoric and the ways of the philosophers. And I did not see them remedying the sick [07] nor quenching the thirst of the person with extreme thirst. And I saw that the closest path was the way of the Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Read with regard to affirmation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The good word ascends to Him.</strong></span> (Soorah Faatir (35), aayah 10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The Most Merciful ascended upon the Throne.</span></strong> (Soorah TaaHaa (20), aayah 5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And read with regard to negation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him</span></strong> (Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they do not encompass Him with knowledge</span></strong>. (Soorah Taahaa (20), aayah 110) ”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(End of quote)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“So He, the Majestic in Renown, is One. There is nothing like Him; and He is The All Hearing, The All Seeing.”</strong></span> He is, He the Perfect, One. No one shares with Him with regard to His Self nor with regard to His Names and His Attributes nor with regard to His Creating and His Actions nor with regard to His worship. There is no sharer and no partner for Him. So why therefore tire yourself out? You are a created being and He is the Creator. How can the created being encompass knowledge of the Creator, the Majestic and Most High? So you, your role is just to submit to Allaah and to His Messenger and not to dispute and not to argue and not to tire yourself out and to tire other people out. This is what is obligatory and binding. And therefore the Companions, they did not engage themselves in these unnecessary matters. And they did not withhold with regard to an aayah or with regard to a hadeeth. Rather they affirmed it and submitted to it and held what it contained as their creed and belief, and they never had any problems arise, ever. So the matter is a matter requiring submission and compliance. And that we do not delve into matters of creed and belief in the way which the people of disputation and the people of kalaam, theological rhetoric, and people of logic delved into it. Such that the result was, as they themselves admitted regarding themselves, that they ended up in a state of bewilderment and confusion and not reaching any result, as one of them said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“We didn’t benefit anything from our studies, throughout our whole lives Except in the end we just gathered idle speech.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Meaning), so and so said and so and so said. And if he says such and such then the response is such and such. [08]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee hafizahullaah said regarding this point, “Meaning by that, speech which was introduced by the Jahmiyyah with regard to delving into speaking about Attributes of Allaah without knowledge. But as for describing (giving as an Attribute) that which Allaah described Himself with or which His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam described Him with, then this is something required.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] This occurs in al-`Aqeedah Al-Waasitiyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] These lines of poetry are by al-Fakhrur-Raazee. You can refer back to Dar· Ta`aarud al-Aql wan-Naql and Minhaajus-Sunnah (of Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymeeyah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[05] These lines of poetry are by ash-Shahristaanee, the author of the book al-Milal wan-Nahl. You can refer back to Dar· Ta`aarud al-Aql wan-Naql and Minhaajus-Sunnah (of Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymeeyah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[06] This is a quote from ar-Raazee quoted from him in the book an-Nuboowaat of Shaykhul-Islaam (ibn Taymeeyah)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[07] <strong>Translator’s note:</strong> curing the one who has a need for knowledge</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[08] Shaykh as-Suhaymee hafizahullaah said, “Then he made clear that it is obligatory to describe Allaah with that which He described Himself with, and that which His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam described Him with, without tahreef, distorting the meaning, without ta`teel, denying/depriving it of meaning, without takyeef, saying how, and without tamtheel, likening the Creator to the creation, in accordance with His Saying, He, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There is nothing like Him (Allaah); and He is The All Hearing, The All Seeing</strong> </span>(Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, “There is nothing like Him;” this is negation. And, “and He is The All Hearing, The All Seeing;” this is affirmation. And it contains a proof for detailed affirmation and for general and concise negation. Because His Saying, “There is nothing like Him,” this is a general and concise and negation. It negates everything that can be imagined or can cross the mind. And “and He is The Hearing, The Seeing,” this is affirmation in detail. And this aayah is a tremendous principle with regard to affirming the Attributes along with declaring Allaah, the Exalted and Most High, free of whatever does not befit Him.</p>

Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;"><span class="fontstyle0">4.  ولا شيء يعجزه‏<br />
And nothing renders Him incapable;</span> </span></strong></p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F357043148&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/allaah-is-al-qadir-nothing-renders-him-incapable" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an affirmation of the perfection of His Power and Ability. Allaah the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He (Allaah) has full power over everything</strong></span><br />
(Sooratul-Maa.idah (5), <em>aayah </em>120)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And Allaah was and is fully capable of everything</span></strong><br />
(Sooratul-Kahf (18), <em>aayah </em>45)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He (Allaah) always was and is All-Knowing, All-Powerful</strong></span><br />
(Soorah Faa<u>t</u>ir (35), <em>aayah </em>44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And القَدِير (<em>Al-Qadeer</em>) means: the One who is extremely powerful. So His Power, He the Perfect and Most High, is such that there is nothing that can cause Him to be unable. Whenever He wants something He just says to it, “<strong>Be</strong>” and it is.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this contains affirmation of the <em>qudrah</em> (قدرة &#8211; power and ability) of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and it contains affirmation that His Power includes and covers everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the term that some authors use (about Allaah):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah has full power over whatever he wants,” this wording is an error because Allaah did not restrict His Power to His Will. Rather, He said (about Himself),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>(Allaah) has full Power over everything</strong>.” So therefore you should say that which Allaah the Perfect and Most High said about Himself. This (a similar statement) only occurs in the saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He (Allaah) has full Power to gather them (the people) together when He Wishes</strong></span> (Sooratu<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>Sh</u>ooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because, the gathering of the creation has a certain time in the future and He is fully able to gather them at that time, meaning, the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And from His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and whatever creatures He has created and spread within them. And He (Allaah) has full Power to gather them together when He Wishes.</strong></span> (Sooratu<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>Sh</u>ooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [4][1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[1] Translator’s side point:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And there is nothing which causes Allaah to be incapable”</strong>: This is a denial but what is meant by it is not a mere denial because denial on its own is not from the belief of the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah</em>; rather, it is the position of the innovators.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the people of the Sunnah then their way is the way of the Qur.aan which gives a general denial of certain things for Allaah and gives a detailed affirmation of Attributes for Him. And whenever there is a denial then the denial is there to affirm something which is its perfect opposite. So this denial is there because of affirmation of its perfect opposite i.e. nothing renders Him incapable because of the perfection of His Power and Ability.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further side point: In his explanation, Ibn Abil-`Izz said regarding <em>ta<u>sh</u>beeh</em>: Affirming attributes for Allaah when the creation have the like of those attributes, for example, affirming that Allaah is the All-Knowing when we affirm that the creation has knowledge and affirming that Allaah has Sight when the creation has sight and affirming that Allaah has a Hand when the creation has hands. This fact is what leads the <em>mu`a<u>tt</u>ilah</em> into denying certain attributes because they say that if you affirm for Allaah a Hand then you are declaring Him like the creation and if we affirm for Allaah a Face then amongst the creation we have faces, so if we affirm a Face for Allaah then we will be making Him like the creation. So therefore they deny any Hand for Allaah and deny any Face for Allaah and so on with other attributes as well. They say that in that way they will stay clear of making the Creator like the creation.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The one who knows of Allaah knows other than Him, and the one who is ignorant of Allaah is therefore by all means ignorant of every other thing.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَلَا تَكُونُوا كَالَّذِينَ نَسُوا اللَّـهَ فَأَنسَاهُمْ أَنفُسَهُمْ ۚ أُولَـٰئِكَ هُمُ الْفَاسِقُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">‘And be not like those who forgot Allaah, so He made them forget themselves. Those are the defiantly disobedient.’</span> {Suraah Anfaal 8: 47}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And don’t be like those who forgot Allaah- because of their disobedience, so He let them forget their own selves- for they were not able to do righteous deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you contemplate this aaayah, you will find a noble and honourable meaning and a great one implicated in this verse that anyone who forgets Allaah, Allaah will make him forget his own self, and therefore will not realise his reality nor would he realise that which benefits or harms him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he will be crippled like cattle, even cattle could be more knowledgeable of its benefits in this sense. What is meant is that<strong> the knowledge of Allaah is the basis and foundation of every other knowledge and it is the basis of the slave of Allaah to know of his happiness, and to perfect his affairs and to work for his other life</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore he would properly estimate Allaah, the proper estimation He deserves. And it will lead him to be shy of Allaah, out of love and magnification- his heart being attached to Him, yearning to meet Allaah and be close to Him, turning His affairs to Him and having awe and fear of Him. And mankind, with this respect, differ in such an estimation of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet  said in invocation to Allaah,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8230;لا أحصي ثناء عليك أنت كما أثنيت على نفسك</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[صحيح مسلم و غيره]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">‘I cannot enumerate praising You, as You (o Allaah) are as You have praised Yourself’</span> [Muslim and others]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet  indicating those most knowledgeable of Allaah, even invoke Allaah with this saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;لا أحصي ثناء عليك أنت كما أثنيت على نفسك</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">‘I cannot enumerate praising You, as You are as You have praised Yourself (O Allaah)’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Love and eagerness</strong> are matters that follow the knowledge of Allaah, so the knowledge of Allaah brings forth and leads to love of Him and yearning to meet Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefor the knowledge of Allaah, is the most great and honorable knowledge and this leads to the proper estimation of Allaah, loving Him and eagerness to meet Him. The more a person is knowledgeable of Allaah, the more perfection he is in his love of Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ad therefore ‘<strong>whoever believes in Allaah and His names and attributes</strong>’ and knows of Him in this respect will love Him more, and then he would achieve a state of sweetness in his heart, and this sweetness puts him in a state whereby he will always love to meet Allaah and be close to Him, and to sense and look at His Face, and listen to Him and to His words.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The knowledge itself leads to the proper estimation of Allaah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Maalik ibn Dinaar rahimahullaah said ‘<span style="color:#993300;">the people of this life they left it and didn’t take the best of it</span>,’ they said to him, ‘and what is it o Abaa Yahya?’ He said, ‘knowing  of Allaah The Most Mighty and Majestic.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who know of Allaah are the ones who have really tasted what is best in this life, and that is the knowledge of Allaah in this life as Maalik bin Dinaar stated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَمَا قَدَرُوا اللَّـهَ حَقَّ قَدْرِهِ إِذْ قَالُوا مَا أَنزَلَ اللَّـهُ عَلَىٰ بَشَرٍ مِّن شَيْءٍ ۗ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">‘And they did not appraise Allaah with true appraisal when they said, &#8220;Allaah did not reveal to a human being anything.&#8221;’</span> {Suraah Al-An’aam 6: 91}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘They (kuffar) did not estimate Allaah with the estimation due to Him’ when they said that Allaah sent nothing down to the human being- so what is meant by saying what is due to Him is what is meant by the proper estimation of Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>When the knowledge of Allaah is strengthened then his eagerness for Allaah also strengthens.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullah ibn Masoud radhi Allaahu anhu said, ‘the believer will not feel at rest without the meeting of his Lord Allaah, therefore anyone who sets his resting coat in this life in the meeting of Allaahسبحانه و تعلى, then it is as if He has reached that.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning the believer would not have any real rest without being keen about the matter of meeting Allaah, yearning so that he can reach Him. As Allaah سبحانه و تعلى says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَتَطْمَئِنُّ قُلُوبُهُم بِذِكْرِ اللَّـهِ ۗ أَلَا بِذِكْرِ اللَّـهِ تَطْمَئِنُّ الْقُلُوبُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Those who have believed and whose hearts are assured by the remembrance of Allaah. Unquestionably, by the remembrance of Allaah hearts are assured.&#8221;</span> {Suraah Ar-Ra’ad 13: 28}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what ibn Masoud was speaking about in his saying that there will be no real rest for the believer unless he meets Allaahسبحانه و تعلى; therefore this matter should be alive, as mentioned in the aayah in Suraatur Ra’ad, they will achieve that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah gave the prophets عليهم السلام the choice between increasing their stay on earth or death, and they would choose the meeting with Allaah the most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Imaam Bukhaari entitled the chapter in his saheeh &#8211; &#8220;the one who loves to meet Allaah, Allaah will love to meet Him&#8221;. Under this chapter he gave the situation with the prophet  from his wife,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">حدثنا بشر بن محمد حدثنا عبد الله قال يونس قال الزهري أخبرني سعيد بن المسيب في رجال من أهل العلم أن عائشة قالت كان النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم يقول وهو صحيح إنه لم يقبض نبي حتى يرى مقعده من الجنة ثم يخير فلما نزل به ورأسه على فخذي غشي عليه ثم أفاق فأشخص بصره إلى سقف البيت ثم قال اللهم الرفيق الأعلى فقلت إذا لا يختارنا وعرفت أنه الحديث الذي كان يحدثنا وهو صحيح قالت فكانت آخر كلمة تكلم بها اللهم الرفيق الأعلى</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">موطأ مالك, صحيح البخاري, صحيح مسلم, مسند أحمد</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Aisha (رضي الله عنها) who said, ‘Rasoolullah صلى الله عليه وسلم used to say, ‘no prophets soul will be taken by Allaah until he sees his seat in Paradise then he will be given the choice’ so when he صلى الله عليه وسلم  became ill and the moment of death approached and his head was on my thigh, when he صلى الله عليه وسلم used to go into the state of unconsciousness and woke up, finally I saw him gaze in the direction of the roof and said ‘O Allaah, the Highest companionship.’ Aisha said, ‘so I knew he didn’t choose us, and I remember the statement he  صلى الله عليه وسلم used to say to us and it is true. And the last words he spoke was ‘Allaahumma rafeequl a’laa.’ (O Allaah, the Highest companionship)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Muwatta of Maalik, Bukhaari, Muslim and Ahmed (with slight difference in wording)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how is it that these rough hearts and stone hearts are able to accuse other Muslims when they speak about knowing Allaah’s names and attributes and defending them in the proper way, as Allaah intended and as Allaah affirmed for Himself, and by the prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم .</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">[121]  And we say that Allaah took Ibraaheem as an especially beloved one (<em><u>Kh</u>aleel</em>) and that Allaah spoke directly to Moosaa, saying that with <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) and testifying to the truth and with full submission.</span></p>

<p><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/allaah-took-ibraaheem-as-khaleel-and-that-allaah-spoke-directly-to-moosaa-dawud-burbank" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>]</strong><br />
—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [121]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) of the Muslims, is that the Messengers (<em>Rusul</em>) are the most excellent of the creation and that the Messengers (<em>Rusul</em>) vary in levels of excellence. So they hold as their creed and belief, that Allaah took Ibraaheem as a <em><u>Kh</u>aleel</em> (an especially beloved one) just as Allaah, the Most High, said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;..and Allaah took Ibraaheem as a <u>Kh</u>aleel (an especially beloved)&#8221; </span> (Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), <em>aayah </em>125)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this word <em>‘al-<u>kh</u>ullah’</em> (الخلة), it means: the highest of the levels of love. So Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, has love for His believing servants and for the <em>muttaqeen</em> ( المتقين &#8211; the people of <em>taqwaa</em> – those are dutiful to Him) and He has love for the <em>mu<u>h</u>sineen</em> (المحسنين &#8211; the doers of good) and He loves those who frequently repent (التوابين &#8211; <em>at-tawwaabeen</em>) and He loves <em>al-mutta<u>t</u>ahhireen</em> (المتطهرين – those people who purify themselves). However, <em>al-<u>kh</u>ullah</em> is a special degree which has not been attained except by two of the creation: Ibraaheem and Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em>`alayhima<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>. Just as he <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Allaah took me as an especially beloved one (<u>Kh</u>aleel) just as He took Ibraaheem as an especially beloved one (<u>Kh</u>aleel).”</span> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And Allaah spoke directly to Moosaa&#8221; </span> (Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), <em>aayah </em>164)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, He (Allaah) gave excellence to some of the Prophets over others, even though all of them were upon a very high level. However, Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, gave excellence to some over others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Those are the Messengers; We gave excellence to some of them over others. From them are those to whom Allaah spoke directly and He raised some in degrees of excellence.&#8221;</span> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>253)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, every Prophet was given by Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, a degree of excellence particular to him. So he gave to Ibraaheem and Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em>`alayhima<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam, al-<u>kh</u>ullah</em> (that He made them His specially beloved). And He gave to Moosaa the excellence that He spoke to him directly, without an angel in-between. And Moosaa heard His Speech; so He the Perfect called to him (ناداه &#8211; <em>naadaahu</em>) and spoke privately to him (ناجاه &#8211; <em>naajaahu</em>). And the term <em>‘al-munaadaat’</em> (المنادات) means ‘a raised voice’ and <em>‘al-munaajaat’</em> (المناجات) is ‘speaking with a low voice’. Both of these occurred for Moosaa <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> and this was a virtue not attained by anyone besides him. And He said at the end of the <em>aayah, “takleemaa</em> (تكليما – with Speech)” for emphasis so that no one could say that this was something metaphorical. So when He has emphasized it with this verbal noun, this proves that it is true and real Speech from Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. So this contains affirmation of <em>al-Kalaam</em> (الكلام – Speech) for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. And it contains affirmation of the virtue of Moosaa <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> over other Prophets with regard to this characteristic. <strong>And the fact that a Prophet had a particular quality special to him does not necessitate that he is better than the others unrestrictedly. Rather, it means that he was more excellent than other Prophets with regard to this particular quality.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [15]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is from the amazing affairs of His ability, that He causes the creation to die and causes them to pass away so that they are destroyed and become dust and remains – such that an ignorant person would say, ‘It is not possible for these to be restored’. However Allaah the Mighty and Majestic will resurrect them again, and He will restore their creation anew. And He will have no difficulty in doing this, as He the Perfect and Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">The creation of you all, and the resurrection of you all is just like that of a single soul.</span></em> (Soorah Luqmaan (31), <em>aayah </em>28)[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And He (Allaah) it is One who creates initially, and then He repeats it (the creation); and that is even easier for Him.  And for Him is the Highest Description in the heavens and in the earth.  And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.</span></em> (Sooratur-Room (30), <em>aayah </em>27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the people of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>, they denied the resurrection, holding it to be something far-fetched, just as Allaah said about them, (that the unbelieving man would say)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;Who will give life to these bones when they are crumbled away?&#8221;</em></span> (Soorah YaaSeen (36), <em>aayah </em>78)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah the Perfect and Most High, said in response,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em><span style="color:#008000;">Say: “He will give life to them Who created them for the first time!”</span> </em> </strong>(Soorah YaaSeen (36), <em>aayah </em>79)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first time they did not exist at all, so He brought them into existance from nothing, He the Perfect and Most High. So, the One who created them from non-existence, is He not able even more so to bring them back into existence? This is correct in accordance with the people’s intellect but otherwise, analogy cannot be made between Allaah, the Perfect, and His creation.  So this is just stated as a similitude,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And for Him is the Highest Description</span></em> (Sooratur-Room (30), <em>aayah </em>27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this a refutation of the denier, Allaah the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And he forgets his (own) creation</span></em> (Soorah YaaSeen (36), <em>aayah </em>78)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: he forgets that in the beginning he was nothing; he did not exist at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Has there come upon man a time when he was nothing mentioned? </span></em>(Sooratul-Insaan (76), <em>aayah </em>1)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: this man, he forgets that Allaah produced him from non-existence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah will indeed gather together these separated bones, shredded flesh, disintigrated dust and these scattered hairs, and He will restore them as they once were:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And from His (Allaah’s) Signs is that the heaven and the earth are established by His Command.  Then, when He calls you with a single call, you will come out from the earth.</em></span> (Sooratur-Room (30), <em>aayah </em>25)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And then the Horn will be blown, and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is upon the earth will faint and die, except whomever Allaah wishes.  And then it will be blown again and they will be standing up, looking on.</span></em> (Sooratuz-Zumar (39), <em>aayah </em>68)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second blowing is the blowing for the resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the first blowing of the horn, it is the blowing for the people to faint and die.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And the Horn will be blown and then the people will come out from their graves going quickly to their Lord.  They (the unbeliever) will say: &#8220;Woe to us! Who has taken us out from our place of sleep?&#8221; (The believer will respond) &#8220;This is what the Most Merciful promised, and the Messengers spoke the truth!&#8221; </span></em>(Soorah YaaSeen (36), <em>aayaat </em>51-52)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah indeed has Power and Ability over everything and this contains a refutation of the unbelievers, those who say that Allaah is unable to give life to the dead and to return them to life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Does man think that We will not gather his bones together? Indeed, We are fully able even to put his fingertips together. </span></em>(Sooratul-Qiyaamah (75), <em>aayaat </em>3-4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">On that Day (the Day of Resurrection) they will come out from the graves, hurrying as if they are racing to a finishing post. </span></em>(Sooratul-Ma`aarij (70), <em>aayah </em>43)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the Power of Allaah, and His Will and His Wish.  Nothing makes Him incapable.  However, it is just that some of the creation, they draw analogy between Allaah and His creation and so therefore they hold that it is far-fetched that there will be any resurrection; because the person thinks in his view, that’s something impossible and he doesn’t look to the Power of Allaah and he doesn’t judge Allaah’s Power as He deserves; and this is a case of ignorance with regard to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>[10]    And He (Allaah) does not resemble the creation. </strong></span></p>

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [10]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is like the wording which has already preceded: <strong>“<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/05/06/there-is-nothing-like-him-allaah/">And there is nothing like Him</a>.”[1]</strong> And the meaning of <em>al-anaam </em>(الأنام) is ‘the creation’.  So Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, is free of any resemblance to the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/05/17/there-is-nothing-like-unto-him-and-he-is-the-all-hearing-the-all-seeing/"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>There is nothing like Him and He is the All-Hearing the All-Seeing</em></span></a>.</strong> (Sooratu<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>Sh</u>ooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And there is no equal for Him</strong>.</span></em> (Sooratul-I<u>kh</u>laa<u>s</u> (112), <em>aayah </em>4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He, the Perfect, is free from resembling His creation.  And even though He has Names and Attributes which correspond to names and attributes of the creation in their wording and in their meaning, however, in their reality and in how they are, there is no resemblance between the two.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Translator’s side point: Ibn Abil-`Izz <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, in his explanation, said on this point:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Nu`aym ibn <u>H</u>ammaad</strong> said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">“Whoever declares that Allaah is like anything from his creation then he has committed unbelief, and whoever denies anything from that which Allaah has described Himself with, then he has committed unbelief, and there is not in the attributes which Allaah has mentioned for Himself nor in the attributes which His Messenger mentioned for Him, any resemblance.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, <strong>Is<u>h</u>aaq ibn Raahawayh</strong> said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">“Whoever describes Allaah and declares that His Attributes are like the attributes of anyone from Allaah’s creation then he is a <strong><em>kaafir</em> </strong>(disbeliever) in Allaah, the Tremendous One.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">“The sign of Jahm and his companions is their claim against the people of the Sunnah and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em> and the lies which they had instigated, that they say, ‘The people of the Sunnah are <em>mu<u>sh</u>abbihah</em> (that they declare Allaah to be like His creation).’ But rather, it is just that they are <em>mu`a<u>tt</u>ilah</em> (deniers of the attributes).”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this was the saying of a great number of the imaams of the <em>Salaf – </em>the sign of the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> is that they call the people of the Sunnah <em>Mu<u>sh</u>abbihah.  </em>Because there are none from the deniers of the Names and Attributes, except that he calls the one who affirms them a <em>Mu<u>sh</u>abbih</em> (one who makes Allaah like the creation).  So whoever denies Allaah’s Names altogether, then they are from the extreme apostates – like the <em>Qaraami<u>t</u>ah</em> (القرامطة) and the philosophers.  And whoever says that it cannot be said about Allaah that He is has knowledge and (it cannot be said, they say, about Allaah) that He has power, claiming that whoever calls Allaah that is a <em>Mu<u>sh</u>abbih.  </em>They say His Names are just metaphorical, like the extreme <em>Jahmiyyah</em>.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">[27]  {There is nothing like unto Him and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.}</span> </strong><br />
(a<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>Sh</u>ooraa (42) <em>aayah</em> 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F323059041&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe><br />
—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [27]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a negation of <em>tashbeeh</em> &#8211; there being anything like Allaah, the One free of all imperfections. And the <em>kaaf</em> (in <u>ك</u>مثله) is to emphasize the negation, like (as occurs in a different <em>aayah</em>):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">وَكَفَىٰ بِاللَّهِ عَلِيمًا</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em><span style="color:#008000;">…and Allaah is Sufficient as a Knower. </span></em></strong> (Sooratun-Nisaa. (4), <em>aayah </em>70)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In origin (it would usually be said): وكفى الله عليماً but the (extra) <em>baa’</em> (in <u>ب</u>الله) is for emphasis.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And nothing whatsoever resembles Him – not the angels, and not the Prophets, and not the Messengers, and not the beloved servants of Allaah, nor any created being.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ البَصِيرُ</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em><span style="color:#008000;">…and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</span></em></strong> (Sooratu<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>Sh</u>ooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He called Himself <strong><em>As-Samee’</em> </strong>(the All-Hearing One) <strong><em>Al-Ba<u>s</u>eer</em></strong> (the All-Seeing One).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the beginning of the <em>aayah </em>[1] contains a refutation of the <strong><em>Mu<u>sh</u>abbihah</em> </strong>(those who liken Allaah to the Creation) and the end of it contains a refutation of the <strong><em>Mu`a<u>tt</u>ilah</em></strong> (those who deny Allaah’s Attributes). And it indicates that affirming His Names and Attributes does not necessitate resemblance to the created beings. So the hearing and seeing of the created beings does not resemble the Hearing and Seeing of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/how-a-common-person-from-the-people-of-tawheed-defeated-the-scholar-from-grave-worshippers" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/JJkuhC</a><br />
—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [24]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there is nothing than can possibly do without or be independent of Allaah – no angel, nor any heaven nor any earth, nor anyone from the <em>jinn</em> nor anyone from mankind, nor any inanimate object, whether mountains or oceans; everything is dependent upon Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>O mankind! You are the ones who are needy and dependent upon Allaah.  And Allaah, He is the One who is Independent – the One deserving of all praise.</em></span> (Sooratul-Faa<u>t</u>ir (35), <em>aayah </em>15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So everything is dependent upon Him and not upon the <em>awliyaa</em>.  (beloved servants of Allaah) and not upon the heavens.  And whoever says that the <em>awliyaa</em>.  (beloved servants of Allaah) have power and ability which is different to human power and ability, and whoever says that they have some control over the creation and that they benefit and harm, besides Allaah; then this is the saying of the unbelievers and the <em>mu<u>sh</u>riks</em>.  So the <em>awliyaa</em>.  (beloved servants of Allaah), and the Messengers and the angels, have no independence from Allaah and they cannot do anything without Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this nullifies the worship of everything besides Allaah, whether idols or other things.  How can you worship things that are themselves dependent (upon Allaah) and forget the One in whose Hand is the Ownership and the Mastery of everything?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And for this reason one of the scholars from the grave-worshippers, he said to a common person from the people of <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, “You people say that the <em>awliyaa</em>.  (beloved servants of Allaah), they can’t benefit and they can’t bring harm.” So he said, “Yes, we say that they don’t bring benefit and they don’t bring harm.” So he (the grave-worshipper) said, “Does not Allaah, the Most High, say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Do not consider those who are killed in Allaah’s cause as being dead.  Rather, they are alive, with their Lord, being given provision.”</span></em> (Soorah Aal-`Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>169)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So (this man who is only just a regular person) he responded to him and said, “Did Allaah say <strong><em>yurzaqoon</em> </strong>(يُرْزَقون – they are given provision) or did He say <strong><em>yarzuqoon</em> </strong>(يَرْزُقون – they give provision)?” So the man said, “Rather He said, <strong><em>yurzaqoon</em> </strong>(يُرْزَقون – they are given provision) with a <em><u>d</u>ammah</em> on the <em>yaa’</em>” So (the man who is a common person), he said, “In that case I will ask the One who Provides for them and I will not ask them.” So that person of knowledge was defeated in argument by the evidence of this common person who was upon the correct natural disposition.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong> ما زال بصفاته قديمًا قبل خلقه</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>[16]     He has always had His Attributes, before His act of creation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F322401664&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/allah-has-always-had-his-attributes-before-his-act-of-creation-sh-fawzan-dawud-burbank" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://goo.gl/GGu3zw</a><br />
—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [16]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The saying of the author, <strong>“<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/04/24/he-is-the-ancient-one-without-any-beginning-the-one-who-persists-without-any-ending/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ancient One without any beginning</a>”</strong>[1] has already preceded.  So, there was nothing before Him, He the Perfect and Most High.  And the meaning of that is that He has the Attributes of Perfection and His Attributes of Perfection are eternal; they have always existed and they always will.  So just as He is the First without any beginning, then likewise, His Attributes (are the same) since they are along with Him, He the One free of all imperfections.  So, they were always existing, just as Allaah the Perfect and Most High has always existed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not the case that He existed before without any Attributes and then Attributes came about for Him afterwards as the people of misguidance say; those who say, “He did not always have Attributes and then afterwards He came to have them.” They say so in order not to necessitate there being multiple lords deserving worship, as they claim, or multiple divinities in existence who are eternal, such that the Names and Attributes would be partners with Allaah in His Eternity.  So we say, “How free is Allaah of all deficiencies, <em>Sub<u>h</u>aanAllaah!</em>  This (saying) would necessitate that Allaah was deficient &#8211; High and Exalted is Allaah – that He was deficient for a period and then He came to have Attributes and so, became Perfect through those Attributes; High and Exalted is Allaah above what they say.  And the fact that His Attributes are eternal does not necessitate that there are other eternal lords.  Because the attributes are not something other than and outside the one who has those attributes.  Rather, they are meanings found in the one who has the attributes.  And an attribute is not something independent of the one who has the attribute. So if you say for example, “such and such person hears and he sees and he has knowledge of <em>fiqh</em> (he is a jurist) and he is a scholar of the language and he is a scholar of grammar” does it mean that this person has become many people? So having multiple attributes does not necessitate that the ones having the attributes are multiple as the people of misguidance have said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah, the One free of all imperfections and the Most High, His Attributes had no beginning just as His Self (<em><u>Dh</u>aat</em>) had no beginning.  So Allaah has the Attribute of being the Creator <em>(Al-<u>Kh</u>aaliq</em><em>)</em> always and forever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the actions of (Allaah) the Perfect, then they are eternal with regard to their type, newly occurring with regard to actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, He was ‘the One who speaks’ before He actually spoke and He was ‘the Creator’ before He actually created anything and as for His speaking and His creating, then these are actions which newly occur and so on, to the rest of the actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">[17] لم يزدد بكونهم شيئًا، لم يكن قبلهم من صفته.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">[17]  He (Allaah) was not increased in any Attribute which He did not have before, by the creation of the creation.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: His creating the creation.  We do not say that He did not become a Creator except after He created the people.  Rather, Allaah has been the Creator always, forever, without any beginning to that.  And as for His act of creating, then that is an action which occurs newly again and again.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [17] <strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">[18] وكما كان بصفاته أزليًا، كذلك لا يزال عليها أبديًا.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">[18] And just as He has always possessed His Attributes, then likewise, He will always possess them forever.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as He has always has His Attributes forever, meaning: there was no beginning to that; then likewise, His Attributes will remain with Him, He the Perfect, in the future.  So He is Eternal, along with His Attributes; He has no end.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">أنت الآخر فلا بعدك شيء</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“You are the Last One, so there is nothing after You.” </em></span>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">the Last One with Your Names and Attributes.  So it is not to be said that these attributes will cease to be with Him in the future; rather, they will always be with Him, He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [18] <strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">[19] ليس بعد خلق الخلق استفاد اسم ‏(‏الخالق‏)‏.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">[19]     He did not acquire the Name ‘The Creator’ after the creation of the creation.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a clarification and a repetition of what has preceded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> End of explanation of point [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[20] ولا بإحداث البرية استفاد اسم ‏(‏الباري‏)‏.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[20] Nor did He acquire the Name ‘<em>Al-Baaree’</em> (The Maker) after giving existence to the beings.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">So from the Names of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic is الباري (<em>Al-Baaree</em> – The Maker); meaning: The Creator.  برأ الخلق (<em>bara.a al-khalq</em>) means: He made them.  So, Allaah is <em>Al-Baaree</em> (The Maker of the creation).  And this Name goes along with Allaah’s Self &#8211; it has no beginning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [20]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[21] له معنى الربوبية ولا مربوب، ومعنى الخالق ولا مخلوق‏.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[21] He possessed the meaning of Lordship and Nurturing when there were no slaves, and He had the meaning of being the Creator without there being any creation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So likewise, He was the <em>Rabb</em> (Lord and Nurturer) before anything existed for Him to be the Owner and the Master of.  And the meaning of <em>Ar-Rabb</em> (The Lord and Nurturer) is: The Owner and the One who Controls and the One who Rectifies and the Master; and these Attributes are always with His Self – without any beginning and without any end, even before the existence of those things that He is the Lord and Master of, and even after those things which He is the Lord and Master of, pass away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[22] وكما أنه محيي الموتى بعدما أحيا، استحق هذا الاسم قبل إحيائهم، كذلك استحق اسم الخالق قبل إنشائهم‏.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[22] And just as He is the One who is ‘The Giver of life to the dead’ after He gives them life, then He deserves this Name even before He gave life to them; and likewise, He deserves the Name ‘The Creator’ before He created and produced them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So just as He, the Perfect has always possessed the Attribute of being the One who gives life to the dead, and that He gives life and gives death, and this Attribute was never absent (from Him) until He actually gave life to the dead. Rather, it was always His and it always will be His forever.  And as for the action of giving life to the dead, then this is something which occurs newly and repeatedly; Allaah gave life to some and He gives life to some, He the Perfect, whenever He Wishes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[23] ذلك بأنه على كل شيء قدير‏.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[23] That is because He has full Power and Ability over everything.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an eternal Attribute.  It cannot be said that He did not acquire the Attribute of Power and Ability until He created and produced the creation.  Rather, <em>Al-Qudrah</em> (Power and Ability) is an eternal Attribute of His.  Rather, His having produced the creation, this is an effect produced by His being the One who has full Power and Ability.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah is the One who described Himself as being the One who has full Power and Ability over everything – over the things that exist and over the things that do not exist.  And He did not restrict His Power to anything in particular.  Rather, nothing renders Him incapable and it is not permissible to restrict and say that He only has Power over such and such.  And it is not to be said, “Allaah has power over whatever He Wishes.”[3] Because, this saying is particular and restricted to gathering the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And from His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and all the creatures that He spread throughout them.  And He has full Power to gather them when He Wishes.</em></span> (Sooratu<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>Sh</u>ooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this was a particular case.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [23][4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Point [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Listen @ the Link : <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/04/24/he-is-the-ancient-one-without-any-beginning-the-one-who-persists-without-any-ending/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://wp.me/p1VJ3-bCO</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] From a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> in Saheeh Muslim where the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said, addressing Allaah in a <em>du`aa</em>., <strong><em>“You are the Last One, so there is nothing after You.”</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] This came previously under Point [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Translator’s side point: As a correction of this point, Shay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah, </em>then he criticised this saying here, the saying that you can’t say about Allaah that He has power over what He wishes. Sh al-Albaanee criticised that in his Silsilah &#8230; [break in recording] <strong>“&#8230; <em>Lord of the Creation.  So Allaah will reply, “I am not mocking you but rather I have full ability over whatever I Wish.”</em> ” </strong><em><u>H</u>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Muslim in the book of <em>Eemaan</em>. [187].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After he brought this <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>, Shay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee said: So the saying of Allaah the Most High, at the end of this <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>, <strong><em>“But rather I have full power over whatever I Wish,”</em></strong> this shows the mistake of the one who wrote notes to Al-`Aqeedah A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>a<u>ha</u>awiyyah quoting some noble person that, “some people say, ‘Allaah has full power over whatever He Wishes’ and that this saying is not correct.”  I (Shay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee )say: Rather, it is exactly what is correct after its being established in this <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>, especially when it is witnessed to by the saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And He (Allaah) has full Power to gather them when He Wishes.</em></span> (Sooratu<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>Sh</u>ooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this does not deny that His Wish and His Power and Ability, He the Most High, are general to everything as someone seems to have thought; and Allaah knows best.  [as-Saheehah 6/195, <em><u>H</u>adee<u>th</u> </em>#2601]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[118]    </strong><strong>وهُوَ مُسْتَغْنٍ عَنِ العرشِ وما دُونَه.‏‏‏‏</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[118]       And He (Allaah) has no need of the Throne and whatever is beneath it.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F322115253&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe><br />
—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [118]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not imagine that the meaning of His saying, He the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em><span style="color:#339966;"> And then He (Allaah) ascended upon the Throne</span> </em></span> (Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…is that He has need of the Throne just as someone from the creation would mount something from the creation. Rather, Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic ascended upon the Throne and He has no need of the Throne, nor of whatever is beneath the Throne.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of the created beings are in total need of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Allaah holds the heavens and the earth so that they do not fall away from their places; and if they moved away, then none besides Him could hold them. </em></span>(Soorah Faa<u>t</u>ir (35), <em>aayah </em>41)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, He (Allaah) holds and supports the Throne and He holds and supports the heavens and He holds and supports the earth and all the created beings by His Power and His Might. So, they are in need of Him and He has no need of them, He the One free of all imperfections and the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the fact that something is above something else does not necessitate that the thing which is higher has need of the thing which is beneath. So the heavens are above the earth, and they are not in need of the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>End of explanation of point [118][1] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[1] Translator’s Side Point:</strong> From <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, he said in his small notes,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The explainer (Ibn Abil-`Izz) <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaahu ta`aalaa</em> said, ‘The <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> (A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>a<u>h</u>aawee) <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah,</em> mentioned this speech here having already mentioned the `<em>Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne) and the <em>Kursee</em> (Footstool); so then afterwards he mentions that He, the Perfect, has no need of the Throne and whatever is beneath the Throne, to make clear that His creating the Throne to ascend over it is not because He had any need of it; rather, for a great wisdom which was necessitated. And the fact that something above is above the thing which is beneath, does not necessitate that the lower thing contains or encompasses or carries the higher thing; nor does it mean that that thing which is higher is in need of that which is lower. So look at the heaven how it is above the earth and yet it is not in need of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Lord, the Most High is far greater and more tremendous than His ‘Highness’ should necessitate this. Rather, Allaah’s being High (His ‘Highness’) results in qualities particular to Him and in His bearing and carrying whatever is beneath, by His Power. And it necessitates the total need of the lower things for Him and the fact that He, the Perfect, has no need whatsoever of what is beneath Him. And it necessitates His encompassing everything, He the Mighty and Majestic. So He is above the Throne and He, by His Power, supports the Throne and its carriers and He has no need of the Throne. And the Throne is in need of Him and He encompasses the Throne and the Throne does not encompass Him; and He confines the Throne and it does not confine Him; and all of these things are not possible for the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And those people who deny <em>al-`uluww</em> (Allaah’s Highness) – the people who deny His Attributes, if they only accepted this detailed explanation, then they would be guided to the correct path, and they would know that intellect is in accordance with the texts and they would be proceeding behind the proof. However, they depart from the proof so they go astray from the correct way. And the affair in that regard is just as Imaam Maalik <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said when he was asked about the saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And then He (Allaah) ascended over the Throne</span> </em>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…and other things, (someone asked him), “How did He ascend?’ So Imaam Maalik replied, “<em>Istiwaa</em> (ascending) is known and how is unknown.”’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s Side Point:</strong> Likewise, <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah in Dar· at-Ta`aaru<u>d</u> al-`Aql wan-Naql (درء تعارض العقل والنقل) makes the same point – that it is from Allaah’s tremendous Power that He supports the Throne and whoever is carrying the Throne, and they only support the Throne because of power given to them by Allaah.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[13]    He is the Creator without any need, Provider without any difficulty.</strong></span></p>

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [13]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is the One who created the creation and He has no need of them.  Rather, He created them just so that they should worship Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And I did not create jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me alone. </span></em>(Sooratu<u>dh</u>&#8211;<u>Dh</u>aariyaat (51), <em>aayah</em> 56)[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, He created them not because He had any need of them – that they should aid Him or assist Him or help Him, He the One free from all imperfections, or that they should defend Him.  He only created them so that they should worship Him.  And they (the people) are the ones who need that worship in order to connect themselves to Allaah and to attach themselves to their Lord.  So `<em>ibaadah</em> (worship) is the connection between the person and his Lord.  So it draws him closer to Allaah, and through it he attains reward from Allaah, and recompense.  So, `<em>ibaadah</em> (worship) is a need of the creation and it is not a need of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>If you (people) disbelieve (in Allaah), you and everybody upon the earth, then Allaah is the Independent One who has no need, the One deserving of all praise. </em></span>(Soorah Ibraaheem (14), <em>aayah </em>8)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">If you (people) disbelieve (in Allaah), then Allaah has no need of you. </span></em>(Sooratuz-Zumar (39), <em>aayah </em>7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his (the author’s) saying, <strong>“Allaah is the Provider without any difficulty”</strong>[2] meaning, He is the One who provides all the provision for His servants and that does not diminish what He has with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Footnotes</span>: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s side point: Ibn Abil-`Izz <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, quotes the next two <em>aayaat</em> which come after this one in Sooratu<u>dh</u>&#8211;<u>Dh</u>aariyaat, <em>aayaat</em> 57 and 58:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">I do not want from them any provision and I do not want that they should feed Me.  Indeed Allaah, He is the great Provider, the One possessing Power, the Strong.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Sooratu<u>dh</u>&#8211;<u>Dh</u>aariyaat (51), <em>aayaat</em> 57-58)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Side point: Ibn Abil-`Izz <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, quotes from the following <u>h</u>adee<u>th</u> qudsee:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“&#8230;O my servants, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you were to stand in one place and ask of Me, and I were to give every person what he asked for, then that would not diminish anything from what I have, except as a needle would diminish the water of the sea when it is placed in it.”</span></em></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[3]  And there is nothing like Him. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F321258104&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe><br />
—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [3]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is taken from the saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>There is nothing like Him (Allaah)</em></span> (Sooratu<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>Sh</u>ooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also, the saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And there is none equal or comparable to Him (Allaah) </em></span>(Sooratul-I<u>kh</u>laa<u>s</u> (112), <em>aayah </em>4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>So do not set up any rivals for Allaah</em></span> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: those who are alike or similar to Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Do you know of any namesake for Him (Allaah)?</span> </em>[1] (Soorah Maryam (19), <em>aayah </em>65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: anyone like Him – one who can share His Name, He the Perfect and Most High. So <em>at-tam<u>th</u>eel</em> (التمثيل &#8211; there being anyone like Him) and <em>at-ta<u>sh</u>beeh</em> (التشبيه &#8211; there being anyone resembling Him), both of these are negated for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, no one from His creation resembles Him. So this is what is obligatory – that we affirm whatever Allaah has affirmed for Himself and we hold that as our creed. However, we do not hold that He resembles anyone from His creation nor do we hold that He is like his creation, He, the Perfect and Most High. So this contains a refutation of the <em>mu<u>sh</u>abbihah</em> &#8211; who believe that Allaah is like His creation and (they) do not differentiate between the Creator and the creation; and this is a false and futile position.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And opposite to this position, is the position of the <em>mu`a<u>tt</u>ilah</em> (المعطلة &#8211; those who negate/deny Allaah’s attributes) – those who go beyond limits in declaring Allaah free to such an extent that they deny for Allaah that which He has affirmed for Himself with regards to Names and Attributes. Doing so, as they claim, to flee away from declaring Him to be like His creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, both of these two groups go beyond the limits. The <em>mu`a<u>tt</u>ilah</em> (those who deny His attributes) go beyond limits in <em>tanzeeh</em> (تنزيه &#8211; declaring Him free) and denying any likeness. Whereas, the <em>mu<u>sh</u>abbihah</em> (المشبهة &#8211; those who declare Allaah’s Attributes to be like those of the creation) go beyond the limit in affirmation. Whereas, the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah</em> take the moderate and middle position. So, they affirm for Allaah whatever He affirms for Himself in accordance with what befits His Majesty, without <em>ta<u>sh</u>beeh</em> (declaring His attributes to be like the attributes of the creation) and without <em>ta`<u>t</u>eel</em> (تعطيل &#8211; denying His attributes), doing so in accordance with the saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. </span></em>(Sooratu<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>Sh</u>ooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying, “<strong>There is nothing like Him</strong>” negates and denies any <em>ta<u>sh</u>beeh</em> (resemblance with the creation) and His saying, “<strong>And He (Allaah) is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing</strong>” is a negation of <em>ta`<u>t</u>eel</em> (denying His attributes). So this is the position which the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em> proceed upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, it is said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">الْمُعَطِّلُ يَعْبُدُ عَدَمًا، وَالْمُشَبِّهُ يَعْبُدُ صَنَمًا، وَالْمُوَحِّدُ يَعْبُدُ إِلَـٰهًا وَاحِدًا فَرْدًا صَمَدًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>mu`a<u>tt</u>il</em> (one who negates Allaah’s attributes) worships something which does not exist;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>mu<u>sh</u>abbih</em> (one who declares Allaah’s attributes to be like those of the creation) worships an idol;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>muwa<u>hh</u>id</em> (person upon true <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>) worships the sole One who deserves worship, the One who is Single, the Independent Lord and Master.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>End of explanation of point [3][3]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s side point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> `Abdur-Ra<u>h</u>maan ibn Naa<u>s</u>ir As-Sa`dee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said in the <em>tafseer</em> of this <em>aayah</em> that the <em>aayah</em> is in the form of a question and what is meant is a denial i.e. there is no namesake for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Translator’s Side Point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> says regarding this point: “<strong>And there is nothing like Him</strong>”: This is one of the fundamentals from the fundamental principles of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed;</em> which is, that with regard to Allaah the Most High: <strong>there is nothing like Him</strong> – neither in His Self, His Attributes and His Actions. However, the innovators and the people of <em>ta.weel</em> (تأويل &#8211; those who twist Allaah’s Attributes) take it as a principle by which they deny many of Allaah’s Attributes, He, the Exalted and Most High. So whenever their hearts are too constricted to believe in one of His Attributes, He, the Mighty and Majestic, then they perform <em>ta.weel</em> (twist that Attribute) and try and destroy it and deny it. So they deny an Attribute and they use as an evidence for what they are doing His saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him …</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Pretending to be ignorant of the end of the <em>aayah:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">… and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. </span></em>(Sooratu<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>Sh</u>ooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this <em>aayah</em> gathers between declaring Him free, along with affirming His Attributes. So whoever wishes to be safe and sound in his creed then he should declare Allaah, the Most High, to be free from any resemblance to the creation, without explaining His Attributes away, and without denying His Attributes. Rather, he should affirm for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, with regard to Attributes, everything which He has affirmed for Himself in His Book or in a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of His Prophet, without declaring that the Creator resembles the creation. This is the position of the <em>Salaf;</em> and the author <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, was upon it following on from Abu <u>H</u>aneefah and the rest of <em>imaams</em>.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [11]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His Life is a complete and perfect life which does not suffer from any deficiency nor any sleep.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah, none has the right to be worshipped except Him, the Ever-Living One, the Independent Sustainer of all.  Neither sleep nor slumber takes hold of Him.</span></em> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>255)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And place reliance upon the Ever-Living One Who does not die.</span></em> (Sooratul-Furqaan (25), <em>aayah </em>58)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, He negates for Himself <em>as-sinah</em> (السِنة – slumber) and that means light sleep and (He negates for Himself) <em>an-nawm</em> (النوم) which is deep sleep.[1] And He negated for Himself <em>al-mawt</em> (الموت – death) because of the completeness and perfection of His Life, He the Perfect and Most High.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And sleep and slumber and death, these are deficiencies in life and these are attributes to be found in the creation; and the life of the creation is deficient because he sleeps and he dies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So sleeping is a part of completeness with regard to the creation but it is a deficiency with regard to the Creator; because a person who cannot sleep they have an affliction affecting their health.  So this shows the difference and the distinction between the Attributes of the Creator and the attributes of the creation.  And as for the two Names: الحي (<em>Al-<u>H</u>ayy</em> &#8211; The Ever-living) and القيوم (<em>Al-Qayyoom</em> –and the independent Sustainer of all), then these are two attributes taken from the statement of Allaah the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah, none has the right to be worshipped except Him, He is the Ever-living, the independent Sustainer of all </span></em>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>255)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>Al-<u>H</u>ayy</em>, the Ever-living means the One who has complete and perfect life and <em>Al-Qayyoom</em> is a word in intensive form.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] From Aboo Moosaa <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh </em>who said: Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> stood amongst us with five sayings; so he said, <strong><em>“Allaah the Mighty and Majestic does not sleep and it is not befitting for Him that He should sleep&#8230;”</em></strong> the hadeeth.  Reported by Muslim in the book of <em>Eemaan.</em></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">The Explanation – Point [12]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So the word) <strong>القيوم (<em>Al-Qayyoom</em></strong> – The Independent Sustainer of everything) is: the One who independently exists by Himself and the One who sustains everything; the One who independently exists and has no need of anything; the One who is independent of everything and the One who sustains everything else.  Everything else is in a state of poverty and need of Him and needs to be sustained by Him, He the Perfect and Most High.  So if it were not that Allaah sustains the heavens and the earth and all of the creation then they would all be destroyed and pass away.  But however, Allaah sustains them and guards them and provides for them – giving them whatever would benefit them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the whole of the creation is in need of Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Indeed Allaah holds the heavens and the earth so that they do not move away from their places, and if they were to move away from their places, there is no one that could hold them after Him.</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[1] Translator’s side point:</strong> From the explanation of Ibn Abil-`Izz <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, he says with regards to these two Names &#8211; <strong><em>Al-<u>H</u>ayy</em></strong> (that Allaah is Ever-living) and <strong><em>Al-Qayyoom</em></strong> (that Allaah is the Independent One who sustains everything):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these two Names, all of the rest of Allaah’s Perfect Names return back and pivot around these two.  And all the meanings of the other Names refer back to these two.  Because the first, <strong><em>Al-<u>H</u>ayaat</em></strong> – the attribute of life, it necessitates for Him all the attributes of perfection; so no attribute will be missing from His attribute of life except due to weakness in that life.  So since the Life of Allaah, the Most High, is the most perfect and complete life, then affirming it means affirmation of every attribute of perfection for Him.  As for the name <em><strong>Al-Qayyoom</strong>,</em> then this includes the perfection of Allaah’s Independence and the perfection of His Power since He is the One who independently exists and has no need of anyone else in any sense; and He is the one Who supports and sustains everything else; and there is no establishment for anything except if He establishes it.  So these two Names gather completely the rest of the Names.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F319877140&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe><br />
—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [58][1]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Ar-ru&#8217;yah</em> (الرؤية – the seeing) means: the believers seeing their Lord, the Perfect and Most High; because the believers will see their Lord, the Perfect and Most High, in the Hereafter. They will see Him openly – with their eyes, just as they see the moon on the night when it is full and just as they see the sun bright and clear when there is no cloud-cover to hide it; just as the chosen Prophet (Al-Mu<u>st</u>afaa) <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed about in the authentic <em>mutawaatir</em> <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> from him, <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>.[2] So therefore, the author said, “The seeing (<em>ar-ru.yah</em>) is true” meaning: it is affirmed by the Book and the Sunnah and the <em>ijmaa`</em> (consensus) of the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em> from the <em>Salaf</em> (predecessors) and from the <em><u>Kh</u>alaf</em> (later peoples). Nobody disagrees about that except for the <em>mubtadi`ah</em> (innovators) and the people of the deviant ways.[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the believers will see their Lord, the Perfect and Most High, just as He the Perfect said,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">On that Day (the Day of Resurrection) some faces would be radiant, looking at their Lord.<br />
</span></em>(Sooratul-Qiyaamah (75), <em>aayaat </em>22-23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are the faces of the believers. As for (the word in the first <em>aayah</em>) <em>‘naa<u>d</u>irah’</em> (ناضرة &#8211; radiant), meaning: from <em>an-na<u>d</u>rah</em> (النضرة) which means brilliance and beauty.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">You will recognize upon their faces the radiance of bliss.</span></em><br />
(Sooratul-Mu<u>t</u>affifeen (83), <em>aayah </em>24)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for (the second <em>aayah</em>) <em>‘na<u>z</u>irah’</em> (ناظرة) then it means looking with the eyes. You say: <em>“na<u>z</u>artu ilaa ka<u>dh</u>aa”</em> (نظرت إلى كذا) – “I looked upon such and such” when you mean: “I saw it” (أبصرته) – <em>ab<u>s</u>artuh</em>. The term <em>‘an-na<u>z</u>ar’</em> (النظر) has different usages in the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. (Firstly), if it is used with the term ‘<em>ilaa’ </em>(إلى) meaning ‘towards’ or ‘to’ then it means: seeing with the eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Will they not look upon the camels at how they have been created and at the sky and how it has been raised?</span></em>  (Sooratul-<u>Gh</u>aa<u>sh</u>iyah (88), <em>aayaat </em>17-18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Will they not look with their eyes at these amazing parts of the creation which prove the Power and Ability of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. And in this <em>aayah</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Looking at their Lord</span> </em>(Sooratul-Qiyaamah (75), <em>aayaat </em>23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Using the term ‘<em>ilaa’</em> (إلى).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when <em>‘an-na<u>z</u>ar’</em> (النظر) is used on its own without any intermediate particle, then it means: halting and waiting.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">On the Day when the male and female hypocrites will say to those who believe, “Wait for us so that we can acquire some of your light.”</span></em> (Sooratul-<u>H</u>adeed (57), <em>aayah </em>13)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Wait for us so we can derive some light from your light; because the hypocrites, their lights will be extinguished, and Allaah’s Refuge is sought; so they will remain in darkness. So therefore, they will seek from the believers to wait for them until they can take some light from their light. And His Saying, He the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Do they but await that Allaah should come to them?</span></em> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>210)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: They do not await except the coming of the Lord on the Day of Resurrection, to carry out judgment between His slaves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when <em>‘an-na<u>z</u>ar’</em> (النظر) – ‘looking’ is used with the particle ‘<em>fee’</em> (في) – ‘into’, then it carries the meaning of ‘reflecting and considering’, just as Allaah the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Will they not reflect upon the Dominion of the heavens and the earth.</span></em> (Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>185)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: reflect upon those things created by Allaah in the heavens and upon the earth and take this as a proof for the Power and Ability of Allaah, the Creator, He the Perfect and Most High; and of His being deserving of all worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in summary, <em>‘an-na<u>z</u>ar’</em> (النظر) here is used with the particle ‘<em>ilaa’</em> (إلى) – ‘at’ and its meaning is: (‘looking at’) seeing and seeing with the eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Perfect and Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">For those who did well in the world, there will be the finest reward and an increase.</span> </em>(Soorah Yoonus (10), <em>aayah </em>26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> himself, explained the term <em>‘al-<u>h</u>usnaa’</em> (الحسنى – the finest) to mean Paradise; and he explained <em>‘az-ziyaadah’</em> (الزيادة – the increase) to mean looking at the Honorable Face of Allaah. And this occurs in <u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> Muslim.[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Those who are dutiful to Allaah will have whatever they wished in Paradise and we have something extra for them.</span></em> (Soorah Qaaf (50), <em>aayah </em>35)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<em>Al-mazeed</em>’ (المزيد – something extra): it is looking at the Honorable Face of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High said about the unbelievers,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">But no! On that Day the unbelievers will be blocked and screened away from their Lord.</span></em><br />
(Sooratul-Mu<u>t</u>affifeen (83), <em>aayah </em>15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if the unbelievers are screened away from Allaah, not seeing Him because they disbelieved in this world, so then they will be screened and prevented from looking upon Him on the Day of Resurrection. And this is the greatest deprivation and the greatest punishment; and Allaah’s Refuge is sought. So the <em>aayah</em> proves that the believers would not be blocked and screened away from Allaah on the Day of Resurrection and that they will indeed look upon Him in the Hereafter; because they believed in Him in this world, not having seen Him. Rather, they took as proof for Him, He the Perfect, His Signs and His Messages (sent to His Messengers). So therefore, Allaah will honour them with looking upon Him on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And looking upon the Face of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, is the greatest bliss in Paradise. This is the position of the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah</em> and these are some of their proofs from the Qur.aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for their proofs from the Sunnah then they are very many; indeed they reach the level of <em>mutwaatir</em> (being reported by a very large number of people at every stage of transmission – from the Companions, <em>Taabi`een</em> and every level thereon), as was said by the great scholar Ibnul-Qayyim in his valuable book <em><u>H</u>aadiyul-Arwaa<u>h</u> ilaa Bilaadil-Afraa<u>h</u></em> (حادي الأرواح إلى بلاد الأفراح) and he quoted the <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> reported about seeing Allaah (by the believers on the Day of Resurrection) and that they reach the level of being <em>mutawaatir</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them is his saying <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إنكم سترون ربكم يوم القيامة، كما ترون القمر ليلة البدر، وكما ترون الشمس صحوًا ليس دونـها سحاب، لا تُضامون في رؤيته – أو:‏ لا تَضامُّون في رؤيته</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008080;">“You will certainly see your Lord on the Day of Resurrection, just as you see the Moon on the night when it is full and just as you see the Sun – bright and clear, not being covered over by clouds; and you will not be put to trouble in seeing Him – or you will not have to rush and crowd together to see Him.”</span></em> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: You will not have to scramble and crowd to see Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, because every single one will see the Lord, each person remaining at his place without any crowding or scrambling, just as the people see the Sun and the Moon without having to scramble and crowd. Usually if there is something upon the earth which is hidden, then the people have to scramble to get to see it. However, if it is something raised up like the Sun and the Moon, then they do not have to crowd and scramble to see it; everyone can see it while he still remains at his place. And if this is the case with regard to something created, the Sun and the Moon, then how about the Creator, the Perfect and Most High?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Point [58] to be continued <em>inshaa. Allaah</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s Side Point: In the larger explanation of Ibn Abil-`Izz, Ibn Abil-`Izz said with regard to this point, “This matter is one of the noblest matters from the principles of the religion and from the most tremendous of them. And it is the limit which those people who strive, strive for, and those people who vie, vie for. And those will be deprived, those who are screened away from their Lord; they will be truly deprived – those who are turned away from His Door.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] (One of these <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>) from Jareer ibn `Abdillaah al-Bajalee <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em> who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">كُنَّا عِنْدَ النَّبِيِّ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ فَنَظَرَ إِلَى الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَة يَعْنِي الْبَدْرَ فَقَالَ إِنَّكُمْ سَتَرَوْنَ رَبَّكُمْ كَمَا تَرَوْنَ هَذَا الْقَمَرَ لَا تُضَامُّونَ فِي رُؤْيَتِهِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008080;"><em>“We were the Prophet <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and he looked at the Moon on the night when it was full and he said, ‘You will certainly see your Lord, just as you see this Moon; you will not be put to trouble in seeing Him’.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><u>H</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree as <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> 554 and by Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s Side Point: Some of the explainers make the point that this <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> affirms seeing Allaah truly and really, just as we truly and really see the Moon and the Sun.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Translator’s Side Point: Ibn Abil-`Izz mentions who they are. He said, “The ones who disagree and differ about seeing, they are the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> and the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> and those who follow them from the <em><u>Kh</u>awaarij</em> and the <em>Imaamiyyah</em> (the <em><u>Sh</u>ee`ah</em>). And their saying is false and futile and it is rejected by the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Muslim reports it as <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> 181, in the Book of <em>Eemaan</em> in <u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> Muslim, and also reported by At-Tirmi<u>dh</u>ee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] <em><u>H</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree from a <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em><em>,</em> as <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u> </em>554, 806 and 7434, and also by Muslim who reports it with the wording: تضارون (you will not cause harm to anyone to see Him.)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">[45] وأن القرآن كلام الله‏.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">[45]    And that the Qur.aan is the Speech of Allaah. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [45]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After you have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) in Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and you have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) in His Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam,</em> then, you have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) that the Qur.aan is the Speech of Allaah; because this is what the Messenger of Allaah <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> came with, and Allaah sent down the Qur.aan to him.  And this Qur.aan is not from the speech of Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> nor is it from the speech of Jibreel; rather, it is just the Speech of Allaah, the Mighty and the Majestic.  Allaah spoke with it, and Jibreel took it from Allaah, and the Prophet <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> took it from Jibreel <em>`alahis-salaam</em>, and the Ummah (this nation) took it from the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is the Speech of Allaah; it originated from Him, He the One free of all imperfections.  Jibreel did not take it from <em>Al-Law<u>h</u> Al-Ma<u>h</u>foo<u>z</u></em> (اللوح المحفوظ<em> – </em>the Preserved Tablet) as the people of misguidance say.  And it is not from the speech of Jibreel nor Mu<u>h</u>ammad; rather, it is from the Speech of the Lord of the whole of creation.  And as for Jibreel and Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em>`alayhima<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>, then those two were Messengers who conveyed from Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.  For speech is said by, and attributed to, the one who initially spoke it; not the one who said it only as one conveying and transmitting it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, those who say that Jibreel took it from the Preserved Tablet or who say that Allaah created it within something and then Jibreel took it from that thing, then whoever says this is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) in Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, who has disbelieved with <em>kufr</em> which takes them out of the Religion, as is the saying of the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> and the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> and those who follow their way.  So it (the Qur.aan) is the Speech of Allaah – its letters and its meanings; Allaah spoke with it as He wished.  So, we describe Allaah with the Attribute of His having spoken; and <em>Al-Kalaam</em> (Speech) is from Allaah’s Attributes which are actions (<em><u>s</u>ifaatihil-fi`liyyah</em>).  And the ‘how’ (<em>kayfiyyah</em>) or the manner in which He spoke with it, then in that regard we say, “Allaah knows best about that.” So, this is just like the rest of His Attributes, we have <em>eemaan</em> in them but we do not know how they are.  So the meaning is known but as for ‘how’, then that is unknown to us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>End of explanation of point [45]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">[46] منه بدأ بلا كيفية قولًا، وأنزله على رسوله وحيًا‏.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">[46]    It originated from Him as something spoken without us knowing how; and He sent it down to His Messenger as revelation.  </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [46]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: that the Qur.aan descended from Allaah; Allaah spoke with it and sent it down.  It did not descend from someone else besides Him, and it did not originate from someone other than Him.  It is not as they say, that it originated from Jibreel or from the Preserved Tablet or from somewhere in mid-air.  Rather, it began from Allaah and Jibreel heard it and he conveyed it to the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> as <em>wa<u>h</u>y</em> (revelation) and the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, he conveyed it to the people.  And if this Qur.aan had been from the speech of humans then someone from the people would have been able to bring a <em>soorah</em> the like of it.  So, since they are unable to do this, then this shows that it is indeed the Speech of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.  He the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And if you are in any doubt about that which We sent down to Our slave (Mu<u>h</u>ammad <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam), then bring a soorah like it and call your witnesses besides Allaah upon that, if you are truthful.  </em></span>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the One free from all imperfections and the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Or do they say, “He forged it”?  Say, “Then bring ten soorahs which are forged like it.” </span></em>(Soorah Hood (11), <em>aayah </em>13)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah rendered them incapable of doing that, even though they were Arabs and eloquent in the language.  And the Qur.aan is in the language of the Arabs and is in the letters which they spoke with, and they were eager to oppose the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam;</em> and if it was within their ability to resist and oppose this Qur.aan, they would not have saved any efforts to do so.  So when they were unable to do that, then this shows that it is indeed the Speech of Allaah, which is not approached by falsehood from in front nor from behind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>End of explanation of point [46]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">[47] وصدّقه المؤمنون على ذلك حقًا‏.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">[47]    And the believers attest to it as being the Truth upon that basis. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [47]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So those who have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) in Allaah and His Messenger, they believe that the Qur.aan is the Speech of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was just one who conveyed (the Message) from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the saying of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed, it is the Speech brought by an honourable Messenger (Jibreel `alayhis-salaam) possessing the strength to do whatever duty he is given; high in status with the Lord of the Tremendous Throne. </span></em>(Sooratut-Takweer (81), <em>aayaat </em>19-20)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is meant by its being ascribed to Jibreel, is from the aspect of conveying<em>;</em> since it is not possible that this Qur.aan is from the Speech of Allaah <em>and</em> from the speech of Jibreel.  Speech does not come except from one; so it is not possible to describe it as being the Speech of more than one.  And its being ascribed to Allaah is <em><u>h</u>aqeeqiyyah</em> (true and real) and as for its being ascribed to Jibreel, then (it is) from the aspect of conveying it (<em>tablee<u>gh</u></em> &#8211; تبليغ).  And in another <em>aayah</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed it is Speech conveyed by an honourable Messenger and it is not the speech of a poet; little it is that you believe.</span> </em>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>aaqqah (69), <em>aayaat </em>40-41)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.  So its being ascribed to him is an ascription of conveying (<em>tablee<u>gh</u></em>).  So He, the One free of all imperfections, sometimes ascribes it to Himself, and sometimes to Jibreel and sometimes to Mu<u>h</u>ammad (<em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>).  And one and the same speech cannot have been spoken by more than one.  So therefore, its being ascribed to Allaah is an ascription with regard to its origin and that it is His Speech, and its being ascribed to Jibreel and Mu<u>h</u>ammad is an ascription of conveying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [47] [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[1] Translator’s Side Point:</strong> In his larger explanation, Ibn Abil-`Izz goes into great detail in explaining these points and if you want to see the beauty of the saying of the people of Truth about the Qur.aan being the Speech of Allaah: that it originated from Him, He spoke with it and its Letters and Meanings are from His Speech; then if you read the explanation and his inclusion of eight (8) sayings of the people of deviation, then you will further see the beauty of this speech.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Points discussed in this excerpt include:</strong></span></p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>The Qur.aan is the Speech of Allaah and it originated from Him; it is not created.</li>
<li>One who says that Jibreel took it from the Preserved Tablet has disbelieved with <em>kufr</em> which takes him out of the religion.</li>
<li>It originated from Allaah as something spoken without us knowing how; and He sent it down to His Messenger as revelation.</li>
<li>If the Qur.aan was from the speech of humans then someone would have been able to bring a <em>soorah</em> the like of it. But they cannot; so this shows that it is indeed the Speech of Allaah.</li>
<li>Jibreel and Mu<u>h</u>ammad `<em>alayhimas-salaam</em> were just Messengers who conveyed the Message (Qur.aan) from Allaah.</li>
<li>The same speech cannot have been spoken by more than one.</li>
<li>When Allaah mentions: <strong>“…Speech brought by an honorable Messenger” </strong>and<strong> “…Speech conveyed by an honorable Messenger”</strong>, this ascription to Jibreel and Mu<u>h</u>ammad `<em>alayhimas-salaam</em> is an ascription of conveying and not of having originally spoken with the Speech.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Aqeedah Tahaawiyyah : Point # 8: </strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>[8]</strong> <strong>ولا يكون إلا ما يريد‏.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[8] <span style="color:#000000;"><strong> And nothing occurs except what He (Allaah) wills.</strong></span></p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F319065738&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe><br />
—</p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [8]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This contains an affirmation of <em>al-Qadr </em>(القدر &#8211; pre-decree) and an affirmation of <em>al-Iraadah</em> (الإرادة &#8211; Allaah’s Will).  So nothing exists within His kingdom and nothing occurs within His creation whether events or things except that Allaah willed it to occur, He the Perfect and Most High – willing it with His <em>Iraadah al-Kawniyyah</em> (Universal Will):</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And His Affair, when He wills something, is just that He says to it, &#8220;Be!&#8221; and it is!</span></em><br />
(Soorah YaaSeen (36), <em>aayah </em>82)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, every good and every evil occurs by Allaah’s Universal Will; so nothing escapes from His Will.  And this contains a refutation of the <em>Qadariyyah</em> – those who deny <em>al-Qadr</em> (pre-decree) and who claim that the person himself, he is the one who creates his own actions and produces his own actions; and Highly Exalted is Allaah above that which they say.  Because this (saying of theirs) is a declaration of Allaah’s being unable and (it is a statement) that there are things in His creation which He the Perfect and Most High does not Will.  So this is to describe Him with deficiency because everything which occurs within the creation – whether good or evil, then it occurs by His Will.  Rather, He creates good for a wise purpose and He creates that which is evil for a wise purpose.  So from the aspect of its creation, then it is not an evil because it is created for a tremendous wisdom and a tremendous goal which is to test and to try, and to distinguish that which is foul from that which is good, and in order to reward the people upon their righteous deeds and to recompense the people for their evil deeds.  And He was Wise in that, He, the Perfect and Most High; He did not create anything without purpose.</p>
<p>End of explanation of point [8][1]</p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s side point: Ibn Abil-`Izz <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, in his famous explanation of A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>a<u>ha</u>awiyyah, says: “<strong>And nothing exists except what He (Allaah) wills</strong>.” This contains a refutation of the saying of the <em>Qadariyyah</em> and the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> because they say, “Allaah willed <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) from all of the people but the unbeliever is the one who willed unbelief for himself.” And this saying of theirs is corrupt and is rejected since it contrary to the Book and the Sunnah and to correct intellect and it is the well-known matter of <em>al-Qadr</em> (pre-decree) and something in explanation of that will follow <em>inshaa Allaahu ta`aalaa</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they (these people who deny pre-decree) are called the <em>Qadariyyah</em> because they denied pre-decree; and likewise the <em>Jabariyyah</em> (who say that the people have no free will and are forced to do whatever they do) are also called the people of pre-decree (<em>Qadariyyah</em>).  This name (<em>al-Qadariyyah</em>) is mostly used for the first group (those who deny the pre-decree).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the people of the Sunnah, then they say that even though Allaah willed that sins would occur, however, He does not love them and He is not pleased with them and He did not command them.  Rather, He hates them and is angry with them and He forbade them.  This is the saying of all of the <em>Salaf</em> – those who say, “Whatever Allaah willed occurs and whatever He did not will, does not occur.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[…]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the verifiers from the people of the Sunnah say, “‘Will’ in the Book of Allaah is of two types: Allaah’s Will referring to His pre-decree (His Universal Will – الإرادة الكونية) and His Legislational Will (الإرادة الشرعية) which comprises His Love and His Pleasure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Aqeedah Tahaawiyyah : Point # 7: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> <strong>لا يفنى ولا يبيد‏.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>He does not perish nor (does He) pass away. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F319064019&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [7]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-fanaa. </em>(الفناء &#8211; perishing) and <em>al-beed</em> (البيد &#8211; passing away) have one and the same meaning.[1]  So Allaah, the One free of all imperfections and the Most High has as His Attribute: continual and everlasting life.  Allaah, the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And place reliance upon the Ever-Living One Who does not die.</em></span><br />
(Sooratul-Furqaan (25), <em>aayah </em>58)</p>
<p>So, Allaah never perishes (passes away).  He, the Perfect and Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Everything will perish except for His Face.</em></span><br />
(Sooratul-Qa<u>s</u>a<u>s</u> (28), <em>aayah </em>88)</p>
<p>And He, the Perfect and Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Everyone upon (the earth) will perish (die).  But the Majestic and Noble Face of your Lord will remain forever. </span></em>(Sooratur-Ra<u>h</u>maan (55), <em>aayaat </em>26-27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So for Him, the Perfect and Most High, is <em>Al-Baqaa. </em>(البقاء – persisting and remaining forever) whereas the creation will die and then they will be resurrected.  And initially, they, the creation, were non-existent and then Allaah created them and then they will die and then Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic will raise them in the resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah the One free of all imperfections and the Most High had no beginning and He has no end.</p>
<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s side point: Ibn Abil-`Izz <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, in his explanation of A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>a<u>ha</u>awiyyah, makes the point that the second one (<em>al-beed</em> – passing away) is an emphasis of the first one (<em>al-fanaa</em>. – perishing).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Aqeedah Tahawiyyah : Point # 6 </strong></span></p>
<p><strong>قديم بلا ابتداء، دائم بلا انتهاء‏.</strong></p>
<p>[6]<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>  He is the Ancient One without any beginning, the One who Persists without any ending.</strong></span></p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F319057196&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [6]</strong></span></p>
<p>As is indicated by saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">He (Allaah) is the First and the Last</span></em><br />
(Sooratul-<u>H</u>adeed (57), <em>aayah </em>3)</p>
<p>And his saying <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">‏أَنْتَ الْأَوَّلُ فَلَيْسَ قَبْلَكَ شَيْء، وَأَنْتَ الْآخِرُ فَلَيْسَ بَعْدَكَ شَيْء</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">“<em>You are the First One and there was nothing before You, and You are the Last One and there is nothing after You.</em>”</span>[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the word <em>qadeem</em> (قديم – the ancient one) is not applied to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, except in the sense of informing about Him.  As for calling Him with that name, then there is not from His Names “<em>al-qadeem”</em> (the ancient one).  Rather, from His Names is: “<em>Al-Awwal”</em> (الأول &#8211; The First); and the term <em>Al-Awwal</em> (The First) is not the same as saying <em>al-qadeem</em> (the ancient one) because the term <em>al-qadeem</em> (the ancient one) may have someone before Him.  As for the term “<em>Al-Awwal”</em> (The First) then there is nothing before him (one who is first).  As the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">أَنْتَ الْأَوَّلُ فَلَيْسَ قَبْلَكَ شَيْء</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“You are the First One and there was nothing before You.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the author <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah,</em> made a precaution here and he said, <strong>“The Ancient One without any beginning,”</strong> and if he had just said “<strong>The Ancient One</strong>” and remained silent then that would not be correct in meaning.  [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Reported by Muslim in the Book of <em><u>Dh</u>ikr</em> and <em>Du`aa</em>. and <em>Tawbah</em> and <em>Isti<u>gh</u>faar</em>.  It is a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> would recite this <em>du`aa</em>. when he would go to bed (as part of a longer supplication).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Translator’s side point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> `Abdul-`Azeez Ibn Baaz <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> says about this same point, <strong>“The Ancient One without any beginning”</strong>: The wording <em>qadeem </em>does not occur amongst the Perfect Names of Allaah as the explainer (Ibn Abil-`Izz <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) and others explained.  But many of the people of theological rhetoric mention that phrase about Allaah, that He is <em>Qadeem, </em>to affirm that His existence came before everything.  However, the Names of Allaah are <em>tawqeefiyyah – </em>they can only be affirmed with a text from the Noble Book or the authentic Sunnah. It is not permissible to affirm anything from His Names based upon opinion as the <em>imaams</em> of the <em>Salafu<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>aali<u>h</u></em> have stated.  And the word ‘<em>al-qadeem</em>’ (the ancient one), does not indicate the meaning which the people of theological rhetoric intended because the wording ‘<em>al-qadeem</em>’ (that which is ancient) in the Arabic language means that which preceded something else even though it itself did not exist at one time, such as occurs in the saying of Allaah, the Perfect,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Until it returned like the old ancient date stalk<br />
</strong>(Soorah YaaSeen (36), <em>aayah </em>39)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, the correct meaning is only indicated by the addition which the author mentioned, “<strong>The Ancient One without any beginning”</strong> but it is not befitting to count that amongst the Perfect Names of Allaah since it is not established in texts and we are sufficed in that regard by His Name, He the Perfect, <em>‘Al-Awwal’</em> (The First One),</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>He (Allaah) is the First and the Last</strong><br />
(Sooratul-<u>H</u>adeed (57), <em>aayah </em>3)</p>
<p>And Allaah is the One who grants success.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From the Book: <strong>How are we Obligated to Interpret the Qur’aan?</strong> Shaykh al-Albanee.<br />
<strong>[ <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/how-are-we-obligated-to-interpret-the-noble-quraan-shaykh-al-albanee-al-ibaanah-com.pdf" target="_blank">Download complete PDF book</a>]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[5] Question</strong>: Allaah informs us about Himself saying:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;">وَمَكَرُواْ وَمَكَرَ اللّهُ وَاللّهُ خَيْرُ الْمَاآِرِينَ</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And they plotted and Allaah too plotted. And Allaah is the best of plotters.”</strong> </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">[Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 54]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Perhaps the minds of some people may limit the understanding of this ayah to just its apparent meaning. And maybe we are not in need of explaining it. But how is it that Allaah is the best of plotters?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[5] Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This question is easy by the Grace of Allaah. This is since we are able to understand that plotting is not always necessarily characterized with being evil nor is it always necessarily characterized with being good. So perhaps a disbeliever may plot against a Muslim however this Muslim is bright and clever and not heedless and stupid. So he is aware of the plots of his disbelieving opponent and thus deals with him in retaliation to his plot. This is such that the end result is that this Muslim through his good plotting compels the disbeliever’s evil plot to backfire on his own self. So can it be said that when this Muslim plotted against the disbeliever, he engaged in an illegal affair? No one says this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is easy to comprehend this fact from the statement of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم: <strong>“War is deception.” [</strong>14] What can be said about deception is exactly the same that can be said about plotting. A Muslim deceiving his Muslim brother is forbidden. However, if a Muslim deceives a disbeliever who is an enemy to Allaah and an enemy to His Messenger, this is not forbidden. On the contrary, it is obligatory. The same goes for a Muslim plotting against a disbeliever who intends to plot against him, such that this Muslim reverses the plot of this disbeliever. This is a good form of plotting. This is a human being and that is a human being. But what do we say with respect to the Lord of all that exists, the All-Able, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He invalidates the plots of all the plotters. This is why Allaah says: <strong>“And Allaah is the best of plotters.”</strong> So when Allaah describes Himself with this description, our attention shuld be directed to the fact that plotting – even on the part of humans – is not always negative. This is since Allaah says: <strong>“The best of plotters.”</strong> So there is plotting that is good and plotting that is bad. So whoever plots for a good reason should not be condemned. And Allaah, Mighty and Majestic, is as He says, the <strong>“best of plotters.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In brief, I say: Whatever suppositions may come to your mind, Allaah is contrary to that. So if a person imagines something that is not befitting to Allaah, then he should know right away that he is wrong. Hence this ayah contains praise for Allaah, so there is nothing in it that is impermissible to ascribe to Allaah.</p>

<p><strong>Transcription of the Audio:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillah hir Rahman nir Raheem. Alhamdulillahi Rabbil Aalameen wa sallalaahu ala nabeeyena Muhammad wa alaa alihi wa sahbhi wa sallama tasleeman kaseera</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Second Question is why was the Ka&#8217;abah called Baytullah Al Haraam, The inviolable house of Allah ?.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Ka&#8217;bah was called Baytullah i.e The House of Allah. That is because it is the place of magnification of Allah(عز و جل) Most Mighty and Most Majestic.People come to it from all places in order to offer an obligation which Allah had ordained upon them and also because people direct themselves in its direction while in their prayers, wherever they may be fulfilling one of the conditions of the Salah i.e. directing one self towards the Qibla.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) stated in Surah Al- Baqarah (2:144) :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">قَدۡ نَرَىٰ تَقَلُّبَ وَجۡهِكَ فِى ٱلسَّمَآءِ‌ۖ فَلَنُوَلِّيَنَّكَ قِبۡلَةً۬ تَرۡضَٮٰهَا‌ۚ فَوَلِّ وَجۡهَكَ شَطۡرَ ٱلۡمَسۡجِدِ ٱلۡحَرَامِ‌ۚ وَحَيۡثُ مَا كُنتُمۡ فَوَلُّواْ وُجُوهَكُمۡ شَطۡرَهُ ۥ‌ۗ وَإِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلۡكِتَـٰبَ لَيَعۡلَمُونَ أَنَّهُ ٱلۡحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّهِمۡ‌ۗ وَمَا ٱللَّهُ بِغَـٰفِلٍ عَمَّا يَعۡمَلُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Verily! We have seen the turning of your (Muhammad&#8217;s صلى الله عليه وسلم) face towards the heaven. Surely, We shall turn you to a Qiblah (prayer direction) that shall please you, so turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid- Al-Harâm (at Makkah). And wheresoever you people are, turn your faces (in prayer) in that direction. Certainly, the people who were given the Scriptures (i.e. Jews and the Christians) know well that, that (your turning towards the direction of the Ka&#8217;bah at Makkah in prayers) is the truth from their Lord. And Allâh is not unaware of what they do.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) narrated it to Himself added it when he mentioned the Ka&#8217;abah as an honour and magnification of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is because that which is related to Allah in the construct of the statements by Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) is divided into two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) The Attribute of Himself (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى)<br />
2) The creature of  his creation</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it is an attribute, then it is related because it is established with Him and Allah(عز و جل) is qualified by it, it is His attribute like Allah&#8217;s hearing, Allah&#8217;s sight, Allah&#8217;s knowledge, Allah&#8217;s ability, Allah&#8217;s speech and other than that from His most mighty and magnificent attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it s a creature from his creation, then it is added to Allah (عز و جل) in the construct as away of honouring and magnification and in this way Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى)  related the Ka&#8217;abah to Himself when He said in Surah Al Hajj (22:26):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَطَهِّرۡ بَيۡتِىَ لِلطَّآٮِٕفِينَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">And (remember) when We showed Ibrahim (Abraham) the site of the (Sacred) House (the Ka&#8217;bah at Makkah) (saying): &#8220;Associate not anything (in worship) with Me, [La ilaha ill-Allah (none has the right to be worshipped but Allah Islamic Monotheism], and sanctify <span style="color:#ff0000;">My House</span> for those who circumambulate it, and those who stand up for prayer, and those who bow (submit themselves with humility and obedience to Allah), and make prostration (in prayer, etc.);&#8221; )</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He said &#8216;My House&#8217; (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى). He narrated it it to Himself in the construct of the verse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also He added to Himself the masaajid (the Mosques) as He said in Surah Al Baqarah (2:114):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ومن اظلم ممن منع مساجد الله ان يذكر فيها اسمه وسعى في خرابها اولئك ما كان لهم ان يدخلوها الا خائفين لهم في الدنيا خزي ولهم في الاخرة عذاب عظيم</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And who is more unjust than those who forbid Allah&#8217;s Name be glorified and mentioned much (i.e. prayers and invocations, etc.) in <span style="color:#ff0000;">Allah&#8217;s Mosques</span> and strive for their ruin? It was not fitting that such should themselves enter them (Allah&#8217;s Mosques) except in fear. For them there is disgrace in this world, and they will have a great torment in the Hereafter.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You see that now, Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) added the mosques in the  construct to Himself in the relation &#8216; &#8216;Allah&#8217;s Mosques&#8221; and also  (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) He may do the same regarding some of his creatures in order to make clear His comprehensive possession as in His statement  (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) in Surah Al Jasiya (45:13):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;وسخر لكم ما في السماوات وما في الارض جميعا منه ان في ذلك لايات لقوم يتفكرون&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And has subjected to you all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth; it is all as a favour and kindness from Him. Verily, in it are signs for a people who think deeply.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore  in summary  Allah  (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) referred the Ka&#8217;abah to Himself as an honour and magnification and no one should think that Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) reffered the ka&#8217;abah to Himself because it is &#8220;a place in which He resides&#8221;. This is impossible because (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) encompasses everything and nothing from his creatures encompass Him, rather His Kursee(سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) encompasses the Heavens and the Earth, as Allah Stated in Surah Al Baqarah (2:255) that his Kursee extends over the Heavens and the Earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in Surah Zumar (39:67):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وما قدروا الله حق قدره والارض جميعا قبضته يوم القيامة والسماوات مطويات بيمينه سبحان</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And on the Day of Resurrection the whole of the earth will be grasped by His Hand and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He is above His heavens ascended the throne in the most majestic way that befits Him and it&#8217;s not possible that He ( سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) dwells in any of his creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allah knows the best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><em>Tabaarak Allaah</em></strong>”: means: tremendously great is the One whose actions are these, He the Perfect and Most High. And whose Ability is such and these are the things which He has created, He the Exalted and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And, “<strong><em>Tabaarak</em></strong>”: is a verb which is used specifically for Him, He the Perfect, so it cannot be applied to anyone besides Him. And <strong><em>al-Barakah</em></strong> (blessing) it means abundance of good and its increase, and the blessings which come from Allaah the Majestic and Most High do not end. As for a created being, it cannot be said about him, “<strong><em>tabaarak</em></strong>”. Rather it can be said to him, “<strong><em>mubaarak</em></strong>” meaning, “May you receive blessing”, meaning may Allaah put blessing into him and make him blessed. And all blessing is from Allaah the Perfect and Most High.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Allaahu Akbar<br />
</strong><strong>Allaah is Greater</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;That He will call you to account for what your hearts have earned.&#8221;</span> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:225].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The day when neither wealth nor children will be of any avail, except he who comes to Allaah with a dean and pure heart.&#8221;</span> [Soorah ash-Shu&#8217;araa 79:88-89].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Indeed, there is a piece of flesh in the body; if it is sound then all the body is sound. However, if it is diseased, then all the body is diseased Truly that is the heart.&#8221;</span> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Rajab (d.795H) &#8211; rahimahullaah -said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">&#8220;So know that the world &#8211; and whatever is above it and below it in the water- will not be corrected except when the actions of its people are all for Allaah. The actions of the body follow on from the actions and intentions of the heart. So when the actions and intentions of the heart are purely for Allaah alone, then it is corrected, and likewise the actions of the body will also be correct. However, if the actions and intentions of the heart are for other than Allaah, then it is corrupted, and likewise the actions of the body will be corrupted in proportion to how much the heart is corrupted.&#8221; [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">And he said: &#8220;Hearts will not be corrected until the ma&#8217;rifah (knowledge and realisation) of Allaah &#8211; being in awe of His greatness, loving Him, fearing Him, hoping in Him, relying and trusting in Him &#8211; is not firmly implanted in them. This is the reality of Tawheed and the meaning of the saying: Laa ilaaha illallaah (that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah). Thus, hearts will not be corrected until Allaah is made the ilaah (deity) to be known, to be loved, feared and hoped in, and that He &#8211; along with this &#8211; becomes the only ilaah (deity) worthy of this, without associating any partner to Him in this.&#8221; [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, we may begin to appreciate the greatness of Allaah &#8211; the Most High&#8217;s &#8211; and being in awe of Him, by considering some narrations regarding what He &#8211; the Most High &#8211; has created.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Indeed I see what you do not see and hear what you do not hear. Heaven has groaned, and it has a right to do so. By Him in Whose Hand is my soul! There is not in the heaven a space equivalent to four fingers, except than an angel has prostrated his forehead to Allaah in it. By Allaah! If you knew what I know, you would laugh little and weep a lot, and you would not take delight in women in their beds, but rather would go to the wilderness and implore Allaah for help.&#8221;</span> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The seven Heavens compared to the Kursee (the Chair) is like a ring which is thrown into a desert. And such is the magnitude of the &#8216;Arsh (the Throne of Allaah) compared with the Kursee.&#8221;</span> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;I have been given permission to relate to you about the Angels of Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; that carry the &#8216;Arsh (Throne). Between one of the Angel&#8217;s ear and shoulder is a distance of seven hundred year journey.&#8221;</span> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Al-Baytul-Mamoor is in the seventh heaven [directly above the Ka &#8216;bah]. Each day seventy thousand angels enter it, and they will not return until the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;</span> [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So: &#8220;the need of the servants for this (type of) knowledge is greater then every other need; end it is the most necessary of all things for them, since there is no life for the hearts, nor any delight, nor any tranquility, except through knowing their Lord, the only One Who deserves to be worshipped, their Creator &#8211; with His Names, His Attributes and His Actions, and that He &#8211; along with all that &#8211; is more beloved to the person than anything else. So man&#8217;s striving is with regards to everything that will draw him nearer to Allaah, to the exclusion of the creation &#8230; So the people who know Allaah the best, are the ones who best follow the way to Him; and know best whet lies at the end of the way.&#8221; [8]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">One may notice that sometimes Allâh refers to Himself by We or Us. This is not an indication of different &#8220;personalities&#8221; or &#8220;forms&#8221; of Allâh as it is the case in the Trinity concept of the Catholic Church. Allâh (God) is One.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The use of <strong>We and Us is always associated with verses referring to Allâh&#8217;s Greatness in His Lordship</strong> e.g. Creation, Power, Might, etc&#8230; This is very common in the Arabic Language. a king issues orders or statements by saying &#8220;We&#8221; or &#8220;Us.&#8221; The power and might of any king is imperfect. Allâh Glorification of Himself is Perfect because He is Perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In His address to mankind by <strong>calling them to direct their worship to Him, Allâh always refers to Himself by I, Me and Myself</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this is well understood in Arabic and also in other Semitic languages. Even in English, there is the &#8220;<strong>Royal We and Us</strong>&#8221; as we hear it from statements by members of the Royal Family in England and elsewhere. To Allâh, however, belongs the Best Examples, Names, Attributes, and Actions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] <strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What should be said concerning Allaah&#8217;s saying: &#8220;Allaah mocks at them…&#8221; [13] and &#8220;Allaah ridicules them…&#8221;, [Surah At-Tawbah: 79] as well as what is similar to that from the <em>Mutashaabihaat</em> (unclear) verses?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Salaf (Predecessors) used to say concerning these ayaat as well as those similar to them: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Leave them as they are stated</strong></span>.&#8221; But they did not mean by this to leave them the way they are without attaching any understanding to them. Rather, they meant by it, to leave them the way they are stated according to their correct understanding, without making comparisons for (the Attributes of Allaah stated in) them (<em><strong>tashbeeh</strong></em>), describing their manner (<em><strong>takyeef</strong></em>), misinterpreting them (<em><strong>ta&#8217;weel</strong></em>) and denying them (<em><strong>ta&#8217;teel</strong></em>). Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;There is nothing whatsoever like Him (in comparison). And He is the All-Hearer, the All- Seer.&#8221;</span></em> [Surah Ash-Shooraa: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this ayah, there is <em><strong>tanzeeh</strong> </em>(negation of all anthropomorphic qualities from Allaah) as well as <em><strong>ithbaat</strong> </em>(affirmation) for two attributes for Himself, which are hearing and seeing. The understanding of this elimination of all similarities to Allaah (tanzeeh) is that we must (also) affirm the attributes that Allaah has described Himself with or the Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, has described Him with, as it befits His grandness, may He be Glorified and Exalted. And we do not say &#8220;how&#8221; that is, such as by saying: &#8220;His hearing is like our hearing and His seeing is like our seeing.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, we do not misinterpret that (i.e. make ta&#8217;weel) as has been done by some of the extremists from the Mu&#8217;tazilah, such that they have misinterpreted Allaah&#8217;s hearing and seeing to be His knowledge. And this is in spite of Allaah&#8217;s describing Himself with knowledge in many other ayaat of the Noble Qur&#8217;aan! Thus, the misinterpretation (ta&#8217;weel) of these individuals of hearing and seeing for knowledge constitutes ta&#8217;teel (denial of Allaah&#8217;s Attributes). The scholars say about this: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The one who commits ta&#8217;teel worships nothing, while the one who commits tajseem worships a statue</strong></span>.&#8221; [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Based on this, we say, concerning the two ayahs mentioned previously in the question, which contain Allaah&#8217;s mocking and ridiculing, that it is a mocking and a ridiculing that is befitting for Allaah. And it is not like that which limited intellects may perceive it to be, from that which has comparisons to the<br />
creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] Surah Al-Baqarah: 15<br />
[14] Translator&#8217;s Note: This is because the one who commits ta&#8217;teel (mu&#8217;attil) denies all of Allaah&#8217;s Attributes, so it is as if he is worshipping nothing. On the other hand, the one who commits tajseem (mujassim) ascribes anthropomorphic qualities to Allaah, for example saying His eyes are like our eyes and His hand is like our hands. So it is like He is worshipping a statue.</p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Allāh is <em>As-Samad</em>” – Shaykh ibn Uthaymeen</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Concerning his statement: &#8220;Allāh is <em>As-Samad</em>&#8220;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a clause of continuation, after He mentioned <em>Al-Ahadai&#8217;yyah</em> (the oneness), he mentioned <em>As-Samadiyyah</em>, and used a definite clause for both, to indicate exclusivity. That is Allah, alone, is <em>As-Samad</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>What is the meaning of <em>As-Samad</em>?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is said that As-Samad means <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He is the Perfect One, in His Knowledge, His Power, His Wisdom, His ’<em>Izzah</em> (Honor and Might), His Sovereignty and in all His Attributes</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also said:<span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em> As-Samad</em> is the one who does not have any cavity</strong></span> &#8211; that is without intestines nor abdomen. That is why it is said: The Angels are <em>Samad</em> because they do not have cavities; they do not eat nor drink. This meaning is related from Ibn ’Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him.[1] And this does not negate the first meaning, because it indicates His self sufficiency from all of His creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is said: <em>As-Samad</em> has the meaning of the <em>Ma’ful</em> form, that is <em>Al-Masmudu ilaihi</em>;He who is betaken to by the creation of their needs, with the meaning that they incline to Him and they reach out for Him, and surrender their needs to Him. So it has the meaning of the everyone is in need of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These interpretations do not contradict one another in relation to Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and as such we say that each of these meanings are affirmed due to the lack of contradiction among them. We interpret it with a comprehensive interpretation; we say As-Samad is the One Who is Perfect in His Attributes, the One whom all His creatures are in need of; they are dependent upon Him. Therefore, the tremendous meaning of the word As-Samad becomes clear to you. He is the One independent of any need from all other than Him, Perfect in all of What is attributed to Him, and that all other than Him is in need of Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If somebody says to you: “Allah rose above the Throne, does His rising above the Throne mean that He is in need of the Throne, such that if the Throne was removed, He would fall?” The answer is no! Never! Because Allah is <em>Samad</em>, perfect without need of the Throne. Rather the Throne, the heavens, the <em>Kursi</em> and all creatures are in need of Allah; He is independent of any need from them. We derive this from the word <em>As-Samad</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If somebody asks: &#8220;<strong>Does Allah eat and drink</strong>?&#8221; I say: Never; because Allah is <em>Samad</em>.” With this, we recognize that the word <em>As-Samad</em> is a word that covers all the perfect Attributes of Allah, and it relates to all the imperfect attributes of the creatures. That is why the are in need of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer&#8221;</strong> (Ash-Shura 42:11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fruit of a person’s faith in this, is that it leads the servant to give Him the utmost reverence, because there is nothing like Him among the creatures. So, exalt this Magnificent Lord that does not have an equal; Or else there will not be any benefit here to your faith that; <strong>&#8220;There is nothing like unto Him&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>When you believe that He is the All-Hearer,</strong></span> you Will soon be cautious regarding every statement that angers Allah, because you know that He hears you, and You fear His punishment. You will soon avoid every statement that involves disobedience of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, because you believe He is the All-Hearer. If this belief does not make this happen to you, know that your belief that Allah as the All-Hearer, is without a doubt, deficient.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you truly believe that Allah is the All-Hearer, you would not say anything except that which pleases Him, particularly when you are talking about His Shari&#8217;ah, as in the case of a Mufti or a scholar. For this is indeed worse. Allah, Glorious is He, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Then who does more wrong than one who invents a lie against Allah, to lead mankind astray without knowledge. Certainly Alla&#8217;h guides not the people who are Zalimz&#8217;n (wrongdoers))</strong> (Al-An’am 8:144)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed this is among the worst forms of wrongdoing. That is why He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Verity! Allah guides not the people who are Zalimin wrongdoers))</strong> (Al-Ahqaf 46:10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This among the punishments for the one who gives religious verdicts without knowledge; that he will not be guided, because he is a wrongdoer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Be warned my brother Muslim, against saying anything that does not please Allah, whether you say that regarding Allah, or otherwise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The fruit of the belief that Allah is the All-Seer</strong></span>, is that you will not do anything that angers Allah, because you know that whenever you are looking at something that is prohibited, while the people do not know it is an unlawful glance, Allah, the Exalted sees this glance, and He knows what is in your heart:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>{Allah knows the fraud of the eyes, and all that the breasts conceal}</strong>(Ghafir 40:19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When you believe in this, it is not possible that you ever do anything that does not please Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should be shy before Allah, as you are shy before the nearest of the people to you, the most respected of them before you. Therefore, if we believe that Allah is the All-Seer, we will soon guard against every action that will lead to angering Allah; otherwise, our faith in that will be deficient.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If somebody points with his finger, his lip, his eye, or head, to something that is unlawful, while the people around him are unaware, Allah, the Exalted, sees him. Whoever believes in Him, then he should beware of this; If we believe in What is implicated by Allah’s Names Attributes, then we would have a complete state steadfastness (Istiqamah) among ourselves. And the One whose Help is sought.</p>

<p>Based upon the hadeeth qudsi ‘O My slaves’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Dharr al-Ghifari (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) is that among the sayings he relates from his Lord (may He be glorified) is that He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O My servants, I have forbidden oppression for Myself and have made it forbidden amongst you, so do not oppress one another. O My servants, all of you are astray except for those I have guided, so seek guidance of Me and I shall guide you, O My servants, all of you are hungry except for those I have fed, so seek food of Me and I shall feed you. O My servants, all of you are naked except for those I have clothed, so seek clothing of Me and I shall clothe you. O My servants, you sin by night and by day, and I forgive all sins, so seek forgiveness of Me and I shall forgive you. O My servants, you will not attain harming Me so as to harm Me, and will not attain benefitting Me so as to benefit Me. O My servants, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to be as pious as the most pious heart of any one man of you, that would not increase My kingdom in anything. O My servants, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to be as wicked as the most wicked heart of any one man of you, that would not decrease My kingdom in anything. O My servants, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to rise up in one place and make a request of Me, and were I to give everyone what he requested, that would not decrease what I have, any more that a needle decreases the sea if put into it. O My servants, it is but your deeds that I reckon up for you and then recompense you for, so let him finds good praise Allah and let him who finds other that blame no one but himself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was related by <strong>Muslim</strong> (also by at-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet ﷺ said: “If you marry a woman or buy a slave, place your hand on her forehead, say ‘<i>bismillaah</i>’ and supplicate for blessing and say:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center"><big><b>اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَ</b><b>سْأَلُكَ مِنْ خَيْرِهَا وَخَيْرِ مَا جَبَلْتَهَا عَلَيْهِ وَأَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّهَا وَشَرِّ مَا جَبَلْتَهَا عَلَيْهِ</b></big></p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center">(O Allaah, indeed I ask You for the good in her and the good characteristics that You created in her, and I seek refuge in You from the evil in her and the evil characteristics that You created in her)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if you buy a camel, place your hand on top of its hump and say the same.”<a>[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This <i>hadeeth</i> has evidence that Allaah is the Creator of good and evil, contrary to those – such as the Mu`tazilah and others – who hold that evil is not from His creation تبارك وتعالى. <strong>There is nothing in Allaah’s being Creator of evil that contradicts His Perfection تعالى, rather it is from His Perfection تبارك وتعالى</strong>. Details of that are present in comprehensive volumes, one of the best being the book<i>Shifaa ul-`aleel fi l-qadhaa.i wa l-qadari wa tta`leel</i> by Ibn ul-Qayyim, so look through it if you wish.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And is this supplication legislated when buying something like a car? My answer is: yes, due to the good that is hoped from it and the evil that is feared from it.”</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>The following is Translated &amp; Compiled by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 – Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, Allaah is not ashamed to set forth a parable</span></strong>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Baqarah: 26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 – What is mentioned in the hadeeth of Ya’ala bin Umayyah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> saw a man bathing at an open place where there was no partitioning and without a wrapping garment, so the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> climbed the <em>Mimbar</em>, and he praised Allaah and glorified Him and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘Indeed Allaah <em>– Azza wa Jal –</em> is The Shy One, The One who Conceals, He loves modesty and covering up, so if one of you bathes (outside) then he should cover up.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Narrated by Abu Dawood and Nisaa’ee – authenticated by Albaani in ‘Irwa’ no. 2335]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – The hadeeth of Salman <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said: The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘Indeed your Lord <em>– Tabaaraka wa Ta’ala –</em> is The Shy One, The Generous, Allaah is Shy from His slave if the slave raises his hands towards Him, that He would return them without anything.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Narrated by Abu Dawood, Tirmidhi and Ibn Maajah – authenticated by Albaani in ‘Irwa’ no. 2335]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 – The author Muhammad al-Hamood an-Najdi said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Know – may Allaah have mercy upon me and you – that the greatest modesty which is necessary to have is with Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>, He Who fluctuates His blessings and His virtue day and night. We cannot do without Him even for a blink of an eye. We are under His Hearing and Sight, and nothing of our condition, statements and actions is absent from Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just like Allaah <em>–Azza wa Jal-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Whatever you (O Muhammad) may be doing, and whatever portion you may be reciting from the Qur’aan, – and whatever deed you (mankind) may be doing (good or evil), We are Witness thereof, when you are doing it. And nothing is hidden from your Lord (so much as) the weight of an atom on the earth or in the heaven. Not what is less than that or what is greater than that but is (written) in a Clear Record</span>.</strong> &gt;&gt; [Yunus: 61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Summarised from ‘an-Nahaj al-Asma’ fee Sharh ‘Asmaa Allaah al-Hussna 3/99-]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5  – Shaykh Muhammad Khaleel Haraas <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Name of Allaah Ta’ala <em>al-Hayyee</em> (The Shy One) is a Name which is appropriate to Him, and it is not like the <em>Hayya</em> (Modesty) of the creation, which is a change and effect, which seizes a person when he is frightened by that which brings him shame or fault.  Rather it is leaving that which is not appropriate with His abundant Mercy and His perfect Generosity and Kindness, and His great Pardoning and His Gentleness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the slave of Allaah openly sins even though modesty is the thing that he is in most need of, and modesty is the weakest thing he has, and he uses Allaah’s blessings to sin.  However, Allaah <em>– Subhanahu–</em> along with His perfection in not needing anything whatsoever and His complete ability over modesty, is shy from the slave from removing his veil and humiliating him, so Allaah covers up the slave with that which disguises him from the means of covering up, then after that Allaah pardons his sins and forgives them.  Just like the hadeeth of Ibn Umar <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">‘Indeed Allaah comes close to the believer, and covers him then asks him, between Himself and the slave: Did you not do such and such, on such and such day? Until the slave of Allaah acknowledges his sins, and is certain that he will definitely be destroyed and Allaah says to him: I covered up your sins in the <em>Dunyaa</em> and today I will forgive them for you.’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Narrated by Bukhari and Muslim &#8211; Taken from ‘an-Nahaj al-Asma’ fee Sharh ‘Asmaa Allaah al-Hussna 3/103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allāh , may His Praise and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taken from Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah of Shaykh Al-Albaani<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albani refutes this doubt by researching the following Ahadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of ‘Aa’ishah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anha</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘If the Shaytan comes to one of you and says: ‘Who created you?’ say ‘Allaah.’ Then he will say: who created Allaah? So if one of you finds this situation then say: ‘I have believed in Allaah and His Messengers.’ This doubt will then leave you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Ahmad graded Hasan by Albani [saheehah 116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration also in Saheehah (Hadeeth No.117), the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said: ‘The Shaytan comes to one of you and says: ‘Who created this? Who created that? Who created this?Until he says who created your lord? So if this reaches you then seek refuge in Allaah and it will end.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhari, Muslim and Ibn Sunni.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the wording narrated by Abu Hurairah, the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The people will question one another so much that one of them will say: So Allaah created the creation, then who created Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em>? So if they say this, then say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَد ٌ ,اللَّهُ الصَّمَد ُ, لَمْ يَلِدْ وَلَمْ يُولَد ْ, وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُ كُفُوًاأَحَدٌالإخلاص: ١ – ٤</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Say: He is Allaah, The One. <em>Allaahus-Samad</em>, He does not beget nor was he begotten, and there is none like unto Him. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he should spittle to his left three times and seek refuge from the Shaytan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Abu Dawood &amp; Ibn Sunni and graded Hasan by Albani.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Shaykh Albani comments by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fiqh al-Hadeeth:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These authentic Ahadeeth indicate that it is obligatory for the one Shaytan whispers to, by saying ‘who created Allaah?’, that he turns away from debating with him and responds with what wasmentioned in the previous Ahadeeth, the summary of which is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have believed in Allaah and His Messengers. ‘He isAllaah, The One, <em>Allaahus-Samad</em>, He does not beget nor was He begotten, and there is none like unto Him.’ Then he should spittle to his left three times and seek refuge from the Shaytan. This (then) stops him from being carried away by the whisperings of Shaytan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I truly believe that whoever does this sincerely, out of obedience to Allaah and His Messenger, these whisperings will definitely leave him and his Shaytan will be defeated due to the saying of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>: ‘Then this doubt will leave you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This noble prophetic teaching is more beneficial and more definitive against whisperings than intellectual debate in this issue, since it is very rare that such a debate will be beneficial. What is sad is that the majority of people are neglectful of this noble prophetic teaching! So take heed O Muslims, learn the Sunnah of your Prophet and implement it, in it is cure and honour for you.’</p>

Abomination of saying: &#8220;Forgive me if you wish, O Allah!&#8221;</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1743.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">You must not supplicate: `O Allah! forgive me if You wish; O Allah bestow mercy on me if You wish.&#8217; But beg from Allah with certitude for no one has the power to compel Allah.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration of Muslim is: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">A supplication should be made in full confidence and one should persistently express his desire (before Allah) in his supplication, for no bounty is too great for Allah to bestow (upon his slaves).</span>&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1744.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">When one of you supplicates, let him be decisive and he should not say: `O Allah, bestow upon me such and such if You wish&#8217;, because no one has the power to compel Him</span>.&#8221;<br />

Prohibition of Swearing in the name of anything besides Allah</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1707.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#000080;">Allah has prohibited you from taking an oath by your fathers. He who must take an oath, may do so by swearing in the Name of Allah or he should remain silent.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1708.</b> `Abdur-Rahman bin Samurah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Swear neither by the name of Taghut (i.e., false deities, false leaders, etc.) nor by your fathers.</span>&#8221;<br />

[Abu Dawud with authentic Isnad].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1710.</b> Buraidah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">If anyone swears that in such and such case he will be free from Islam and afterwards he turns out to be a liar, he will be as he has sworn; but if he is speaking the truth, he will not revert safely to Islam.</span>&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1711.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) said: I heard a man saying: &#8220;No, by the Ka`bah.&#8221; I admonished him: &#8220;Do not swear by any thing besides Allah, for I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying, `<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who swears by anyone or anything other than Allah, has indeed committed an act of Kufr or Shirk&#8217;</span>.&#8221;<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">In this book, we present the classical treatise on Creed of Imaam Ibn Qudaamah Al-Maqdisee, rahimahullaah, known as Lum&#8217;at-ul-&#8216;Itiqaad, which is studied all over the Muslim world. Imaam Muhammad bin Saalih Al-&#8216;Uthaimeen, rahimahullaah, has provided an in depth explanation for the points touched on by the author in a clear and simple manner. Furthermore, the narrations mentioned in the book have been verified and lengthy and extensive footnotes have been provided to make this book a valuable source of reference.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Muhammad bin Saalih Al-&#8216;Uthaimeen said in his introduction to this book: &#8216;This is a brief commentary of the book &#8216;Lum’at-ul-‘Itiqaad”, written by Abu Muhammad ‘Abdullaah bin Ahmad Ibn Qudaamah Al-Maqdisee (rahimahullaah), who was born in Sha’baan in 541H in a village from the districts of Nablis (present-day Palestine) and who died on the day of ‘Eed-ul-Fitr in 620H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this book, the author (rahimahullaah) gathered together the main points of the Islaamic Creed (‘Aqeedah). For this reason, the Board of the Educational Institutes assigned this book to be studied and taught during the second semester of the first year of study, so that it may serve as a pillar upon which one can establish his Creed at this stage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because I saw the importance of this book in terms of the topics it touches upon, its methodology and the lack of there being any explanation for it, I became determined, while seeking assistance from Allaah and hoping that He grant me correctness in intention and action, to put forth some words on it, in the attempt to clarify its ambiguous parts, explain its meanings and bring to light its main points.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No doubt this book is of great importance for the Muslim with regard to establishing the correct Creed. This book is deserving of being taught and studied so that it may serve as a foundation for both the students of knowledge and the common Muslims. The topics touched upon by the author relate to the authentic Creed and Methodology, which all Muslims are obligated to have knowledge of. Consequently, we encourage everyone to purchase a copy of this magnificent book.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Selected pearls from the books of the People of Knowledge and Fiqh</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The consensus (amongst Ahlus Sunnah) which has been conveyed regarding three principles related to Allah&#8217;s Attributes</span></p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;"><strong>The First Principle:</strong> Regarding Allah the Most High&#8217;s Attributes, there is no place for the intellect (in deriving) them.</p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh as-Sijzee mentioned in his book &#8220;Ar-Radd &#8216;ala man Ankara al-Harf wa as-Sawt&#8221;, pg. 121:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;The Imaams have agreed that the Attributes are not derived except by way of refrainment&#8221; (i.e.refraining from affirming an Attribute for Allah until there is proof).</span></p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second Principle:</strong> Belief in the Attributes of Allah is by affirming their literal meaning not figurative.</p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn &#8216;Abdil Barr mentioned in his book &#8220;at-Tamheed&#8221;, 145/7:</p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;There is a consensus amongst Ahlus Sunnah that the Attributes (of Allah) are affirmed, all of them, which have come in the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah and believing in them and understanding them according to their apparent meaning, not figuratively, except that they (Ahlus Sunnah) do not establish the &#8216;how&#8217; of these Attributes nor do they establish or determine the reality of them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;">However, Ahlul Bid&#8217;ah, the Jahmiyyah and Mu&#8217;tazilah &#8211; all of them &#8211; and the Khawaarij deny them (Allah&#8217;s Attributes) and they do not understand any of them according to their literal meaning.</p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;">Those who deny Allah&#8217;s Attributes also claim that whoever affirms them, then he is one who has likened Allah to His creation and conversely, those who do so are considered from amongst the people who negate the One Who is worshipped according to those who affirm Allah&#8217;s Attributes.</p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;">The &#8216;Allaamah al-Maqreezee  mentioned in his book &#8220;al-Muwaa&#8217;idh wal I&#8217;tibaar bi Dhikr al-Khutat wal Aathaar&#8221;, 188/4:</p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And all of them (Ahlus Sunnah) have narrated understanding the Attributes as they have come.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;"><strong>The Third Principle:</strong> The literal meaning texts of the Attributes are known to us in light of their linguistic meaning and they are unknown to us with regards to the &#8216;how&#8217; of these Attributes.</p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;">Al-Imaam adh-Dhahabee mentioned in his book &#8220;al-&#8216;Arsh&#8221;, 195/1 whilst commenting on the statement of Imaam Maalik: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The ascension of Allah on His Throne is not unknown (its known linguistically) and the &#8216;how&#8217; of it is incomprehensible&#8221;:</span></p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And what Imaam Maalik said is what the texts have come with and this is what ALL of the Salaf were upon.&#8221;</span></p>
