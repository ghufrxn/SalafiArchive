<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Eight Event</strong></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Allāh Judges Creation</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabic word commonly used here, مُحَاسَبَة (<em>muḥāsabah</em>) or حِسَاب (<em>ḥisāb</em>), “judging,” “reckoning,” or “taking to account” is when people will be called to recollect, admit, and be judged on the Day of Resurrection for the actions they did in this life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As far religious evidence for this event, it is confirmed by the Qur&#8217;aan, the Sunnah, the consensus of mainstream Muslims, and even suggested by one’s intellect.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Qur&#8217;aan, Allah (تعالى) says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ إِلَيْنَا إِيَابَهُمْ  ثُمَّ إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا حِسَابَهُم</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Certainly, to us is their return, then certainly upon us is their reckoning</span>.[Sūrah al-Ghāshiyah, 88:25-26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">فَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِيَ كِتَابَهُ بِيَمِينِهِ فَسَوْفَ يُحَاسَبُ حِسَابًا يَسِيرًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Then as for he who is given his record in his right hand, he will be judged with an easy reckoning.</span> [Sūrah al-Inshiqāq, 84:7-8]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Sunnah, numerous ḥadīth have been authentically reported from the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) that Allah will judge his creations. For example, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) used to say in some of his prayers:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُمَّ حَاسِبْنِي حِسَابًا يَسِيْرًا </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">Oh Allah, call me to account with an easy reckoning.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Upon hearing this, ‘Āishah (رضي الله عنها) asked, “What is an easy reckoning?” He answered:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَنْ يَنْظُرَ فِي كِتَابِهِ فَيَتَجَاوَزُ عَنْهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>That he looks into his book but pardons him (or finds in his book that he has been pardoned)</em>.</span>[86]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the consensus among mainstream Muslims, the entire nation of believers has always agreed that Allah will judge creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the intellect, it is understood that Allah will judge us because we have been made responsible for actions: obligated to do some, obligated to avoid some, and obligated to hold certain beliefs. Intellect and wisdom dictates that anyone made responsible for something will be held accountable for it and judged for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">There are, however, some people who will be exempt from being judged;</span></strong> they will be allowed to enter Paradise without judgment or punishment. This has been confirmed in “Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī” and “Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim.” The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">عُرِضَتْ عَلَيَّ الأُمَمُ فَأَخَذَ النَّبِيُّ يَمُرُّ مَعَهُ الأُمَّةُ وَالنَّبِيُّ يَمُرُّ مَعَهُ النَّفَرُ وَالنَّبِيُّ يَمُرُّ</span><span style="color:#000000;">مَعَهُ الْعَشَرَةُ وَالنَّبِيُّ يَمُرُّ مَعَهُ الْخَمْسَةُ وَالنَّبِيُّ يَمُرُّ وَحْدَهُ ، فَنَظَرْتُ فَإِذَا سَوَادٌ كَثِيرٌ </span><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْتُ : يَا جِبْرِيلُ هَؤُلاءِ أُمَّتِي ؟ قَالَ : لا وَلَكِنْ انْظُرْ إِلَى الأُفُقِ ، فَنَظَرْتُ فَإِذَا سَوَادٌ </span><span style="color:#000000;">كَثِيرٌ ، قَالَ : هَؤُلاءِ أُمَّتُكَ وَهَؤُلاءِ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا قُدَّامَهُمْ لا حِسَابَ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلا عَذَابَ ، </span><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْتُ : وَلِمَ ؟ قَالَ : كَانُوا لا يَكْتَوُونَ وَلا يَسْتَرْقُونَ وَلا يَتَطَيَّرُونَ وَعَلَى رَبِّهِمْ </span><span style="color:#000000;">يَتَوَكَّلُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">I was shown the nations (of prophets) and I saw a prophet with an entire nation with him, a prophet with only a single follower, a prophet with ten followers, a prophet with five, and a prophet with none. I then saw a huge crowd and asked, “Oh (Angel) Gabriel, is this my nation?” to which he replied, “No, but look to the horizon.” I then looked and saw a huge nation (of followers). Gabriel said, “This is your nation and in front of them are seventy thousand who will have no judgment and no punishment.” I asked, “Why?” He answered, “They did not practice cauterization, did not seek ruqyá (incantations, healings with Qur&#8217;aan recitations), did not believe in good or bad omens, and they relied exclusively on their Lord.”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After hearing this, a companion named ‘Ukkāshah Ibn Miḥṣan stood and said to the prophet, “Pray to Allah to make me one of those.” So the prophet said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ مِنْهُمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">Oh Allah, make him one of them.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then another man stood and he too asked, “Pray to Allah to make me one of them,” but the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) replied:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">سَبَقَكَ بِهَا عُكَّاشَةُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">‘Ukkāshah beat you to it.</span></em> [Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is even a narration recorded by Imam Aḥmad (5/280, 281) in which these seventy thousand will each have with them an additional seventy thousand, and all of them (70,000 x 70,000) will enter Paradise without judgment or punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">The creations to be judged will also include the Jinn</span></strong>, the creatures created by Allah that are unseen by mankind, because they too are held accountable for their beliefs and actions. So like a human, a disbelieving Jinn will enter the fire:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قَالَ ادْخُلُوا فِي أُمَمٍ قَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِكُم مِّنَ الْجِنِّ وَالإِنسِ فِي النَّارِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Allah) will say, “Enter among nations which had passed on before you of Jinn and mankind into the fire.”</span> [Sūrah al-A’rāf, 7:38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…and a believing Jinn will enter Paradise according to the opinion of most scholars, and this position is correct as indicated by the statement of Allah about two particular gardens given to those who will enter paradise:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فِيهِنَّ قَاصِرَاتُ الطَّرْفِ لَمْ يَطْمِثْهُنَّ إِنسٌ قَبْلَهُمْ وَلا جَانٌّ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">In them are women limiting (their) glances, untouched before them by man or Jinn. </span>[Sūrah al-Raḥmān, 55:56]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Here is a question: Will animals be judged and held accountable? </strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer is as far as judging between them to establish justice and fairness for what occurred between them, then yes, they will be judged because the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَتُؤَدُّنَّ الْحُقُوقَ إِلَى أَهْلِهَا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ حَتَّى يُقَادَ لِلشَّاةِ الْجَلْحَاءِ مِنْ الشَّاةِ الْقَرْنَاءِ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">The rights of justice will be established among those who deserve them on the Day of Resurrection so much so that a ram without horns will be given its rights taken from it by a ram with horns.</span> </em>[Recorded by Muslim.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But again, this is only for ensuring that complete fairness and justice is finally established. As far as being judged for actions they were responsible for carrying out, then no, animals will not be held accountable as they are not responsible for such actions. They will have neither reward nor punishment.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">A Believer’s Judgment</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Describing the manner in which Allah will judge a believer and take him to account, Ibn ‘Umar (رضي الله عنهما) narrated that the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) described the private counsel to be held between a true believer and his Lord:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُدْنِي الْمُؤْمِنَ فَيَضَعُ عَلَيْهِ كَنَفَهُ وَيَسْتُرُهُ ، فَيَقُولُ : أَتَعْرِفُ ذَنْبَ كَذَا أَتَعْرِفُ </span><span style="color:#000000;">ذَنْبَ كَذَا ؟ فَيَقُولُ : نَعَمْ أَيْ رَبِّ ، حَتَّى إِذَا قَرَّرَهُ بِذُنُوبِهِ وَرَأَى فِي نَفْسِهِ أَنَّهُ هَلَكَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">قَالَ : سَتَرْتُهَا عَلَيْكَ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَأَنَا أَغْفِرُهَا لَكَ الْيَوْمَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">Allah will draw a believer close, placing him under his care and screening him. Allah will say to him, “Do you remember this sin and that sin?” The person will answer, “Yes, my Lord.” After he is made to confess all of his sins and he sincerely believes he is ruined, Allah will say, “I concealed them for you in life and I forgive you for them today.”</span></em> [Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While speaking with his servant, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) will screen him so that no one will see or hear him during their private conversation. This is a way of Allah (عزّ وجلّ) favoring and showing kindness to a true believer in him. When people make someone confess their crimes publicly in front of everyone, even if they pardon the individual for them, there is still an aspect of scandal and humiliation that remains. Yet if such proceedings were held privately, then this would be a better way of concealing and protecting people from that.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">A Disbeliever’s Judgment</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Describing a disbeliever’s judgment, Ibn Taymiyyah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;As for a disbeliever, they will not be judged in the same manner as someone who has his good and bad deeds weighed. This is because those who disbelieve in Allah have no good deeds at all. Still, their deeds will be counted and they will be held responsible for them; they will be made to confess them and will be humiliated.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of this has come in the same ḥadīth of Ibn ‘Umar previously mentioned in which the prophet spoke about how Allah will conceal a believer and speak privately with him. The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) then said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَمَّا الْكُفَّارُ وَالْمُنَافِقُونَ فَيُنَادَى بِهِمْ عَلَى رُءُوسِ الْخَلائِقِ : هَؤُلاءِ الَّذِينَ كَذَبُوا عَلَى اللَّهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">But as for the disbelievers and hypocrites, they will be publicly called out in front of all creation and it will be announced, “These are the ones who lied against Allah.”</span> </em>[Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in “Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim,” Abū Hurayrah narrated that the messenger of Allah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَيَلْقَى الْعَبْدَ فَيَقُولُ : أَيْ فُلْ أَلَمْ أُكْرِمْكَ وَأُسَوِّدْكَ وَأُزَوِّجْكَ وَأُسَخِّرْ لَكَ الْخَيْلَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَالإِبِلَ وَأَذَرْكَ تَرْأَسُ وَتَرْبَعُ ؟ فَيَقُولُ : بَلَى ، قَالَ : فَيَقُولُ : أَفَظَنَنْتَ أَنَّكَ مُلاقِيَّ ؟ </span><span style="color:#000000;">فَيَقُولُ : لا ، فَيَقُولُ : فَإِنِّي أَنْسَاكَ كَمَا نَسِيتَنِي ،</span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ يَلْقَى الثَّانِيَ فَيَقُولُ : أَيْ فُلْ أَلَمْ أُكْرِمْكَ وَأُسَوِّدْكَ وَأُزَوِّجْكَ وَأُسَخِّرْ لَكَ الْخَيْلَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَالإِبِلَ وَأَذَرْكَ تَرْأَسُ وَتَرْبَعُ ؟ فَيَقُولُ.: بَلَى أَيْ رَبِّ ، فَيَقُولُ : أَفَظَنَنْتَ أَنَّكَ مُلاقِيَّ ؟ </span><span style="color:#000000;">فَيَقُولُ : لا ، فَيَقُولُ : فَإِنِّي أَنْسَاكَ كَمَا نَسِيتَنِي ، </span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ يَلْقَى الثَّالِثَ ، فَيَقُولُ لَهُ مِثْلَ ذَلِكَ ، فَيَقُولُ : يَا رَبِّ آمَنْتُ بِكَ وَبِكِتَابِكَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَبِرُسُلِكَ وَصَلَّيْتُ وَصُمْتُ وَتَصَدَّقْتُ وَيُثْنِي بِخَيْرٍ مَا اسْتَطَاعَ ، فَيَقُولُ : هَاهُنَا إِذًا ،</span><span style="color:#000000;">قَالَ : ثُمَّ : يُقَالُ لَهُ : الآنَ نَبْعَثُ شَاهِدَنَا عَلَيْكَ ، وَيَتَفَكَّرُ فِي نَفْسِهِ مَنْ ذَا الَّذِي يَشْهَدُ </span><span style="color:#000000;">عَلَيَّ ، فَيُخْتَمُ عَلَى فِيهِ ، وَيُقَالُ لِفَخِذِهِ وَلَحْمِهِ وَعِظَامِهِ : انْطِقِي ، فَتَنْطِقُ فَخِذُهُ </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَحْمُهُ وَعِظَامُهُ بِعَمَلِهِ ، وَذَلِكَ لِيُعْذِرَ مِنْ نَفْسِهِ وَذَلِكَ الْمُنَافِقُ وَذَلِكَ الَّذِي يَسْخَطُ </span><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">Allah will meet with a servant, asking, “Oh so-and-so, did I not honor you, give you authority, give you a spouse, give you control over horses and camels, and made you a leader (or allowed you to live a comfortable life)?” The person will reply, “You did.” Allah will ask him, “Did you think you would ever meet me?” and he will answer, “No.” So Allah will say, “Then I will forget you as you forgot me.”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">Then Allah will meet with a second person and ask, “Oh so-and-so, did I not honor you, give you authority, give you a spouse, give you control over horses and camels, and made you a leader (or allowed you to live a comfortable life)?” The person will reply, “You did, my Lord.” Allah will ask him, “Did you think you would ever meet me?” and he will answer, “No.” So Allah will say, “Then I will forget you as you forgot me.”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">Allah will then meet with a third person and will ask him similarly as he did with the others, but this person will say, “My Lord, I believed in you, in your book, and in your messengers. I prayed, fasted, and gave charity.” And he will continue praising the good (he did) as much as he can. Allah will say, “(Stop) then. Now we will bring forth our witness against you.” The person will think to himself about who this witness could be to testify against him. His mouth will then be sealed and his legs, his flesh and bones will be told, “Speak.” His legs, flesh, and bones will then speak about what he did. That is the person who will have no excuse for himself; that is the hypocrite, and that is the one with whom Allah is angry.</span></em> [Recorded by Muslim.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the Day of Judgment, the first people to be judged will be this nation, the Muslims who followed Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم), based on the prophet’s statement:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">نَحْنُ الآخِرُوْنَ السَّابِقُوْنَ يَوْمَ القِيَامَةِ المَقْضِيُّ بَيْنَهُمْ قَبْلَ الخَلائِقِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">We are the last ones (in this life) but the first ones on the Day of Resurrection to have their accounts settled before the rest of creation.</span></em> [94]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, Ibn ‘Abbās (رضي الله عنهما) narrated that the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">نَحْنُ آخِرُ الأُمَمِ وَأَوَّلُ مَنْ يُحَاسَبُ ، يُقَالُ : أَيْنَ الأُمَّةُ الأُمِّيَّةُ وَنَبِيُّهَا ؟ فَنَحْنُ الآخِرُونَ الأَوَّلُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">We are the last religious nation (in this life) but the first to be judged. It will be said, “Where is the illiterate nation and its prophet?” So we are the last ones yet the first ones</span></em>.[95]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first thing for which a worshipper of Allah will be judged and called to account regarding the rights of Allah will be his prayer based on the statement of the prophet :(صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَوَّلُ مَا يُحَاسَبُ بِهِ الْعَبْدُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ الصَلاة ، فَإِنْ صَلُحَتْ صَلُحَ سَائِرُ عَمَلِهِ ،  وَإِنْ فَسَدَتْ فَسَدَ سَائِرُ عَمَلِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>The first thing for which a worshipper will be judged on the Day of Resurrection will be prayer. If it is sound, the rest of his deeds will be sound, but if it is bad, the rest of his deeds will be bad</em>.</span> [96]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the first crimes to be judged regarding the rights of other people will be those pertaining to bloodshed as he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَوَّلَ مَا يُقْضَى بَيْنَ النَّاسِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فِي الدِّمَاءِ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">The first thing to be settled between people on the Day of Resurrection will be (crimes of) bloodshed.</span></em>[97]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because prayer is the best bodily act of worship related to the rights of Allah, and bloodshed is the greatest violation of communal rights related to mankind.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[86] Recorded by Aḥmad (6/48) and Ibn Abī ‘Āṣim in “<em>Kitāb al-Sunnah</em>” (no. 885). al-Albānī said it is authentic in his checking of “<em>Kitāb al-Sunnah</em>” (2/429).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[94] Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim. In a similar ḥadīth, also recorded by them both, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">نَحْنُ الآخِرُونَ السَّابِقُونَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ مِنْ قَبْلِنَا وَأُوتِينَاهُ مِنْ بَعْدِهِمْ ، فَهَذَا الْيَوْمُ الَّذِي اخْتَلَفُوا فِيهِ فَهَدَانَا اللَّهُ فَغَدًا لِلْيَهُودِ وَبَعْدَ غَدٍ لِلنَّصَارَى</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">We are the last ones but the first ones on the Day of Resurrection. They were given the scripture before us and we were given it after them. So this is the day they differed about, but Allah has guided us. So tomorrow is for the Jews, and the day after is for the Christians.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[95] Recorded by Ibn Mājah, Aḥmad, and al-Bayhaqī. al-Albānī said it is authentic in “<em>Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan Ibn Mājah</em>” (no. 3463).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[96] Recorded by al-Tirmidhī, al-Nasāī, Ibn Mājah, and al-Ṭabarānī. The text is from al-Ṭabarānī and al-Albānī said it is authentic in “<em>Ṣaḥīḥ al-Targhīb wal-Tarhīb</em>” (1/185).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Seventh Event</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Books of Deeds are Distributed</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People’s books of deeds will be distributed, open for them to read. An individual’s book of deeds is the register with every action he did in life written inside. These deeds are being written now by the angels entrusted with recording the actions of all the children of Adam. Allah (تعالى) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِنَّ عَلَيْكُمْ لَحَافِظِينَ كِرَامًا كَاتِبِينَ يَعْلَمُونَ مَا تَفْعَلُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And indeed, (appointed) over you are keepers, honorable recorders. They know whatever you do.</span> [Surah al-Isrā, 82:10-12][69]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These angels record in a book everything a person does because they are always with him. And on the Day of Resurrection, Allah will bring forth this book, making it known to the person as he says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَكُلَّ إِنسَانٍ أَلْزَمْنَاهُ طَائِرَهُ فِي عُنُقِهِ وَنُخْرِجُ لَهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ كِتَابًا يَلْقَاهُ مَنشُورًا </span><span style="color:#000000;">اقْرَأْ كِتَابَكَ كَفَى بِنَفْسِكَ الْيَوْمَ عَلَيْكَ حَسِيبًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Every person, we have imposed his fate upon his neck. And we will produce for him, on the Day of Resurrection, a record which he will find spread open. (It will be said to him,) “Read your book. You are sufficient today as a reckoner against yourself. </span>[Surah al-Isrā, 17:13-14.]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Recording of Good Deeds</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Both good deeds and bad deeds are written in these books. As for the good deeds, the actions a person actually does are recorded, as are his good intentions and even those deeds he intends to do but may not have actually done them. So there are three types of rewarded behavior: 1) good deeds performed, 2) good intentions, and 3) good deeds intended but not performed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>1. Good Deeds:</strong> </span>It is clear that a person’s good deeds are written.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>2. Good Intentions:</strong></span> Intending to do a good deed is also recorded in a person’s favor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But a reward is given for only the intention and not necessarily the action intended. This is based on the hadith of a rich man who spends his wealth in charity and a poor man who says, “<strong>If I had wealth, I would do what he does</strong>.” About these two, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَهُوَ بِنِيَّتِهِ فَأَجْرُهُمَا سَوَاءٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>He is rewarded for his intention, and the reward is the same for both</em>.</span>[71]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So both the rich and poor are equally rewarded in intention but not in action. This is also confirmed by the narration in which the poor immigrants of Medina complained to the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) saying, “Oh messenger of Allah, the wealthy have overtaken us (in reward).” The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said (as a way to catch up with the wealthy in rewards):</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">تُسَبِّحُونَ وَتُكَبِّرُونَ وَتَحْمَدُونَ دُبُرَ كُلِّ صَلاةٍ ثَلاثًا وَثَلاثِينَ مَرَّة</span></h2>
<p><em><span style="color:#808000;">Glorify Allah, declare his greatness, and thank him after each prayer thirty-three times.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But when this advice reached the wealthy, they too did likewise. So the poor returned, complaining to the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) again that the rich are now doing both— giving charity and praising Allah after the prayers. He (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) then said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ذَلِكَ فَضْلُ اللَّهِ يُؤْتِهِ مَنْ يَشَاءُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>That is the favor of Allah he gives to whom he wishes. </em></span>[Recorded by al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet did not reply the second time that the poor, despite their sincere intentions, would have the same reward as the rich in deed. And this is fair because a man who does not perform a certain deed is not the same as the one who actually does it, yet he may still get a similar reward for the intention alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>3. Good Deeds Intended but Not Performed:</strong> </span>The third type of rewarded behavior which a person may find written in his book of deeds is the actions he may sincerely intend to do but did not actually do them. The difference between this type and the second is that for these intentions, he does receive a reward for the action itself. These are the deeds that an individual may intend to do and perhaps he does as much as he is able to of such deed. Then something prevents him from completing the deed. In such case, a full good deed will be recorded based on the statement of Allah:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يَخْرُجْ مِن بَيْتِهِ مُهَاجِرًا إِلَى اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ ثُمَّ يُدْرِكْهُ الْمَوْتُ فَقَدْ وَقَعَ أَجْرُهُ عَلَى اللَّهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever leaves his home as an emigrant to Allah and his messenger and then death overtakes him, his reward has already become incumbent upon Allah.</span>[Surah al-Nisa, 4:100]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this is also good news for students of religious knowledge. For example, if someone intends to study religious knowledge for the purpose of benefiting others with such information, defending the Sunnah of the messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) and spreading Allah’s religion throughout the earth, yet he is unable to complete his studies—perhaps he dies in the process, for example—he will still have those good deeds recorded for him and he will achieve its rewards.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even if a person has a habit of performing a particular good deed but for some reason he is unable to do it under certain circumstances, he still has the good deed recorded for him. The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا مَرِضَ الْعَبْدُ أَوْ سَافَرَ كُتِبَ لَهُ مِثْلُ مَا كَانَ يَعْمَلُ مُقِيمًا صَحِيحًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>When a servant becomes sick or travels, whatever he used to do while residing at home or healthy will still be recorded for him.</em></span> [Recorded by al-Bukhari]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Recording of Bad Deeds</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for bad deeds, they are written against a person if: 1) he actually does a bad deed, 2) he intends and hopes to do the bad deed, and 3) he intends to do the bad deed and tries to commit it but for some reason he is unable to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>1. Bad Deeds:</strong></span> This is clear; if someone does a bad deed, he has it recorded against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>2. Bad Intentions:</strong> </span>Sins an individual intends or hopes to do are also written against him. But like good intentions, he has a bad deed recorded for the intention and not a full bad deed for the action intended. The proof of this is in the same hadith mentioned about good intentions. The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) spoke about a person Allah had provided wealth but no knowledge so that he aimlessly wasted his wealth. A person Allah had given neither wealth nor knowledge then said, “If I had wealth, I would do what he does,” admiring the former’s wasteful spending. So the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَهُوَ بِنِيَّتِهِ فَوِزْرُهُمَا سَوَاءٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>He is recorded for his intention, and the sin is the same for both of them.</em></span> [75]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>As for an individual intending to do a bad deed but refrains from it, this is of three types:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">1) If the person does not do the deed because he was unable though he tried to do it, he is just like a person who actually did the bad deed,</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">2) If he refrains from doing the deed for the sake of Allah, he is rewarded, and</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">3) If he simply decides not to do it (but not for the sake of Allah) or even if committing the deed did not seriously cross his mind, then he has neither sin nor reward written for him.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>3. Bad Deeds Intended but Not Performed:</strong> </span>These are also recorded against a person as complete bad deeds if the person tried his utmost to do them based on the statement (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) of the prophet:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ذَا تَوَاجَهَ الْمُسْلِمَانِ بِسَيْفَيْهِمَا فَكِلاهُمَا مِنْ أَهْلِ النَّارِ</span></h2>
<p><span style="color:#808000;"><em>If two Muslims face off with their swords (i.e. if they fight to the death), both of them are people of the fire.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After hearing this, the companions asked, “Messenger of Allah, we understand about the killer, but why the one killed too?” He replied:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّهُ أَرَادَ قَتْلَ صَاحِبِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>He also wanted to kill his opponent.</em></span>[Recorded by al-Bukhari and Muslim.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, if someone wanted to drink alcohol but something happened so that he was unable to do it, it is still recorded against him as a bad deed because he tried as much as he could to commit it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To conclude this topic we must know that Allah rewards good deeds with rewards greater than the original good deed, but He recompenses a bad deed only equivalent to the original sin; He says (تعالى) :</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَن جَاءَ بِالْحَسَنَةِ فَلَهُ عَشْرُ أَمْثَالِهَا وَمَن جَاءَ بِالسَّيِّئَةِ فَلا يُجْزَى إِلاَّ مِثْلَهَا وَهُمْ لا يُظْلَمُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>Whoever comes (on the Day of Judgment) with a good deed will have ten times the like thereof, and whoever comes with an evil deed will not be recompensed except the like thereof, and they will not be wronged.</em></span> [77]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Receiving the Books of Deeds</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">About the distribution of these books and the ways in which people will receive them, Allah (تعالى) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِيَ كِتَابَهُ بِيَمِينِهِ فَسَوْفَ يُحَاسَبُ حِسَابًا يَسِيرًا وَيَنقَلِبُ إِلَى أَهْلِهِ </span><span style="color:#000000;">مَسْرُورًا وَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِيَ كِتَابَهُ وَرَاءَ ظَهْرِهِ فَسَوْفَ يَدْعُو ثُبُورًا وَيَصْلَى سَعِيرًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Then as for he who is given his record in his right hand, he will be judged with an easy reckoning, and he will return to his people in happiness. But as for he who is given his record behind his back, he will cry out for destruction, and he will burn in a blaze.</span>[Surah al-Inshiqaq, 84:7-12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِيَ كِتَابَهُ بِشِمَالِهِ فَيَقُولُ يَا لَيْتَنِي لَمْ أُوتَ كِتَابِيَهْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">But as for he who is given his record in his left hand, he will say, “Oh, I wish I had never been given my record.” </span>[Surah al-Haqqah, 69:25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the Day of Judgment, people will receive their books of deeds in different ways. Some will be given their books in their right hands – these are the believers. In this is also an indication that the right hand is more honorable and so a believer is given his book in his right hand. When the believer receives his book of deeds, he will take it with his right hand, rejoice, then cry out:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِيَ كِتَابَهُ بِيَمِينِهِ فَيَقُولُ هَاؤُمُ اقْرَءُوا كِتَابِيَهْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">So as for he who is given his record in his right hand, he will say, “Here,read my record!” </span>[Surah al-Haqqah, 69:19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for a disbeliever in Allah, he receives his book of deeds in his left hand or from behind his back. He will then cry out for destruction:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِيَ كِتَابَهُ بِشِمَالِهِ فَيَقُولُ يَا لَيْتَنِي لَمْ أُوتَ كِتَابِيَهْ وَلَمْ أَدْرِ مَا حِسَابِيَهْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">But as for he who is given his record in his left hand, he will say, “Oh, I wish I had never been given my record and had never known what my account was.</span>[Surah al-Haqqah, 69:25-26.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the manner in which people receive their books of deeds is of three types: in the right hand, in the left hand, and behind the back. But these three types are only different in description and are not three separate ways books will be distributed. This is because if an individual receives his book of deeds from behind his back, he is at the same time given his book in his left hand—he takes it with his left hand, reaching his hand behind him. And since he receives his book with his left hand, he is known as one of the “People of the Left.” [82] He receives his book behind his back because during his life, he turned his back on the book of Allah. So it is only befitting that in return, he is given his book of deeds from behind his back, and Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To conclude, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَكُلَّ إِنسَانٍ أَلْزَمْنَاهُ طَائِرَهُ فِي عُنُقِهِ وَنُخْرِجُ لَهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ كِتَابًا يَلْقَاهُ مَنشُورًا </span><span style="color:#000000;">اقْرَأْ كِتَابَكَ كَفَى بِنَفْسِكَ الْيَوْمَ عَلَيْكَ حَسِيبًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Every person, we have imposed his fate upon his neck. And we will produce for him, on the Day of Resurrection, a record which he will find spread open. (It will be said to him,) “Read your book. You are sufficient today as a reckoner against yourself. </span>[Surah al-Isra, 17:13-14.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his fate (i.e. his deeds) imposed on his neck, this is the most befitting attachment for a person’s deeds – bound to his neck – because he will never be separated from them until he dies. He will find his book open; he neither expends effort nor does he find difficulty in opening it. &#8220;<strong>Read your book</strong>&#8221; Read what has been written for or against you. &#8220;<strong>Your own self is sufficient as a reckoner against you today</strong>&#8220;. This is the perfection of justice and fairness – that the individual will be responsible for taking himself to account.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have in front of us now a door we may close on every bad deed, every sin: repentance. Regardless of how great a sin may be, when someone repents to Allah, he will forgive him. Even if a person continuously repeated the same sin but he repents, Allah will forgive him. The matter is still within our hands, so we must ensure that nothing is written in this book except righteous deeds before Allah judges creation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[69] Surah al-Isrā, 82:10-12.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Surah Qaf, 50:17-18, Allah informs us that the angels are seated on the right and left of us:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِذْ يَتَلَقَّى الْمُتَلَقِّيَانِ عَنِ الْيَمِينِ وَعَنِ الشِّمَالِ قَعِيدٌ مَّا يَلْفِظُ مِن قَوْلٍ إِلاَّ لَدَيْهِ رَقِيبٌ عَتِيدٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">When the two receivers receive, seated on the right and on the left. Not a word does he utter but there is a watcher by him ready (to record it).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[71] Recorded by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah and al-Albani said it is authentic in “Sahih Sunan al-Tirmidhi” (no. 1894).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The full text of the hadith is:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ثَلاثَةٌ أُقْسِمُ عَلَيْهِنَّ وَأُحَدِّثُكُمْ حَدِيثًا فَاحْفَظُوهُ ، قَالَ : مَا نَقَصَ مَالُ عَبْدٍ مِنْ صَدَقَةٍ ، وَلا ظُلِمَ عَبْدٌ مَظْلَمَةً فَصَبَرَ عَلَيْهَا إِلاَّ زَادَهُ اللَّهُ عِزًّا ، </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَلا فَتَحَ عَبْدٌ بَابَ مَسْأَلَةٍ إِلاَّ فَتَحَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ بَابَ فَقْرٍ &#8211; أَوْ كَلِمَةً نَحْوَهَا &#8211; وَأُحَدِّثُكُمْ حَدِيثًا فَاحْفَظُوهُ ، قَالَ : إِنَّمَا الدُّنْيَا لأَرْبَعَةِ نَفَرٍ : عَبْدٍ </span><span style="color:#000000;">رَزَقَهُ اللَّهُ مَالاً وَعِلْمًا فَهُوَ يَتَّقِي فِيهِ رَبَّهُ وَيَصِلُ فِيهِ رَحِمَهُ ، وَيَعْلَمُ لِلَّهِ فِيهِ حَقًّا فَهَذَا بِأَفْضَلِ الْمَنَازِلِ ، وَعَبْدٍ رَزَقَهُ اللَّهُ عِلْمًا وَلَمْ يَرْزُقْهُ مَالاً </span><span style="color:#000000;">فَهُوَ صَادِقُ النِّيَّةِ يَقُولُ : لَوْ أَنَّ لِي مَالاً لَعَمِلْتُ بِعَمَلِ فُلانٍ ، فَهُوَ بِنِيَّتِهِ فَأَجْرُهُمَا سَوَاءٌ ، وَعَبْدٍ رَزَقَهُ اللَّهُ مَالاً وَلَمْ يَرْزُقْهُ عِلْمًا فَهُوَ يَخْبِطُ فِي </span><span style="color:#000000;">مَالِهِ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ لا يَتَّقِي فِيهِ رَبَّهُ وَلا يَصِلُ فِيهِ رَحِمَهُ وَلا يَعْلَمُ لِلَّهِ فِيهِ حَقًّا فَهَذَا بِأَخْبَثِ الْمَنَازِلِ ، وَعَبْدٍ لَمْ يَرْزُقْهُ اللَّهُ مَالاً وَلا عِلْمًا فَهُوَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">يَقُولُ : لَوْ أَنَّ لِي مَالاً لَعَمِلْتُ فِيهِ بِعَمَلِ فُلانٍ ، فَهُوَ بِنِيَّتِهِ فَوِزْرُهُمَا سَوَاءٌ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">There are three things that I attest to; I will mention them so remember them. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">1) Charity will never decrease a person’s wealth, </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">2) no servant is wronged and patiently endures that except that Allah will increase him in honor, and </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">3) no servant opens the door of begging except that Allah will open the door of poverty (or he said similarly). </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">And I will mention something else so remember it. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The world is for four types of people: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">1) a person Allah has provided with wealth and knowledge so he is conscientious of his Lord regarding them and thus gains his mercy therewith. He knows Allah has a right upon him with regards to them, and this is the best of the (four) types. </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">2) A person Allah has provided with knowledge but not wealth, yet he is truthful in his intention when he says, “If I had wealth, I would do what so-and-so does (the first type of person).” So he is rewarded for his intention, and the reward is the same for both of them. </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">3) A person Allah has provided wealth but no knowledge so that he aimlessly wastes his wealth without knowledge. He is neither conscientious of his Lord with it nor does he achieve his mercy. He does not even know that Allah has a right upon him regarding it, and this is the worst of the (four) types. </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">4) A person Allah has provided no wealth and no knowledge. But he says, “If I had wealth, I would do what so-and-so does (the third type of person).” So he is also recorded for his intention, and the sin is the same for both of them.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[75] Recorded by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah and al-Albani said it is authentic in “Sahih Sunan al-Tirmidhi” (no. 1894). See page 53 for the full hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[77] Surah al-Anaam, 6:160.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Evidence from the Sunnah of a ten-fold reward for a good deed and only a single recompense for a bad deed is the hadith recorded by Muslim in which the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يقول الله : مَنْ جَاء بالحَسَنَةِ فَلَهُ عَشْرُ أمْثَالِهَا أَوْ أزْيَد ، وَمَنْ جَاءَ بالسَيِّئَةِ فَجَزاءُ سَيِّئَةٍ سَيِّئَةٌ مِثْلُهَا أَوْ أغْفِرُ . وَمَنْ تَقَرَّبَ مِنِّي شِبْرًا تَقَرَّبْتُ </span><span style="color:#000000;">مِنْهُ ذِرَاعًا ، وَمَنْ تَقَرَّبَ مِنِّي ذِرَاعًا تَقَرَّبْتُ مِنْهُ بَاعًا ، وَمَنْ أتَانِي يَمْشِي أتَيْتُهُ هَرْوَلَةً ، وَمَنْ لَقِيني بِقُرَابِ الأرْض خَطِيئةً لا يُشْرِكُ بِي شَيئاً ، </span><span style="color:#000000;">لَقِيتُهُ بِمِثْلِهَا مَغفِرَةً</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Allah says, “Whoever does a good deed will have ten times reward for it or even more. And whoever does a bad deed will have a single bad deed for it or I will forgive it. Whoever comes close to me a hand-span, I will come close to him an arm’s length; and whoever comes close to me an arm’s length, I will come close to him the distance of two outstretched arms. Whoever comes to me walking, I will come to him running. And whoever meets me with the earth full of sins but associated nothing with me in worship, I will meet him with as much forgiveness.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[82] A similar description is used in the Surah al-Waqi’ah, 56:8-9:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَأَصْحَابُ الْمَيْمَنَةِ مَا أَصْحَابُ الْمَيْمَنَةِ وَأَصْحَابُ الْمَشْأَمَةِ مَا أَصْحَابُ الْمَشْأَمَةِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Companions of the Right – what are the Companions of the Right? And the Companions of the Left – what re the Companions of the Left?</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Day of Resurrection: The Tenth Event</strong></span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Bridge</strong></span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabic word صِرَاط (Ṣirāṭ) is the bridge stretched over Hell over which people will cross to get to Paradise. About it, Allah ( تعالى ) says:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِن مِّنكُمْ إِلَّا وَارِدُهَا ۚ كَانَ عَلَىٰ رَبِّكَ حَتْمًا مَّقْضِيًّا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And there is none of you except that he will pass over it. This is with your Lord a decree which must be accomplished</span>.[Sūrah Maryam, 19:71]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abdullāh Ibn Mas’ūd, Qatādah, and Zayd Ibn Aslam explained this verse to mean the crossing of the bridge. Others, including Ibn ‘Abbās, explained that it describes those who will enter the fire but will be saved from it.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ يُضْرَبُ الْجِسْرُ عَلَى جَهَنَّمَ ، وَتَحِلُّ الشَّفَاعَةُ وَيَقُولُونَ : اللَّهُمَّ سَلِّمْ سَلِّمْ</span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the bridge will be placed over Hell and intercession will be permitted. They (the messengers) will say, “Oh Allah, save (us), save (us).” [<span style="color:#ff0000;">113</span>]</p>





<p style="text-align:justify;">Scholars have differed as to the exact nature of this bridge. Some say it is a wide path over which people will cross according to the deeds they did in this life. They say it is wide because the word “bridge,” taken at face value, means just that and because Allah’s messenger ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) described it as being slippery and elusive. They understood that the bridge must be somewhat wide because a very narrow path would not be described with the specific Arabic words (slippery and elusive) that the prophet used. When asked about the bridge, the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَدْحَضَةٌ مَزِلَّةٌ عَلَيْهِ خَطَاطِيفُ وَكَلالِيبُ وَحَسَكَةٌ مُفَلْطَحَةٌ لَهَا شَوْكَةٌ عُقَيْفَاءُ</span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;"><span style="color:#808000;">It is slippery, elusive with hooks and grapples, and broad spikes and curved thorns</span>.</span>[Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the ḥadīth narrated by Abū Hurayrah, the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَبِهِ كَلالِيبُ مِثْلُ شَوْكِ السَّعْدَانِ غَيْرَ أَنَّهَا لا يَعْلَمُ قَدْرَ عِظَمِهَا إِلاَّ اللَّهُ فَتَخْطَفُ </span><span style="color:#000000;">النَّاسَ بِأَعْمَالِهِمْ</span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">It has hooks like the thorns of al-Sa’dān (a place in Najd) except that no one but Allah knows the huge size of them. They will seize people according to their deeds</span>.[Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Other scholars said no, it is actually a very narrow bridge just as has come in a ḥadīth narrated by Abū Sa’īd al-Khudrī ( رضي الله عنه ) in which he said:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">بَلَغَنِي أَنَّ الصِّرَاطَ أَحَدُّ مِنَ السَّيْفِ وَأَدَقُّ مِنَ الشَّعْرَةِ</span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">He informed (or: It has reached) me that the bridge is sharper that a sword and thinner than a hair.</span>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">116</span>]</p>
<p>

</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Here we come to a question: How is it possible for people to actually pass over a bridge like this? The answer is that the events and things to occur in the hereafter cannot be compared to or measured based solely on what we know of things of this life. Allah is capable of anything, and we do not know exactly how people will cross it. Will they cross in groups or one at a time? Allah knows best.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">But regarding this issue—whether the bridge is wide or narrow—it is not incumbent on people to accept one position over the other because both groups of scholars have strong points.</p>



<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Crossing the Bridge</span></strong></h3>



<p style="text-align:justify;">No one will cross the bridge except the believers. As for the disbelievers, they will be taken straight to the fire. The believers will cross it according to their deeds based on the ḥadīth narrated by Abū Sa’īd al-Khudrī ( رضي الله عنه ) that the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَيَمُرُّ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ كَطَرْفِ الْعَيْنِ وَكَالْبَرْقِ وَكَالرِّيحِ وَكَالطَّيْرِ وَكَأَجَاوِيدِ الْخَيْلِ  </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَالرِّكَابِ فَنَاجٍ مُسَلَّمٌ وَمَخْدُوشٌ مُرْسَلٌ وَمَكْدُوسٌ فِي نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ</span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">The believers will cross: some as fast as the blink of an eye, some like lightning, some like the wind, some like a bird, some like horses, and some as fast as camels. Some people will be safe a secure, some will be scratched but delivered, and others will fall into the fire of Hell</span>.[Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">The speed at which a person crosses is obviously not by his choice. If it were, naturally everyone would want to cross quickly. Rather, the passage across is according to the speed at which he used to accept religious teachings in this life. So whoever was always quick to accept the teachings of the messengers, he will pass quickly over the bridge. Whoever was slow to accept them will pass slowly over the bridge. It is a suitable reward and the reward is according to the deed.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people will be seized by hooks that are on the bridge and, again, this will only be according to their deeds. As for the prophet’s statement, “others will fall into the fire of Hell,” it is understood that the fire into which sinners will fall is the same fire the disbelievers will be in. However, these believing sinners will still not experience the same punishment as disbelievers will. Some scholars have even said that this fire will be cool and safe for them just as the fire was cool and peaceful on Prophet Abraham. [<span style="color:#ff0000;">118</span>]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">However, what is more apparent is that this is not the case; the fire will likely be hot and painful but not as intense as the heat the disbelievers in Allah will experience. As a side note, the points on the body upon which believers prostrate during prayer will never be touched by the fire just as it has been reported by the prophet in “Ṣaḥīḥ al- Bukhārī” and “Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim.” [<span style="color:#ff0000;">119</span>] The places of prostration are those that touch the ground: the forehead, nose, palms, knees, and the toes.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">In a ḥadīth in “Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim,” the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) also said:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">تَجْرِي بِهِمْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ وَنَبِيُّكُمْ قَائِمٌ عَلَى الصِّرَاطِ يَقُولُ : رَبِّ سَلِّمْ سَلِّمْ حَتَّى تَعْجِزَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">أَعْمَالُ الْعِبَادِ حَتَّى يَجِيءَ الرَّجُلُ فَلا يَسْتَطِيعُ السَّيْرَ إِلاَّ زَحْفًا</span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Their deeds will carry them (over the bridge) while your prophet is standing on the bridge saying, “My Lord, save (them), save (them).” Some servants’ deeds will hinder them so much that a man will be unable to pass over except while crawling.</span> [Recorded by Muslim.]</p>





<p style="text-align:justify;">And in “Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī:”</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">حَتَّى يَمُرَّ آخِرُهُمْ يُسْحَبُ سَحْبًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">…until the last of them crosses being dragged.</span>[Recorded by al-Bukhārī]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">The first of the prophets to cross the bridge will be Muhammad ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) and the first of all religious nations will be his nation as the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَأَكُونُ أَنَا وَأُمَّتِي أَوَّلَ مَنْ يُجِيزُهَا ، وَلا يَتَكَلَّمُ يَوْمَئِذٍ إِلاَّ الرُّسُلُ ، وَدَعْوَى الرُّسُلِ </span><span style="color:#000000;">يَوْمَئِذٍ : اللَّهُمَّ سَلِّمْ سَلِّمْ</span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">I and my nation will be the first to be allowed to cross it. On that day, no one will speak except the messengers and the prayer of the messengers that day will be, “Oh Allah, save (us), save (us)!</span> [Recorded by al-Bukhārī]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah says, “After they cross, they will stop at a bridge/platform between Paradise and the fire and they will settle any unresolved issues between themselves.”</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">This area is a small bridge or platform, and this settling of disagreements between them is not the major settling of affairs and retribution that occurs between people on the Day of Resurrection. Instead, this particular reconciliation is to resolve any bad feelings, grudges, or anger that may still remain in people’s hearts. So in a sense, this is a period of purification because the major settling of disagreements does not necessarily remove all feelings of resentment within people’s hearts.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">So this bridge or platform between Paradise and Hell is to purify the hearts so that the believers enter Paradise having no bad feelings for one another as Allah ( تعالى ) says:</p>





<h2><span style="color:#000000;">ادْخُلُوهَا بِسَلَامٍ آمِنِينَ وَنَزَعْنَا مَا فِي صُدُورِهِم مِّنْ غِلٍّ إِخْوَانًا عَلَىٰ سُرُرٍ مُّتَقَابِلِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Enter it with peace, safe and secure. And we will remove whatever is in their breasts of resentment, (so they will become) brothers, on thrones facing each other</span>.[Sūrah al-Ḥijr, 15:46-47]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">About this bridge before Paradise, the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا خَلَصَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ مِنَ النَّارِ ، حُبِسُوا بِقَنْطَرَةٍ بَيْنَ الْجَنَّةِ وَالنَّارِ ، فَيَتَقَاصُّونَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">مَظَالِمَ كَانَتْ بَيْنَهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا ، حَتَّى إِذَا نُقُّوا وَهُذِّبُوا أُذِنَ لَهُمْ بِدُخُولِ الْجَنَّةِ ،</span><span style="color:#000000;">فَوَالَّذِي نَفْسُ مُحَمَّدٍ بِيَدِهِ لأَحَدُهُمْ بِمَسْكَنِهِ فِي الْجَنَّةِ أَدَلُّ بِمَنْزِلِهِ كَانَ فِي الدُّنْيَا</span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">When the believers are delivered from the fire, they will be detained at the bridge between Paradise and the fire to settle whatever injustices may have occurred between them in life. When they have all become refined and purified, entrance into Paradise will be granted. And I swear by the one in whose hand is Muhammad’s life, each individual will recognize his home in Paradise even more so than he does his home in this life.</span> [Recorded by al-Bukhārī]</p>

<p>

</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يُضْرَبُ جِسْرُ جَهَنَّمَ ، فَأَكُونُ أَوَّلَ مَنْ يُجِيزُ ، وَدُعَاءُ الرُّسُلِ يَوْمَئِذٍ : اللَّهُمَّ سَلِّمْ سَلِّمْ</span></h2>
<p>

</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">The bridge of Hell will be placed and I will be the first to be permitted. The supplication of the messengers that day will be, “Oh Allah, save (us), save (us).”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[116] Recorded by Imām Aḥmad in a marfū’ form meaning some ḥadīth scholars accept it as being “raised” to the status of an actual statement of the prophet himself ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ). Imam Muslim also mentioned it in his authentic collection as a comment to another ḥadīth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[118] This is when the disbelieving people attempted to burn Abraham for destroying their idols. About this, Allah says in Sūrah al-Anbiyā, 21:68-69:</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;">قَالُوا حَرِّقُوهُ وَانصُرُوا آلِهَتَكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ فَاعِلِينَ قُلْنَا يَا نَارُ كُونِي بَرْدًا وَسَلَامًا عَلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ</span></h2>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">They said, “Burn him and support your gods if you are to act.” We (Allah) said, “Fire, be coolness and safety upon Abraham.”</span></p>
<p>

</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[119] The ḥadīth, recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim, is:</p>
<p>

</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا أَرَادَ اللَّهُ رَحْمَةَ مَنْ أَرَادَ مِنْ أَهْلِ النَّارِ أَمَرَ اللَّهُ الْمَلائِكَةَ أَنْ يُخْرِجُوا مَنْ كَانَ يَعْبُدُ اللَّهَ فَيُخْرِجُونَهُمْ وَيَعْرِفُونَهُمْ بِآثَارِ السُّجُودِ وَحَرَّمَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُ عَلَى النَّارِ أَنْ تَأْكُلَ أَثَرَ السُّجُودِ</span></h2>
<p>

</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">When Allah wants mercy for someone from the people of the fire, he commands the angels to take out whoever used to worship Allah. So they (the angels) will recognize them by the marks of prostration because Allah has forbidden the fire from destroying the marks of prostration.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Sixth Event</strong></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Scales are Placed &amp; Deeds are Weighed</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one of the verses that proves the scales will be setup on the Day of Resurrection, Allah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">فَمَن ثَقُلَتْ مَوَازِينُهُ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And those whose scales are heavy </strong>(with good deeds)<strong>, it is they who will be successful</strong></span>.[Sūrah al-Muminūn, 23:102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The verse contains a conditional clause; the condition is &#8220;<strong>those whose scales are heavy</strong>&#8220;, and if that condition is met, the consequence is &#8220;<strong>it is they who will be successful</strong>.&#8221; By &#8220;<strong>scales are heavy</strong>&#8220;, what is meant is that one’s good deeds outweigh his bad. &#8220;<strong>Successful</strong>&#8221; here describes an individual who achieves what he hopes for and is saved from what he fears. So he is given safety from what he hates and rewarded with what he loves. Allah also says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَنْ خَفَّتْ مَوَازِينُهُ فَأُولَئِكَ الَّذِينَ خَسِرُوا أَنفُسَهُمْ فِي جَهَنَّمَ خَالِدُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>But those whose scales are light, it is they who have lost their souls. In Hell they will abide forever</strong></span>. [Sūrah al-Muminūn, 23:103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who do not believe in Allah will <strong>&#8220;have lost their souls</strong>.&#8221; They will lose themselves, their families, and the possessions they hold dear:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ إِنَّ الْخَاسِرِينَ الَّذِينَ خَسِرُوا أَنفُسَهُمْ وَأَهْلِيهِمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ ۖ أَلا ذَلِكَ هُوَ الْخُسْرَانُ الْمُبِينُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Say: Indeed, the losers are the ones who will lose themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection. Unquestionably, that is the clear loss</span></strong>.[Sūrah al-Zumar, 39:15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for a believer in Allah whose behavior was righteous, he will have succeeded, gaining his soul, his family, and his possessions, having benefited from all of them. People who do not believe in Allah (or disbelieve in Allah’s “oneness”) will lose themselves because they will have not benefited from their very existence in life. In fact such people, despite what they presumably achieve in life, actually achieve no true benefit and gain only harm (in the hereafter). In a sense, they even lose their wealth in life as they gain no real benefit from it. Even when they may share it with others among creation, such charity does not benefit the givers. Allah (تعالى) says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا مَنَعَهُمْ أَن تُقْبَلَ مِنْهُمْ نَفَقَاتُهُمْ إِلَّا أَنَّهُمْ كَفَرُوا بِاللَّهِ وَبِرَسُولِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And nothing prevents their spending from being accepted from them except that they disbelieved in Allah and in his messenger</strong></span>.[Sūrah al-Tawbah, 9:54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They also lose their families because their families will either be in the fire with them, or if their families are in Paradise, such disbelievers will still have lost them because they themselves will be in the fire. Any individual who dies while disbelieving in Allah will never again enjoy the company of his family. Such enjoyment will be locked out from a disbeliever as soon as he is locked in his coffin, and each one will imagine no one else is receiving a harsher punishment than he.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#000000;">whose scales are light</span></strong>&#8220;, this means his bad deeds will outweigh his good or he will have no good deeds whatsoever. This is the meaning if we accept the position that disbelievers will have their deeds weighed which seems apparent from the verse in Sūrah al-Muminūn, 23:103 and others like it. And this position is one of the two held by religious scholars. The other opinion, that disbelievers will not have their deeds weighed, is the second position and it is based on the verses:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ هَلْ نُنَبِّئُكُم بِالْأَخْسَرِينَ أَعْمَالً الَّذِينَ ضَلَّ سَعْيُهُمْ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا وَهُمْ يَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُمْ يُحْسِنُونَ صُنْعًا أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا بِآيَاتِ رَبِّهِمْ وَلِقَائِهِ فَحَبِطَتْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ فَلَا نُقِيمُ لَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ وَزْنًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Say: Shall we inform you of the greatest losers as to (their) deeds? Those whose effort is lost in the worldly life while they thought they were doing good work. Those are the ones who disbelieve in the verses of their Lord and in (their) meeting him. So their deeds have become worthless, and we will not assign to them on the Day of Resurrection any weight.</span></strong> [Sūrah al-Kahf, 18:103-105]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the two positions, whether disbelievers will have their deeds weighed or not, Allah knows best which is correct.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabic word for scales used in some verses, ( مَوَازِيْن <em>mawāzīn</em>), has been reported in other texts in both the singular and plural forms. As for the plural form, Allah (تعالى) says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَنَضَعُ الْمَوَازِينَ الْقِسْطَ لِيَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ فَلَا تُظْلَمُ نَفْسٌ شَيْئًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And we place the scales of justice for the Day of Resurrection, so no soul will be treated unjustly in any way. </strong></span>[Sūrah al-Anbiyā, 21:47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَالْوَزْنُ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْحَقُّ ۚ فَمَن ثَقُلَتْ مَوَازِينُهُ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ وَمَنْ خَفَّتْ مَوَازِينُهُ فَأُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ خَسِرُوا أَنفُسَهُم بِمَا كَانُوا بِآيَاتِنَا يَظْلِمُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">And the weighing (of deeds) that day will be true. So those whose scales are heavy, it is they who will be successful. And those whose scales are light, they will lose themselves for what injustice they were doing toward our verses.</span> </strong>[Sūrah al-‘Arāf, 7:8-9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the singular form, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">كَلِمَتَانِ حَبِيبَتَانِ إِلَى الرَّحْمَنِ خَفِيفَتَانِ عَلَى اللِّسَانِ ثَقِيلَتَانِ فِي الْمِيزَانِ : سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ الْعَظِيمِ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There are two statements beloved to the Most Merciful, light on the tongue but heavy on the scale: “Glorified is Allah and all thanks are for him,” and “Glorified is Allah the greatest.”</strong> </span>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">59</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this ḥadīth, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) mentioned the singular form, ( مِيْزَان <em>mīzān</em>), “scale.” So how do we understand the Quran verses which mention “scales” and this ḥadīth which mentions “scale?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps it is mentioned in the plural form only as a way of speaking about what is weighed – deeds – which is plural. Then it is mentioned in the ḥadīth in singular form because the scale is actually one. It could also be because perhaps there is one scale for each nation or even that the prophet meant “heavy in weight” when he said, “heavy on the scale.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, what is apparent—and Allah knows best—is that the scale is actually one but is mentioned in plural form with regards to what is weighed (i.e., deeds). This linguistic usage can also be seen in the verse:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; فَمَن ثَقُلَتْ مَوَازِينُهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So those whose scales are heavy&#8230;</strong></span>[Sūrah al-A’rāf, 7:8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this verse, it is not actually the scales that are heavy, rather it is a form of Arabic speech in which one word (e.g. scales) is used to mean another word relating to the former (e.g. deeds).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a related issue but one into which people have not delved: Will there be a single scale setup for all nations, all mankind, or will there be one for each nation (e.g., one for Muhammad’s nation, one for Jesus’ nation, one for Moses’, etc.)? This question may be relevant because some texts indicate the rewards for deeds vary for different nations. [<span style="color:#ff0000;">61</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These texts, taken at face value, are apparent in that the scale will be real and tangible as this is exactly how the word “scale” is commonly understood. This is because the principle of understanding religious texts reported in the Quran or Sunnah is that they are to be understood upon the commonly known, real and actual meanings of their words unless there is clear evidence that they should be understood differently (i.e. metaphorically). The commonly understood meaning to all Muslim teachers, writers, and lecturers ever since the Quran was revealed up until today is that the scale is real. However, some misguided sects have differed in understanding. For example, those who incorrectly believe any texts can be figurative, having metaphorical meanings instead of what the words actually mean, they claim that there will not be a real scale setup on the Day of Resurrection. They insist that there is really no need for an actual scale to weigh actions because Allah already knows the deeds of his servants and their worth. Instead, they claim that “scale” is allegorical and it really means Allah’s “fairness” or “justice.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No doubt, the claim of such people is incorrect because it contradicts the outward, apparent meaning of the word and the consensus of all the righteous predecessors who understood the word to mean what the word actually means – scale. If we say the meaning is figurative and it really means fairness or justice, then there is little meaning in the several texts which mention “scale,” they would simply say “justice” (as other texts do) because the characteristics of fairness and justice are closer to and speak more directly to people’s souls than the word “scale” anyway. For this reason, Allah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَأْمُرُ بِالْعَدْلِ وَالْإِحْسَانِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Indeed, Allah orders justice and good conduct.</span></strong>[Sūrah al-Naḥl, 16:90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The correct understanding is to take the word “scale” on its intended, actual meaning. We say that the correct understanding is the same one revealed – scale. The “<strong>Ḥadīth of the Card</strong>” (to be mentioned soon) also proves that it is a real, actual scale with weighing pans. This ḥadīth mentions that scrolls of bad deeds placed in one pan will be lighter than a single card placed in the other pan which will be heavier. So it is clear, what is correct is what was revealed – the scale is real.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The actions of the servants will then be weighed. And with that, there are two points of discussion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first point is this:</strong> How will deeds be weighed when it is known that a deed is simply a description or action of the one who performed it, and a deed has no physical form? The answer is that Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) will make these deeds into actual, physical forms. This should not be unbelievably strange when considering the capability of Allah (عزّ وجل). As an analogy, death will be made into the form of a ram on the Day of Judgment and it will be slaughtered between Paradise and Hell [<span style="color:#ff0000;">63</span>] while death now is simply a concept and not a physical form. And to clarify a side-note, the Angel of Death is not the one slaughtered here; it is actually death that Allah (تعالى) will make into a physical form everyone will witness and see. Similarly, Allah (عزّ وجل)جلwill turn deeds into actual forms that will be actually weighed with this actual scale.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second point:</strong> Deeds will actually be weighed, both good and bad. This is the apparent understanding as Allah (تعالى) says in the Quran:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">يَوْمَئِذٍ يَصْدُرُ النَّاسُ أَشْتَاتًا لِّيُرَوْا أَعْمَالَهُمْ  فَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ خَيْرًا يَرَهُ وَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ شَرًّا يَرَهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>That day, people will depart, separated (into categories) to be shown their deeds. So whoever does an atom’s weight of good will see it, and whoever does an atom’s weight of evil will see it.</strong></span> [Sūrah al-Zalzalah, 99:6-8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is clear that deeds will really be weighed whether they are good or bad. Also, as has previously been mentioned, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)said, “There are two statements beloved to the Most Merciful, light on the tongue but heavy on the scale&#8230;” This ḥadīth is also clear, even explicit, in that actions will actually be given form and weight and then weighed, and there are several other texts that prove this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, there are other reliable texts that indicate that it may not be the actual deeds weighed but rather the records of deeds. An example of this type is the “Ḥadīth of the Card” in which the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« إِنَّ اللَّهَ سَيُخَلِّصُ رَجُلاً مِنْ أُمَّتِي عَلَى رُءُوسِ الْخَلائِقِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فَيَنْشُرُ عَلَيْهِ </span><span style="color:#000000;">تِسْعَةً وَتِسْعِينَ سِجِلاًّ كُلُّ سِجِلٍّ مِثْلُ مَدِّ الْبَصَرِ ثُمَّ يَقُولُ.: أَتُنْكِرُ مِنْ هَذَا شَيْئًا ؟ </span><span style="color:#000000;">أَظَلَمَكَ كَتَبَتِي الْحَافِظُونَ ؟ فَيَقُولُ : لا يَا رَبِّ ، فَيَقُولُ : أَفَلَكَ عُذْرٌ ؟ فَيَقُولُ : لا يَا </span><span style="color:#000000;">رَبِّ ، فَيَقُولُ : بَلَى إِنَّ لَكَ عِنْدَنَا حَسَنَةً فَإِنَّهُ لا ظُلْمَ عَلَيْكَ الْيَوْمَ ، فَتَخْرُجُ بِطَاقَةٌ فِيهَا </span><span style="color:#000000;">أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لا إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ ، فَيَقُولُ : احْضُرْ وَزْنَكَ ، </span><span style="color:#000000;">فَيَقُولُ : يَا رَبِّ مَا هَذِهِ الْبِطَاقَةُ مَعَ هَذِهِ السِّجِلاَّتِ ؟ فَقَالَ : إِنَّكَ لا تُظْلَمُ ، قَالَ : </span><span style="color:#000000;">فَتُوضَعُ السِّجِلاَّتُ فِي كَفَّةٍ وَالْبِطَاقَةُ فِي كَفَّةٍ فَطَاشَتْ السِّجِلاَّتُ وَثَقُلَتْ الْبِطَاقَةُ فَلا </span><span style="color:#000000;">يَثْقُلُ مَعَ اسْمِ اللَّهِ شَيْءٌ »</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allah will single out a man from my nation at the head of all the creations on the Day of Resurrection. Ninety-nine scrolls (of bad deeds) will be spread out before him, each as far as the eye can see. He will be asked, “Do you deny doing any of this? Did my recording, guardian angels wrong you in any way?” The man will answer, “No, my Lord.” He will be asked, “Do you have any excuse?” to which he will again reply, “No, my Lord.” It will then be said, “Rather you certainly do have a good deed with us and there will be no injustice on you today.” A card will then be brought out, written on it: “I testify there is nothing deserving of worship but Allah, and I testify that Muhammad is his servant and messenger.” The man will be told, “Present yourself for your weighing.” He will ask, “My Lord, what is this card compared to all these scrolls (of bad deeds)?” He (Allah) will tell him, “You will certainly not be wronged.” So the scrolls will be placed in one pan (of the scale) and the card in the other, and the scrolls will be lighter and the card heavier as nothing is heavier than the name of Allah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Recorded by al-Tirmidhī, Ibn Mājah, and Aḥmad. al-Albānī said it is authentic in his “Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan al-Tirmidhī” (no.2127)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this ḥadīth, it is apparent that it is the written records of deeds weighed instead of the deeds themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are other texts that indicate what is weighed is the person who does the deeds. For example, Allah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا بِآيَاتِ رَبِّهِمْ وَلِقَائِهِ فَحَبِطَتْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ فَلَا نُقِيمُ لَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ وَزْنًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Those are the ones who disbelieve in the verses of their Lord and in </strong>(their)<strong> meeting with him, so their deeds have become worthless. And we will not assign to them on the Day of Resurrection any weight</strong></span>.[Sūrah al-Kahf, 18:105]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But it has been said that the meaning of &#8220;weight&#8221; in the verse could mean “significance” or “importance” instead of weight. Another indication that it may be the person himself that is weighed is the ḥadīth of Abū Hurayrah ( رضي الله عنه)in which he narrated that the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« إِنَّهُ لَيَأْتِي الرَّجُلُ الْعَظِيمُ السَّمِينُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ لا يَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ »</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>A huge, fat man will be brought on the Day of Resurrection and he will not weigh in the sight of Allah even as much as a gnat’s wing</strong> </span>[Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The understanding that it is the person who will be weighed is also indicated by the ḥadīth of Ibn Mas’ūd ( رضي الله عنه)when he was once trying to break a siwāk branch from a tree. He used to have thin legs and the wind blew and started to move him. Because of this, other companions ( رضي الله عنه)مbegan laughing at him. So the prophet ( صلّى الله ) عليه وسلّمasked them, “What are you laughing at?” They answered, “At the skinniness of his legs.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)then said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ ، لَهُمَا أَثْقَلُ فِي الْمِيزَانِ مِنْ أُحُدٍ »</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>I swear by the one in who hand is my soul (Allah), they (his legs) are both heavier in the scale than Mt. Uḥud.</strong></span> [Recorded by Aḥmad (1/421) and al-Albānī classed its chain of narrators as ḥasan in “Sharḥ al-A’qīdah al-Ṭaḥāwiyyah.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So to conclude, we have texts indicating three things that will be weighed in the scale: the deeds, the records of deeds, and the person who performed the deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some scholars said the way to understand these together is simply that some people will have their deeds weighed, some will have their records of deeds weighed, and others will be weighed themselves. Other scholars said that when texts mention deeds being weighed, what is really meant is the records of deeds, and as for a person being weighed, this is specific to certain individuals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Other scholars have combined these texts with the understanding that in reality only the records of deeds are weighed, but they will be heavy or light based on the merit and greatness of the deeds written in them. So in essence, it is as if the deeds are weighed. But after reflecting on the texts relevant to this issue, we find most of them indicate that it is the deeds that are weighed. Yet some people will be exclusively chosen to have their records of deeds weighed or even the individual himself. As far as the ḥadīth of Ibn Mas’ūd or the “Ḥadīth of the Card,” it could be that these are specific situations for which Allah chooses whomever he wants from his servants.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the scales are placed, people’s deeds are weighed, then the books of deeds are distributed.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">59</span>] Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim. The transliteration of these two statements:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ الْعَظِيمِ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>SubḥānAllahi al-‘Aẓīm SubḥānAllahi wa biḥamdihi</strong></span><br />
Glorified is Allah the greatest Glorified is Allah and all thanks are for him</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another ḥadīth which mentions “scale” in the singular form and indicates the greatness of this scale is classified as authentic by al-Albānī in “Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ṣaḥīḥah” (no. 941). In it, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« يُوْضَعُ المِيْزَانُ يَوْمَ القِيَامَةِ فَلَوْ وَزِنَ فِيْهِ السَّمَوَاتِ وَالأَرْضَ لَوَسَعَتْ فَتَقُوْلُ المَلائِكَةُ : يَا رَبّ لِمَنْ يَزِنَ هَذَا ؟ فَيَقُوْلُ اللهُ تَعَالَى : لِمَنْ </span><span style="color:#000000;">شِئْتُ مِنْ خَلْقِي . فَتَقُوْلُ المَلائِكَةُ : سُبْحَانَكَمَا عَبَدْنَاكَ حَقَّ عِبَادَتِكَ . وَيُوْضَعُ الصِّرَاطُ مِثْلَ حَدِّ المُوْسَى فَتَقُوْلُ المَلائِكَةُ : مَنْ تَجِيْزُ عَلَى </span><span style="color:#000000;">هَذَا ؟ فَيَقُوْلُ : مَنْ شِئْتُ مِنْ خَلْقِيْ . فَيَقُوْلُوْنَ : سُبْحَانَكَمَا عَبَدْنَاكَ حَقَّ عِبَادَتِكَ »</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">The scale will be set up on the Day of Resurrection, and if the heavens and the earth were to be weighed in it, it would be sufficient to hold them. The angels will ask, “Oh Lord, who is this for?” Allah will reply, “For whomsoever I want among my creations.” The angels will then say, “Glory to you, we have not worshipped you as you rightfully deserve to be worshipped.” And the bridge will be placed (over Hell) and it will be like the edge of a razor. The angels will ask Allah, “Who will be saved from this?” to which Allah will again reply, “Whomsoever I want among my creations.” They will say, “Glory to you, we have not worshipped you as you rightfully deserve to be worshipped.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">61</span>] One example of such texts is the ḥadīth recorded by al-Bukhārī in which the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)said comparing Muslims to Jews and Christians:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« مَثَلُكُمْ وَمَثَلُ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابَيْنِ كَمَثَلِ رَجُلٍ اسْتَأْجَرَ أُجَرَاءَ فَقَالَ : مَنْ يَعْمَلُ لِي مِنْ غُدْوَةَ إِلَى نِصْفِ النَّهَارِ عَلَى قِيرَاطٍ ؟ فَعَمِلَتْ الْيَهُودُ ، ثُمَّ قَالَ : مَنْ يَعْمَلُ لِي مِنْ نِصْفِ النَّهَارِ إِلَى صَلاةِ الْعَصْرِ عَلَى قِيرَاطٍ ؟ فَعَمِلَتْ النَّصَارَى ، ثُمَّ قَالَ : مَنْ يَعْمَلُ لِي مِنْ الْعَصْرِ إِلَى أَنْ تَغِيبَ الشَّمْسُ عَلَى قِيرَاطَيْنِ ؟ فَأَنْتُمْ هُمْ ، فَغَضِبَتْ الْيَهُودُ وَالنَّصَارَى فَقَالُوا : مَا لَنَا أَكْثَرَ عَمَلاً وَأَقَلَّ عَطَاءً ؟ قَالَ : هَلْ نَقَصْتُكُمْ مِنْ حَقِّكُمْ ؟ قَالُوا : لا ، قَالَ : فَذَلِكَ فَضْلِي أُوتِيهِ مَنْ أَشَاءُ »</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Your example compared to those of the two former scriptures can be likened to a man who hires a number of laborers. He asks, “Who will work for me from morning until midday for a certain sum?” The Jews are the ones to work at this time. Then he asks, “Who will work from midday to the late afternoon for the same sum?” The Christians are the ones to work at this time. Then he asks, “Who will work from the late afternoon until sunset for double that sum?” You (Muslims) are these people. This angers the Jews and Christians who ask, “Why did we have to work more only to receive less?” He answers, “Have you been cheated of any of your rights?” They answer, “No.” He then says, “This is my favor that I give to whom I please.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">63</span>] The proof is the ḥadīth recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim in which the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« يُؤْتَى بِالْمَوْتِ كَهَيْئَةِ كَبْشٍ أَمْلَحَ فَيُنَادِي مُنَادٍ : يَا أَهْلَ الْجَنَّةِ ، فَيَشْرَئِبُّونَ وَيَنْظُرُونَ ، فَيَقُولُ : هَلْ تَعْرِفُونَ هَذَا ؟ فَيَقُولُونَ : نَعَمْ هَذَا الْمَوْتُ ، وَكُلُّهُمْ قَدْ رَآهُ ، ثُمَّ يُنَادِي : يَا أَهْلَ النَّارِ ، فَيَشْرَئِبُّونَ وَيَنْظُرُونَ ، فَيَقُولُ : هَلْ تَعْرِفُونَ هَذَا ؟ فَيَقُولُونَ : نَعَمْ هَذَا الْمَوْتُ ، وَكُلُّهُمْ قَدْ رَآهُ ، فَيُذْبَحُ ، ثُمَّ يَقُولُ : يَا أَهْلَ الْجَنَّةِ خُلُودٌ فَلا مَوْتَ وَيَا أَهْلَ النَّارِ خُلُودٌ فَلا مَوْتَ ، ثُمَّ قَرَأَ : &#8220;وَأَنْذِرْهُمْ يَوْمَ الْحَسْرَةِ إِذْ قُضِيَ الأَمْرُ وَهُمْ فِي غَفْلَةٍ &#8220;وَهَؤُلاءِ فِي غَفْلَةٍ أَهْلُ الدُّنْيَا &#8220;وَهُمْ لا يُؤْمِنُونَ »&#8221;</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Death will be brought in the form of a black and white ram and a caller will call out, “Oh people of Paradise!” and they will stretch their necks and look. They will be asked, “Do you know what this is?” to which they will answer, “Yes, that is death,” and each of them will be able to see it. Then it will be called out, “Oh people of Hell!” They will also stretch out their necks and look. They will be asked, “Do you know what this is?” and they too will say, “Yes, it is death,” and each of them will see it. It will then be slaughtered. Then it will be said, “Oh people of Paradise, eternity and no death. Oh people of Hell, eternity and no death.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)recited:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنْذِرْهُمْ يَوْمَ الْحَسْرَةِ إِذْ قُضِيَ الأَمْرُ وَهُمْ فِي غَفْلَةٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">And warn them of the Day of Regret, when the matter will be concluded. And yet they are in heedlessness.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then said, “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And these people are headless, people of this life</strong></span>,” and finished the verse:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And they do not believe</strong></span>. [Sūrah Maryam, 19:39]</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Day of Resurrection <br />The Third Event</strong></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Sun is Brought Near</strong></span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;">The sun will be brought near to mankind, as close as a “<strong>mile</strong>,” the Arabic word used for mile here being <strong>مِيْل</strong> (mīl). Whether it is the mile we know to be the common unit of distance or the eye-pencil to apply kohl (as the word could imply in Arabic), whatever the case the sun will be very close to people.[<span style="color:#ff0000;">29</span>] If the sun’s heat is as we know it here in this life while there is such a great distance between it and us, then how will it be when it is a “mile” above our heads?</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Here is a question: It is well-known that if the sun were to move even a hair from its position, it would burn the earth, incinerating it completely. So how is it possible on that day for the sun to be that close and not burn creation? The answer is that although people will be resurrected on that day with their previous bodies, they may not be recreated in the same exact state and with the same capability as they have now. Rather, they will be stronger and greater in what they can withstand.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, if people were to remain for fifty days in direct sunshine with no shade, no food, and no water, they would be unable to do so; they would die. But on the Day of Resurrection, they will remain in such a state for fifty thousand years [<span style="color:#ff0000;">30</span>] without food,water, or shade except those to whom Allah ( عزّ وجلّ ) shades. In addition, they will witness other terrifying events but they will be made to withstand them.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">As an example of this greater capability to bear situations without dying, look at how the people of the fire will withstand such seemingly unbearable circumstances:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا بِآيَاتِنَا سَوْفَ نُصْلِيهِمْ نَارًا كُلَّمَا نَضِجَتْ جُلُودُهُم بَدَّلْنَاهُمْ جُلُودًا غَيْرَهَا لِيَذُوقُوا الْعَذَابَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Indeed, those who disbelieve in our verses, we will drive them into a fire. Every time their skins are roasted through, we will replace them with other skins so they may taste the punishment. </strong></span>[Surah An-Nisa 4:56]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Will anyone be saved from the heat of the sun on the Day of Resurrection? Yes, there are types of people whom Allah will shade from the sun. The prophet ( صلّى اللّه عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There are seven (types of people) whom Allah will shade in his shade on a day when there will be no shade except his shade: a just ruler; a youth who grew up in the worship of Allah; a man whose heart is attached to the mosques; people who love each other for Allah’s sake, meeting for his sake and parting for his sake; a man who is called by a woman of beauty and position (for adultery), but he says: “(No) I fear Allah;” a man who gives in charity and hides it so much so that his left hand does not know what his right hand gives in charity; and a man who remembered Allah in private so much that his eyes shed tears. </strong></span>[Recorded by al-Bukhārī, Muslim, and al-Tirmidhī]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">There are also other types of individuals Allah will shade on that day. And by, “when there will be no shade except his shade,” it means no shade except the shade Allah creates. And it is not as some people think that it is the shade of Allah himself because that would necessitate that the sun would be above Allah ( عزّ وجلّ)</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">In this life, we can take shelter in shade ourselves, but on the Day of Resurrection, there will be no shade except the shade Allah ( سبحانه وتعالى ) makes so that whoever he wills can take shelter in his shade when the sun is brought near.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to the closeness of the sun, people will sweat so much that it will rise.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">The Fourth Event</span></strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Sweat Rises</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the sun’s heat, people will sweat profusely in proportion to their deeds. For some, the sweat will rise to their ankles, some to their knees, some to their waists, and for some, the sweat will rise up to their mouths. So individuals will be at different levels regarding their sweat. They will sweat from the intense heat and the extremely uncomfortable situation: crowdedness, extreme hardships, and at close distance to the sun. Still, although people will sweat from the circumstances of that day, their sweat will only be according to their deeds in this life. [<span style="color:#ff0000;">33</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here is a question: How will they be of varying degrees in sweat if people are all together in one place? To answer, we must return to a basic principle of belief. It is that when dealing with affairs of the unseen, events that authentic texts confirm will take place in the future, it is incumbent upon us to believe in them, trusting them to be true without persisting in asking, “How? Why?” These are things beyond the extent of our own intellects; it is not yet possible for us to perceive or fully understand it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imagine two people buried in a single grave, one a believer and the other a disbeliever. The believer will still experience the enjoyment that he deserves, and the disbeliever will experience the punishment he deserves even though they are in the same grave. Likewise, we believe the sweat will rise on the Day of Judgment as foretold.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now are we saying that Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) will gather together someone whose sweat will reach his mouth in a particular place, someone with sweat to his ankles in a different place, and others with sweat rising to their knees or waist in other places? No, not necessarily but Allah knows best. What we are saying is that it is possible for the individual with sweat reaching only to his ankles to be next to someone with his sweat up to his mouth because Allah is capable of doing anything. This is comparable to the fact that light will encompass believers all around them, yet at the same time, disbelievers in Allah will be surrounded by darkness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So regarding the Day of Resurrection, we must believe in it and all that is to occur on that day. As for the “How?” and “Why?” of the exact nature, that is not our right to know. As people suffer on the Day of Resurrection, standing in their own sweat, they will anxiously wait for judgment to begin. And this will only occur by “The Greatest Intercession.”</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">29</span>] The prophet ( صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ ) said in the ḥadīth recorded by Muslim confirming this:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>» تُدْنَى الشَّمْسُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ مِنْ الْخَلْقِ حَتَّى تَكُونَ مِنْهُمْ كَمِقْدَارِ مِيلٍ «</strong></span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>On the Day of Resurrection, the sun will be brought close to creation so much that it will be a “mile” from them.</strong></p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the narrators of the ḥadīth, Sulaym Ibn ‘Āmir, said, “By Allah, I do not know if he meant by <em>mīl</em> the distance of land or the <em>mīl</em> that is used to apply kohl to the eye.”</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">30</span>] The scholar is perhaps alluding to the verse in Sūrah al-Ma’ārij (70:4) in which Allah says,</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">تَعْرُجُ الْمَلَائِكَةُ وَالرُّوحُ إِلَيْهِ فِي يَوْمٍ كَانَ مِقْدَارُهُ خَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ</span></strong></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The angels and the spirit will ascend to him during a day the extent of which is fifty thousand years.</strong></span></p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, the prophet ( صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ) said in a ḥadīth recorded by Muslim:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">مَا مِنْ صَاحِبِ كَنْزٍ لا يُؤَدِّي زَكَاتَهُ إِلاَّ أُحْمِيَ عَلَيْهِ فِي نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ فَيُجْعَلُ صَفَائِحَ فَيُكْوَى بِهَا جَنْبَاهُ وَجَبِينُهُ حَتَّى يَحْكُمَ اللَّهُ بَيْنَ عِبَادِهِ فِي  </span></strong><strong><span style="color:#000000;">يَوْمٍ كَانَ مِقْدَارُهُ خَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ ثُمَّ يَرَى سَبِيلَهُ إِمَّا إِلَى الْجَنَّةِ وَإِمَّا إِلَى النَّارِ</span></strong></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>There is no owner of treasure who does not pay its zakāh (obligated charity), but it will be heated in the fire of Hell and made into plates with which his sides and forehead will be branded until Allah passes judgment between his slaves on a day the length of which will be like fifty thousand years. Then he will be shown his path, whether it leads to Paradise or to Hell.</strong></p>





<p>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">33</span>] This is established by the ḥadīth recorded by Muslim in which the prophet ( صلّى اللّه عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>فَيَكُونُ النَّاسُ عَلَى قَدْرِ أَعْمَالِهِمْ فِي الْعَرَقِ ، فَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ يَكُونُ إِلَى كَعْبَيْهِ ، وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ يَكُونُ إِلَى رُكْبَتَيْهِ ، وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ يَكُونُ إِلَى حَقْوَيْهِ ، وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ يُلْجِمُهُ الْعَرَقُ إِلْجَامًا</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>The people will be in sweat in accordance with their deeds. For some, it will rise to their ankles, some to their knees, some to their waists, and for some of them, the sweat will reach their mouths.</strong></p>

<hr />
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The below Explanation was taken from Tafseer Ibn Katheer, Darusssalam English Publication</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Qari`ah is one of the names of the Day of Judgement, like Al-Haqqah, At-Tammah, As-Sakhkhah, Al-Ghashiyah and other names.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah intensifies concern and fright for it by saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And what will make you know what Al-Qari`ah is</strong></span>) Then He explains this by saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is a Day whereon mankind will be like moths scattered about.</strong></span>) meaning, in their scattering, their dividing, their coming and their going, all due to being bewildered at what is happening to them, they will be like scattered moths. This is like Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As if they were locusts spread abroad</strong></span>.) (54:7) Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the mountains will be like wool, carded</strong></span>.) meaning, they will become like carded wool that has began to wear out (fade away) and be torn apart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Ata&#8217; Al-Khurasani, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi have all said, <strong>(like wool (`Ihn). ) &#8220;Woolen.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah informs about the results received by those who performed the deeds, and the honor and disgrace they will experience based upon their deeds. He says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Then as for him whose Balance will be heavy</strong></span>.) meaning, his good deeds are more than his bad deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He will live a pleasant life</strong></span>.) meaning, in Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong><span style="color:#000000;">But as for him whose Balance will be light.</span></strong>) meaning, his bad deeds are more than his good deeds. Then Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>His mother will be Hawiyah</strong></span>.) It has been said that this means he will be falling and tumbling headfirst into the fire of Hell, and the expression `<strong>his mothe</strong>r&#8217; has been used to refer to his <strong>brain</strong> (as it is the mother of his head). A statement similar to this has been reported from Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Abu Salih and Qatadah. Qatadah said, &#8220;<strong>He will fall into the Hellfire on his head</strong>.&#8221; Abu Salih made a similar statement when he said, &#8220;They will fall into the Fire on their heads.&#8221; It has also been said that it means his mother that he will return to and end up with in the Hereafter will be Hawiyah, which is one of the names of the Hellfire. Ibn Jarir said, &#8220;Al-Hawiyah is only called his mother because he will have no other abode except for it.&#8221; Ibn Zayd said, &#8220;Al-Hawiyah is the Fire, and it will be his mother and his abode to which he will return, and where he will be settled.&#8221; Then he recited the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Their abode will be the Fire.</strong></span>) (3:151) Ibn Abi Hatim said that it has been narrated from Qatadah that he said, &#8220;It is the Fire, and it is their abode.&#8221; Thus, Allah says in explaining the meaning of Al-Hawiyah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And what will make you know what it is</strong></span>). Allah&#8217;s statement</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong><span style="color:#000000;">A fire Hamiyah!</span></strong>) meaning, extreme heat. It is a heat that is accompanied by a strong flame and fire. It is narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>The fire of the Children of Adam that you all kindle is one part of the seventy parts of the fire of Hell</strong>.) They (the Companions) said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Isn&#8217;t it sufficient&#8221; He replied,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>It is more than it by sixty-nine times</strong>.) This has been recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. In some of the wordings he stated,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(It is more than it by sixty-nine times, each of them is like the heat of it</strong>.) It has been narrated in a Hadith that Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>Verily, the person who will receive the lightest torment of the people of the Hellfire will be a man who will have two sandals that will cause his brain to boil.</strong> )&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been confirmed in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>The Hellfire complained to its Lord and said, &#8220;O Lord! Some parts of me devour other parts of me.&#8221; So He (Allah) permitted it to take two breaths: one breath in the winter and one breath in the summer. Thus, the most severe cold that you experience in the winter is from its cold, and the most severe heat that you experience in the summer is from its heat.</strong> )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Two Sahihs it is recorded that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>When the heat becomes intense pray the prayer when it cools down, for indeed the intense heat is from the breath of Hell</strong>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Qari`ah, and all praise and thanks are due to Allah.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whoever denies the Resurrection is a disbeliever, and the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">زَعَمَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا أَن لَّن يُبْعَثُوا ۚ قُلْ بَلَىٰ وَرَبِّي لَتُبْعَثُنَّ ثُمَّ لَتُنَبَّؤُنَّ بِمَا عَمِلْتُمْ ۚ وَذَٰلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Those who disbelieve claim that they will not be resurrected. Say </strong>(O Muhammad)<strong>, ‘Yes, by my Lord you will certainly be resurrected and then you will certainly be informed of the deeds which you did. And that is easy for</strong><strong> Allaah. </strong></span>[64:7] <sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">73</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">73</span>]:<strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying: “<strong>Whoever denies the Resurrection is a disbeliever</strong>…” &#8211; because he has denied a pillar from the pillars of eemaan and because he is denying Allaah and to His Messengers and to His Books because Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, informed about the Resurrection and the Messengers informed about the Resurrection and the Books informed about the Resurrection. So whoever denies it then he is a disbeliever. And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">.. زَعَمَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Those who disbelieve <em>za’ama </em>claim…</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Az –za’m</em> means “a lie” ( a false claim)</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَن لَّن يُبْعَثُوا ..</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">…that they will not be resurrected.</span> </strong>[64:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the aayah proves that denying the Resurrection is <em>kufr</em> (disbelief). They say, “there is no resurrection after death” &#8211; the people of <em>shirk</em> and the worshippers of idols in the time of the Prophet <em>sall Allaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> used to dispute about the Resurrection.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَإِذَا كُنَّا عِظَامًا نَّخِرَةً  &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">قَالُوا تِلْكَ إِذًا كَرَّةٌ خَاسِرَةٌ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“How can that occur when we have become crumbled bones?” They said, “That would be a return resulting in loss.” </strong></span>[79:11-12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَن يُحْيِي الْعِظَامَ وَهِيَ رَمِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Who can give life to the bones when they have crumbled to dust?” </strong></span>[36:78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from their disputing was:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَيَعِدُكُمْ أَنَّكُمْ إِذَا مِتُّمْ وَكُنتُمْ تُرَابًا وَعِظَامًا أَنَّكُم مُّخْرَجُونَ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">هَيْهَاتَ هَيْهَاتَ لِمَا تُوعَدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Does he </strong>(the Prophet Saalih) <strong>promise you that when you have become dust and bones that you will then be brought out anew from your graves? How far fetched, how far fetched is what you are being promised.” </strong></span>[23:35-36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; to the rest of the sayings of the disbelievers from the previous nations and from the people of shirk in the time of the Prophet<em> sall Allaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>. So whoever denies the Resurrection then he will be along with those disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No one denies the Resurrection except for a disbeliever. And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, has commanded His Prophet <em>sall Allaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> to swear an oath by Him upon the Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> قُلْ </span><span style="color:#000000;">بَلَىٰ وَرَبِّي </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say,&#8221;Yes, by my Lord…&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an oath.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> لَتُبْعَثُنَّ ثُمَّ لَتُنَبَّؤُنَّ بِمَا عَمِلْتُمْ ..</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;…you will certainly be resurrected </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(from your graves)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, and then you will certainly be informed of the deeds which you did </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(in the world)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">.&#8221; </span></strong>[64:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This aayah is one of the three <em>aayaat</em> in which Allaah commanded His Prophet to swear an oath upon the Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first aayah is from Soorah Yoonus:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَيَسْتَنبِئُونَكَ أَحَقٌّ هُوَ ۖ <span style="color:#0000ff;">قُلْ إِي وَرَبِّي</span> إِنَّهُ لَحَقٌّ ۖ وَمَا أَنتُم بِمُعْجِزِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they question you, “Is is true?” Say, “Yes, by my Lord, it is indeed true and you cannot render Allaah incapable.” </strong></span>[10:53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second is in Soorah Saba’:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا لَا تَأْتِينَا السَّاعَةُ ۖ <span style="color:#0000ff;">قُلْ بَلَىٰ وَرَبِّي</span> لَتَأْتِيَنَّكُمْ عَالِمِ الْغَيْبِ ۖ لَا يَعْزُبُ عَنْهُ مِثْقَالُ ذَرَّةٍ فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَلَا فِي الْأَرْضِ وَلَا أَصْغَرُ مِن ذَٰلِكَ وَلَا أَكْبَرُ إِلَّا فِي كِتَابٍ مُّبِينٍ لِّيَجْزِيَ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌ وَرِزْقٌ كَرِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And those who disbelieve say, “The Hour will not come upon us.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say, “Yes, by my Lord, the Knower of the hidden and the unseen, it shall certainly come upon you. Not even the amount of the tiniest ant in the Heavens or the Earth escapes Him – nor anything smaller nor anything greater  &#8211; except that it is confirmed in a Clear Book.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">In order that He should reward those who believe and do righteous deeds. For them there will be forgiveness and generous provision.</span></strong> [34:3-4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah commanded His Prophet to swear by Him upon the Resurrection and upon the establishment of the Hour.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the third aayah is that which is with us from Soorah at Taghaabun:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">زَعَمَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا أَن لَّن يُبْعَثُوا ۚ <span style="color:#0000ff;">قُلْ بَلَىٰ وَرَبِّي</span> لَتُبْعَثُنَّ ثُمَّ لَتُنَبَّؤُنَّ بِمَا عَمِلْتُمْ ۚ وَذَٰلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Those who disbelieve claim that Allaah will not resurrect them after death.  </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(O Muhammad)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, ‘Yes, by my Lord you will certainly be resurrected (from your graves), and then you will certainly be informed of the deeds which you did (in the world).  And that is easy for Allaah.</span></strong>[64:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Wisdom behind the Resurrection is recompensing the servants for their deeds. And His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>…then you will certainly be informed…</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning – that you will be informed of your deeds and recompensed for them.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The <em>Hisaab </em>(Account) and The<em> Meezaan (</em>the Balance)</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the Resurrection the people will be brought to <em>hisaab </em>(account) and will be rewarded or punished for their actions.  And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلِلَّهِ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ لِيَجْزِيَ الَّذِينَ أَسَاءُوا بِمَا عَمِلُوا وَيَجْزِيَ الَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُوا بِالْحُسْنَى</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth,So that He may recompense those who did evil for what they did; and that He may reward those who did good with the best reward of Paradise</span>. </strong>[53:31]<strong><sup>[</sup></strong><span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>72</sup></span><strong><sup>]</sup></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">72</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the actions that will occur on the Day of Resurrection is <em>al hisaab</em> (the Reckoning) and<em> al meezaan</em> (the Balance). The <em>hisaab</em> has the meaning of <em>munaaqashah</em> (interrogation) of the people of sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>So the Muslims will be of three categories on the Day of Resurrection:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The first category</strong></span> from them are those who will have no <em>hisaab</em> (reckoning) and will enter Paradise without any reckoning and without any punishment, just as occurs in the hadeeth of the seventy thousand who will enter Paradise without any reckoning and without any punishment.[1]</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[1] Hadeeth reported by al Bukhaaree (5705) and Muslim from the hadeeth of ‘Imraan ibn Husayn <em>radi Allaahu ‘anhu</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The second category</strong> </span>of the people are those who will be given a light reckoning, and it is <em>al-‘ar<u>d</u></em> (presentation of the record) only. He is not taken to account with the reckoning of interrogation but rather will be reckoned such that the record is just presented to him. And this person is also (as well as the first category) one of the people of bliss. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِيَ كِتَابَهُ بِيَمِينِهِ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">فَسَوْفَ يُحَاسَبُ حِسَابًا يَسِيرًا &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَيَنقَلِبُ إِلَىٰ أَهْلِهِ مَسْرُورًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So as for the one who is given his record of deeds in his right hand, then he will soon receive a light reckoning and he will return to his family joyful. </strong></span>[84:7-9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The third category:</strong></span> those who will receive a reckoning involving interrogation and this person is in great danger, because of his <em>sall Allaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Whoever has his record closely examined will be punished.</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Reported by al Bukhaaree (103) and Muslim (2876) from the hadeeth of ‘Aaishah <em>ra<u>d</u>iAllaahu‘anhaa</em>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>As for the <em>kuffaar</em> (disbelievers)</strong></span> then the scholars disagree regarding them: will they receive a reckoning or will they not receive a reckoning? So from the scholars are those who say that the disbelievers will not receive a reckoning because they (the disbelievers) do not have any good deeds. Rather they will be taken straight to the Fire because they have no good deeds. And from the scholars are those who say (that) they will receive a reckoning with a <em>hisaab</em> (reckoning) of <em>taqreer</em> (confession), meaning a (confession) of their deeds, their <em>kufr</em> (disbelief) and their apostasy. Then they will be taken to the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>meezaan</em> (the Balance) means the apparatus upon which the deeds of the people will be weighed. The good deeds will be placed on one scale and the evil deeds on one scale.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَمَن ثَقُلَتْ مَوَازِينُهُ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ </span>&#8211; <span style="color:#000000;">وَمَنْ خَفَّتْ مَوَازِينُهُ فَأُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ خَسِرُوا أَنفُسَهُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So whoever’s balance of good deeds is heavy, then they will be the successful ones. And whoever’s balance of good deeds is light then they are the ones who have caused their own souls to be in loss</span>. </strong>[23:102-103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if the evil deeds outweigh, then the person will lose; and if the good deeds outweigh, then the person will succeed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Balance is a balance for the deeds; and likewise, the person who is given the record in his right hand, then his reckoning will be easy. And whoever is given his record in his left hand, then his reckoning will be difficult and he will see the terrors and the huge dangers and he will go on from one danger to the next in the different stages of the Resurrection, and the Reckoning, and Gathering. These are terrifying matters if we reflect upon them.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Belief in the Resurrection</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And after they have died, the people will be resurrected, and the proof is His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مِنْهَا خَلَقْنَاكُمْ وَفِيهَا نُعِيدُكُمْ وَمِنْهَا نُخْرِجُكُمْ تَارَةً أُخْرَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>From the Earth We created you </strong>(O Mankind)<strong>, and to it We shall return you </strong>(after death)<strong> and from it We shall raise you to life again. </strong></span>[20:55]<sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">70</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">70</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He moved on, to another fundamental principle, which is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>eemaan (true faith) in <em>al-ba’th</em> (the Resurrection)</strong></span> – meaning that death alone is not what is wanted. We know and everyone knows &#8211; even the disbelievers and the atheists and the evil heretics &#8211; all of them know that death will certainly occur. No one denies death, because it is something which is experienced. However the important matter is the Resurrection after death; this is the point of disagreement between the believers and the disbelievers, the Resurrection after death. And it (the Resurrection) is the restoration of the bodies which have rotted away and become decayed bones and dust and which have separated in the Earth. They will be restored and rebuilt just as they were before, because the One who created them in the first place is fully able to bring them back again.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the souls will be blown into them, then they will move and proceed from the graves to the <em>Mahshar</em> (GatheringPlace) because of His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَوْمَ يَخْرُجُونَ مِنَ الْأَجْدَاثِ سِرَاعًا كَأَنَّهُمْ إِلَىٰ نُصُبٍ يُوفِضُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>On the Day when they will come out from the graves, they will be as if they are racing to a finishing post. </strong></span>[70:43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَخْرُجُونَ مِنَ الْأَجْدَاثِ كَأَنَّهُمْ جَرَادٌ مُّنتَشِرٌ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">مُّهْطِعِينَ إِلَى الدَّاعِ ۖ يَقُولُ الْكَافِرُونَ هَٰذَا يَوْمٌ عَسِرٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They will come forth from the graves as if they are scattered locusts, rushing towards the caller. </strong></span>[54:7-8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No one will stay back. So this Resurrection is true, there is no doubt about it. And whoever denies it is a disbeliever in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. And having eemaan in the Resurrection is one of the six pillars of eemaan about which the Prophet <em>sall Allaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“(Eemaan) is that you truly believe in Allaah and in His Angels and in His Books and in His Messengers and in the Last Day  and that you truly believe in Pre-decree, the good of it and the bad of it.”</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Reported by al Bukhaaree (50) and Muslim from the hadeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>i Allaahu ‘anhu </em>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever does not truly believe in the Resurrection and in the Last Day, then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (a disbeliever) in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, even if he bears witness to ‘<em>laa ilaaha ill Allaah</em>’ and that ‘Muhammad <em>rasool ullaah</em>’ and even if he prays and fasts and performs Hajj and gives the <em>Zakaat</em> and does the actions of obedience. If he denies the Resurrection or doubts about it, then he will be a disbeliever in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proofs for the Resurrection are many; from them is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">.. مِنْهَا خَلَقْنَاكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>From it We created you…</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: the Earth, when He created Aadam ‘alaihissalaam, the father of mankind.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">.. وَفِيهَا نُعِيدُكُمْ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And to it We shall return you…</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning; after death, in the graves.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِنْهَا نُخْرِجُكُمْ تَارَةً أُخْرَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And from it We shall bring you out again.</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this aayah includes the beginning and the final return:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مِنْهَا خَلَقْنَاكُمْ وَفِيهَا نُعِيدُكُمْ وَمِنْهَا نُخْرِجُكُمْ تَارَةً أُخْرَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>From it We created you and to it We shall return you and from it We shall bring you out again. </strong></span>[20:55]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also the saying of Allaah, the Most High:<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَاللَّهُ أَنبَتَكُم مِّنَ الْأَرْضِ نَبَاتًا &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ يُعِيدُكُمْ فِيهَا وَيُخْرِجُكُمْ إِخْرَاجًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And Allaah created you from the (dust of) the Earth, then He will cause you to return (to being dust) within the Earth, then He will bring you forth and restore you to</strong><strong> life. </strong></span>[71:17-18] <sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">71</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">71</span>]  <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">.. وَاللَّهُ أَنبَتَكُم مِّنَ الْأَرْضِ نَبَاتًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah created you from the </strong>(dust of)<strong> the Earth…</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When He created Aadam ‘<em>alaihissalaam</em> from it.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">.. </span><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ يُعِيدُكُمْ فِيهَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then He will return you to it…</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Through death and the graves.<em> </em></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَيُخْرِجُكُمْ إِخْرَاجًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He will bring you out from it. </strong></span>[71:17-18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Resurrection. They will come out from the graves and they will proceed to the <em>Ma<u>h</u>-shar</em> (the Gathering Place).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قَالَ فِيهَا تَحْيَوْنَ وَفِيهَا تَمُوتُونَ وَمِنْهَا تُخْرَجُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He said, &#8220;Upon the Earth you will live and upon it you will die and from it you will be brought out.&#8221; </strong></span>[7:25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: you will live upon its surface and you will die upon it and you will come out from it for the Resurrection on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are proofs from the Qur&#8217;aan for the Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also to be found an intellectual proof from the Qur&#8217;aan itself and it is that the One who is able to bring the creation about initially is able to restore the creation even more so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَهُوَ الَّذِي يَبْدَأُ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ وَهُوَ أَهْوَنُ عَلَيْهِ ۚ وَلَهُ الْمَثَلُ الْأَعْلَىٰ فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۚ وَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He</strong> (<strong>Allaah</strong>)<strong> is the One who created the creation to begin with, then He restores it and that is even easier for Him. And for Him is the highest description in the Heavens and the Earth. And He is the All Mighty, the All Wise. </strong></span>[30:27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The One who was able to bring the people into existence from non existence is able to restore them after death even more so. This is a proof which is textual and intellectual.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the proofs for the Resurrection is that which occurs to the Earth with regards to its being brought to life with plants. So you can see the Earth being dead, having no plants upon it, being barren. Then Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, sends down rain upon it, then He causes plants to grow which were dead stubble previously. Likewise the bodies which are within the Earth; they were stored within the Earth and Allaah will send down rain upon them and then the bodies will grow and become complete. And then the souls will be breathed into them. So indeed you see the Earth, how it can be dry and arid, but then it comes to life with that (vegetation) which grows from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Majestic and Most High – He is the One who gives life to the Earth after its death:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِنْ آيَاتِهِ أَنَّكَ تَرَى الْأَرْضَ خَاشِعَةً فَإِذَا أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْهَا الْمَاءَ اهْتَزَّتْ وَرَبَتْ ۚ إِنَّ الَّذِي أَحْيَاهَا لَمُحْيِي الْمَوْتَىٰ ۚ إِنَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And from His signs is that you see the Earth dry and barren. Then when We send down water upon it, it rises and stirs to life with vegetation. The One who gives life to it will certainly give life to the dead. Indeed He has full ability over everything</span>. </strong>[41:39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the One who has ability over giving life to the Earth after its death is able to give life to the bodies after their death because both are cases of coming to life after death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the proofs for the Resurrection is that if were to be no Resurrection then that would necessitate that the creation of Mankind was meaningless because they (the people) live  &#8211;  the obedient, dutiful, believer in Allaah and His Messengers live;  and the disbeliever, the atheist, the evil heretic, the wicked tyrant, the arrogant one, the sinner live – all of them live and then they die, without this believer receiving anything from his reward or without this disbeliever and this evil heretic and this atheist and this tyrannical oppressor of the people receiving any of his recompense whatsoever?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So does this befit Allaah that He would leave the people in this manner without rewarding the people of eemaan for their eemaan, and the people who did good for their good, and the people of crimes and disbelief for their crimes and <em>kufr</em>? This would not befit the Wisdom of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, and therefore He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلِلَّهِ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ لِيَجْزِيَ الَّذِينَ أَسَاءُوا بِمَا عَمِلُوا وَيَجْزِيَ الَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُوا بِالْحُسْنَى</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And to Allaah belongs whatever is in the Heavens and in the Earth, so that He will recompense those who did evil for what they did and He will reward those who did good with the best reward. </strong></span>[53:31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this will not occur except on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise in His saying, He the Perfect:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَمْ حَسِبَ الَّذِينَ اجْتَرَحُوا السَّيِّئَاتِ أَن نَّجْعَلَهُمْ كَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ سَوَاءً مَّحْيَاهُمْ وَمَمَاتُهُمْ ۚ سَاءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And do those who commit evil deeds think that We will treat them just the same as those who believe and do righteous deeds in their life and in their death? Evil is the judgment that they make. </strong></span>[45:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And, He the Perfect and Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَمْ نَجْعَلُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ كَالْمُفْسِدِينَ فِي الْأَرْضِ أَمْ نَجْعَلُ الْمُتَّقِينَ كَالْفُجَّارِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Shall We make those who truly believe and who do righteous deeds just like those who cause corruption upon the Earth? Or shall We make those who are dutiful to Allaah just the same as the wicked evil doers? </strong></span>[38:28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Perfect and Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَفَحَسِبْتُمْ أَنَّمَا خَلَقْنَاكُمْ عَبَثًا وَأَنَّكُمْ إِلَيْنَا لَا تُرْجَعُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do you think that We created you without purpose and that you will not be returned to Us? </strong></span>[23:115]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَيَحْسَبُ الْإِنسَانُ أَن يُتْرَكَ سُدًى &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">أَلَمْ يَكُ نُطْفَةً مِّن مَّنِيٍّ يُمْنَىٰ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ كَانَ عَلَقَةً فَخَلَقَ فَسَوَّىٰ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">فَجَعَلَ مِنْهُ الزَّوْجَيْنِ الذَّكَرَ وَالْأُنثَىٰ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">أَلَيْسَ ذَٰلِكَ بِقَادِرٍ عَلَىٰ أَن يُحْيِيَ الْمَوْتَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Does man think that he will be left without having duties placed upon him? Was he not a drop of sperm emitted? Then he was a clot of blood and Allaah created him and fully formed him? And produced from him offspring, male and female? Is the One who did that not able to give life to the dead?</span> </strong>[75:36-40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He rebutted the disbeliever who said,</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَن يُحْيِي الْعِظَامَ وَهِيَ رَمِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Who will give life to the bones when they are decayed away? </strong></span>[36:78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ يُحْيِيهَا الَّذِي أَنشَأَهَا أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ ۖ وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ خَلْقٍ عَلِيمٌ  &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُم مِّنَ الشَّجَرِ الْأَخْضَرِ نَارًا فَإِذَا أَنتُم مِّنْهُ تُوقِدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “He who created him in the first place will give life to him; and He has full knowledge of every created thing. He who produces fire for you from the green tree, then you use it to light your own fires</span>. </strong>[36:78-80]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The One who is able to bring out fire which burns from a fresh green tree &#8211; is He not able to give life to the dead?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the evidences for the Resurrection is using as evidence the creation of the Heavens and the Earth. So the One who created these tremendously huge and awesome created things is fully able to restore man to life because the One who is able to do something tremendous will be able to do something less, even more so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَوَلَيْسَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ بِقَادِرٍ عَلَىٰ أَن يَخْلُقَ مِثْلَهُم ۚ بَلَىٰ وَهُوَ الْخَلَّاقُ الْعَلِيمُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Is the One who created the Heavens and the Earth not able to create the like of them? Yes, indeed! And He is the All Knowing Creator who creates again and again.</strong></span> [36:81]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَخَلْقُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ أَكْبَرُ مِنْ خَلْقِ النَّاسِ وَلَٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The creation of the Heavens and the Earth is greater than the creation of mankind. However most of mankind do not know.</strong></span> [40:57]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are the evidences for the Resurrection which confirm that Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, will resurrect those who are in the graves and that He will recompense every doer of deeds in accordance with his deeds; if good, then with good and if evil, then with evil. So let the disbeliever disbelieve and let the wicked person and the evil heretic and the apostate be upon evil – because in front of him there lies the Resurrection and the Rising from death and the Recompensing and the Reckoning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the believer, the one who is dutiful to Allaah, who worships Allaah and seeks to draw closer to Allaah, then his deeds will never be lost. For there is an appointment where Allaah will recompense him for his deeds and will give him multiplied reward and will give him things that he did not think of or expect.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lessons 38 : Point 51</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in the <em>Qi<u>s</u>aa<u>s</u></em> (retribution) on the Day of Resurrection between all of the creation; the descendants of Aadam, the beasts of prey, the reptiles, even between the tiniest ants until Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic brings about retribution between them. For the People of Paradise from the People of the Fire and for the People of the Fire from the People of Paradise and for the People of Paradise from each other and for the People of the Fire from each other. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F376101761&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/eemaan-in-the-qisaasretribution-on-the-dayofresurrection-between-all-of-the-creation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is already preceded that Allaah will resurrect the creation on the Day of Resurrection in order to recompense them for <strong><em>jazaa</em></strong>· (to give them their due reward), in order to recompense them for their good deeds and their evil deeds with regard to the descendants of Aadam. And for <strong><em>Qi<u>s</u>aa<u>s</u></em> </strong>(retribution/revenge/retaliation ) to be established with regard to again the descendants of Aadam and for the animals. So, the animals will be resurrected for <em>Qi<u>s</u>aa<u>s</u> </em>(retaliation) only, whereas the descendants of Aadam will be resurrected for jazaa (recompensing) and <em>Qi<u>s</u>aa<u>s</u></em> (retaliation) between them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And to have <em>eemaan</em> in the retribution on the Day of Resurrection between all of the creation; the descendants of Aadam, the beasts of prey and the animals,” </strong>all of them will be raised for <em>al-Qi<u>s</u>aa<u>s</u></em> (retribution) between them. As for the animals then when vengeance has been taken from some for others then they will end up being turned to dust. But as for the descendants of Aadam then they will be in two groups; a group will be in Paradise and a group will be in a Blazing Fire and they will not die after that ever. They will remain forever either in Paradise or in the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Even to the extent that retaliation will be taken for the tiniest ant from the other tiniest ant,” </strong>to the extent that <em>a<u>th</u>&#8211;<u>th</u>arrah</em> (tiniest ant) will gain vengeance over each other because Allaah does not consent to <em><u>z</u>ulm</em> (oppression) ever because He is the most just and wise of Judges and He is the most just Arbitrator. He does not consent to <em><u>z</u>ulm</em> (oppression) even between the animals and the tiny ant. On the Day of Resurrection they will be resurrected and vengeance will be taken for some upon others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <em>mu&#8217;minoon</em> (believers) and the first matter concerning which retribution will be taken between them on the Day of Resurrection will be with regard to the shedding of blood from the rights of mankind and they’ll take revenge upon each other after they have crossed over the <em><u>s</u>iraat</em> (bridge) of the Hellfire and before they enter into Paradise. They will be stopped and retribution will be taken from some in favour of others. And then when they have been cleansed and purified, permission will be given to them to enter into Paradise because no-one will enter Paradise whilst he has any act of oppression due upon him. Because Paradise is the abode of those who are good and pure and no-one will enter it except those who are good and pure, those who have no reckoning left upon them nor anything owed to anyone else nor any sins to the extent that the believer who is sinful will be punished in the Fire in accordance with the level of sin or otherwise Allaah will pardon him in accordance with His wish and will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاءُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah does not forgive that <em>shirk</em> is committed with Him but He forgives whatever is less than that to whomever He wishes. </strong></span>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), <em>aayah</em> 48)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to any sins that are less than <em>shirk</em>, if He wishes, He will forgive him and if He wishes, He will punish him in accordance with the level of his sins until he becomes clean and purified from sins then he will enter into Paradise. So, no-one will enter into Paradise except one who is pure, be it by recompensing or by punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“To the extent that Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic will bring about retribution between them for some from others and for the People of Paradise from the People of the Fire and for the People of the Fire from the People of Paradise,” </strong>so, the believer if he has wronged the disbeliever then retribution will be taken for the disbeliever on the Day of Resurrection and vice versa. The disbeliever if he has wronged the believer then retribution will be taken for the believer on the Day of Resurrection. So, no-one will be just left having acts of oppression left upon him and to the extent that the believer will be avenged upon the believer.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> then he said with regard to this point, “There occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth that Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic will call out on the Day of resurrection and say “al-Malik and ad-Dayyaan (I am the King, I am the One Who brings about retribution) and it is not befitting that anyone from the People of the Fire should enter the Fire whilst he has anything due from the People of Paradise that is due to him nor is it befitting for anyone from the People of Paradise to enter Paradise whilst there is any right due from him for someone from the People of the Fire until I take retribution for him even if it is for a single slap.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>So we (companions) said, “How will it be when it is the case that we will come to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic naked, uncircumcised and empty-handed?”. </strong></span><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>said, “with good deeds and bad deeds.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Jaabir ibn `Abdillaah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhuma</em> and declared authentic by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is important is that they will not enter the Paradise or the Fire until the rights have been be taken from them for each other. Then when they have been purified and cleansed and the People of Paradise will be entered into Paradise and the People of the Fire enter the Fire and success is granted by Allaah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 19 : Point 19</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And to have eemaan in the siraat </span></strong><span style="color:#993300;">(the Bridge)</span><strong><span style="color:#993300;"> over the Hellfire. The Bridge will seize whomever Allaah wishes. And whoever Allaah wishes will cross over. And whoever Allaah wishes will fall into the Hellfire. And they will have lights in accordance with the level of their eemaan.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F365778335&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/eemaan-in-the-siraat-the-bridge-over-the-hellfire" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From that which will occur on the Day of Resurrection is the passing over the <em>siraat</em> (Bridge) as has already been mentioned. And the siraat, in the language means <em>at-tareeq</em> (a path). And what is meant here is the Bridge laid down over the top of the Hellfire. And it will be very thin, thinner than a hair and sharper than a sword and hotter than burning coals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The creation will pass over it in accordance with the level of their deeds. Their deeds will cause them to proceed. So whoever is saved then he has succeeded and whoever is not saved is destroyed. And the people crossing over it will be in accordance with the level of their deeds. So some of them will cross over like the blinking of the eye. And some of them will cross over like the flash of lightening. And some of them will cross over like the wind. And some of them will cross over like fast horses. And some of them will cross over like riders upon camels. And some of them will run, running upon feet. And some of them will walk. And some of them will crawl. And some of them will be seized and thrown down into the Hellfire. And this is mentioned in the Honourable Qur&#8217;aan and in the Prophetic Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So by your Lord We shall certainly gather them and the devils. Then We shall bring them around the Hellfire upon their knees.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Up until His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is not one of you except that he will have to cross over it. It is a binding decree from your Lord.</span> </strong>(Soorah Maryam (19), aayahs 68-71)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(‘Cross over it’)</strong> meaning the Hellfire. And this crossing, it is the crossing over the siraat, the Bridge. This is the crossing which is mentioned in the Qur&#8217;aan. And the address here is to the believers and to other than them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is not one of you except that he will have to cross over it. The believers and the disbelievers and the hypocrites will cross over it. All of the creation will cross over this Bridge. So whoever is saved from it (crosses it successfully) then he will enter Paradise. And whoever falls down is destroyed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Then We will save those who had taqwaa </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(those who were fearful of Allaah and dutiful to Him)</span> (Soorah Maryam (19), aayah 72)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nothing will bring about salvation except for <em><strong>taqwaa</strong> </em>(dutifulness to Allaah). Strength of body will not save nor will having plentiful wealth nor will status. Nothing will bring about salvation except taqwaa (being dutiful) to Allaah the Perfect and Most High. This is the textual statement in the Honourable Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And ahaadeeth occur in the Sunnah regarding the terrors of the Resurrection. And from them is the crossing over the siraat, the Bridge. So it is essential to have eemaan in the Bridge and in the crossing over it. And it is not sufficient to just believe in that; rather there must be action. So therefore a person should prepare for the crossing over it by having taqwaa (by being dutiful to Allaah); and that is righteous deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“The Bridge will seize whomever Allaah wishes and whoever Allaah wishes will cross over.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then We shall save those who were dutiful to Allaah and We will leave the disbelieving wrongdoers in the Hellfire upon their knees</strong></span> (Soorah Maryam (19), aayah 72)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because the siraat will have hooks upon it that will seize whomever they are commanded to seize.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“he will cross”</strong>. Meaning he will pass over it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And they (the people) will have light in accordance with the level of their eemaan.”</strong> On the Day of Resurrection, the people of eemaan (true believers), they will have light. And they will walk within it. Just as He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Their light will run before them. And their books will be in their right hands. They will say O our Lord, complete our light for us and forgive us. Indeed you have full ability over everything</strong></span> (Sooratut-Tahreem (66), aayah 8)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The Day when you shall see the believing men and the believing women with their light running before them and their books will be in their right hands. It will be said to them, glad tidings to you this day of gardens beneath which rivers flow. You will remain therein forever. That is the tremendous success.</strong> </span>(Sooratul-Hadeed (57), aayah 12)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The munafiqoon (hypocrites)</strong> will be given light initially, because of the fact that they entered into Islaam and they outwardly displayed Islaam (in the world). So therefore they will be treated in accordance with what they outwardly showed. They will be given light, but it will be as a trick, just as they sought to trick with their Islaam. So therefore they will be given light as a trick upon them and then their light will be extinguished and they will remain in darkness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">On the Day when the hypocrites men and women will say to the believers: &#8220;Wait for us! Let us get something from your light!&#8221; It will be said: &#8220;Go back to your rear! Then seek a light!&#8221; So a wall will be put up between them, with a gate therein. Inside it will be mercy, and outside it will be torment.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(The hypocrites)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> will call the believers: &#8220;Were we not with you?&#8221; The believers will reply: &#8220;Yes! But you led yourselves into temptations, you looked forward for our destruction; you doubted </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(in Faith)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">; and you were deceived by false desires, till the Command of Allah came to pass. And the chief deceiver </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Satan)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> deceived you in respect of Allah.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So this Day no ransom shall be taken from you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(hypocrites)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, nor of those who disbelieved, </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">. Your abode is the Fire, that is the proper place for you, and worst indeed is that destination.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Hadeed (57), aayahs 13 &#8211; 15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So eemaan will have light on the Day of Resurrection within which the person will proceed. Whereas the disbelievers and the hypocrites will be in darkness, and Allaah’s refuge is sought. They will not know where they are going.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 18 : Point 18</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And to have <em>eemaan</em> in the Intercession (the Shafaa`ah) of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> on the Day of Resurrection for those guilty of sins; and upon the Bridge (as-Siraat), and to cause them to come out from within the Hell Fire. There is no Prophet except that he will have Intercession. And likewise will be the case with the eminently truthful and sincere followers of the Prophets, and the martyrs and the righteous people. And after that Allaah will bestow favour abundantly upon whomever He wishes; and people will come out of the Fire after they have been burnt and reduced to charcoal.</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/eemaan-in-the-intercession-of-allaahs-messenger-on-the-day-of-resurrection" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the fundamentals of the (creed and belief of) Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah is <em>eemaan</em> in ash-Shafaa`ah (the Intercession) with the preconditions which are mentioned by Allaah the Majestic and Most High. That it has to be with His Permission, and that the one being interceded for is from the people of <em>eemaan</em>. As for the one who is interceded for being from the people who are disbelievers, then Intercession will not be accepted for him. He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So the Intercession of those who intercede will not benefit them (the disbelievers).</span></strong> (Sooratul-Muddaththir (74), aayah 48)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The disbelieving wrongdoers will have no close friend nor any intercessor who will be given heed to</span></strong>. (Soorah Ghaafir (40), aayah 18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the disbeliever, there will never be any Intercession for him ever. As for the believer, then Intercession is established for him if Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, grants permission. And the greatest of the intercessors and the Noble Chief of those who intercede will be our Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So he will have Intercessions which will be specific to him and also Intercessions which he shares along with others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And to have <em>eemaan</em> in the Intercession of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> for those guilty of sins on the Day of Resurrection; and upon the Bridge (Siraat)”</strong>. The Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is the greatest one of those who will intercede on the Day of Resurrection. Indeed he will intercede for all of the people upon the standing place, so that Allaah relieves them from the standing and brings them to account; because the standing will be prolonged for them. Along with severe distress and severe heat and severe thirst and extreme fear, the standing will be prolonged for them, the standing of the Hashr, the Gathering. So therefore they will go to Oolil-`Azm, those Messengers who are firmest in resolve, and request from them that they should supplicate to Allaah to relieve them of the standing, so that they go either to Paradise or to the Fire. So they will go to Aadam and he will excuse himself. And they will go to Nooh and he will excuse himself. And they will go to Ibraaheem and he will excuse himself. And they will go to Moosaa and he will excuse himself. And they will go to `Eesaa and he will excuse himself. And they will go to Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and he will say, “I am the one for it.” Then he will go and he will fall down in prostration beneath the `Arsh, the Throne because there will be no intercession for anyone except with the permission of Allaah. Therefore he will fall down in prostration and make supplication to his Lord until it is said to him, “<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O Muhammad raise your head. Ask and you will be given. Intercede and your intercession will be accepted</strong></span>.” [03] So Allaah will grant permission for him to intercede and he will intercede on behalf of the people of the gathering place for them to move on from the gathering place to the <em>Hisaab</em>, Reckoning. This is <strong>ash-Shafaa`atul-Uzmaa</strong>, the Major Intercession which Allaah will favour him with over the creation. He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And during the night pray tahajjud as an extra Prayer for you. Your Lord shall certainly raise you to a praiseworthy standing place.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Israa· (17), aayah 79)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This praiseworthy standing place (<strong>al-maqaamul-mahmood</strong>) is ash-Shafaa`atul-Uzmaa, the Major Intercession. And there occurs in the supplication which is said after the athaan,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><strong>Grant Muhammad al-waseelah (the place of honour in Paradise) and al-fadeelah (the position of superior virtue) and raise him to maqaamam-mahmoodaa (the praiseworthy standing place) which you have promised him.</strong></em> [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is ash-Shafaa`atul-Uzmaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise he will intercede with regard to the people guilty of major sins from the nation. He <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> will intercede for them that, either they do not enter the Fire, or otherwise that they be brought out from it if they do enter it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> will intercede for them, and this is not specific to him. So he will intercede, and all of the Prophets will intercede. And the owliyaa· (beloved and obedient servants of Allaah) will intercede and the afraat, they are those who die young, they will intercede for those Muslims who are guilty of major sins. This point is contrary to the Jahmiyyah and the Mu`tazilah and the Khawaarij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Khawaarij, they are those who rebel against the rulers, the rulers of the Muslims, by using the sword, and they break the due obedience. And they are also those who declare a Muslim to be a disbeliever on account of major sins which are less than shirk. They are the Khawaarij. They were called Khawaarij (literally those who depart or exit or revolt) because they depart from what is legislated and they revolt against the person in authority and they break the due obedience. Those people deny the Intercession and they say, “Whoever enters the Fire will never come out from it.” And they use as evidence His saying, He, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They will not come out from the Hell Fire</strong></span> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 167)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we say: This is with regard to the <em>kuffaar</em> (disbelievers). So the disbelievers will never come out from the Fire. But as for the Intercession which is meant here, then it is with regard to the people of <em>eemaan</em>, those who are believers who are guilty of major sins; and it is established. And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Who (none) can intercede with Him (Allaah) except with His permission</strong> </span>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 255)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It indicates that only if He grants permission can anyone intercede. And likewise His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And how many angels there are in the heavens whose Intercession will not benefit at all except after Allaah grants permission for whomever He wishes and is pleased with.</span></strong> (Sooratun-Najm (53), aayah 26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">This contains the two conditions for the Shafaa`ah</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">That Allaah grants permission; this is the first condition and</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">That He is pleased, this is the second condition, He is pleased with the one who is being interceded for. And He is not pleased except with a believer. As for the disbeliever, He will not be pleased with him.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So those who contradict the people of the Sunnah with regard to the Intercession take two opposite positions. From them are those who deny the Intercession. And they are the Khawaarij and the Mu`tazilah, those who declare people to be disbelievers on account of major sins which are less than shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the second group are those who go beyond the limits in affirming Intercession. And they are the Soofees and the grave worshippers, those who depend totally upon Intercession and who turn to the graves and who seek aid from the dead. They seek intercession from them, (from the dead). Just as He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they worship besides Allaah others who cannot harm them nor benefit them and they say, “Those are our intercessors with Allaah.”</strong></span> (Soorah Yoonus (10), aayah 18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They worship them in order that they should intercede for them with Allaah. As for those who take the middle position, and they are the Ahlus-Sunnah walJamaa`ah, they do not deny Intercession totally and they do not affirm it unrestrictedly. Rather they affirm it with the two conditions which occur in the Book and the Sunnah. This is the conclusion on the topic of the Intercession.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, <strong>“And Intercession is established for those who are sinful, guilty of sins.”</strong> Meaning Intercession will be for the believers who are guilty of sins. Those who do not reach the level of <em>kufr</em>, disbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And it will occur upon the Siraat (Bridge) over the Fire.”</strong> Meaning:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> will intercede for the believers whilst they are crossing the Bridge</strong>. And he will intercede for those who have entered the Fire that they should be brought out from it, if they are from the people of towheed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he will intercede upon the Bridge when the people are passing over it, and it is the Bridge which will be laid across the upper part of the Hell Fire. The people will cross over it in accordance with their deeds. So some of them will cross over it in the blinking of an eye. And some of them will cross over it like lightening. And some of them will cross over it like the passing of the wind. And some will cross over it like fast horses. And some will cross over it like the riders of camels. And some will be running over it. And some will be walking. And some will be crawling. And some will be snatched from it and thrown down into the Fire. All of the creation will have to pass over this Bridge, the believers and the disbelievers. And nothing will render them safe except for their deeds. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There is not one of you except that he will have to cross over it</strong></span> (Soorah Maryam (19), aayah 71)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning over the Bridge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">It is a binding decree from your Lord. Then We will rescue those who were dutiful to Allaah and We will leave the wrongdoing disbelievers upon their knees in the Hell Fire.</span> </strong>(Soorah Maryam (19), aayahs 71-72)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So no one will be saved except for the people of taqwaa, dutifulness to Allaah. As for the disbelievers then they will be destroyed in the Fire, and Allaah’s refuge is sought. This is the Siraat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And after that Allaah will bestow Favour abundantly upon whomever He wishes.”</strong> And Allaah will bring out from the Fire some of the believers without the Intercession of those who intercede. Rather by His Favour (<em>fadl</em>), He, the Perfect and Most High. He will bring out some people from the Fire by His <em>fadl</em>, by His Favour, He the Perfect, without the Intercession of anyone, rather just by His <em>fadl</em>, His Favour, He the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying,<strong> “And people will come out from the Fire after they have been burnt and turned to charcoal.”</strong> Allaah the Majestic and Most High informed that the people of the Fire who are to remain forever in it will not die in it nor will they live.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So remind if the reminding will benefit. Those who fear Allaah will take heed of the reminder. But the wretched will avoid it. The one who will enter the Great Fire, then he will not die in it nor will he live.</span></strong> (Sooratul-A`laa (87), aayah 9-13)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the person who does not accept the reminder and does not accept the admonition and continues upon his misguidance, this one will enter Hell Fire; and he will remain in it. And he will not live a life which allows him to rest, and he will not die a death which gives him relief, rather he will remain in torment. But as for the person who enters it from the disobedient people of towheed, then he will be burnt and turned to charcoal. And then he will come out from the Hell Fire and he will be placed in a river, the River of Life, and their bodies will grow. And when their bodies are completed, then permission will be granted for them to enter Paradise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 18 : Point 17</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have eemaan in the howd (Reservoir/great body of water/lake) of Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. And every Prophet will have a Reservoir except for Saalih `alayhis-salaam, for his Reservoir will be the udder of his she-camel.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F365277362&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/eemaan-in-the-hawd-reservoir-lake-of-allaahs-messenger" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise from the usool, fundamentals, of the Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah is to have eemaan in the howd (Reservoir). So the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam will have a howd, a Reservoir, and every Prophet from the Prophets will have a howd, a reservoir of water, which his nation will come to drink from. Because the people will suffer severe thirst (on the Day of Resurrection after the standing). They will need water. And the Reservoir of our Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam will be the greatest of the reservoirs. Its length is a month (the length of a month’s journey) and its width is that of a month. Its water will be whiter than milk and sweeter than honey and its drinking vessels will be the number of the stars in the sky. Whoever drinks a single drink from it, will never become thirsty after it. [01] And the apostates, who apostasized (left Islaam) after the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam will be pushed away from it. And whoever denied it, and Allaah knows best, will also be pushed away from it from the people of innovations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, <strong>“And every Prophet will have a Reservoir except for Saalih `alayhis-salaam, for his Reservoir will be the udder of his she-camel.”</strong> This exception is not established as far as I know. And what is actually correct is that every Prophet will have a howd as occurs in the hadeeth. [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] There is reported with regard to this (howd) ahaadeeth which are mutawaatir (reported by huge numbers of people at every level of transmission; such a huge number that they could not have got together and made it up). So from them is that which Imaam Muslim reports in his Saheeh (no. 2292) from `Abdullaah ibn `Amr ibn al-`Aas radiyAllaahu`anhumaa who said, “Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘My howd (Reservoir) will have the distance of a month and its sides will be equal. Its water will be whiter than silver and its fragrance will be better than musk, and its drinking cups will be like the stars of the sky. So whoever drinks from it then he will never ever become thirsty after it.’”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Another hadeeth) reported by Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 247) from Aboo Hurayrah radiyAllaahu`anhu that Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“My howd (Reservoir) is larger than the distance from Aylah to `Adn. It is indeed whiter than snow and sweeter than honey in milk, and its drinking vessels will be more than the number of the stars. And I will repel people away from it just as a man repels the camels of other people away from his reservoir.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>They said, “O Messenger of Allaah, will you recognize us on that day? He said, </strong><strong>“Yes. You will have a mark which no one from the other nations has. You will come to me with white marks upon your foreheads and limbs from the traces of wudoo·. And a group from you will be repelled away from me so that you do not reach. So I will say, ‘O my Lord, those are companions of mine. So an angel will respond to me and say, ‘Do you know what they did after you departed?’”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] This occurs from a hadeeth of Samarah ibn Jundub radiyAllaahu`anhu who said, “Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Every Prophet shall have a howd, and they will boast about which of them has the most people who come to drink. And I hope that I will be the one having the most people who come to drink from it.” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by al-Bukhaaree in his book at-Taareekhul-Kabeer and by at-Tirmithee and Ibn Abee `Aasim and at-Tabaraanee; and declared authentic by al-Haafiz al-Mizzee due to its different chains of narration, as was mentioned by Ibn Katheer in his Tafseer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> This hadeeth was declared saheeh authentic by Shaykh al-Albaanee rahimahullaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Saalih as Suhaymee hafizahullaah said in his explanation,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The saying of the author that Saalih, his Reservoir will be the udder of his she camel, this is a point requiring to be looked at because there is no authentic proof for it.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaanee rahimahullaah in his book Silsilatul-Ahaadeeth ad-Da`eefah brings a couple of narrations in that regard (no. 771 and 772) which are not authentic about that. And he judged that these two ahaadeeth are mowdoo` (fabricated). The same was said by Ibnul-Jawzee in his book al Mowdoo`aat and Imaam ath-Thahabee in his book Meezaanul-I`tidaal.</p>

<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And to have eemaan in the Balance on the Day of Resurrection. Upon it good and evil will be weighed. It has two scales/balance plates, and a pointer.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F364774649&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/eemaan-in-the-balance-meezaan-on-the-day-of-resurrection" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the issues of `aqeedah (creed and belief) is having eemaan in the Balance (the <em>meezaan</em>) with which the deeds of the servants will be weighed on the Day of Resurrection. He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the weighing on that Day (on the Day of Resurrection) will be true. So whoever’s scale of good deeds is heavier, then they will be the successful ones. And whoever’s scale of good deeds is lighter, then they are the ones who will have lost their own selves on account of their rejecting our signs.</strong> </span>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), aayahs 8-9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the other aayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They will lose their own selves remaining forever in the Hellfire.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Mu·minoon (23), aayah 103)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the scale of good deeds is heavier, then the servant will be blissful and successful. But if the opposite is the case and the evil deeds are heavier, the servant will be destroyed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So whoever’s scale of good deeds is heavy, then he will live a pleasant life in Paradise. And whoever’s scale of good deeds is lighter, then he will have his abode in the pit of Hell. And what will explain to you what is the pit of Hell. It is a blazing hot fire.</strong></span> (Sooratul-Qaari`ah (101), aayahs 6-11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is from the justice of Allaah the Majestic and Most High, that He will weigh the good deeds and the bad deeds with a balance which they will see, a physical balance which has two balance plates; and it has a pointer. The good deeds will be placed on one balance plate and the evil deeds will be placed on one balance plate, as is indicated in the Book and the Sunnah, contrary to the Mu`tazilah, those who say, “What is meant by scales (al-mawaazeen) and the balance (al-meezaan) is the establishment of justice, but there is actually no physical balance there.” This is based upon their false and futile position because they rely upon their intellect and they do not place reliance upon the texts. So the balance is something real. It will have two balance plates as occurs in the authentic ahaadeeth. [01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Good and evil will be weighed upon it.”</strong> Meaning good deeds and evil deeds. His saying, “It will have two scales and a pointer”. It will have two balance plates as occurs in the ahaadeeth. The good deeds will be placed on one scale and the evil deeds on one scale, as occurs in the hadeeth of <em><strong>bitaaqah</strong> </em>(hadeeth of the parchment) with regard to the story of the person who will have ninety-nine scrolls. Every scroll from them will stretch as far as the eye can see and will be filled with evil deeds. So it will be said to him, “Do you have any good deed?” So he will say, “No O my Lord.” So he will see the tremendous size of these large scrolls and he will say, “No O my Lord.” So it will be said, “Rather you will not be wronged; you have one good deed with Us.” So a parchment will be brought containing the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and the testification that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah. And it will be placed on one scale and the scrolls will be placed on the other scale. And the parchment will outweigh and the scrolls will be lighter. So he will enter into Paradise.[02] [03] This is a proof that there will be two balance plates for this Balance upon which the deeds will be placed on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And it has a pointer”</strong> <em>Lisaanul-meezaan</em> (the pointer of the balance) is well known to the people. They call it the heart of the balance, that which leans to the right or to the left. And if the two balance plates are equal, then the heart of the balance will be levelled. And if one scale outweighs, then the pointer will point towards it. [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] Abul-Hasan al-Ash`aree mentioned in (his book) Maqaalaat al-Islaamiyyeen, “The people of the Truth said (speaking about the Balance), ‘It has a pointer and two balance plates. On one of the scales good deeds will be weighed, and on the other the evil deeds’&#8230;Whereas the people of innovation they negate the Balance and they say, ‘Scales does not mean scales and pointers but rather it is metaphorical, just meaning that Allaah will recompense them for their deeds, measure for measure.’ And they denied the balance.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] This hadeeth is the hadeeth of `Abdullaah ibn `Amr who said, “Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu ` alayhi wa sallam said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">‘A man from my nation will be called out in front of the whole of the creation on the Day of Resurrection. So ninety-nine scrolls will be laid out for him. Each of the scrolls will be as far as the eye can see. Then it will be said, “Do you deny anything from this?” So he will say, “No, O my Lord.” So it will be said, “Do you have any excuse or any good deed?” So the man will fear and he will say, “No.” So it will be said: “Yes indeed, you have good deeds with Us. You will not be wronged with regard to them.” So a parchment will be brought out for him containing, ‘I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger. So he will say, “O my Lord, what is this parchment in comparison to those scrolls?” So it will be said, “You will not be wronged.” So the scrolls will be placed on one scale and that parchment will be placed on one scale. So the scrolls will be lighter and the parchment will outweigh.’”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Ibnul-Mubaarak in his book az-Zuhd and in his Musnad and by Imaam Ahmad and by at-Tirmithee and Ibn Maajah and others besides.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh al-Albaanee declared this hadeeth saheeh, authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee hafizahullaah mentioned some points of benefit with regard to this hadeeth. He said, “The hadeeth contains a number of points of benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>The first benefit</strong> is that the people of sins will be beneath al-mashee·ah (Allaah’s Will and Wish). If Allaah wishes He will forgive them by His favour. And if He wishes He will punish them by His justice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>The second point of benefit</strong> is that whoever is such that his eemaan (true belief) and his towheed is strong, and his attachment to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, this fact may be a means for wiping away all of his evil deeds. And there is no clearer proof for this than the fact that this small parchment will outweigh and overcome all of the rest of the scrolls.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>The third point of benefit</strong> is that the person who is guilty of major sin, he does not become a disbeliever, as the Khawaarij and the Mu`tazilah claimed. Rather he is beneath mashee·atullaah (the Wish and Will of Allaah). So even if he is punished, then still he will not remain forever in the Fire. “The fourth point of benefit is the tremendous virtue of Laa ilaaha illAllaah, none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah over the rest of deeds. So when a Muslim says it, knowing its meaning and acting in accordance with it, then that is the case, tremendous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>The fifth point of benefit</strong> is establishment of al-meezaan (Balance of deeds) with which the deeds will be weighed on the Day of Resurrection, and that it is a balance which is true and real. It will be erected on the Open Plane of the Resurrection before the passing over the Siraat (Bridge). This is the most correct of the sayings which the People of Knowledge mention.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee rahimahullaah said in explanation of this point, “As for the lisaan (the pointer) then it is a point (spike) through which it is known which way the balance inclines.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 16 : Point 14</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And to have Eemaan in seeing Allaah on the Day of Resurrection. They will see Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, with the eyes of their heads. And He will bring them to account without any mediator </span></strong>[01]<strong><span style="color:#993300;"> or any interpreter.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F364407587&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-believers-will-see-their-lord-on-the-day-of-resurrection-openly-with-their-eyes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the tremendous and important matters of `<em>aqeedah</em> is: <span style="font-size:1rem;">Affirmation of the fact that the true believers will see their Lord on the Day of Resurrection openly with their eyes, just as they see the Moon on the night of the full Moon and just as they see the Sun clearly, not obscured by any clouds, as occurs in the authentic </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">ahaadith</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> which are </span><strong style="font-size:1rem;"><em>mutawaatir</em> </strong><span style="font-size:1rem;">(reported by huge numbers of people at every level of transmission, so many that it is impossible to could have got together upon lie) affirming the believers seeing their Lord.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Imaam Ibnul-Qayyim brought in Haadiyul-Arwah (ilaa Bilaadil-Afraah) the hadeeth occurring about this. And he did so at great length, quoting their chains of narration; and they are <em>mutawaatir</em> (reported by huge numbers of people at every level of transmission) affirming that the believers will indeed see their Lord openly with their eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the people of misguidance from the deviant sects, such as the Mu`tazilah and those who took their position, they opposed this and they denied ar-ru&#8217;yah (the Seeing, that the believers will indeed see Allaah on the Day of Resurrection). And it is something mentioned in the Qur&#8217;aan. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">For those who did well in the world, will be al-husnaa</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (the finest reward of Paradise)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> and <em>ziyaadah</em> </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(an increase)</span> [02] (Soorah Yoonus (10), aayah 26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There occurs in Saheeh Muslim that the ziyaadah, the increase, is looking at the Face of Allaah the Perfect and Most High. [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They shall have whatever they (the believers in Paradise) wish therein and with Us there is something extra.</span></strong>(Soorah Qaaf (50), aayah 35)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em><strong>al-mazeed</strong></em>, that which is extra, is looking at the Face of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. And there occurs in Sooratul-Qiyaamah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Some faces on that day (Day of Resurrection) will be radiant, looking at their Lord</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Qiyamah(75), aayahs 22-23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Naadirah</em> with a <em>daad</em> from <em>an-nudrah</em>, radiance, which means that which is shining and beautiful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You will recognise upon their faces <em>nadrah</em> (the radiance) of bliss</strong></span> (Sooratul-Mutaffifeen (83), aayah 24)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8230;looking at their Lord</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With a <em>zaa</em>· (<em>naazirah</em>) meaning with their eyes. They will be looking at Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, feeling more joy at that than the joy which they experience on account of the bliss in Paradise. This occurs in the Honourable Qur&#8217;aan. In Sooratul-Mutaffifeen He said with regard to the disbelievers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">But no, on that Day, the disbelievers will be screened away and prevented from seeing their Lord</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Mutaffifeen (83), aayah 15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning screened and blocked from seeing Allaah. So if the disbelievers are blocked from seeing Allaah, then this is a proof that the believers will see their Lord the Mighty and Majestic. [04] And that is because the believers believed in Him in this world, yet they did not see Him. Rather they relied upon the evidences and therefore believed in Him. And they believed in His Messengers. So they believed in Him even though they did not see Him in this world. So therefore Allaah will honour them in Paradise that He will show Himself to them, so that they will see Him openly because they believed in Him in this world and did not see Him. But as for the disbelievers, because of the fact that they disbelieved in Him in this world, therefore Allaah will block them from seeing Him on the Day of Resurrection as a recompense (punishment) for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">as a fully appropriate recompense.</span> </strong>(Sooratun-Naba· (78), aayah 26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the false doubts which the Mu`tazilah rely upon, and those who held their saying, is that Allaah said to Moosaa: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">You shall not see Me.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And when Moosaa came to Our appointed place and His Lord spoke to Him, he </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Moosaa)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> said O My Lord show Yourself to Me, so that I may look upon You. So He </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Allaah the Most High) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">said You will not see Me. However look at the mountain. So if it remains settled in its place, then You will see Me</span> </strong>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), aayah 143)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said, “And this is a proof that Allaah cannot be seen.” We say: Yes this is with regard to this world, because the event occurred in this world. We agree that Allaah cannot be seen in this world. So Moosaa asked to see Him in this world, so Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, said: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">He said You will not see Me </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8211;</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> </span></strong>Meaning in this life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And an-nafee, negation, with <strong><em>Lan</em> </strong>(in Arabic it is negation of something that is occurring in the future) does not necessitate <em>ta&#8217;beed</em> (its being something forever). Rather it is a negation for a certain time. So (His saying) : <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He said You will not see Me &#8211; </strong></span>Meaning, ‘You will not see Me in this world.’ And there occurs in the Arabic language that negating something with <em>Lan</em> does not necessitate its being forever (a negation forever). And therefore Ibnu Maalik [05] said in al-Kaafiyatush-Shaafiyah in nahw (Arabic grammar):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Whoever holds the opinion that negating something with Lan means forever, Then reject his saying and support other than it.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning that <em>Lan</em> does not necessitate a negation that is forever. And the proof is also that Allaah said with regard to the Jews:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Then wish for death if you are truthful. But they will never wish for it</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayahs 94-95)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet it occurs that in the Hereafter they will indeed wish for death in order to be relieved from the torment. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They will call out ‘O Maalik! Let Your Lord put an end to us’</span></strong> (Sooratuz-Zukhruf (43), aayah 77)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they will request death. So this proves that <em>Lan</em> does not mean negation without end. This is what is necessitated by the Arabic language and it is what is necessitated by what is indicated in the Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They say also that what proves that Allaah cannot be seen is His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Sight cannot encompass Him (Allaah) but He encompasses Sight</span></strong> (Sooratul- An`aam (6), aayah 103)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We say to them: this does not contain a negation of Seeing (ru·yah), rather it only negates totally encompassing (idraak). He did not say, “Sight will not see Him.” He said, &#8220;it will not encompass Him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And denying <strong>encompassing</strong> is something different to denying <strong>seeing</strong>. So sight will see Him, however it will not encompass Him. So idraak means encompassing Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. So Even though they will see Him in Paradise, they will not fully encompass Him, He the Perfect and Most High. So what is negated here is encompassing him. [06] So they will see Him but they will not fully encompass Him. They will see Him as is proven by the evidences. And harmonizing the texts is what is obligatory. If there are differences between texts, then as far as it is possible to harmonize between them, this must be done. And this is clear; and all Praise is for Allaah. And the Speech of Allaah can never contradict itself. Rather some parts of it explain other parts. As for the person who takes one aayah and abandons a different ayaah, then this is from the people of deviation. He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So as for those people in whose hearts is deviation, then they follow that which is unclear, seeking discord and seeking to falsely interpret it</span> </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), aayah 7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So evidence is taken from the Qur&#8217;aan in totality.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">All of it is from our Lord</span> </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), aayah 7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as the <em>raasikhoon</em> (those firmly grounded in knowledge) say. So the Qur&#8217;aan, some parts of it explain the rest. And there can never be any contradiction in it because Allaah has negated from it any contradiction. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Will they not ponder/reflect upon the Qur&#8217;aan. If it had been from other than Allaah, they would certainly would have found in it many contradictions</span> </strong>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), aayah 82)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if you have a problem in understanding an aayah, then you look into the Qur&#8217;aan for that which will explain it. And if you do not find that, then you go to the Sunnah to find that which will explain it in the Sunnah. And if you do not find its explanation in the Sunnah, then you go to the sayings of the Companions, those who narrated from the Messenger sallAllaahu ` alayhi wa sallam, to find in their sayings that which will explain the aayah which you have a problem in understanding. The Qur&#8217;aan, and all Praise is for Allaah, is preserved in its wording and in its meaning. It neither opposes nor contradicts itself, rather contradictions only occur in the understandings of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise those false claimants to knowledge, those who did not truly study knowledge and did not take the principles of deriving evidence and of how to reach conclusions, they derive proof without understanding (fiqh). And they affirm things which no-one before them affirmed from the people of knowledge because of jahl, ignorance, and because of ta`aalum, pseudo-knowledge/false knowledge. So these are tremendous matters which require learning and require precision and require careful consideration and require verification, because the `aqeedah (creed and belief) is the foundation. And if there are deficiencies in it, this will be a deficiency in the foundation (of your religion). So in summary, this is the disagreement of the people with regard to seeing Allaah the Mighty and Majestic on the Day of Resurrection. So Allaah cannot be seen in this world. He will only be seen by the believers in the Hereafter. And He will be screened away from the disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And having Eemaan in ar-ru&#8217;yah (seeing Him) on the Day of Resurrection.”</strong> Why did he say on the Day of Resurrection? Because He, the Majestic and Most High, cannot be seen in this world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, <strong>“They will see Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, with the eyes of their heads.”</strong> He said with the eyes of their heads to negate ta&#8217;weel, false interpretation/ misinterpretation, of those who say the meaning of ‘they will see their Lord’ means: with their hearts, not with their sight.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And He will bring them to account without any mediator and without any interpreter.”</strong> Meaning, on the Day of Resurrection at the <em>hisaab</em>, Reckoning, the servant will be in private with his Lord. And Allaah will call him to account for his deeds in his language which the servant will understand. There will be no interpreter between him and Him. The interpreter is one who conveys the meaning from one language to another language, like the one who conveys the meaning from the English language to the Arabic language or vice versa because the languages are many.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> ‘without any screen’ in some editions</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Muhammad ibn Jareer At-Tabaree, the famous mufassir of the Qur&#8217;aan, explained this part of the aayah by saying, “For those from His creation who performed the worship of Allaah well in this world, such that they obeyed Him with regard to what He commanded them and forbade them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] Reported by Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 181) (in the Book of Eemaan) (Hadeeth of) Suhayb radiAllaahu `anh, from the Prophet sallAllaahu ` alayhi wa sallam that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“When the people of Paradise enter Paradise, Allaah, the Exalted and Most High, will say, ‘Do you wish for Me to give you any increase?’ So they will say, ‘Have You not made our faces white? Have You not entered us into Paradise and saved us from the Fire.’ He said: So then He will uncover the screen and they will not have been given anything which is more beloved to them than looking at their Lord the Mighty and Majestic. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">And then he recited this aayah:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">For those who did well in the world, there will be the best reward (of Paradise) and an increase (looking upon their Lord).</span></strong> (Soorah Yoonus (10), aayah 26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> As Imaam ash-Shaafi`ee also said, that this is mentioned as being a punishment for the disbelievers that they will blocked, not able to see their Lord. So therefore the believers who will not be punished, this is affirmation that they will indeed see their Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[06] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Some of the people of knowledge mention a point that a person for example from a distance may see the walls of a town, but not see what is beyond the walls, he may see the town but he doesn’t see what is beyond the town, what is inside the town and all the details, all around the town from every aspect. He does not encompass the town he can just see the town. So there is a clear difference between idraak, totally encompassing something, and between seeing it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Or like the one who passed by a town in ruin up to its roofs. He said: &#8220;How will Allah ever bring it to life after its death&#8221; So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him up (again). He said: &#8220;How long did you remain (dead)&#8221; He (the man) said: &#8220;(Perhaps) I remained (dead) a day or part of a day.&#8221; He said: &#8220;Nay, you have remained (dead) for a hundred years, look at your food and your drink, they show no change; and look at your donkey! And thus We have made of you a sign for the people. Look at the bones, how We bring them together and clothe them with flesh.&#8221; When this was clearly shown to him, he said, &#8220;I know (now) that Allah is able to do all things.&#8221;</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 2.259)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(Have you not looked at him who disputed with Ibrahim about his Lord)</span> means, &#8220;Have you seen anyone like the person who disputed with Ibrahim about his Lord&#8221; Then, Allah connected the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(Or like the one who passed by a town in ruin up to its roofs)</span> to the Ayah above by using `or&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Ali bin Abi Talib said that the Ayah (2:259) meant `Uzayr. Ibn Jarir also reported it, and this explanation was also reported by Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim from Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Sulayman bin Buraydah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujahid bin Jabr said that the Ayah refers to a man from the Children of Israel, and the village was Jerusalem, after Nebuchadnezzar destroyed it and killed its people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(in ruin)</span> means, it became empty of people. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(up to its roofs)</span> indicates that the roofs and walls (of the village) fell to the ground. `Uzayr stood contemplating about what had happened to that city, after a great civilization used to inhabit it. He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(Oh! How will Allah ever bring it to life after its death)</span> because of the utter destruction he saw and the implausibility of its returning to what it used to be. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him up (again).)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The city was rebuilt seventy years after the man (`Uzayr) died, and its inhabitants increased and the Children of Israel moved back to it. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>When Allah resurrected `Uzayr after he died, the first organ that He resurrected were his eyes, so that he could witness what Allah does with him, how He brings life back to his body.</strong></span> When his resurrection was complete, Allah said to him, meaning through the angel,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(&#8220;How long did you remain (dead)&#8221; He (the man) said: &#8220;(Perhaps) I remained (dead) a day or part of a day.&#8221;)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars said that since the man died in the early part of the day and Allah resurrected him in the latter part of the day, when he saw that the sun was still apparent, he thought that it was the sun of that very day. He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(&#8220;Or part of a day. &#8221; He said: &#8220;Nay, you have remained (dead) for a hundred years, look at your food and your drink, they show no change.&#8221;)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He had grapes, figs and juice, and he found them as he left them; neither did the juice spoil nor the figs become bitter nor the grapes rot.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(And look at your donkey!),</span> &#8220;How Allah brings it back to life while you are watching.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(And thus We have made of you a sign for the people)</span> that Resurrection occurs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(Look at the bones, how We Nunshizuha)</span> meaning, collect them and put them back together. In his Mustadrak, Al-Hakim, recorded that Kharijah bin Zayd bin Thabit said that his father said that the Messenger of Allah read this Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(how We Nunshizuha.)</span> Al-Hakim said; &#8220;Its chain is Sahih and they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not record it.&#8221; The Ayah was also read,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(نُنْشِرُهَا)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Nunshiruha&#8221; meaning, bring them back to life, as Mujahid stated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(And clothe them with flesh. )</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Suddi said, &#8221; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>`Uzayr observed the bones of his donkey, which were scattered all around him to his right and left, and Allah sent a wind that collected the bones from all over the area. Allah then brought every bone to its place, until they formed a full donkey made of fleshless bones. Allah then covered these bones with flesh, nerves, veins and skin. Allah sent an angel who blew life in the donkeys&#8217; nostrils, and the donkey started to bray by Allah&#8217;s leave.&#8221; All this occurred while `Uzayr was watching</strong></span>, and this is when he proclaimed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(He said, &#8220;I know (now) that Allah is able to do all things,&#8221;)</span> meaning, &#8220;I know that, and I did witness it with my own eyes. Therefore, I am the most knowledgeable in this matter among the people of my time.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>[15]    The One who resurrects without any exertion</strong></span></p>

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [15]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is from the amazing affairs of His ability, that He causes the creation to die and causes them to pass away so that they are destroyed and become dust and remains – such that an ignorant person would say, ‘It is not possible for these to be restored’. However Allaah the Mighty and Majestic will resurrect them again, and He will restore their creation anew. And He will have no difficulty in doing this, as He the Perfect and Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">The creation of you all, and the resurrection of you all is just like that of a single soul.</span></em> (Soorah Luqmaan (31), <em>aayah </em>28)[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And He (Allaah) it is One who creates initially, and then He repeats it (the creation); and that is even easier for Him.  And for Him is the Highest Description in the heavens and in the earth.  And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.</span></em> (Sooratur-Room (30), <em>aayah </em>27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the people of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>, they denied the resurrection, holding it to be something far-fetched, just as Allaah said about them, (that the unbelieving man would say)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;Who will give life to these bones when they are crumbled away?&#8221;</em></span> (Soorah YaaSeen (36), <em>aayah </em>78)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah the Perfect and Most High, said in response,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em><span style="color:#008000;">Say: “He will give life to them Who created them for the first time!”</span> </em> </strong>(Soorah YaaSeen (36), <em>aayah </em>79)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first time they did not exist at all, so He brought them into existance from nothing, He the Perfect and Most High. So, the One who created them from non-existence, is He not able even more so to bring them back into existence? This is correct in accordance with the people’s intellect but otherwise, analogy cannot be made between Allaah, the Perfect, and His creation.  So this is just stated as a similitude,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And for Him is the Highest Description</span></em> (Sooratur-Room (30), <em>aayah </em>27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this a refutation of the denier, Allaah the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And he forgets his (own) creation</span></em> (Soorah YaaSeen (36), <em>aayah </em>78)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: he forgets that in the beginning he was nothing; he did not exist at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Has there come upon man a time when he was nothing mentioned? </span></em>(Sooratul-Insaan (76), <em>aayah </em>1)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: this man, he forgets that Allaah produced him from non-existence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah will indeed gather together these separated bones, shredded flesh, disintigrated dust and these scattered hairs, and He will restore them as they once were:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And from His (Allaah’s) Signs is that the heaven and the earth are established by His Command.  Then, when He calls you with a single call, you will come out from the earth.</em></span> (Sooratur-Room (30), <em>aayah </em>25)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And then the Horn will be blown, and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is upon the earth will faint and die, except whomever Allaah wishes.  And then it will be blown again and they will be standing up, looking on.</span></em> (Sooratuz-Zumar (39), <em>aayah </em>68)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second blowing is the blowing for the resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the first blowing of the horn, it is the blowing for the people to faint and die.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And the Horn will be blown and then the people will come out from their graves going quickly to their Lord.  They (the unbeliever) will say: &#8220;Woe to us! Who has taken us out from our place of sleep?&#8221; (The believer will respond) &#8220;This is what the Most Merciful promised, and the Messengers spoke the truth!&#8221; </span></em>(Soorah YaaSeen (36), <em>aayaat </em>51-52)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah indeed has Power and Ability over everything and this contains a refutation of the unbelievers, those who say that Allaah is unable to give life to the dead and to return them to life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Does man think that We will not gather his bones together? Indeed, We are fully able even to put his fingertips together. </span></em>(Sooratul-Qiyaamah (75), <em>aayaat </em>3-4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">On that Day (the Day of Resurrection) they will come out from the graves, hurrying as if they are racing to a finishing post. </span></em>(Sooratul-Ma`aarij (70), <em>aayah </em>43)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the Power of Allaah, and His Will and His Wish.  Nothing makes Him incapable.  However, it is just that some of the creation, they draw analogy between Allaah and His creation and so therefore they hold that it is far-fetched that there will be any resurrection; because the person thinks in his view, that’s something impossible and he doesn’t look to the Power of Allaah and he doesn’t judge Allaah’s Power as He deserves; and this is a case of ignorance with regard to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And it is Allah Who sends the winds, so that they raise up the clouds, and We drive them to a dead land, and revive therewith the earth after its death. As such (will be) the Resurrection!</strong> <span style="color:#999999;">( Surah Faatir 35:09)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Evidence of Life after Death</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Often Allah refers to the Resurrection by using the analogy of the earth coming back to life after it has died, as in the beginning of Surat Al-Hajj, where He urges His servants to draw the lesson of the former from the latter. For the earth is dead and lifeless, with nothing growing in it, then He sends to it clouds which bring water, which He sends down upon it,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#339966;"><span style="color:#ff9900;"><span style="color:#339966;">(it is stirred (to life), and it swells and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth))</span> </span></span></strong>(22:5). So too, when Allah wishes to resurrect the bodies, He will send rain from beneath the Throne which will cover the whole earth, and the bodies will grow in their graves like seeds grow in the earth. It says in the Sahih:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>Every part of the son of Adam will disintegrate apart from the coccyx, from which he was created and from him he will be made anew</strong>.) Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#339966;"><strong>As such (will be) the Resurrection!</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">According to the Hadith of Abu Raz0n: I said, O Messenger of Allah, how will Allah bring the dead back to life? What is the sign of that in His creation? He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Abu Razin, do you not pass through the valley of your people (and see it) arid and barren, then you pass through it (and see it) stirred (to life) and green) I said, `Yes.&#8217; He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Thus will Allah bring the dead back to life.)&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Compiled and translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The <em>Shafa’a</em> of the Messenger </strong><strong><em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em></strong><strong> cannot be achieved except </strong>by <strong>obedience to him.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘When the Messenger’s <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> status of being dependent Allaah <em>Subhanahu</em> was complete, all of the creation were in need of him in the <em>Duniya</em>(for the rulings of worshipping Allaah Alone) and inthe Hereafter:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for their need of him in this world; then it isstronger than their need for food, drink and breathing by which their bodies remain alive.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for their need of him in the Hereafter; then the people will seek intercession from the Messengers so that they can be relieved from their severe condition. All of the Messengers will refrain from interceding but the prophet Muhammad <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> will intercede for them and he is the one who will open the gates of Paradise for them.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from ‘al-Fawaid’ by Shaykhul –Islaam Ibn al-Qayyim p. 99</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The <em>Shafa’a</em> of the Angels</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from the Sharh of Aqeedatu Tahaweeya by Shaykh Salih aalush-Shaykh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fifth point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Ash-Shafa’a</em> on the Day of Judgement is not specifically for the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> nor for the other Prophets; rather the Angels will intercede and the Believers will intercede according to their status’: ( the scholars, the martyrs and the righteous people will intercede), as is established in the Saheeh that Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> will say on the Day of Judgement: {{ the Angels have interceded, the Prophets have interceded, the believers have interceded and nothing remains except the mercy of The Most Merciful of those who show mercy, so Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> will command that groups of people, who did not do any good whatsoever, should be taken out of the fire. }} (hadeeth from Saheeh Muslim) to the end of the hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So here <em>ash-Shafa’a</em> is not specific to the Prophets, but the Angels will also intercede as Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>said describing the Angels who carry the ‘<em>Arsh</em> and other than them: &lt;&gt; [Ash-Shurah: 5] and this seeking forgiveness is before helping them in the worst destination and punishment. They are the most merciful -who have been given responsibility- to the people of <em>Eemaan</em>, since they have seen the punishment and the worst destination.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said: {{the Angels have interceded, the Prophets have interceded, the believers have interceded}} so there is a general <em>ash-Shafa’a</em> for every righteous believer to intercede; he will intercede for his close relatives and for whoever he wills.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The <em>Shafa’a</em> of Children for their Parents</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hadeeth – taken from Silsilah Saheehah No. 3416</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Habeebah or Umm Habeebah who said: ‘We were sitting in the house of ‘Aa’ishah, and the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>entered and said: ‘There are no two parents whose three children die before they reach the age ofaccountability, except that they are brought until they are standing at the door of Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It will be said to them; ‘Enter Paradise.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They will say: ‘Should we enter Paradise even though our parents have not yet entered?!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it will be said them again to enter, – I do not know if it is the second time but it will be said to them-: ‘Enter Paradise along with your parents.’ The messenger said ‘and that is the saying of Allaah <em>–Azza wa Jal &#8211;</em> &lt;&lt; So no intercession of intercessors will be of any use to them&gt;&gt;’ [Al-Muddathir: 48] and the Messenger also said: ‘the intercession of children benefits their parents.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Ishaq bin Rahawayah in his Musnad &amp; authenticated by Shaykh al-Albaani</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Seventy Thousand that will enter Paradise with the Messenger’s Intercession</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hadeeth – taken from Silsilah Saheehah No. 1879</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>His </strong><strong><em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em></strong><strong><em>Shafa’a</em></strong><strong> on the Day of Judgement</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Huraira from the Prophet: ‘I asked Allaah <em>– Azza wa Jal –</em> for <em>ash-Shafa’a</em> for my<em>Ummah</em> and Allaah said to me: ‘You can have seventy thousand who will enter Paradise without being taken to account.’ So I said: ‘O Allaah increase the number for me.’ So Allaah said: ‘Indeed you will have this.’ So Allaah increased them in front of Him and on the right and on the left.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by al-Baghawi &amp; authenticated by Shaykh al-Albaani</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani brings another supporting evidence for the above hadeeth from ‘Mishkaat’ with an authentic chain:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Umaamah who said I heardthe Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> saying: ‘My Lord promised me that seventy thousand from my Ummah will enter Paradise without account or being punished and that with every thousand of these there will be another seventy thousand and there will be many, many more from those whom Allaah has increased.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and authenticated by Shaykh al-Albaani in Mishkaat no. 5556</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Intercession of the righteous people from the Ummah of the Prophet </strong><strong><em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hadeeth – taken from Silsilah Saheehah No. 2178</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Umaamah who said I heardthe Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>: ‘People will enter Paradise due to the <em>Shafa’a</em> of a person who is not a Prophet. The amount that will enter will be like the tribe of al-Hayyain, or the like of one of the sub-tribes of al-Hayyain like the tribe of Rabeeyah and the tribe of Maddar.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah<strong><em>.</em></strong> Is not the tribe of Rabeeyah from the tribe of Maddar?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger answered; ‘Indeed I say what I say.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Ahmad, Ibn ‘Aasakir and authenticated by Shaykh al-Albaani</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Correct Belief in <em>ash-Shafa’a</em> refutes the ideology of the Khawaarij</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Khawaarij hold the opinion that if a Muslim commits a major sin then he has left Islaam, however the correct belief of the Salaf is that he does not leave Islaam, but he must repent to Allaah<em>Ta’ala</em>. The following is a refutation of the ideology of the Khawaarij:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Anas who said that theMessenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘My intercession is for those from my <em>Ummah </em>who commit major sins.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Tirmidhi, Ibn Khuzaimah and authenticated by Shaykh al-Albaani in Mishkaat no. 5558-9</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Those whose intercession will not be accepted</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Darda who said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- saying, ‘Indeed those who curse cannot be witnesses orintercessors on the Day of Judgement.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Muslim, Abu Dawood and Ahmad</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This chapter heading was mentioned by Shaykh Muqbil in his book ‘ash-Shafa’a’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Intercession by reading the Qur’aan</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Umaamah al-Baahilee who said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>saying, ‘Read the Qur’aan, since it will come as an intercessor on the Day of Judgement for the one who reads it. Read the two illuminating lights, sooratul Baqarah and soorah Aali Imran since they will come on the Day of Judgement as though they are two shades overhead or two large clouds or two groups of birds with wings outstretched, bringing forward evidence for the one who reads these two Soorahs. Read Sooratul Baqarah because taking toit is a blessing (<em>Barakah</em>) and leaving it is sorrow, and magicians can cannot read/confront it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Muslim, al-Bayhaqi and Ahmad</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Hudhaifa b. al-Yaman reported: By Allah, I have the best knowledge amongst people about every turmoil which is going to appear in the period intervening me and the Last Hour; and it is not for the fact that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) told me something confidentially pertaining to it and he did not tell anybody else about it, but it is because of the fact that I was present in the assembly in which he had been describing the turmoil. and he especially made a mention of three turmoils which would not spare anything and amongst these there would be turmoils like storms in the hot season. Some of them would be violent and some of them would be comparatively mild. Hudhaifa said: All (who were present) except I have gone (to the next world).</p>

Let us fight with them; and the Muslims would say: Nay, by Allah, we would never get aside from you and from our brethren that you may fight them. They will then fight and a third (part) of the army would run away, whom Allah will never forgive. A third (part of the army). which would be constituted of excellent martyrs in Allah&#8217;s eye, would be killed ani the third who would never be put to trial would win and they would be conquerors of Constantinople. And as they would be busy in distributing the spoils of war (amongst themselves) after hanging their swords by the olive trees, the Satan would cry: The Dajjal has taken your place among your family. They would then come out, but it would be of no avail. And when they would come to Syria, he would come out while they would be still preparing themselves for battle drawing up the ranks. Certainly, the time of prayer shall come and then Jesus (peace be upon him) son of Mary would descend and would lead them in prayer. When the enemy of Allah would see him, it would (disappear) just as the salt dissolves itself in water and if he (Jesus) were not to confront them at all, even then it would dissolve completely, but Allah would kill them by his hand and he would show them their blood on his lance (the lance of Jesus Christ).</p>

I said: You mean Rome? And he said: Yes, and there would be a terrible fight and the Muslims would prepare a detachment (for fighting unto death) which would not return but victorious. They will fight until night will intervene them; both the sides will return without being victorious and both will be wiped out. The Muslims will again prepare a detachment for fighting unto death so that they may not return but victorious. When it would be the fourth day, a new detachment out of the remnant of the Muslims would be prepared and Allah will decree that the enemy should be routed. And they would fight such a fight the like of which would not be seen, so much so that even if a bird were to pass their flanks, it would fall down dead before reaching the end of them. (There would be such a largescale massacre) that when counting would be done, (only) one out of a hundred men related to one another would be found alive. So what can be the joy at the spoils of such war and what inheritance would be divided! They would be in this very state that they would hear of a calamity more horrible than this.

Have you not hearde Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace upon him) as saying: He will have no no children, I said: Yes, of course. Thereupon he said: But I have children. Have you not heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: He would not enter Mecca and Medina? I said: Yes, of course. Thereupon he said I have been once in Medina and now I intend to go to Mecca. And he said to me at the end of his talk: By Allah: I know his place of birth his abode where he is just now. He (Abu Sa&#8217;id) said: This caused confusion in my mind (in regard to his identity).</p>

Has Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) not said that he would be a Jew whereas I am a Muslim and he also said that he would not have children, whereas I have children, and he also said: veryly, Allah has prohibited him to enter Mecca whereas I have performed Pilgrimage, atid. he went on saying this that I was about to be impressed by his tallk. He (however) said this also: I know where he (Dajjal) is and I know his father abd I mother, and it was said to him: Won&#8217;t you feel pleased if you would be the same person?

Khattab went along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) in the company of some persons toIbn Sayyad that he found him playing with children near the bettlement of Bani Maghala and Ibn Sayyad was at that time just at the threshold of adolescence and he did not perceive (the presence of Holy Prophet) until Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) struck his back with his hands. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Ibn Sayyad, don&#8217;t you bear witness that I am the messenger of Allah? Ibn Sayyad looked toward him and he said: I bear witness to the fact that you the messenger of the unlettered. Ibn Sayyad said to the Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him): Do you bear witness to the fact that I am the messenger of Allah? Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) rejected this and said: I affirm my faith in Allah and in His messengers.

Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: May you be disgraced and dishonoured, you would not not be able to go beyond your rank. &#8216;Umar b. Khattab said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, permit me that I should strike his neck. Therupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: If he is the same (Dajjal) who would appear near the Last Hour, you would not be able to overpower him, and he is not that ther is no good for you to kill him. &#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Umar further narrated that after some time Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and Ubayy b. Ka&#8217;b went towards the palm trees where Ibn Sayyad was. When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) went near the tree he hid himself behind a tree with the intention of hearing something from Ibn sayyad before Ibn Sayyad could see him, but Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may pcxce be upon him) saw him on a bed with a blanket around him from which a murmuring sound was being heard and Ibn Sayyad&#8217;s mother saw Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) behind the trunk of the palm tree. She said to Ibn Sayyad: Saf (that being his name), here is Muhammad.

Umar told that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) stood up amongst the people and lauded Allah as He deserved, then he made a mention of the Dajjal and said: I warn you of him and there is no Prophet who has not warned his people against the Dajjal. Even Noah warned (against him) but I am going to tell you a thing which no Prophet told his people. You must know that he (the Dajjal) is one-eyed and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, is not one-eyed. Ibn Shihab said: &#8216;Umar b. Thabit al-Ansari informed me that some of the Companions of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) informed him that the day when Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) warned people against the Dajjal, he also said: There would be written between his two eyes (the word) Kafir (infidel) and everyone who would resent his deeds would be able to read or every Muslim would be about to read, and he also said: Bear this thing in mind that none amongst you would be able to see Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, until he dies.</p>

When we went to him (to the Holy Prophet) in the evening and he read (the signs of fear) in our faces, he said: What is the matter with you? We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, you made a mention of the Dajjal in the morning (sometimes describing him) to be insignificant and sometimes very important, until we began to think as if he were present in some (near) part of the cluster of the datpalm trees. Thereupon he said: I harbour fear in regard to you in so many other things besides the Dajjal. If he comes forth while I am among on, I shall contend with him on your behalf, but if he comes forth while I am not amongst you, a man must contend on his own behalf and Allah would take care of every Muslim on my behalf (and safeguard him against his evil). He (Dajjal) would be a young man with twisted, contracted hair, and a blind eye. I compare him to &#8216;Abd-ul-&#8216;Uzza b. Qatan. He who amongst you would survive to see him should recite over him the opening verses of Sura Kahf (xviii.). He would appear on the way between Syria and Iraq and would spread mischief right and left. O servant of Allah! adhere (to the path of Truth). We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, how long would he stay on the earth? He said.. For forty days, one day like a year and one day like a month and one day like a week and the rest of the days would be like your days. We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, would one day&#8217;s prayer suffice for the prayers of day equal to one year? Thereupon he said: No, but you must make an estimate of time (and then observe prayer). We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, how quickly would he walk upon the earth? Thereupon he said: Like cloud driven by the wind. He would come to the people and invite them (to a wrong religion) and they would affirm their faith in him and respond to him. He would then give command to the sky and there would be rainfall upon the earth and it would grow crops. Then in the evening, their posturing animals would come to them with their humps very high and their udders full of milk and their flanks stretched. He would then come to another people and invite them. But they would reject him and he would go away from them and there would be drought for them and nothing would be lef t with them in the form of wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would then walk through the waste, land and say to it: Bring forth your treasures, and the treasures would come out and collect (themselves) before him like the swarm of bees. He would then call a person brimming with youth and strike him with the sword and cut him into two pieces and (make these pieces lie at a distance which is generally) between the archer and his target. He would then call (that young man) and he will come forward laughing with his face gleaming (with happiness) and it would at this very time that Allah would send Christ, son of Mary, and he will descend at the white minaret in the eastern side of Damscus wearing two garments lightly dyed with saffron and placing his hands on the wings of two Angels. When he would lower his head, there would fall beads of perspiration from his head, and when he would raise it up, beads like pearls would scatter from it. Every non-believer who would smell the odour of his self would die and his breath would reach as far as he would be able to see. He would then search for him (Dajjal) until he would catch hold of him at the gate of Ludd and would kill him. Then a people whom Allah had protected would come to Jesus, son of Mary, and he would wipe their faces and would inform them of their ranks in Paradise and it would be under such conditions that Allah would reveal to Jesus these words: I have brought forth from amongst My servants such people against whom none would be able to fight; you take these people safely to Tur, and then Allah would send Gog and Magog and they would swarm down from every slope. The first of them would pass the lake of Tibering and drink out of it. And when the last of them would pass, he would say: There was once water there. Jesus and his companions would then be besieged here (at Tur, and they would be so much hard pressed) that the head of the ox would be dearer to them than one hundred dinirs and Allah&#8217;s Apostle, Jesus, and his companions would supplicate Allah, Who would send to them insects (which would attack their necks) and in the morning they would perish like one single person. Allah&#8217;s Apostle, Jesus, and his companions would then come down to the earth and they would not find in the earth as much space as a single span which is not filled with their putrefaction and stench. Allah&#8217;s Apostle, Jesus, and his companions would then again beseech Allah, Who would send birds whose necks would be like those of bactrin camels and they would carry them and throw them where God would will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah would send rain which no house of clay or (the tent of) camels&#8217; hairs would keep out and it would wash away the earth until it could appear to be a mirror. Then the earth would be told to bring forth its fruit and restore its blessing and, as a result thereof, there would grow (such a big) pomegranate that a group of persons would be able to eat that, and seek shelter under its skin and milch cow would give so much milk that a whole party would be able to drink it. And the milch camel would give such (a large quantity of) milk that the whole tribe would be able to drink out of that and the milch sheep would give so much milk that the whole family would be able to drink out of that and at that time Allah would send a pleasant wind which would soothe (people) even under their armpits, and would take the life of every Muslim and only the wicked would survive who would commit adultery like asses and the Last Hour would come to them.</p>

So he will alight at some of the barren tracts near Medina, and a person who would be the best of men or one from amongst the best of men would say to him: I bear testimony to the fact that you are Dajjal about whom Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had informed us. The Dajjal would say: What is your opinion if I kill this (person), then I bring him back to life; even then will you harbour doubt in this matter? They would say: No. He would then kill (the man) and then bring him back to life. When he would bring tha@ person to life, he would say: By Allah, I had no better proof of the fact (that you are a Dajjal) than at the present time (that you are actually so). The Dajjal would then make an attempt to kill him (again) but he would not be able to do that. Abu Ishaq reported that it was said: That person would be Khadir (Allah be pleased with him).</p>

He would say: I intend to go to this one who is coming forth. They would say to him: Don&#8217;t you believe in our Lord? He would say: There is nothing hidden about our Lord. They would say: Kill him. Then some amongst them would say: Has your master (Dajjal) not forbidden you to kill anyone without (his consent)? And so they would take him to the Dajjal and when the believer would see him, he would say: O people. he is the Dajjil about whom Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has informed (us). The Dajjal would then order for breaking his head and utter (these words): Catch hold of him and break his head. He would be struck even on his back and on his stomach. Then the Dajjal would ask him: Don&#8217;t you believe in me? He would say: You are a false Masih. He would then order him to be torn (into pieces) with a saw from the parting of his hair up to his legs. After that the Dajjal would walk between the two pieces. He would then say to him: Stand, and he would stand erect. He would then say to him: Don&#8217;t you believe in me? And the person would say: It has only added to my insight concerning you (that you are really the Dajjal). He would then say: O people, he would not behave with anyone amongst people (in such a manner) after me. The Dajjal would try to catch hold of him so that he should kill him (again). The space between his neck and collar bone would be turned into copper and he would find no means to kill him. So he would catch hold of him by his hand and feet and throw him (into the air) and the people would think as if he had been thrown in the Hell-Fire whereas he would be thrown in Paradise. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He would be the most eminent amongst persons in regard to martyrdom in the eye of the Lord of the world.</p>

Thereupon he said: Hallowed be Allah, there is no god but Allah (or the words to the same effect). I have decided that I would not narrate anything to anyone now. I had only said that you would see after some time an important event that the (sacred) House (Ka&#8217;ba) would be burnt and it would happen and definitely happen. He then reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: The Dajjal would appear in my Ummah and he would stay (in the world) for forty-I cannot say whether he meant forty days, forty months or forty years. And Allah would then send Jesus son of Mary who would resemble &#8216;Urwa b Mas&#8217;ud. He (Jesus Christ) would chase him and kill him. Then people would live for seven years that there would be no ran. cour between two persons. Then Allah would send cold wind from the side of Syria that none would survive upon the earth having a speck of good in him or faith in him but he would die, so much so that even if some amongst you were to enter the innermost part of the mountain, this wind would reach that place also and that would cause his heath. I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Only the wicked people would survive and they would be as careless as birds with the charactertistics of beasts. They would never appreciate the good nor condemn evil. Then the Satan would come to them in human form and would say: Don&#8217;t you respond? And they would say: What do you order us? And he would command them to worship the idols but, in spite of this, they would have abundance of sustenance and lead comfortable lives. Then the trumpet would be blown and no one would hear that but he would bend hfs neck to one side and raise it from the other side and the first one to hear that trumpet would be the person who would be busy in setting right the tank meant for providing water to the camels. He would swoon and the other people would also swoon, then Allah would send or He would cause to send rain which would be like dew and there would grow out of it the bodies of the people. Then the second trumpet would be blown and they would stand up and begin to look (around). Then it would be said: O people, go to your Lord, and make them stand there. And they would be questioned. Then it would be said: Bring out a group (out of them) for the Hell-Fire. And then it would be asked: How much? It would be said: Nine hundred and ninty-nine out of one thousand for the Hell-Fire and that would be the day which would make the children old because of its terror and that would be the day about which it has been said:&#8221; On the day when the shank would be uncovered&#8221; (lxviii. 42).</p>

Qais and she was the first amongst the emigrant women: Narrate to me a hadith which you had heard directly from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and there is no extra link in between them. She said: Very well, if you like, I am prepared to do that, and he said to her: Well, do It and narrate that to me. She said: I married the son of Mughira and he was a chosen young man of Quraish at that time, but he fell as a martyr in the first Jihad (fighting) on the side of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). When I became a widow, &#8216;Abd al-Rahman b. Auf, one amongst the group of the Companions of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), sent me the proposal of marriage. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) also sent me such a message for his freed slave Usama b. Zaid. And it had been conveyed to me that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (way peace be upon him) had said (about Usama): He who loves me should also love Usima. When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) talked to me (about this matter), I said: My affairs are in your hand. You may marry me to anyone whom you like. He said: You better shift now to the house of Umm Sharik, and Umm Sharik was a rich lady from amongst the Anqir. She spent generously for the cause of Allah and entertained guests very hospitably. I said: Well, I will do as you like. He said: Do not do that for Umm Sharik is a woman who is very frequently vizited by guests and I do not like that your head may be uncovered or the cloth may be removed from your shank and the strangers may catch sight of them which you abhor. You better shift to the house of your cousin &#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Amr b. Umm Maktum and he is a person of the Bani Fihr branch of the Quraish, and he belonged to that tribe (to which Fatima) belonged. So I shifted to that house, and when my period of waiting was over, I heard the voice of an announcer making an announcement that the prayer would be observed in the mosque (where) congregational prayer (is observed).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I set out towards that mosque and observed prayer along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and I was in the row of the women which was near the row of men. When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had finished his prayer, he sat on the pulpit smiling and said: Every worshipper should keep sitting at his place. He then said: Do you know why I had asked you to assemble? They said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He said: By Allah. I have not made you assemble for exhortation or for a warning, but I have detained you here, for Tamim Dari, a Christian, who came and accepted Islam, told me something, which agrees with what I was-telling, yuu about the Dajjal. He narrated to me that he had sailed in a ship along with thirty men of Bani Lakhm and Bani Judham and had been tossed by waves in the ocean for a month. Then these (waves) took them (near) the land within the ocean (island) at the time of sunset. They sat in a small side-boat and entered that Island. There was a beast with long thick hair (and because of these) they could not distinguish his face from his back. They said: Woe to you, who can you be? Thereupon it said: I am al-Jassasa. They said: What is al-Jassasa? And it said: O people, go to this person in the monastery as he is very much eager to know about you. He (the narrator) said: When it named a person for us we were afraid of it lest it should be a Devil. Then we hurriedly went on till we came to that monastery and found a well-built person there with his hands tied to his neck and having iron shackles between his two legs up to the ankles. We said: Woe be upon thee, who are you? And he said: You would soon come to know about me. but tell me who are you. We said: We are people from Arabia and we embarked upon a boat but the sea-waves had been driving us for one month and they brought as near this island. We got Into the side-boats and entered this island and here a beast met us with profusely thick hair and because of the thickness of his hair his face could not be distinguished from his back. We said: Woe be to thee, who are you? It said: I am al- Jassasa. We said: What is al-Jassasa? And it said: You go to this very person in the monastery for he is eagerly waiting for you to know about you. So we came to you in hot haste fearing that that might be the Devil. He (that chained person) said: Tell me about the date-palm trees of Baisan. We &amp;aid: About what aspect of theirs do you seek information? He said: I ask you whether these trees bear fruit or not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We said: Yes Thereupon he said: I think these would not bear fruits. He said: Inform me about the lake of Tabariyya? We said: Which aspect of it do you want to know? He said: Is there water in it? They said: There is abundance of water in it. Thereupon he said: I think it would soon become dry. He again said: Inform me about the spring of Zughar. They said: Which aspect of it you want to know? He (the chained person) said: Is there water in it and does it irrigate (the land)? We said to him: Yes, there is abundance of water in it and the inhabitants (of Medina) irrigate (land) with the help of it, He said: Inform me about the unlettered Prophet; what has he done? We said: He has come out from Mecca and has settled In Yathrib (Medina). He said: Do the Arabs fight against him? We said: Yes. He said: How did he deal with him? We informed him that he had overcome those in his neighbourhood and they had submitted themselves before him. Thereupon he said to us: Had it actually happened? We said: Yes. Thereupon he said: If it is so that is better for them that they should show obedience to him. I am going to tell you about. myself and I am Dajjal and would be soon permitted to get out and so I shall get out and travel in the land, and will not spare any town where I would not stay for forty nights except Mecca and Medina as these two (places) are prohibited (areas) for me and I would not make an attempt to enter any one of these two. An angel with a sword in his hand would confront me and would bar my way and there would be angels to guard every passage leading to it; then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) striking the pulpit with the help of the end of his staff said: This implies Taiba meaning Medina. Have I not, told you an account (of the Dajjal) like this? &#8216;The people said: Yes, and this account narrated by Tamim Dari was liked by me for it corroborates the account which I gave to you in regard to him (Dajjal) at Medina and Mecca. Behold he (Dajjal) is in the Syrian sea (Mediterranian) or the Yemen sea (Arabian sea). Nay, on the contrary, he As In the east, he is in the east, he is in the east, and he pointed with his hand towards the east.

Surely to thy Lord is the return. Hast thou seen him who forbids a servant when he prays? Seest thou if he is on the right way, or enjoins observance of piety? Seest thou if he [Abu Jah]] denies and turns away? Knowest he not that Allah sees? Nay. if he desists not, We will seize him by the forelock-a lying, sinful forelock. Then let him summon his council. We will summon the guards of the Hell. Nay! Obey not thou him&#8221; (Icvi. 6-19). (Rather prostrate thyself.)

Thereupon Abdullah got up and said in anger. O people, fear Allah and say only that which one knows amongst you and do not say which he does not know and he should simply say: Allah has the best knowledge for He has the best knowledge amongst all of you. It does not behove him to say that which he does not know. Allah has the best knowledge of it. Verily Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, said to His Prophet (may peace be upon him) to state:&#8221; I do not ask from you any remuneration and I am not the one to put you in trouble,&#8221; and when Allah&#8217;s Mesqenger (may peace be upon him) saw people turning back (from religion) he said: O Allah, afflict thern with seven famines as was done in the case of Yusuf, so they were afflicted with famine by which they were forced to eat everything until they were obliged to eat the hides and the dead bodies because of hunger, and every one of them looked towards the sky and he found a smoke. And Abu Sufyan came and he said: Muhammad, you have come to command us to obey Allah and cement the ties of blood- relation whereas your people are undone; supplicate Allah for tlicm. Thereupon Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, said:&#8221; Wait for the day when there would be clear smoke from the sky which would envelop people and that would be grievous torivent&#8221; up to the words:&#8221; you are going to return to (evil).&#8221; (if this verse implied the torment of the next life) could the chastisement of the next (life) be averted (as the Qur&#8217;an states): On the day when We seize (them) with the most violent seizing; surely We shall exact retribution&#8221; (xliv. 16)? The seizing (in the hadith) implies that of the Day of Badr. And so far as the sign of smoke, seizing, inevitability and signs of Rome are concern- ed, they have become things of the past now.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Masruq reported that there came to Abdullah a person and said: I have left behind in the mosque a man who explains the Qur&#8217;an according to his personal discretion and he explained this verse:&#8221; So wait for the day when the Heaven brings a clear smoke.&#8221; He says that a smoke would come to the people on the Day of Resurrection anl it will withhold breath and they would be inflicted with cold. &#8216;Abdullah said: He who has knowledge should say something and he who has no knowledge should simply say: Allah is best aware. This reflects the understanding of a person that he should say about that which he does not know that it is Allah who knows best. The fact is that when the Quraish disobeyed Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) he supplicated Allah that they should be afflicted with famine and starvation as was done in case of Yusuf. And they were so much hard pressed that a person would ace the sky and he would see between him and the sky something like smoke and they were so much hard pressed that they began to cat the bones, and a person came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger. seek forgiveness for the tribe of Mudar for (its people) have been undone. The Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: For Mudar? You are overbold, but he supplicated Allah for them. It was upon this that this verse was revealed:&#8221; We shall remove the chastisement a little, but they will surely return to evil&#8221; (xliv. 15). lie (the narrator) said: There was a downpoor of rain upon them. When there was some relief for them they returned to the same position as they had been before, and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed this verse:&#8221; So wait for the day when the heaven brings a clear smoke enveloping people. This is a grievous torment on the day when We seize them with the most violent seizing; surely, We shall exact retribution.&#8221; And this (seizing) implied (Battle) of Badr.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;I will be at my Lake-Fount (Kauthar) waiting for whoever will come to me. Then some people will be taken away from me whereupon I will say, &#8216;My followers!&#8217; It will be said, &#8216;You do not know they turned Apostates as renegades (deserted their religion).'&#8221; (Ibn Abi Mulaika said, &#8220;Allah, we seek refuge with You from turning on our heels from the (Islamic) religion and from being put to trial&#8221;).</p>

There will come to me some people whom I know and they know me, and then a barrier will be set up between me and them.&#8221; Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri added that the Prophet further said: &#8220;I will say those people are from me. It will be said, &#8216;You do not know what changes and new things they did after you.&#8217; Then I will say, &#8216;Far removed (from mercy), far removed (from mercy), those who changed (the religion) after me! &#8220;</p>

Isn&#8217;t it the forbidden (Sacred) Town (Mecca)?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; He then said, &#8220;Your blood, your properties, your honors and your skins (i.e., bodies) are as sacred to one another like the sanctity of this day of yours in this month of yours in this town of yours.

So it is incumbent upon those who are present to convey it (this message of mine) to those who are absent because the informed one might comprehend what I have said better than the present audience who will convey it to him.)&#8221; The narrator added: In fact, it was like that. The Prophet added, &#8220;Beware! Do not renegade as disbelievers after me by striking (cutting) the necks of one another.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hudhaifa bin Al-Yaman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people used to ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle about the good but I used to ask him about the evil lest I should be overtaken by them. So I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We were living in ignorance and in an (extremely) worst atmosphere, then Allah brought to us this good (i.e., Islam); will there be any evil after this good?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; I said, &#8216;Will there be any good after that evil?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Yes, but it will be tainted (not pure.)&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What will be its taint?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;(There will be) some people who will guide others not according to my tradition? You will approve of some of their deeds and disapprove of some others.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;Will there be any evil after that good?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Yes, (there will be) some people calling at the gates of the (Hell) Fire, and whoever will respond to their call, will be thrown by them into the (Hell) Fire.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah s Apostle! Will you describe them to us?&#8221; He said, &#8220;They will be from our own people and will speak our language.&#8221; I said, &#8220;What do you order me to do if such a state should take place in my life?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Stick to the group of Muslims and their Imam (ruler).&#8221; I said, &#8220;If there is neither a group of Muslims nor an Imam (ruler)?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Then turn away from all those sects even if you were to bite (eat) the roots of a tree till death overtakes you while you are in that state.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 207:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Al-Aswad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An army unit was being recruited from the people of Medina and my name was written among them. Then I met &#8216;Ikrima, and when I informed him about it, he discouraged me very strongly and said, &#8220;Ibn &#8216;Abbas told me that there were some Muslims who were with the pagans to increase their number against Allah&#8217;s Apostle (and the Muslim army) so arrows (from the Muslim army) would hit one of them and kill him or a Muslim would strike him (with his sword) and kill him. So Allah revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Verily! As for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves (by staying among the disbelievers).&#8217; (4.97)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 208:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hudhaifa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle related to us, two prophetic narrations one of which I have seen fulfilled and I am waiting for the fulfillment of the other. The Prophet told us that the virtue of honesty descended in the roots of men&#8217;s hearts (from Allah) and then they learned it from the Qur&#8217;an and then they learned it from the Sunna (the Prophet&#8217;s traditions). The Prophet further told us how that honesty will be taken away: He said: &#8220;Man will go to sleep during which honesty will be taken away from his heart and only its trace will remain in his heart like the trace of a dark spot; then man will go to sleep, during which honesty will decrease further still, so that its trace will resemble the trace of blister as when an ember is dropped on one&#8217;s foot which would make it swell, and one would see it swollen but there would be nothing inside. People would be carrying out their trade but hardly will there be a trustworthy person. It will be said, &#8216;in such-and-such tribe there is an honest man,&#8217; and later it will be said about some man, &#8216;What a wise, polite and strong man he is!&#8217; Though he will not have faith equal even to a mustard seed in his heart.&#8221; No doubt, there came upon me a time when I did not mind dealing (bargaining) with anyone of you, for if he was a Muslim his Islam would compel him to pay me what is due to me, and if he was a Christian, the Muslim official would compel him to pay me what is due to me, but today I do not deal except with such-and-such person.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 209:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salama bin Al-Akwa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That he visited Al-Hajjaj (bin Yusuf). Al-Hajjaj said, &#8220;O son of Al-Akwa! You have turned on your heels (i.e., deserted Islam) by staying (in the desert) with the bedouins.&#8221; Salama replied, &#8220;No, but Allah&#8217;s Apostle allowed me to stay with the bedouin in the desert.&#8221; Narrated Yazid bin Abi Ubaid: When &#8216;Uthman bin Affan was killed (martyred), Salama bin Al-Akwa&#8217; went out to a place called Ar-Rabadha and married there and begot children, and he stayed there till a few nights before his death when he came to Medina.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 210:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;There will come a time when the best property of a Muslim will be sheep which he will take to the tops of mountains and the places of rainfall so as to flee with his religion from the afflictions.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 211:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people started asking the Prophet too many questions importunately. So one day he ascended the pulpit and said, &#8220;You will not ask me any question but I will explain it to you.&#8221; I looked right and left, and behold, every man was covering his head with his garment and weeping. Then got up a man who, whenever quarreling with somebody, used to be accused of not being the son of his father. He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Who is my father?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Your father is Hudhaifa.&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar got up and said, &#8220;We accept Allah as our Lord, Islam as our religion and Muhammad as our Apostle and we seek refuge with Allah from the evil of afflictions.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8221; I have never seen the good and bad like on this day. No doubt, Paradise and Hell was displayed in front of me till I saw them in front of that wall,&#8221; Qatada said: This Hadith used to be mentioned as an explanation of this Verse:&#8211; &#8216;O you who believe! Ask not questions about things which, if made plain to you, may cause you trouble.&#8217; (5.101)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 212:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salim&#8217;s father:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet stood up beside the pulpit (and pointed with his finger towards the East) and said, &#8220;Afflictions are there! Afflictions are there, from where the side of the head of Satan comes out,&#8221; or said, &#8220;..the side of the sun..&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle while he was facing the East, saying, &#8220;Verily! Afflictions are there, from where the side of the head of Satan comes out.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 214:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah! Bestow Your blessings on our Sham! O Allah! Bestow Your blessings on our Yemen.&#8221; The People said, &#8220;And also on our Najd.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Allah! Bestow Your blessings on our Sham (north)! O Allah! Bestow Your blessings on our Yemen.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! And also on our Najd.&#8221; I think the third time the Prophet said, &#8220;There (in Najd) is the place of earthquakes and afflictions and from there comes out the side of the head of Satan.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sa&#8217;id bin Jubair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar came to us and we hoped that he would narrate to us a good Hadith. But before we asked him, a man got up and said to him, &#8220;O Abu &#8216;Abdur-Rahman! Narrate to us about the battles during the time of the afflictions, as Allah says:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And fight them until there is no more afflictions (i.e. no more worshipping of others besides Allah).'&#8221; (2.193) Ibn &#8216;Umar said (to the man), &#8220;Do you know what is meant by afflictions? Let your mother bereave you! Muhammad used to fight against the pagans, for a Muslim was put to trial in his religion (The pagans will either kill him or chain him as a captive). His fighting was not like your fighting which is carried on for the sake of ruling.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 216:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Shaqiq:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Hudhaifa saying, &#8220;While we were sitting with &#8216;Umar, he said, &#8216;Who among you remembers the statement of the Prophet about the afflictions?&#8217; Hudhaifa said, &#8220;The affliction of a man in his family, his property, his children and his neighbors are expiated by his prayers, Zakat (and alms) and enjoining good and forbidding evil.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I do not ask you about these afflictions, but about those afflictions which will move like the waves of the sea.&#8221; Hudhaifa said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it, O chief of the believers, for there is a closed door between you and them.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Will that door be broken or opened?&#8221; I said, &#8220;No. it will be broken.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Then it will never be closed,&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; We asked Hudhaifa, &#8220;Did &#8216;Umar know what that door meant?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Yes, as I know that there will be night before tomorrow morning, that is because I narrated to him a true narration free from errors.&#8221; We dared not ask Hudhaifa as to whom the door represented so we ordered Masruq to ask him what does the door stand for? He replied, &#8220;&#8216;Umar.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 217:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ash&#8217;ari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet went out to one of the gardens of Medina for some business and I went out to follow him. When he entered the garden, I sat at its gate and said to myself, &#8220;To day I will be the gatekeeper of the Prophet though he has not ordered me.&#8221; The Prophet went and finished his need and went to sit on the constructed edge of the well and uncovered his legs and hung them in the well. In the meantime Abu Bakr came and asked permission to enter. I said (to him), &#8220;Wait till I get you permission.&#8221; Abu Bakr waited outside and I went to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! Abu Bakr asks your permission to enter.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Admit him, and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise.&#8221; So Abu Bakr entered and sat on the right side of the Prophet and uncovered his legs and hung them in the well. Then &#8216;Umar came and I said (to him), &#8220;Wait till I get you permission.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Admit him and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise.&#8221; So Umar entered and sat on the left side of the Prophet and uncovered his legs and hung them in the well so that one side of the well became fully occupied and there remained no place for any-one to sit. Then &#8216;Uthman came and I said (to him), &#8220;Wait till I get permission for you.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Admit him and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise with a calamity which will befall him.&#8221; When he entered, he could not find any place to sit with them so he went to the other edge of the well opposite them and uncovered his legs and hung them in the well. I wished that a brother of mine would come, so I invoked Allah for his coming. (Ibn Al-Musaiyab said, &#8220;I interpreted that (narration) as indicating their graves. The first three are together and the grave of &#8216;Uthman is separate from theirs.&#8221;)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Someone said to Usama, &#8220;Will you not talk to this (Uthman)?&#8221; Usama said, &#8220;I talked to him (secretly) without being the first man to open an evil door. I will never tell a ruler who rules over two men or more that he is good after I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;A man will be brought and put in Hell (Fire) and he will circumambulate (go around and round) in Hell (Fire) like a donkey of a (flour) grinding mill, and all the people of Hell (Fire) will gather around him and will say to him, O so-and-so! Didn&#8217;t you use to order others for good and forbid them from evil?&#8217; That man will say, &#8216;I used to order others to do good but I myself never used to do it, and I used to forbid others from evil while I myself used to do evil.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

Al-Hasan bin &#8216;Ali was at the top of the pulpit and &#8216;Ammar was below Al-Hasan. We all gathered before him. I heard &#8216;Ammar saying, &#8220;&#8216;Aisha has moved to Al-Busra. By Allah! She is the wife of your Prophet in this world and in the Hereafter. But Allah has put you to test whether you obey Him (Allah) or her (&#8216;Aisha).&#8221;</p>

They said to him, &#8220;Since you have become a Muslim, we have never seen you doing a deed more criticizable to us than your haste in this matter.&#8221; &#8216;Ammar said, &#8220;Since you (both) became Muslims, I have never seen you doing a deed more criticizable to me than your keeping away from this matter.&#8221; Then Abu Mas&#8217;ud provided &#8216;Ammar and Abu Musa with two-piece outfits to wear, and one of them went to the mosque (of Kufa).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Shaqiq bin Salama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was sitting with Abu Mas&#8217;ud and Abu Musa and &#8216;Ammar. Abu Mas&#8217;ud said (to &#8216;Ammar), &#8220;There is none of your companions but, if I wish, I could find fault with him except with you. Since you joined the company of the Prophet I have never seen anything done by you more criticizable by me than your haste in this issue.&#8221; &#8216;Ammar said, O Abu Mas&#8217;ud ! I have never seen anything done by you or by this companion of yours (i.e., Abu Musa) more criticizable by me than your keeping away from this issue since the time you both joined the company of the Prophet.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Abu Mas&#8217;ud who was a rich man, said (to his servant), &#8220;O boy! Bring two suits.&#8221; Then he gave one to Abu Musa and the other to &#8216;Ammar and said (to them), &#8220;Put on these suits before going for the Friday prayer. &#8220;</p>

On that, &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amir and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Samura said, &#8220;Let us meet Muawaiya and suggest peace.&#8221; Al-Hasan Al-Basri added: No doubt, I heard that Abu Bakra said, &#8220;Once while the Prophet was addressing (the people), Al-Hasan (bin &#8216;Ali) came and the Prophet said, &#8216;This son of mine is a chief, and Allah may make peace between two groups of Muslims through him.&#8221;</p>

So we sat with him and my father started talking to him saying, &#8220;O Abu Barza! Don&#8217;t you see in what dilemma the people has fallen?&#8221; The first thing heard him saying &#8220;I seek reward from Allah for myself because of being angry and scornful at the Quraish tribe. O you Arabs! You know very well that you were in misery and were few in number and misguided, and that Allah has brought you out of all that with Islam and with Muhammad till He brought you to this state (of prosperity and happiness) which you see now; and it is this worldly wealth and pleasures which has caused mischief to appear among you. The one who is in Sham (i.e., Marwan), by Allah, is not fighting except for the sake of worldly gain: and those who are among you, by Allah, are not fighting except for the sake of worldly gain; and that one who is in Mecca (i.e., Ibn Az-Zubair) by Allah, is not fighting except for the sake of worldly gain.&#8221;</p>

So when the sun will rise and the people will see it (rising from the West) they will all believe (embrace Islam) but that will be the time when: (As Allah said,) &#8216;No good will it do to a soul to believe then, if it believed not before, nor earned good (by deeds of righteousness) through its Faith.&#8217; (6.158) And the Hour will be established while two men spreading a garment in front of them but they will not be able to sell it, nor fold it up; and the Hour will be established when a man has milked his she-camel and has taken away the milk but he will not be able to drink it; and the Hour will be established before a man repairing a tank (for his livestock) is able to water (his animals) in it; and the Hour will be established when a person has raised a morsel (of food) to his mouth but will not be able to eat it.&#8221;</p>

I asked, &#8220;Who is this?&#8217; They replied, &#8216;The son of Mary.&#8217; Then I turned my face to see another man with a huge body, red complexion and curly hair and blind in one eye. His eye looked like a protruding out grape.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:center;" align="center"><span lang="EN-GB">Taken from </span>Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah of Shaykh Al-Albaani<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">From AbdulAziz bin al-Mukhtar bin Abdullaah ad-Danaaj who said he witnessed Abu Salmah bin AbdurRahman sitting in a <i>Masjid</i> at the time of Khalid bin Usayd; He said al-Hasan came and sat with him, and Abu Salmah narrated to us that Abu Hurairah narrated from theProphet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> who said:</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:center;" align="center"><span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA">&#8221; الشمس والقمر ثوران مكوران في النار يوم القيامة &#8220;.</span></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">‘The sun and the moon will both spin and erupt in the Hell-Fire on the Day of Judgement.’</span></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">So al-Hasan asked: ‘What was the sin of the sun and the moon?!’</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Abu Salmah said: ‘Rather what I do is narrate to you from theMessenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</i>.’</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">So al-Hasan remained silent.’</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Collected by Imam Tahawi in ‘Mushkill al-Athaar (1/66-67)</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Also collected by al-Bayhaqi in the book ‘al-Ba’ath wa Nashoor’, also by Bazaar, al-Isma’aili and al-Khattabi all by way of Yunus bin Muhammad that AbdulAziz bin al-Mukhtar narrated to us with this narration.</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">I (Albaani) say: This <i>Isnaad</i>  is <i>Saheeh</i>  upon the conditions of Bukhari, and he narrated it in his book ‘as-Saheeh’ in a summarized form, and he said: Mussadad narrated to us that he said AbdulAziz bin al-Mukhtar narrated to us with the wording:</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">‘The sun and the moon will both spin in the Hell-Fire on the Day of Judgement.’</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"><b>The Meaning of the Hadeeth</b></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">The intent of the Hadeeth is not what al-Hasan al-Basri presumed, that the sun and the moon will be in the Hell-Fire punished as a punishment for them, never, indeed Allaah –Azza wa Jal – does not punish he who obeys him from His creation, and from that creation is the Sun and the moon, as to what Allaah&#8217;s -Tabarak wa Ta’ala- saying indicates to:</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:center;" align="center"><span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA">أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ اللَّهَ يَسْجُدُ لَهُ مَنْ فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَنْ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَالشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ وَالنُّجُومُ وَالْجِبَالُ وَالشَّجَرُ وَالدَّوَابُّ وَكَثِيرٌ مِنَ النَّاسِ وَكَثِيرٌ حَقَّ عَلَيْهِ الْعَذَابُ</span></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:center;" align="center">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"> See you not that to Allaah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the mountains, and the trees, and <i>Ad-Dawaab</i> (moving living creatures, beasts, etc.), and many of mankind? But there are many (men) on whom the punishment is justified.</span> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- mentions that His punishment is deserving for those who prostrate for other than Allaah -Ta’ala- in this <i>Dunyaa</i>. Like Tahawi mentions, therefore, when Allaah throws them into the Hell-Fire, then this can have two meanings:</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"><i>The First:</i> that they are the fuel for the Fire.</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Al-Isma’aili said:</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">‘It does not necessitate that being placed in the Hell-Fire that they will be punished, since indeed Allaah has Angels and stones and other things in the Hell-Fire, so that they will be a punishment for the people of the Hell-Fire and a tool from the tools of punishment, and Allaah does what He wills of that punishment, but the Angels and stones will not be punished.’</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"><i>The second is:</i></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">They will both be thrown into the Hell-Fire as remorse for those who worshipped them.</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">al-Khattabi said:</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">‘The intent of them being in the Hell-Fire is not that they will be punished there, but they will be a remorse for those who worshipped them in the <i>Dunyaa</i>, so that those people know that their worship of them was false.’</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">I say: this is the closest to the wording of the hadeeth and what supports this is that in the hadeeth of Anas collected by Abu Ya’ala as is mentioned in ‘al-Fath’ (6/214) it says:</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"> ‘so that those who used to worship them could see them.’</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">But I did not see it in his ‘Musnad’ and Allaah Ta’ala knows best.</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">[Taken from &#8216;Silsilah Ahadeeth as-Saheehah&#8217; vol. 1 No. 124]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"> <b>The Tafsir Ibn Kathir of </b><b>Surat</b><b> Al-Qiyamah (Chapter &#8211; 75)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Which was revealed in Makkah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ أُقْسِمُ بِيَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ &#8211; وَلاَ أُقْسِمُ بِالنَّفْسِ اللَّوَّامَةِ &#8211; أَيَحْسَبُ الإِنسَـنُ أَلَّن نَّجْمَعَ عِظَامَهُ &#8211; بَلَى قَـدِرِينَ عَلَى أَن نُّسَوِّىَ بَنَانَهُ &#8211; بَلْ يُرِيدُ الإِنسَـنُ لِيَفْجُرَ أَمَامَهُ &#8211; يَسْـَلُ أَيَّانَ يَوْمُ الْقِيَـمَةِ &#8211; فَإِذَا بَرِقَ الْبَصَرُ &#8211; وَخَسَفَ الْقَمَرُ &#8211; وَجُمِعَ الشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ &#8211; يَقُولُ الإِنسَـنُ يَوْمَئِذٍ أَيْنَ الْمَفَرُّ &#8211; كَلاَّ لاَ وَزَرَ &#8211; إِلَى رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْمُسْتَقَرُّ &#8211; يُنَبَّأُ الإِنسَـنُ يَوْمَئِذِ بِمَا قَدَّمَ وَأَخَّرَ &#8211; بَلِ الإِنسَـنُ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ بَصِيرَةٌ &#8211; وَلَوْ أَلْقَى مَعَاذِيرَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1. Nay! I swear by the Day of Resurrection.) (2. And nay! I swear by An-Nafs Al-Lawwamah.) (3. Does man think that We shall not assemble his bones) (4. Yes, We are able to put together in perfect order the tips of his fingers.) (5. Nay! Man desires to break out ahead of himself.) (6. He asks: &#8220;When will be this Day of Resurrection&#8221;) (7. So, when Bariqa the sight.) (8. And the moon will be eclipsed.) (9. And the sun and moon will be joined together.) (10. On that Day man will say: &#8220;Where (is the refuge) to flee&#8221;) (11. No! There is no refuge!) (12. Unto your Lord will be the place of rest that Day.) (13. On that Day man will be informed of what he sent forward, and what he left behind.) (14. Nay! Man will be well informed about himself,) (15. Though he may put forth his excuses.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Oath about the Final Return on the Day of Resurrection and the Refutation against the Plots of the Thinkers</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been mentioned previously on more than one occasion that if the thing that is being sworn about is something that is being negated, then it is permissible to use the word &#8220;La&#8221; (Nay) before the oath to emphasize the negation. Here, what is being sworn about is the affirmation of the final abode and the refutation against the claim of the ignorant that the resurrection of bodies will not occur. This is why Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ أُقْسِمُ بِيَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ &#8211; وَلاَ أُقْسِمُ بِالنَّفْسِ اللَّوَّامَةِ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Nay! I swear by the Day of Resurrection. And nay! I swear by An-Nafs Al-Lawwamah.) Qatadah said, &#8220;This means, I swear by both of these things.&#8221; This has also been reported from Ibn `Abbas and Sa`id bin Jubayr. Concerning the Day of Judgement, it is well known what it is. In reference to An-Nafs Al-Lawwamah, Qurrah bin Khalid reported from Al-Hasan Al-Basri that he said about this Ayah, &#8220;Verily, by Allah, we think that every believer blames himself. He says (questioning himself), `What did I intend by my statement What did I intend by my eating What did I intend in what I said to myself&#8217; However, the sinner proceeds ahead and he does not blame himself.&#8221; Ibn Jarir recorded from Sa`id bin Jubayr that he said concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلاَ أُقْسِمُ بِالنَّفْسِ اللَّوَّامَةِ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And nay! I swear by An-Nafs Al-Lawwamah) &#8220;He criticizes himself in good and bad.&#8221; Similar has been reported from `Ikrimah. Ibn Abi Najih reported from Mujahid: &#8220;He is sorry for what he missed (of good deeds) and he blames himself for it.&#8221; Allah said;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَيَحْسَبُ الإِنسَـنُ أَلَّن نَّجْمَعَ عِظَامَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Does man think that We shall not assemble his bones) meaning, `on the Day of Judgement does he think that We are not able to return his bones and gather them from their various places&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[بَلَى قَـدِرِينَ عَلَى أَن نُّسَوِّىَ بَنَانَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Yes, We are able to put together in perfect order the tips of his fingers.) meaning, `does man think that We will not gather his bones Surely, We will gather them and We are quite able to put together his fingertips. This means Our power is suitable to gather (and recreate) them, and if We wished We could surely resurrect him with more than what he originally had. We could make his Banan, which are the tips of his fingers, all equal (in length).&#8217; Concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[بَلْ يُرِيدُ الإِنسَـنُ لِيَفْجُرَ أَمَامَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Nay! Man desires to break out ahead of himself.) Sa`id reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, &#8220;This means to proceed forward.&#8221; Mujahid said about,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لِيَفْجُرَ أَمَامَهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(to break out ahead of himself.) &#8220;This means that he wants to proceed ahead following his own whims.&#8221; `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, &#8220;This refers to the disbeliever who denies the Day of Reckoning.&#8221; Ibn Zayd said the same thing. Thus, Allah says after this,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[يَسْـَلُ أَيَّانَ يَوْمُ الْقِيَـمَةِ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He asks: &#8220;When will be this Day of Resurrection&#8221;) meaning, he says when will the Day of Judgement be His question is only a question of denying its occurrence, and rejecting its existence. This is as Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَى هَـذَا الْوَعْدُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ قُل لَّكُم مِّيعَادُ يَوْمٍ لاَّ تَسْتَـَخِرُونَ عَنْهُ سَاعَةً وَلاَ تَسْتَقْدِمُونَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And they say: &#8220;When is this promise if you are truthful&#8221; Say: &#8220;The appointment to you is for a Day, which you cannot put back for an hour nor put forward.&#8221;) (34:29-30) Here Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَإِذَا بَرِقَ الْبَصَرُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So, when Bariqa the sight.) Abu `Amr bin Al-`Ala&#8217; recited this Ayah as Bariqa with a Kasrah under the letter Ra, which means to be diminished. That which he (Abu `Amr) has said resembles the statement of Allah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ يَرْتَدُّ إِلَيْهِمْ طَرْفُهُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Their gaze returning not towards them.) (14:43) meaning, they will be looking this way and that way in horror. Their gaze will not be able to rest upon anything due to the severity of the terror on that Day. Others recited it as Baraqa with a Fathah over the letter Ra, and its meaning is close to the first recitation (Bariqa). The intent here is that the eyes will be dazzled, humbled, diminished, and humiliated on the Day of Judgement due to the severity of the horrors and the greatness of the matters that they will witness on that Day. Concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَخَسَفَ الْقَمَرُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And the moon will be eclipsed.) meaning, its light will go away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَجُمِعَ الشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And the sun and moon will be joined together.) Mujahid said, &#8220;They will be rolled up.&#8221; In explaining this Ayah, Ibn Zayd recited the following Ayat,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِذَا الشَّمْسُ كُوِّرَتْ &#8211; وَإِذَا النُّجُومُ انكَدَرَتْ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When the sun is wound round and its light is lost and is overthrown, and when the stars fall.) (81:1,2) It has been reported from Ibn Mas`ud that he recited the Ayah as, (وَجُمِعَ بَيْنَ الشَّمْسِ وَالْقَمَرِ) (and the sun and the moon will be joined between each other.) Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[يَقُولُ الإِنسَـنُ يَوْمَئِذٍ أَيْنَ الْمَفَرُّ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(On that Day man will say:&#8221;Where (is the refuge) to flee&#8221;) meaning, the human will see these horrors on the Day of Judgement and he will want to flee. He will say, &#8220;Where (is the place) to flee to&#8221; This means, where is the escape or refuge Allah then says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[كَلاَّ لاَ وَزَرَ &#8211; إِلَى رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْمُسْتَقَرُّ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(No! There is no refuge! Unto your Lord will be the place of rest that Day.) Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Sa`id bin Jubayr and several others of the Salaf said, &#8220;There will be no salvation.&#8221; This Ayah is similar to Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[مَا لَكُمْ مِّن مَّلْجَأٍ يَوْمَئِذٍ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن نَّكِيرٍ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(You will have no refuge on that Day nor there will be for you any denying.) (42:47) meaning, `there will be no place for you to hide.&#8217; This is like what Allah says here,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ وَزَرَ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(There is no refuge.) meaning, `there will be no place for you to seek shelter.&#8217; Thus, Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِلَى رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْمُسْتَقَرُّ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Unto your Lord will be the place of rest that Day.) meaning, the place of return and the final destination. The Deeds of Man will be placed before Him on the Day of Judgement Then Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[يُنَبَّأُ الإِنسَـنُ يَوْمَئِذِ بِمَا قَدَّمَ وَأَخَّرَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(On that Day man will be informed of what he sent forward, and what he left behind.) meaning, he will be informed of all of his deeds, the old of them and the recent of them, the first of them and the last of them, the small of them and the large of them. This is as Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَوَجَدُواْ مَا عَمِلُواْ حَاضِرًا وَلاَ يَظْلِمُ رَبُّكَ أَحَدًا]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And they will find all that they did, placed before them, and your Lord treats no one with injustice.) (18:49) Likewise, Allah says here,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[بَلِ الإِنسَـنُ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ بَصِيرَةٌ &#8211; وَلَوْ أَلْقَى مَعَاذِيرَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Nay! Man will be well informed about himself, though he may put forth his excuses.) meaning, he will be a witness against himself, knowing full well what he did, even though he will try to make excuses and deny it. This is as Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[اقْرَأْ كَتَـبَكَ كَفَى بِنَفْسِكَ الْيَوْمَ عَلَيْكَ حَسِيبًا ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((It will be said to him): &#8220;Read your book. You are sufficient as a reckoner against yourself this Day.&#8221;) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[بَلِ الإِنسَـنُ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ بَصِيرَةٌ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Nay! Man will be well informed about himself.) &#8220;His hearing, his sight, his two hands, his two legs and his limbs.&#8221; Qatadah said, &#8220;This means he is a witness against himself.&#8221; In another narration from Qatadah he said, &#8220;By Allah! If you wish to see him, you would see him as someone who sees the shortcomings of the people and their sins, yet he is heedless of his own sins.&#8221; It used to be said, &#8220;Verily, it is written in the Injil: `O Son of Adam, do you see the small splinters in the eye of your brother and disregard the tree stump that is in your eye, so you do not see it&#8221;&#8217; Mujahid said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلَوْ أَلْقَى مَعَاذِيرَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Though he may put forth his excuses.) &#8220;This means, even though he argues in defense of it, he is a witness against it.&#8221; Qatadah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلَوْ أَلْقَى مَعَاذِيرَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Though he may put forth his excuses.) &#8220;Even though he will try to make false excuses on that Day, they will not be accepted from him.&#8221; As-Suddi said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلَوْ أَلْقَى مَعَاذِيرَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Though he may put forth his excuses.) &#8220;This means his argument.&#8221; This is as Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ثُمَّ لَمْ تَكُنْ فِتْنَتُهُمْ إِلاَّ أَن قَالُواْ وَاللَّهِ رَبِّنَا مَا كُنَّا مُشْرِكِينَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(There will then be no Fitnah for them but to say: &#8220;By Allah, our Lord, we were not those who joined others in worship with Allah.&#8221;) (6:23) Allah also says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[يَوْمَ يَبْعَثُهُمُ اللَّهِ جَمِيعاً فَيَحْلِفُونَ لَهُ كَمَا يَحْلِفُونَ لَكُمْ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُمْ عَلَى شَىْءٍ أَلاَ إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ الْكَـذِبُونَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(On the Day when Allah will resurrect them all together; then they will swear to Him as they swear to you (O Muslims). And they think that they have something. Verily, they are liars!) (58:18) Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلَوْ أَلْقَى مَعَاذِيرَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Though he may put forth his excuses.) &#8220;This is apologizing. Haven&#8217;t you heard that Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ يَنفَعُ الظَّـلِمِينَ مَعْذِرَتُهُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Day when their excuses will be of no profit to wrongdoers.) (40:52) and He says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأَلْقَوْاْ إِلَى اللَّهِ يَوْمَئِذٍ السَّلَمَ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And they will offer submision to Allah on that Day.) (16:87) and He says,</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>How the Prophet received the Revelation</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is Allah teaching His Messenger how to receive the revelation from the angel. For verily, he (the Prophet ) was rushing in his attempts to grasp the revelation and he would be reciting the revelation with the angel while he was reciting it. Therefore, Allah commanded him that when the angel brings some revelation to him he should just listen. Allah would make sure to collect it in his chest, and He would make it easy for him to recite it in the same way that it was revealed to him. Allah would explain it, interpret it and clarify it for him. So the first phase was gathering it in his chest, the second phase was recitation and the third phase was its explanation and clarification of its meaning. Thus, Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ تُحَرِّكْ بِهِ لِسَانَكَ لِتَعْجَلَ بِهِ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Move not your tongue concerning to make haste therewith.) meaning, with the Qur&#8217;an. This is as Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلاَ تَعْجَلْ بِالْقُرْءانِ مِن قَبْلِ إَن يُقْضَى إِلَيْكَ وَحْيُهُ وَقُل رَّبِّ زِدْنِى عِلْماً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And be not in haste with the Qur&#8217;an before its revelation is completed to you, and say: &#8220;My Lord! Increase me in knowledge.&#8221;) (20:114) Then Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا جَمْعَهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(It is for Us to collect it) meaning, `in your chest.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَقُرْءَانَهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and that it be recited.) meaning, `that you recite it.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَإِذَا قَرَأْنَـهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And when We have recited it to you,) meaning, `when the angel has recited it to you from Allah,&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَاتَّبِعْ قُرْءَانَهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(then follow its recitation.) meaning, `listen to it then recite it as he taught you to recite it.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ثُمَّ إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا بَيَانَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then it is for Us to make it clear.) meaning, `after memorizing it and reciting it, We will explain it to you, clarify it and inspire you with its meaning according to what We intended and legislated.&#8217; Imam Ahmad recorded from Ibn `Abbas that he said that the Messenger of Allah used to struggle very hard to grasp the revelation and he used to move his lips (rapidly with the recitation). The narrator, Sa`id, then said, &#8220;Ibn `Abbas said to me, `I will move my lips like the Messenger of Allah used to move his lips (in order to show you).&#8221;&#8217; Then, the subnarrator said, &#8220;And Sa`id said to me, `I will move my lips like I saw Ibn `Abbas moving his lips (in order to show you).&#8221;&#8217; Then Allah revealed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ تُحَرِّكْ بِهِ لِسَانَكَ لِتَعْجَلَ بِهِ &#8211; إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا جَمْعَهُ وَقُرْءَانَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Move not your tongue concerning to make haste therewith. It is for Us to collect it and that it be recited.) Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;This means He will collect it in his chest to recite it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَإِذَا قَرَأْنَـهُ فَاتَّبِعْ قُرْءَانَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And when We have recited it to you, then follow its recitation.) meaning, listen to it and pay attention.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ثُمَّ إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا بَيَانَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then it is for Us to make it clear (to you).) So after this, when Jibril would leave, he would recite it as Jibril had taught him to recite it.&#8221; This has also been recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. Al-Bukhari&#8217;s wording says, &#8220;So whenever Jibril would come to him he would be silent, and when Jibril had left he would recite it just as Allah, the Mighty and Sublime had promised him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Cause of rejecting the Day of Judgement is Love of the World and Heedlessness of the Hereafter</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[كَلاَّ بَلْ تُحِبُّونَ الْعَاجِلَةَ &#8211; وَتَذَرُونَ الاٌّخِرَةَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(But no! Rather you love the present life of this world. And neglect the Hereafter.) meaning, the only thing that has caused them to reject the Day of Judgement and oppose the true revelation and the Mighty Qur&#8217;an Allah revealed to His Messenger is that their only concern is the present worldly life. They are preoccupied and distracted from the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Seeing Allah in the Hereafter</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ نَّاضِرَةٌ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Some faces that Day shall be Nadirah.) which comes from the word Nadarah, which means splendid, radiant, glowing, delighted with goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِلَى رَبِّهَا نَاظِرَةٌ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Looking at their Lord.) meaning, they will see Him with their very eyes. This is just as was recorded by Al-Bukhari in his Sahih,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«إِنَّكُمْ سَتَرَوْنَ رَبَّكُمْ عِيَانًا»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, you all will see your Lord with your own eyes.) The believers seeing Allah in the abode of the Hereafter has been confirmed in the authentic Hadiths from numerous routes of transmission with the scholars of Hadith. It is not possible to deny this or refuse it. Examples would be the Hadiths of Abu Sa`id and Abu Hurayrah, and they are both recorded in the Two Sahihs. They both mentioned that some people said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Will we see our Lord on the Day of Judgement&#8221; The Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«هَلْ تُضَارُّونَ فِي رُؤْيَةِ الشَّمْسِ وَالْقَمَرِ لَيْسَ دُونَهُمَا سَحَابٌ؟»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Are you harmed by seeing the sun and the moon when there are no clouds beneath them) They replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«فَإِنَّكُمْ تَرَوْنَ رَبَّكُمْ كَذَلِك»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then you will surely see your Lord like that.) In the Two Sahihs it is recorded from Jabir that he said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah looked at the moon on a night when it was full, and he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«إِنَّكُمْ تَرَوْنَ رَبَّكُمْ كَمَا تَرَوْنَ هَذَا الْقَمَرَ، فَإِنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ أَنْ لَا تُغْلَبُوا عَلَى صَلَاةٍ قَبْلَ طُلُوعِ الشَّمْسِ وَلَا قَبْلَ غُرُوبِهَا، فَافْعَلُوا»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, you will see your Lord just as you see this moon! So if you are able to avoid missing a prayer before the rising of the sun (Fajr prayer) or before its setting (`Asr prayer) then do so.)&#8221; Among the Hadiths, which Muslim was alone in recording, is a narration from Suhayb that the Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«إِذَا دَخَلَ أَهْلُ الْجَنَّةِ الْجَنَّةَ قَالَ يَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالى: تُرِيدُونَ شَيْئًا أَزِيدُكُمْ؟ فَيَقُولُونَ: أَلَمْ تُبَيِّضْ وُجُوهَنَا؟ أَلَمْ تُدْخِلْنَا الْجَنَّةَ وَتُنَجِّنَا مِنَ النَّارِ؟ قَالَ: فَيَكْشِفُ الْحِجَابَ، فَمَا أُعْطُوا شَيْئًا أَحَبَّ إِلَيْهِمْ مِنَ النَّظَرِ إِلَى رَبِّهِمْ، وَهِيَ الزِّيَادَة»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When the people of Paradise enter the Paradise, Allah will say, `Do you want me to give you anything extra&#8217; They will say, `Haven&#8217;t you whitened our faces Haven&#8217;t you entered us into Paradise and saved us from the Fire&#8217; Then He will remove the veil and they will not be given anything more beloved to them than looking at their Lord, and that will be the extra (Ziyadah).) Then he recited this Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لِّلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُواْ الْحُسْنَى وَزِيَادَةٌ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(For those who have done good is the best and extra (Ziyadah).) (10:26) Also among the Hadiths, which Muslim was alone in recording, is the Hadith of Jabir in which the Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«إِنَّ اللهَ يَتَجَلَّى لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ يَضْحَك»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, Allah will appear before the believers while He is laughing.) This will take place on the open plains of the Resurrection place. In some of these Hadiths, it mentions that the believers will be looking at their Lord on the open plains and some mention that this will occur in the Gardens of Paradise. If it were not due to fear of taking up a lot of space, we would present all of these Hadiths with their routes of transmission and wordings from those that are in the Sahih collections, the collections of good narrations, the Musnad collections and the Sunan collections. However, we have mentioned this in separate places in this Tafsir, and Allah is the Giver of success. This issue is something that the Companions, the Successors and the Salaf of this nation have agreed upon, and all praise is due to Allah. It is something that is agreed upon between the Imams of Islam and the guides of all mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Blackening of the Faces of the Disobedient People on the Day of Judgement</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَوُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ بَاسِرَةٌ &#8211; تَظُنُّ أَن يُفْعَلَ بِهَا فَاقِرَةٌ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And some faces that Day will be Basirah. Thinking that some calamity is about to fall on them.) These are the faces of the sinners that will be Basirah on the Day of Judgement. Qatadah said, &#8220;This means gloomy.&#8221; As-Suddi said, &#8220;Their (the faces) color will change.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[تَظُنُّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Thinking) meaning, they will be certain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَن يُفْعَلَ بِهَا فَاقِرَةٌ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(that some calamity is about to fall on them.) Mujahid said, &#8220;A disaster.&#8221; Qatadah said, &#8220;An evil.&#8221; As-Suddi said, &#8220;They will be certain that they are going to be destroyed.&#8221; Ibn Zayd said, &#8220;They will think that they are going to enter into the Hellfire.&#8221; This situation is similar to Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[يَوْمَ تَبْيَضُّ وُجُوهٌ وَتَسْوَدُّ وُجُوهٌ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(On the Day when some faces will become white and some faces will become black.) (3:106) Similarly Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ مُّسْفِرَةٌ &#8211; ضَـحِكَةٌ مُّسْتَبْشِرَةٌ &#8211; وَوُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ عَلَيْهَا غَبَرَةٌ &#8211; تَرْهَقُهَا قَتَرَةٌ &#8211; أُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْكَفَرَةُ الْفَجَرَةُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Some faces that Day will be bright. Laughing, rejoicing at the good news. And other faces, that Day will be dust-stained; darkness will cover them, such will be the disbelieving, wicked.) (80:38-42) Allah also says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ خَـشِعَةٌ &#8211; عَامِلَةٌ نَّاصِبَةٌ &#8211; تَصْلَى نَاراً حَامِيَةً ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Some faces, that Day will be humiliated. Laboring, weary. They will enter in the hot blazing Fire.) (88:2-4) until Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ نَّاعِمَةٌ &#8211; لِّسَعْيِهَا رَاضِيَةٌ فِى جَنَّةٍ عَالِيَةٍ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((Other) faces that Day will be joyful. Happy with their endeavor. In a lofty Paradise.) (88:8-10) And there are other similar Ayat and discussions (in the Qur&#8217;an).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[كَلاَّ إِذَا بَلَغَتِ التَّرَاقِىَ &#8211; وَقِيلَ مَنْ رَاقٍ &#8211; وَظَنَّ أَنَّهُ الْفِرَاقُ &#8211; وَالْتَفَّتِ السَّاقُ بِالسَّاقِ &#8211; إِلَى رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْمَسَاقُ &#8211; فَلاَ صَدَّقَ وَلاَ صَلَّى &#8211; وَلَـكِن كَذَّبَ وَتَوَلَّى &#8211; ثُمَّ ذَهَبَ إِلَى أَهْلِهِ يَتَمَطَّى &#8211; أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى &#8211; ثُمَّ أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى &#8211; أَيَحْسَبُ الإِنسَـنُ أَن يُتْرَكَ سُدًى &#8211; أَلَمْ يَكُ نُطْفَةً مِّن مَّنِىٍّ يُمْنَى &#8211; ثُمَّ كَانَ عَلَقَةً فَخَلَقَ فَسَوَّى &#8211; فَجَعَلَ مِنْهُ الزَّوْجَيْنِ الذَّكَرَ وَالاٍّنثَى &#8211; أَلَيْسَ ذَلِكَ بِقَـدِرٍ عَلَى أَن يُحْيِىَ الْمَوْتَى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(26. Nay, when it reaches to the collarbones.) (27. And it will be said: &#8220;Who can cure him&#8221;) (28. And he will think that it was the parting;) (29. And one shank will be joined with another shank.) (30. The drive will be on that Day to your Lord!) (31. So, he neither believed nor prayed!) (32. But on the contrary, he denied and turned away!) (33. Then he walked in conceit to his family admiring himself!) (34. Woe to you! And then woe to you!) (35. Again, woe to you! And then woe to you!) (36. Does man think that he will be left neglected) (37. Was he not a Nutfah of semen emitted) (38. Then he became an `Alaqah; then shaped and fashioned in due proportion.) (39. And made of him two sexes, male and female.) (40. Is it not so then, that He would be able to give life to the dead)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Certainty will occur at the Time of Death Allah informs of the condition at the time of death and what terrors it contains.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah make us firm at that time with the Firm Statement. Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[كَلاَّ إِذَا بَلَغَتِ التَّرَاقِىَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Nay, when it reaches to the collarbones.) If we make the word &#8220;Kalla&#8221; negative, then this Ayah means, `O son of Adam! You are not able to deny that which I informed you of at that time (death). This will become something witnessed by you with your own eyes.&#8217; If we consider the word &#8220;Kalla&#8221; to be a word of affirmation, then this would be the most obvious meaning. In this case it would mean that it is certainly true when the soul reaches the collarbones &#8211; meaning, `your soul will be pulled out of your body and it will reach your collarbones.&#8217; This is similar to Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَلَوْلاَ إِذَا بَلَغَتِ الْحُلْقُومَ &#8211; وَأَنتُمْ حِينَئِذٍ تَنظُرُونَ &#8211; وَنَحْنُ أَقْرَبُ إِلَيْهِ مِنكُمْ وَلَـكِن لاَّ تُبْصِرُونَ &#8211; فَلَوْلاَ إِن كُنتُمْ غَيْرَ مَدِينِينَ &#8211; تَرْجِعُونَهَآ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then why do you not (intervene) when (the soul of the dying person) reaches the throat And you at the moment are looking on, but We are nearer to him than you, but you see not, then why do you not if you are exempt from the reckoning and recompense, bring back the soul, if your are truthful) (56:83-87) Thus, Allah similarly says here,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[كَلاَّ إِذَا بَلَغَتِ التَّرَاقِىَ &#8211; وَقِيلَ مَنْ رَاقٍ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Nay, when it reaches to the collarbones. And it will be said: &#8220;Who can cure him) `Ikrimah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, &#8220;Meaning, who is the person who recites divine prayers of healing so that he may come and cure him&#8221; Abu Qilabah made a similar statement when he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَقِيلَ مَنْ رَاقٍ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And it will be said: &#8220;Who can cure him) &#8220;This means who is the doctor that can cure him&#8221; Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and Ibn Zayd all have similar statements. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said concerning the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَالْتَفَّتِ السَّاقُ بِالسَّاقِ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And one shank will be joined with another shank.) &#8220;This is the last day of the days of this world and the first day of the days of the Hereafter. So there will be hardships that will meet (more) hardships, except for he whom Allah has mercy upon.&#8221; `Ikrimah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَالْتَفَّتِ السَّاقُ بِالسَّاقِ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And one shank will be joined with another shank.) &#8220;The great matter (will be joined) with the great matter.&#8221; Mujahid said, &#8220;A test (will be joined) with a test.&#8221; Al-Hasan Al-Basri said concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَالْتَفَّتِ السَّاقُ بِالسَّاقِ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And one shank will be joined with another shank. ) &#8220;These are your two shins when they are bound together.&#8221; In another narration from him (Al-Hasan) he said, &#8220;His two legs have died and they will not carry him while he used to walk around on them.&#8221; Concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِلَى رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْمَسَاقُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The drive will be on that Day to your Lord!) meaning, the place of return and the destination. This is that the soul ascends into the heavens and Allah says, &#8220;Return my servant to the earth, for verily, I have created them from it, I return them into it, and from it I will bring them out at another time.&#8221; This has been reported in the lengthy Hadith of Al-Bara&#8217;. Verily, Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَهُوَ الْقَاهِرُ فَوْقَ عِبَادِهِ وَيُرْسِلُ عَلَيْكُم حَفَظَةً حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَ أَحَدَكُمُ الْمَوْتُ تَوَفَّتْهُ رُسُلُنَا وَهُمْ لاَ يُفَرِّطُونَ &#8211; ثُمَّ رُدُّواْ إِلَى اللَّهِ مَوْلَـهُمُ الْحَقِّ أَلاَ لَهُ الْحُكْمُ وَهُوَ أَسْرَعُ الْحَـسِبِينَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He is the Irresistible (Supreme), over His servants, and He sends guardians over you, until when death approaches one of you, Our messengers take his soul, and they never neglect their duty. Then they are returned to Allah, their True Master. Surely, for Him is the judgement and He is the swiftest in taking account.) (6:61,62)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Mentioning the Case of the Denier</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَلاَ صَدَّقَ وَلاَ صَلَّى &#8211; وَلَـكِن كَذَّبَ وَتَوَلَّى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So, he neither believed nor prayed! But on the contrary, he denied and turned away!) This is to inform about the disbeliever who used to deny the truth in his heart in the abode of this worldly life, and he used to turn away from acting according to its way. Thus, there is no good in him, internally or externally. Therefore, Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَلاَ صَدَّقَ وَلاَ صَلَّى &#8211; وَلَـكِن كَذَّبَ وَتَوَلَّى &#8211; ثُمَّ ذَهَبَ إِلَى أَهْلِهِ يَتَمَطَّى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So he neither believed nor prayed! But on the contrary, he denied and turned away! Then he walked in conceit (full pride) to his family admiring himself!)(75:31-33) meaning, stubborn, cruel, obstinate, wanton, lazy, having no concern and doing no deeds. This is similar to Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَإِذَا انقَلَبُواْ إِلَى أَهْلِهِمْ انقَلَبُواْ فَكِهِينَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And when they returned to their own people, they would return jesting.) (83:31) Allah also says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِنَّهُ كَانَ فِى أَهْلِهِ مَسْرُوراً &#8211; إِنَّهُ ظَنَّ أَن لَّن يَحُورَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, he was among his people in joy! Verily, he thought that he would never come back (to Us)!) (84:13,14) meaning, return.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[بَلَى إِنَّ رَبَّهُ كَانَ بِهِ بَصِيراً ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Yes! Verily, his Lord has been ever beholding him!) (84:15) Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ثُمَّ ذَهَبَ إِلَى أَهْلِهِ يَتَمَطَّى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then he walked in conceit to his family admiring himself!) &#8220;This means arrogantly.&#8221; Qatadah and Zayd bin Aslam both said, &#8220;Strutting.&#8221; Allah then says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى &#8211; ثُمَّ أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Woe to you! And then woe to you! Again, woe to you! And then woe to you!) This is a definite warning and threat from Allah to those who disbelieve in Him and strut about when walking. This means, `you deserve to strut like this while you have disbelieved in your Creator and Maker.&#8217; This is what is commonly said in this type of situation in order to mock and intimidate (someone). This is as Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ذُقْ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْعَزِيزُ الْكَرِيمُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Taste you (this)! Verily you were (pretending to be) the mighty, the generous!) (44:49) Similarly, Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[كُلُواْ وَتَمَتَّعُواْ قَلِيلاً إِنَّكُمْ مُّجْرِمُونَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Eat and enjoy yourselves for a little. Verily, you are criminals.) (77:46) Allah also says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَاعْبُدُواْ مَا شِئْتُمْ مِّن دُونِهِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So worship what you like besides Him.) (39:15) And like Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[اعْمَلُواْ مَا شِئْتُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Do what you will.) (41:40) There are other examples of this as well. Abu `Abdur-Rahman An-Nasa&#8217;i recorded from Sa`id bin Jubayr that he said, &#8220;I mentioned to Ibn `Abbas,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى &#8211; ثُمَّ أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Woe to you! And then woe to you! Again, woe to you! And then woe to you!) He (Ibn `Abbas) replied, `The Messenger of Allah said this to Abu Jahl, then Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed this Ayah.&#8221;&#8217; Ibn Abi Hatim recorded from Qatadah that he said concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى &#8211; ثُمَّ أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Woe to you! And then woe to you! Again, woe to you! And then woe to you!) &#8220;It is a threat followed by a threat, just as you hear it. They claim that the Prophet of Allah grabbed the clothes of the enemy of Allah, Abu Jahl. The Prophet then said to him, `Woe to you! And then (again) woe to you! Again woe to you! And then (again) woe to you!&#8217; At this the enemy of Allah, Abu Jahl, said, `Are you threatening me, O Muhammad By Allah! Neither you nor your Lord are able to do anything, and verily, I am the mightiest person walking between its (Makkah&#8217;s) two mountains.&#8221;&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Man will not be left neglected</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَيَحْسَبُ الإِنسَـنُ أَن يُتْرَكَ سُدًى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Does man think that he will be left neglected) As-Suddi said, &#8220;Meaning not resurrected.&#8221; Mujahid, Ash-Shafi`i and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam, all said, &#8220;Meaning, he will not be commanded and prohibited.&#8221; Apparently the Ayah includes both meanings. This means that he will not be left neglected in this worldly life, without being commanded and prohibited. He also will not be left neglected in his grave unattended to without being resurrected. Rather he will be commanded and prohibited in this life, and gathered back to Allah in the abode of the Hereafter. The intent here is to affirm the existence of the abode of the final return and to refute whoever rejects it from the people of deviance, ignorance and stubbornness. Thus, Allah uses the beginning of creation as a proof for the repetition of the creation in His saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَلَمْ يَكُ نُطْفَةً مِّن مَّنِىٍّ يُمْنَى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Was he not a Nutfah of semen emitted) meaning, was not man a weak drop of sperm from a despised fluid known as semen, that is emitted from the loins into the wombs</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ثُمَّ كَانَ عَلَقَةً فَخَلَقَ فَسَوَّى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then he became an `Alaqah; then shaped and fashioned in due proportion.) meaning, he became a clot, then a lump of flesh, then he was formed and the soul was blown into him. Then he became a perfect creation with healthy limbs, as either a male or a female by the permission and decree of Allah. Thus, Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَجَعَلَ مِنْهُ الزَّوْجَيْنِ الذَّكَرَ وَالاٍّنثَى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And made of him two sexes, male and female.) Then Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَلَيْسَ ذَلِكَ بِقَـدِرٍ عَلَى أَن يُحْيِىَ الْمَوْتَى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Is it not so then, that He would be able to give life to the dead) meaning, is not He Who made this perfect creation from this weak drop of sperm able to repeat that as He did originally And &#8220;the ability to repeat that&#8221; either refers to the origination only, or to both that and the process of perfecting it, according to two different views, as in Allah&#8217;s saying;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَهُوَ الَّذِى يَبْدَأُ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ وَهُوَ أَهْوَنُ عَلَيْهِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And He it is Who originates the creation, then He will repeat it; this is easier for Him.) (30:27) The first view is more popular, and Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Supplication upon completing this Surah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Dawud recorded from Musa bin Abi `A&#8217;ishah that he said, &#8220;A man used to pray on top of his house and whenever he recited,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَلَيْسَ ذَلِكَ بِقَـدِرٍ عَلَى أَن يُحْيِىَ الْمَوْتَى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Is it not so then, that He would be able to give life to the dead) he would say, `Glory to You, of course.&#8217; So the people asked him about that and he said, `I heard it from the Messenger of Allah .&#8221;&#8217; Abu Dawud was alone in transmitting this Hadith and he did not mention who this Companion was, but there is no harm in that. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Qiyamah, all praise and thanks are due to Allah.</p>

Based on <strong>Sheikh Muhammad ibn al-Uthaymeen</strong>&#8216;s tafseer of selected ayaat in <strong>Surat al-Inshiqaaq</strong></p>

<p><span style="color:#008000;">O man! Verily, you are returning towards your Lord with your deeds and actions (good or bad), a sure returning, so you will meet (i.e. the results of your deeds which you did).</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">Then, as for him who will be given his Record in his right hand,</span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;">He surely will receive an easy reckoning,</span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;">And will return to his family in joy.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">But whosoever is given his Record behind his back,</span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;">He will invoke (his) destruction,</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">And shall enter a blazing Fire, and made to taste its burning.</span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;">Verily, he was among his people in joy!</span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;">Verily, he thought that he would never come back (to Us)!</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;" data-mce-style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color:#993300;" data-mce-style="color: #993300;">Translated selections from Muḥammad Ibn Ṣāliḥ al-‘Uthaymīn’s explanation of&nbsp;</span><span style="color:#993300;" data-mce-style="color: #993300;">“<em>al-‘Aqīdah al-Wāsiṭiyyah</em>” by Ibn Taymiyyah and “<em>Lum’ah al-I’tiqād</em>” by Ibn Qudāmah al-Maqdisī</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" data-mce-style="text-align: justify;">The Day of Resurrection, the Day of Judgment, is called the “last day” because it is a day after which there will be no other. It is the final stage. It is the end goal of all the stages through which we pass (i.e., nonexistence, creation in the womb, life, death and the grave, then the hereafter), and it is the end of our journey.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;" data-mce-style="text-align: left;">Allah ( تعالى ) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;" data-mce-style="text-align: center;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#339966;" data-mce-style="color: #339966;">Then, after that you will all certainly die. Then indeed you all, on the Day of Resurrection, will be resurrected</span>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>[Sūrah al-Muminūn, 23:15-16.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" data-mce-style="text-align: justify;">The resurrection is when mankind will rise from their graves to stand before the Lord of creation. Ibn Taymiyyah, in his book “al-‘Aqīdah al-Wāsiṭiyyah,” calls this “the greater resurrection” indicating there is also a lesser resurrection. This lesser resurrection is the one pertaining to each individual as they witness with their own eyes the beginning of the hereafter, their new life after their death. So each individual has his own resurrection; when he or she dies, his or her lesser resurrection has begun.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Shaytan disowns His Followers on the Day of Resurrection</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(And Shaytan will say when the matter has been decided: &#8220;Verily, Allah promised you a promise of truth. And I too promised you, but I betrayed you. I had no authority over you except that I called you, and you responded to me. So blame me not, but blame yourselves. I cannot help you, nor can you help me. I deny your former act in associating me (Shaytan) as a partner with Allah (by obeying me in the life of the world). Verily, there is a painful torment for the wrongdoers.&#8221;)</span> (Ibrahim 14:22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah narrates to us what Iblis will say to his followers after Allah finishes with the judgement between His servants, sending the believers to the gardens of Paradise and the disbelievers to the lows (of the Fire). Iblis, may Allah curse him, will stand and address the latter, in order to add depression to their depression, sorrow to their sorrow and grief to their grief. He will declare,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Verily, Allah promised you a promise of truth.)</strong> by the words of His Messengers that if you follow them, you will gain safety and deliverance. Truly, Allah&#8217;s promise was true and correct news, while I promised you then betrayed you.&#8217; Allah said in another Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(He (Shaytan) makes promises to them, and arouses in them false desires; and Shaytan&#8217;s promises are nothing but deceptions.)</strong> (4:120)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(I had no authority over you)</strong> Shaytan will say, `I had no proof for what I called you to, nor evidence for what I promised you,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(except that I called you, and you responded to me.)</strong> even though the Messengers establish the proof and unequivocal evidences against you and affirmed the truth of what they were sent to you with. But you disobeyed the Messengers and ended up earning this fate,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(So blame me not,)</strong> today,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(but blame yourselves.)</strong>, because it is your fault for defying the proofs and following me in the falsehood that I called you to.&#8217; Shaytan will say next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(I cannot help you)</strong>, I cannot benefit, save, or deliver you from what you are suffering,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(nor can you help me.)</strong>, nor can you save me and deliver me from the torment and punishment I am suffering,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(I deny your former act of associating me (Shaytan) as a partner with Allah.)</strong> or because you associated me with Allah before,&#8217; according to Qatadah. Ibn Jarir commented; &#8220;I deny being a partner with Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored.&#8221; This opinion is the most plausible, for Allah said in other Ayat,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And who is more astray than one who calls on others besides Allah, such as will not answer him till the Day of Resurrection, and who are (even) unaware of their calls to them And when mankind are gathered, they will become their enemies and will deny their worshipping.)</strong> (46:5-6) and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Nay, but they (the so-called gods) will deny their worship of them, and become opponents to them.)</strong>(19:82) Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>(Verily, the wrongdoers)</strong></span>, who deviate from truth and follow falsehood, will earn a painful torment. It appears that this part of the Ayah narrates the speech that Shaytan will deliver to the people of the Fire after they enter it, as we stated. `Amir Ash-Sha`bi said, &#8220;On the Day of Resurrection, two speakers will address the people. Allah the Exalted will say to `Isa, son of Maryam,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>(Did you say unto men: &#8220;Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allah&#8221;)</strong></span> (5:116) until,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>(Allah will say: &#8220;This is a Day on which the truthful will profit from their truth.&#8221;)</strong></span>(5:119) Shaytan, may Allah curse him, will stand and address the people,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#333333;"><strong>I had no authority over you except that I called you, and you responded to me</strong></span>.) Allah next mentioned the final destination of the miserable ones, who earned the disgrace and torment and having to listen to Shaytan address them, then He mentioned the final destination of the happy ones.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Notes</strong> :<br />
1. Allaah says:<br />
&#8220;Some faces that Day shall be shining and radiant. Looking at their Lord&#8221;. (Soorah al-Qiyaamah 75:22-23) Shuaib reports that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Peace be upon him) said, &#8220;When the people of Paradise enter Paradise, Allaah, the Blessed and Most High, will say &#8216;Do you wish for anything extra that I may give you?&#8217; They will say &#8216;Have You not brightened our faces? Have You not entered us into Paradise and saved us from the Fire?&#8217; So He will remove the screen and they will not have been given anything more beloved to them as looking at their Lord, the Mighty and Majestic.&#8221; Reported by Muslim (Eng. trans. 1/114/no. 347) and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hanbal said: I spoke to Abu &#8216;Abdullaah, meaning Ahmad (ibn Hanbal) about seeing Allaah (ar-Ru&#8217;yah). He said, &#8220;They are authentic ahaadeeth. We have Faith (Eemaan) in them and affirm it. We have Faith in and affirm everything reported from the Prophet (Peace be upon him) with good chains of narration.&#8221; Reported by al-Laalikaa&#8217;ee in Sharh Usool I&#8217;tiqaad Ahl is-Sunnah (no.889).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. &#8216;Adiyy ibn Haatim reports that the Prophet (Peace be upon him) said, &#8220;There is not one of you except that Allaah will speak to him on the Day of Resurrection, there being no interpreter between Him and him.&#8221; Reported by al-Bukhaaree (Eng. trans. 8/358/no.547), Ahmad and at-Tirmidhee.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Source : </strong>Imam Ibn AI-Qayyim, <strong>Kitab al Fawa&#8217;id pg. 6-8</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This chapter clearly shows that Allah, the Exalted returns the same body that had obeyed or disobeyed Him in life, in  order to reward or punish it just like He rewards the soul itself, which believes in Him and punishes the one, which disbelieves in Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That does not mean that Allah, the Exalted creates another soul, which will be rewarded or punished, as some people say.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such people do not understand the nature of the  Resurrection, which the Messengers informed mankind about.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They claim that Allah, the Exalted will create another body that is different in all aspects and that Allah will reward or punish it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They also say that the soul is simply a part of the body, so Allah will create another soul other than this one and a body other than this body.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This belief is contrary to what the Messengers taught, and what the Qur&#8217;an, Sunnah, and other Books of Allah, the Exalted say. This is in fact denial of the Resurrection and adopting the belief of the disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such people find it difficult to comprehend that Allah, the Exalted will recreate the very same body and soul that had known life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They cannot imagine how the body will  become bones and dust and Allah will create it again in its original form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah quotes them as saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">أَإِذَا مِتْنَا وَكُنَّا تُرَابًا وَعِظَامًا أَإِنَّا لَمَبْعُوثُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">which means, &#8220;When we are dead and have become dust and  bones, shall we (then) verily be resurrected? (As-Saffat, 37:16)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And such people also say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ذَٰلِكَ رَجْعٌ بَعِيدٌ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">which means, &#8221; That is a far return.&#8221; (Qaf, 50:3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If what they assert is true and another body other than  the one that had known in life is rewarded or punished, this will neither be Resurrection nor returning back, indeed, it would be a new creation altogether.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the following verse would be rendered meaningless. May Allah forbid!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">قَدْ عَلِمْنَا مَا تَنقُصُ الْأَرْضُ مِنْهُمْ ۖ وَعِندَنَا كِتَابٌ حَفِيظٌ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">which means, &#8220;We know that which the earth takes of them (their dead bodies). 11 (Qaf, 50:4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah answered the question that He, the Exalted will separate these pieces which had mixed with the earth and turned it into elements which are difficult to be separated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allah, the Exalted told mankind that He knows what the earth is taking from their flesh, bones, and hair and just as He knows these pieces He is capable of separating, and gathering them after being separated, and creating them again.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Exalted decides the time of Resurrection by His perfect knowledge, power, and wisdom.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Tafseer Ibn Kathir : 56. Al-Waqi&#8217;ah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(7. And you (all) will be in three groups. )</span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;">(8. So those on the right &#8212; how (fortunate) will be those on the right!)</span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;">(9. And those on the left &#8212; how (unfortunate) will be those on the left!)</span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;">(10. And those foremost will be foremost.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And you (all) will be in three groups.) This means that people will be divided into three categories on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some will on the right of Allah&#8217;s Throne, and they are those who were brought forth from `Adam&#8217;s right side. This category will be given their Books of Records in their right hand and will be taken to the right side. As-Suddi explained that they will comprise the majority of the residents of Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another category is those who will be placed to the left of Allah&#8217;s Throne, and they are those who were brought forth from `Adam&#8217;s left side. This category will be given their Books of Records in their left hands and will be taken to the left side. They are the residents of the Fire, may Allah save us from their actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A third category is comprised of those who are the foremost and nearest before Allah. They are in a better grade and status and nearer to Allah than those on the right side. They are the chiefs of those on the right side, because they include the Messengers, Prophets, true believers and martyrs. They are fewer than those on the right side;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">so Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(So those on the right &#8212; how will be those on the right! And those on the left &#8212; how will be those on the left! And those foremost will be foremost.)</span> Allah divides people into these three groups upon their death, as indicated by the end of this Surah. Allah mentioned them in His statement as well,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Then We gave the Book as inheritance to such of Our servants whom We chose. Then of them are some who wrong themselves, and of them are some who follow a middle course, and of them are some who are, by Allah&#8217;s leave, foremost in good deeds.)</span>(35:32) Muhammad bin Ka`b, Abu Hazrah Ya`qub bin Mujahid said that,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(And those foremost will be foremost.)</span> is about the Prophets, peace be upon them, while As-Suddi said that they are the residents of the utmost highs (Ahl Al-`Illiyyin, in Paradise). The meaning of foremost is that they were foremost in performing the acts of righteousness just as Allah commanded them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(And march forth in the way to forgiveness from your Lord, and for Paradise as wide as the heavens and the earth.)</span>(3:133) and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Race with one another in hastening towards forgiveness from your Lord, and Paradise the width whereof is as the width of the heaven and the earth.)</span>(57:21) Therefore, those who rush to obey Allah in this life and are foremost in performing acts of righteousness, will be among the foremost believers honored in the Hereafter. Verily, the reward is according to the kind of deed, and as one does, so he is judged. So Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(These will be the nearest (to Allah). In the Gardens of Delight.)</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source : <strong>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>(260. And (remember) when Ibrahim said, &#8220;My Lord! Show me how You give life to the dead.&#8221; He (Allah) said: &#8220;Do you not believe&#8221; He (Ibrahim) said: &#8220;Yes (I believe), but to be stronger in faith.&#8221; He said: &#8220;Take four birds, then cause them to incline towards you (then slaughter them, cut them into pieces), and then put a portion of them on every hill, and call them, they will come to you in haste. And know that Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.&#8221;)</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Khalil Supplicates to Allah to Show Him How He Resurrects the Dead</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars said that there are reasons behind this request by Ibrahim. For instance, when Ibrahim said to Nimrod, (My Lord (Allah) is He Who gives life and causes death,) he wanted to solidify his knowledge about resurrection by actually witnessing it with his eyes. Prophet Ibrahim said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">(&#8220;My Lord! Show me how You give life to the dead.&#8221; He (Allah) said: &#8220;Do you not believe&#8221; He (Ibrahim) said: &#8220;Yes (I believe), but to be stronger in faith.&#8221;)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>(We are more liable to be in doubt than Ibrahim when he said, &#8220;My Lord! Show me how You give life to the dead.&#8221; Allah said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you believe&#8221; Ibrahim said, &#8220;Yes (I believe), but (I ask) in order to be stronger in faith.&#8221;)</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet&#8217;s statement in the Hadith means, &#8220;We are more liable to seek certainty.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer to Al-Khalil&#8217;s Request:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">(He said: &#8220;Take four birds, then cause them to incline towards you.&#8221;)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Scholars of Tafsir disagreed over the type of birds mentioned here, although this matter in not relevant due to the fact that the Qur&#8217;an did not mention it. Allah&#8217;s statement, (cause them to incline towards you) means, cut them to pieces. This is the explanation of Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Malik, Abu Al-Aswad Ad-Dili, Wahb bin Munabbih, Al-Hasan and As-Suddi.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, Ibrahim caught four birds, slaughtered them, removed the feathers, tore the birds to pieces and mixed the pieces together. He then placed parts of these mixed pieces on four or seven hills. Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;Ibrahim kept the heads of these birds in his hand. Next, Allah commanded Ibrahim to call the birds to him, and he did as Allah commanded him. Ibrahim witnessed the feathers, blood and flesh of these birds fly to each other, and the parts flew each to their bodies, until every bird came back to life and came walking at a fast pace towards Ibrahim, so that the example that Ibrahim was witnessing would become more impressive. Each bird came to collect its head from Ibrahim&#8217;s hand, and if he gave the bird another head the bird refused to accept it. When Ibrahim gave each bird its own head, the head was placed on its body by Allah&#8217;s leave and power. &#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why Allah said,<br />
(And know that Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise) and no one can overwhelm or resist Him. Whatever Allah wills, occurs without hindrance, because He is the All-Mighty, Supreme above all things, and He is Wise in His statements, actions, legislation and decrees.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Ma`mar said that Ayyub said that Ibn `Abbas commented on what Ibrahim said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(but to be stronger in Faith)</strong>, &#8220;To me, there is no Ayah in the Qur&#8217;an that brings more hope than this Ayah.&#8221; Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Muhammad bin Al-Munkadir said that `Abdullah bin `Abbas met `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As and said to him, &#8220;Which Ayah in the Qur&#8217;an carries more hope for you&#8221; Ibn `Amr said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>(Say: &#8220;O `Ibadi (My servants) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not.)</em></span> (39:53).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;But I say that it is Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And (remember) when Ibrahim said, &#8220;My Lord! Show me how You give life to the dead.&#8221; He (Allah) said: &#8220;Do you not believe&#8221; He (Ibrahim) said: &#8220;Yes (I believe)&#8230;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah accepted Ibrahim&#8217;s affirmation when he merely said, `Yes.&#8217; This Ayah refers to the doubts that attack the heart and the thoughts that Shaytan inspires.&#8221; Al-Hakim also recorded this in Al-Mustadrak and said; &#8220;Its chain is Sahih but they did not record it.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Source :Tafseer Ibn Kathir &#8211; Suratul Baqarah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">( Did you (O Muhammad ) not think of those who went forth from their homes in the thousands, fearing death Allah said to them, &#8220;Die&#8221;. And then He restored them to life. Truly, Allah is full of bounty to mankind, but most men thank not.) [Surah Baqarah Verse243]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abu Hatim related that Ibn `Abbas said that these people mentioned herein, were the residents of a village called Dawardan. `Ali bin `Asim said that they were from Dawardan, a village several miles away from Wasit (in Iraq).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his Tafsir, Waki` bin Jarrah said that Ibn `Abbas commented,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Did you (O Muhammad ) not think of those who went forth from their homes in thousands, fearing death) that they were four thousand persons who escaped the plague (that broke out in their land). They said, &#8220;We should go to a land</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that is free of death!&#8221; When they reached a certain area, Allah said to them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;Die.&#8221;) and they all died. Afterwards, one of the Prophets passed by them and supplicated to Allah to resurrect them and Allah brought them back to life. So, Allah stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Did you (O Muhammad ) not think of those who went forth from their homes in the thousands, fearing death)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, several scholars among the Salaf said that these people were the residents of a city during the time of the Children of Israel. The weather in their land did not suit them and an epidemic broke out. They fled their land fearing death and took refuge in the wilderness. They later arrived at a fertile valley and they filled what is between its two sides. Then Allah sent two angels to them, one from the lower side and the other from the upper side of the valley. The angels screamed once and all the people died instantly, just as the death of one man. They were later moved to a different place, where walls and graves were built around them. They all perished, and their bodies rotted and disintegrated. Long afterwards, one of the Prophets of the Children of Israel, whose name was <strong>Hizqil (Ezekiel)</strong>, passed by them and asked Allah to bring them back to life by his hand. Allah accepted his supplication and commanded him to say, &#8220;O rotted bones, Allah commands you to come together.&#8221; The bones of every body were brought together. Allah then commanded him to say, &#8220;O bones, Allah commands you to be covered with flesh, nerves and skin.&#8221; That also happened while Hizqil was watching. Allah then commanded him to say, &#8220;O souls, Allah commands you to return, each to the body that it used to inhabit.&#8221; They all came back to life, looked around and proclaimed, &#8220;All praise is due to You (O Allah!) and there is no deity worthy of worship except You.&#8221; Allah brought them back to life after they had perished long ago.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We should state that bringing these people back to life is a clear proof that physical resurrection shall occur on the Day of Resurrection.<br />
This is why Allah said:<br />
(Truly, Allah is full of bounty to mankind,) meaning, in that He shows them His great signs, sound proofs and clear evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet, (but most men thank not.) as they do not thank Allah for what He has given them with in their worldly life and religious affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The story of the dead people (2:244 above) also indicates that no caution can ever avert destiny and that there is no refuge from Allah, but to Allah Himself. These people departed from their land fleeing the epidemic and seeking to enjoy a long life. What they earned was the opposite of what they sought, as death came quickly and instantaneously and seized them all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is an authentic Hadith that Imam Ahmad reported that `Abdullah bin `Abbas said that `Umar bin Al-Khattab once went to Ash-Sham (Syria). When he reached the area of Sargh, he was met by the commanders of the army: Abu `Ubaydah bin Jarrah and his companions. They told him that the plague had broken out in Ash-Sham. The Hadith then mentioned that `Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf, who was away attending to some of his affairs, came and said, &#8220;I have knowledge regarding this matter. I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Peace be upon him) say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(If it (the plague) breaks out in a land that you are in, do not leave that land to escape from it. If you hear about it in a land, do not enter it.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Umar then thanked Allah and went back. This Hadith is also reported in the Sahihayn.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Hadith regarding the seven to whom Allah gives shade to, on the day when there will be no shade except His — is it specific to men, or will women receive the reward mentioned if they do exactly the same deeds?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ans:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reward mentioned in this Hadith is not specific to men, but rather, it includes both men and women. The Hadith applies to a young girl, for instance, who grows up worshipping Allah Almighty. Similarly, it applies to women who love one another for the sake of Allah, or to a woman who, when she is seduced by a handsome man of good position, says, “Indeed, I fear Allah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also applies to a woman who gives charity from good and honestly earned wealth, yet her left hand doesn’t know what her right hand has spent, and to the woman who remembers Allah when she is alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the quality of being a just Imam (ruler), or congregational prayer in the Masjid, these two are specific to men, for the prayer of a woman in her home is better for her, a fact that is related in authentic narrations from Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him).</p>
