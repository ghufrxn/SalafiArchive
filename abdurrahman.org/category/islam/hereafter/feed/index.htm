<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>ḤADĪTH 1</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The messenger of Allah (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>أتَانِي جِبْرِيْلُ ، فَقَالَ : يَا مُحَمَّدُ ، عِشْ مَا شِئْتَ فَإِنَّكَ مَيِّتٌ ، وَأَحْببْ مَنْ شِئْتَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>فَإِنَّكَ مُفَارِقُهُ ، وَاعْمَلْ مَا شِئْتَ فَإِنَّكَ مَجْزِيٌّ بهِ ، وَاعْلَمْ أَنَّ شَرَفَ الْمُؤْمِنِ قِيَامُ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>اللَّيْلِ ، وَعِزَّهُ اسْتِغْنَاؤُهُ عَنْ النَّاسِ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">Jibrīl came to me and said, “Oh Muhammad, live how you like for you will certainly die. Love whom you like for you will certainly leave him. Do as you like for you will certainly be compensated for it. And know that the dignity of a believer is his standing at night (in prayer), and his honor is his managing himself without need of other people.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Albānī’s Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ṣaḥīḥah (no. 831)]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">ḤADĪTH 2</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abū Hurayrah (رضي الله عنه) reported that Allah’s messenger (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) asked:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"> أَتَدْرُوْنَ مَا الْمُفْلِسُ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Do you know what a bankrupt person is?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They replied, “A bankrupt person among us is the one with no money or possessions.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) continued:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الْمُفْلِسَ مِنْ أُمَّتِي يَأْتِي يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ بصَلاةٍ وَصِيَامٍ وَزَكَاةٍ، وَيَأْتِي قَدْ شَتَمَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">هَذَا.، وَقَذَفَ هَذَا ، وَأَكَلَ مَالَ هَذَا ، وَسَفَكَ دَمَ هَذَا ، وَضَرَبَ هَذَا ، فَيُعْطَى هَذَا </span><span style="color:#000000;">مِنْ حَسَنَاتِهِ ، وَهَذَا مِنْ حَسَنَاتِهِ ، فَإِنْ فَنِيَتْ حَسَنَاتُهُ قَبْلَ أَنْ يُقْضَى مَا عَلَيْهِ ، </span><span style="color:#000000;">أُخِذَ مِنْ خَطَايَاهِمْ فَطُرِحَتْ عَلَيْهِ ، ثُمَّ طُرِحَ فِي النَّارِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">The bankrupt person from my nation is the one who will come on the Day of Resurrection with prayer, fasting, and charity. But he had insulted this person, slandered that person, cheated this person out of money, spilled this person’s blood, and hit that person. Each of these people (he harmed) will then be given some of his good deeds. And if his good deeds run out before settling his affairs, their sins will be taken and put upon the man, then he will be thrown in the fire.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Albānī’s Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ṣaḥīḥah (no. 847)]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>ḤADĪTH 3</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jābir Ibn ‘Abdullah (رضي الله عنه) reported that the messenger of Allah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">اِتَّقُوْا الظُّلْمَ ، فَإِنَّ الظُّلْمَ ظُلُمَاتٌ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ ، وَاتَّقُوْا الشُحَّ ، فَإِنَّ الشُّحَّ </span><span style="color:#000000;">أَهْلَكَ مَنْ كَانَ قَبْلَكُمْ ، حَمَلَهُمْ عَلَى أَنْ سَفَكُوْا دِمَاءَهُمْ وَاسْتَحَلُّوْا مَحَارِمَهُمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">Beware of oppression because oppression will become darkness on the Day of Resurrection. And beware of stinginess because stinginess destroyed those who came before you. It led them to shed each other’s blood and declare each other’s sanctity permissible to violate.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Albānī’s Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ṣaḥīḥah No. 858]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">ḤADĪTH 4</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Faḍālah Ibn ‘Ubayd reported in a marfū’[<span style="color:#ff0000;">5</span>] form:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">اجْعَلُوْا بَيْنَكُمْ وَبَيْنَ النَّارِ حِجَابًا ، وَلَوْ بشِقِّ تَمْرَةٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">Construct between yourself and the fire a barrier even with half a date (given in charity).</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Albānī’s Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ṣaḥīḥah No. 897]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">5</span>] Ibn al-‘Uthaymīn, in Muṣṭalaḥ al-Ḥadīth, explained a marfū’ ḥadīth as one that is either raised to the status of being directly attributed to the prophet (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) as his explicit statement, action, approval, or as a physical or character description, or it is determined for a number of reasons that the statement carries the ruling of being attributed to the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">ḤADĪTH 5</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas (رضي الله عنه) reported in a marfū’ form:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا أَرَادَ اللَّهَ بعَبْدٍ خَيْرًا عَجَّلَ لَهُ العُقُوْبَةَ فِي الدُّنْيَا ، وَإِذَا أَرَادَ اللَّهَ بعَبْدٍ شَرًّا </span><span style="color:#000000;">أَمْسَكَ عَلَيْهِ ذُنُوْبَهُ حَتَّى يُوَافِيْهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>When Allah wants good for a servant, He hastens his punishment (for his sins) in this life. And if Allah wants bad for a servant, he preserves his sins for him until he meets Him on the Day of Resurrection.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Albānī’s Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ṣaḥīḥah No. 1220]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">ḤADĪTH 6</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Amr Ibn al-Ḥamaq (رضي الله عنه) reported in a marfū’ ḥadīth:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا أَرَادَ اللَّهُ بعَبْدٍ خَيْرًا عَسَّلَهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>When Allah wants good for a servant, He makes others pleased with him. It was asked, “And what is this pleasing respect others have for him, messenger of Allah?” He answered:</strong></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَفْتَحُ لَهُ عَمَلاً صَالِحًا بَيْنَ يَدَيْ مَوْتِهِ حَتَّى يَرْضَى عَنْهُ مَنْ حَوْلَهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">He makes the person able to do good deeds at the time of his death so that those around him are pleased with him.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Albānī’s Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ṣaḥīḥah No. 1114]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">ḤADĪTH 7</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Uqbah Ibn ‘Āmir (رضي الله عنه) reported in a marfū’ form:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا رَأَيْتَ اللَّهَ يُعْطِي الْعَبْدَ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا عَلَى مَعَاصِيْهِ مَا يُحِبُّ ، فَإِنَّمَا هُوَ</span><span style="color:#000000;"> اسْتِدْرَاجٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">If you see that Allah provides for a servant in this life from what he likes because of his sins, it is only <em>Istidrāj </em>(allowing him to gradually increase in sin).</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The messenger of Allah then recited the verse:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَلَمَّا نَسُوْا مَا ذُكِّرُوا بهِ فَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ أَبْوَابَ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ حَتَّى إِذَا فَرِحُوْا بمَا </span><span style="color:#000000;">أُوْتُوْا أَخَذْنَاهُم بَغْتَةً فَإِذَا هُم مُّبْلِسُوْنَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">So when they forgot what they had been reminded about, We opened to them the doors of every (good) thing until, when they rejoiced in that which they were given, We seized them suddenly, and they were (then) in despair.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[The Quran, Sūrah al-Anām, 6:44]  [The ḥadīth is no. 413 in Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ṣaḥīḥah.]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">ḤADĪTH 8</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abdullah Ibn ‘Amr (رضي الله عنه) said, “Once we were around Allah’s messenger ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) when someone mentioned tribulations.” The prophet (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) then said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا رَأَيْتَ النَّاسَ قَدْ مَرِجَتْ عُهُوْدُهُمْ ، وَخَفَّتْ أَمَانَاتُهُمْ ، وَكَانُوْا هَكَذَا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">(It will be) when you see people being unconcerned about their promises and their trustworthiness declines, and they (the people and tribulations) are like this—and he interlocked his fingers.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the ḥadīth narrators then stood and asked him, “What should I do at that time, may Allah ransom you with my life.” He (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) answered:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الْزَمْ بَيْتَكَ ، وَأَمْلِكْ عَلَيْكَ لِسَانَكَ ، وَخُذْ مَا تَعْرِفُ ، وَدَعْ مَا تُنْكِرُ ، وَعَلَيْكَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">بأَمْرِ خَاصَّة نَفْسِكَ ، وَدَعْ عَنْكَ أَمْرَ الْعَامَّةِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">Remain in your house, preserve your tongue, take only what you know, leave what you are unsure about, be concerned only with your own affairs, and leave the affairs of the common people.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Albānī’s Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ṣaḥīḥah No. 205]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">ḤADĪTH 9</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abū Dharr (رضي الله عنه) said, “Messenger of Allah, advise me.” He said ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا عَمِلْتَ سَيِّئَةً فَأَتْبعْهَا حَسَنَةً تَمْحُهَا </span></h2>

<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Ammār Ibn Yāsir (رضي الله عنه) narrated a marfū’ ḥadīth:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas (رضي الله عنه) narrated a marfū’ ḥadīth in which Allah’s messenger ( ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَنْ كَانَتْ الآخِرَةُ هَمَّهُ ، جَعَلَ اللَّهُ غِنَاهُ فِي قَلْبهِ ، وَجَمَعَ لَهُ شَمْلَهُ ، وَأَتَتْهُ </span><span style="color:#000000;">الدُّنْيَا وَهِيَ رَاغِمَةٌ ، وَمَنْ كَانَتْ الدُّنْيَا هَمَّهُ ، جَعَلَ اللَّهُ فَقْرَهُ بَيْنَ عَيْنَيْهِ ، وَفَرَّقَ</span><span style="color:#000000;">عَلَيْهِ شَمْلَهُ ، وَلَمْ يَأْتِهِ مِنْ الدُّنْيَا إِلاَّ مَا قُدِّرَ لَهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">Whoever makes the hereafter his (main) concern, Allah will place his richness in his heart, organize his affairs, and the worldly life will come to him without seeking it. But whoever makes this life his concern, Allah will place his poverty before his eyes, scatter his affairs, and nothing of the worldly life will come to him except what has already been destined for him.</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abū Hurayrah (رضي الله عنه) narrated a marfū’ narration in which the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) asked:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَنْ يَأْخُذُ عَنِّي هَؤُلاءِ الكَلِمَاتِ فَيَعْمَلُ بهِنَّ أَوْ يُعَلِّمُ مَنْ يَعْمَلُ بهِنَّ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">Who will take these words from me and act upon them or teach them to others who may act upon them?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abū Hurayrah said: I replied, “I will, messenger of Allah.” He (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) then took my hand and counted on five fingers, saying:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">اِتَّقِ الْمَحَارِمَ تَكُنْ أَعْبَدَ النَّاسِ ، وَارْضَ بمَا قَسَمَ اللَّهُ لَكَ تَكُنْ أَغْنَى النَّاسِ </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَحْسِنْ إِلَى جَارِكَ تَكُنْ مُؤْمِنًا ، وَأَحِبَّ لِلنَّاسِ مَا تُحِبُّ لِنَفْسِكَ تَكُنْ مُسْلِمًا ، </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَلا تُكْثِرْ الضَّحِكَ ، فَإِنَّ كَثْرَةَ الضَّحِكِ تُمِيتُ القَلْبَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">Be cautious of the prohibited things and you will be the most worshipping of people. Be content with what Allah has destined for you and you will be the richest of people. Behave well toward your neighbor and you will be a true believer. Love for people what you love for yourself and you will be a Muslim. And do not laugh excessively, for excessive laughter kills the heart.</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">ḤADĪTH 44</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Abbās (رضي الله عنه) said that once the messenger of Allah (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) passed by a dead sheep that had been left, discarded by its owner. He said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بيَدِهِ ، لَلدُّنْيَا أَهْوَنُ عَلَى اللَّهِ مِنْ هَذِهِ الشَّاةِ عَلَى أَهْلِهَا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">I swear by the One in whose hand is my soul, this worldly life is more insignificant to Allah than this sheep is to its owner.</span></strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لا يَزَالُ اللَّهُ يَغْرِسُ فِي هَذَا الدِّيْنِ غَرْسًا يَسْتَعْمِلُهُمْ بطَاعَتِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">Allah does not cease to cultivate within this religion those He uses for his obedience.</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F433913241&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Fourth Treatise: The Three Fundamental Principles Which it is Obligatory to Have Knowledge of.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First Fundamental Principle: Knowledge and Awareness of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَإِذَا قِيلَ لَكَ مَا هي الأُصُولُ الثلاثةُ التي تجبُ معرفتُها؟ فقُلْ معرِفةُ العبدِ رَبَّهُ، ودينَهُ، ونبيَّهُ محمدًا صلى الله عليه وسلم</span><strong> </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>So if it is said to you, “What are the three fundamental principles which must be known?”, then say, “The servant’s knowledge of his Lord, and his Religion, and his Prophet Muhammad</strong> <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>.</span> <strong><sup>1</sup> </strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong>[1]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong><em>al-U<u>s</u>ool </em>(fundamental principles)</strong>”, this is the plural of <em>a<u>s</u>l </em>which is that which something else is built upon. And the word <em>far’ </em>(branch or detail) is that which is built upon something else. Therefore these (matters) are called <em>u<u>s</u>ool </em>because other matters from the religion are built upon them. Therefore they are called <em>u<u>s</u>ool </em>because the matter of the religion is built upon them. And the whole of the religion pivots upon these three fundamentals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#000000;">معرِفةُ العبدِ رَبَّهُ </span>“The servant’s knowledge of his Lord”</strong>: <em>Rabbahu </em>(his Lord) is in the accusative case because it is the object of <em>ma’rifah </em>(knowledge) because the verbal noun <em>ma’rifah </em>(knowledge) is attached to the active particle <em>‘abd </em>(servant). And the verbal noun, if attached to something, acts in the manner of its verb according to the scholars of the Arabic grammar. So the verbal noun here is attached and acts in the manner of the verb.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And his Religion and his Prophet”</strong>: This is joined – meaning: to the <em>man<u>s</u>oob </em>(accusative). These are the fundamentals of the religion in general, and their details will follow in the speech of the Shaykh <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah </em>if Allaah wishes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why are these three fundamental principles specifically mentioned? Because they are the foundations of the religion of Islaam and because they are the matters about which the servant will be asked when he is placed in his grave. (This is) because the servant when he is placed in his grave and earth has been laid over him and the people have departed from him returning to their families, then two angels will come to him in the grave and his soul will be returned to his body and he will be given the life of the <em>barzakh</em> (transitional period between this life and the Hereafter); it is not a life like the life of this world. It is a life which Allaah knows best about. So they will make him sit up in his grave and they will say to him, “Who is your Lord and what is your religion and who is your prophet?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the believer will say, “My Lord is Allaah and my religion is Islaam and Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> is my prophet.” So it will be said to him, “How did you know that?” So he will say, “I read the Book of Allaah so I understood it and I knew.” So then a caller will call out, “My servant has spoken the Truth.” So they will lay out for him a bed from Paradise and there will open for him a door to Paradise and his grave will be extended for him as far as the eye can see and the fragrance of Paradise and its gentle breeze will come upon him. So he will look to his living place in Paradise and he will say, “O my Lord, establish the Hour so that I can return to my family and my wealth.”<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the doubter who lived upon misgivings and doubt and lack of certainty even if he claimed to be upon Islaam, if he had doubts and misgivings about the Religion of Allaah like the <em>munaafiq </em>(hypocrite) he will stutter. So when they say to him, “Who is your Lord?” He will say, “I don’t know.” And when they say, “What is your Religion?” He will say, “I don’t know.” And when it is said: “Who is your Prophet?” He will say, “I don’t know. Haah, haah, I don’t know, I heard the people saying something so I said it.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by al Bukhaaree in abridged from the <u>h</u>adeeth of Anas (1338) and Muslim (2870).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: that in the <em>dunyaa </em>(world) he would just say whatever the people said, without having <em>eemaan </em> &#8211; and Allaah’s refuge is sought. This hypocrite who outwardly displayed Islaam, whilst he did not believe it in his heart; rather he outwardly showed it to gain worldly benefits, so he said in the world, “My Lord is Allaah”, but he did not truly believe it; his heart denied it, and Allaah’s refuge is sought. He used to say, “My religion is Islaam”, but he did not have <em>eemaan </em>in Islaam; his heart denied it! He used to say, “My prophet is Mu<u>h</u>ammad<em> <u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>”, but he did not truly believe in the messengership of Mu<u>h</u>ammad in his heart! Rather he said it upon his tongue only  &#8211; this is the <em>munaafiq </em>(hypocrite). So it will be said to him: “You did not know and you did not read!” So he will be struck with an iron sledgehammer which will cause him to scream in such a manner that if men and jinn were to hear it, they would drop down dead. It will be heard by everything except for mankind; if he were to hear it he would drop down dead – meaning, he would die from terror. He will be crushed in his grave until his ribs cross over and a gate to the Fire will be opened for him and its fierce and poisonous wind will come upon him and its heat. And he will say, “O my Lord, do not establish the Hour!” This will be his life and his condition in the grave &#8211; and Allaah’s refuge is sought – because he did not give the correct answer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore a caller will call out, “My servant has lied”. So they will lay out for him a bed from the Fire and they will open for him a door to the Fire  &#8211; and Allaah’s refuge is sought. So since these matters are this important it is obligatory upon us to learn them and to hold them as our creed and belief. And it is not sufficient just to learn them alone; rather we learn them and we hold them as our creed, and we have <em>eemaan </em>in them and we act upon them for as long as we live, hoping that Allaah makes us firm at the questioning in the grave. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يُثَبِّتُ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا بِالْقَوْلِ الثَّابِتِ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا وَفِي الْآخِرَةِ ۖ وَيُضِلُّ اللَّهُ الظَّالِمِينَ ۚ وَيَفْعَلُ اللَّهُ مَا يَشَاءُ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah makes firm those who truly believe with the firm saying in the life of this world and in the Hereafter. And Allaah misguides the disbelieving wrongdoers. And Allaah does whatever He wishes. </strong></span>[14:27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these three fundamental principles have tremendous importance, and therefore the Shaykh focused upon them in this treatise and he clarified them so that we should study them and carefully examine them and so that we should hold them as our creed and belief and act upon them hoping that Allaah should make us and you firm with the firm saying in the life of this world and in the Hereafter.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> that Allaah will punish the creation in the Fire in shackles, fetters and chains. The Fire will be inside them and above them and below them. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Whereas, the Jahmiyyah among them <u>H</u>ishaam al-Foo<u>t</u>ee said, “<em>Allaah will only punish them next to the Fire</em>” in rebuttal of Allaah and His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“<strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) that Allaah will punish the creation in the Fire in shackles, fetters and chains. The Fire will be inside them and above them and beneath them,” </strong></span>Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, will cause the Fire to blaze with the bodies of the disbelievers. So they are firewood for the Fire of Hell.</p>
<p><strong>وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمْ وَقُودُ النَّارِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (the disbelievers)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> are fuel for the Fire.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah-Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It will burn with them and use their bodies as fuel and Allaah’s refuge is sought.</p>
<p><strong>فَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا قُطِّعَتْ لَهُمْ ثِيَابٌ مِّن نَّارٍ يُصَبُّ مِن فَوْقِ رُءُوسِهِمُ الْحَمِيمُ ..</strong></p>
<p><strong>يُصْهَرُ بِهِ مَا فِي بُطُونِهِمْ وَالْجُلُودُ </strong></p>
<p><strong>وَلَهُم مَّقَامِعُ مِنْ حَدِيدٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So those who disbelieve will have garments of Fire put out for them, boiling water will be poured down from above upon their heads. It will melt their insides and their skins. And there will be for them hooked rods of iron with which they will be beaten.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ajj (22), <em>aayah </em>19-21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah mentioned that the torment will occur upon the bodies of the disbelievers and that the Fire will burn with them and blaze away consuming them.</p>
<p><strong> يُصَبُّ مِن فَوْقِ رُءُوسِهِمُ الْحَمِيمُ ..</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">…<strong> Boiling water will be poured down upon their heads from above. </strong></span>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ajj (22), <em>aayah </em>19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the Mu`tazilah, there are those who said, <em>“They will not be tortured and the Fire will not blaze away burning their bodies. Rather, they will be punished by the Fire only. As for their bodies then they will not actually burn.”</em> Whereas, Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says in the Qur&#8217;aan that they are the Fuel of the Fire and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The first of those whom the Fire will blaze on the Day of Resurrection will be the scholar who did not act upon his knowledge and the one who gave in charity who shows off in giving charity and the mujaahid (who fought in Allaah’s path) who fought to show off.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word <strong><em>al-aghlaal</em></strong> (shackles), its meaning is that his hands will be bound to his neck and Allaah’s refuge is sought. And <strong><em>al-ankaal</em></strong> (fetters) are instruments of torture.</p>
<p><strong>إِنَّا أَعْتَدْنَا لِلْكَافِرِينَ سَلَاسِلَ وَأَغْلَالًا وَسَعِيرًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We have prepared for the disbelievers iron chains and fetters to bind their hands and a blazing Fire. </strong></span><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratul-Insaan (76), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah </em><span style="font-size:1rem;">4)</span></p>
<p><strong>إِنَّ لَدَيْنَا أَنكَالًا وَجَحِيمًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">We have fetters and a raging Fire.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Muzammil (73), <em>aayah </em>12)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This word <em>al-ankaal</em> (fetters), they are instruments of torture; Allaah’s refuge is sought. Chains and shackles and a blazing Fire. And the Fire will be in their bellies inside of them and above them and beneath them.</p>
<p><strong>لَهُم مِّن جَهَنَّمَ مِهَادٌ وَمِن فَوْقِهِمْ غَوَاشٍ ۚ وَكَذَٰلِكَ نَجْزِي الظَّالِمِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They (the disbelievers) will have the Hellfire as a bed. Over them, there will be coverings of Fire and likewise, We will recompense the disbelieving wrongdoers.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>41)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong> mentions in his lectures of the explanation, he said, “His teacher was <strong>Al-Hu<u>dh</u>ayl</strong>, well-known as Al-`Allaaf and that he had this deviated belief that those who enter the Hellfire, after they have been in the Fire for some time, they will become of the same nature as the Fire so it will become natural for them to the extent that they will feel delight in the Fire.

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 45: Points 70 &amp; 71</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[70] And to have <em>eemaan</em> that the deceased will be made to sit up in his grave and his soul will be restored to him in order that <em>Munkar</em> and <em>Nakeer</em> should question him about <em>eemaan</em> and its required duties then his soul will be gently removed from him without any pain. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[71] And the deceased recognises the one who visits him when he visits him and the believer will experience bliss in the grave and the wicked will be punished as Allaah wishes. </strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/eemaan-in-al-fitnatu-fil-qabr-the-trial-in-the-grave" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“</span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And to have eemaan that the deceased will be made to sit up in his grave,”</span> </strong>it is obligatory to have <em>eemaan</em> that the deceased will be made to sit up in his grave and his soul will be restored to his body and two angels will come to him; one of them is <em>Munkar</em> and the other is <em>An-Nakeer</em>. So, they will both question him and this is <strong><em>al-fitnatu fil-qabr</em> (the trial in the grave)</strong> and it is the most severe thing that will come upon the deceased. If he is saved from this trial then he will be saved from that which comes after it and if he is not saved from this trial then he will be destroyed. There will be no salvation for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The two of them will ask him about three matters:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong><em>Man Rabbuk</em></strong><strong>? (Who is your Lord?) </strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the believer will say “<em>Rabbiyy Allaah”</em> (My Lord is Allaah). Whereas, the <em>munaafiq</em> (hypocrite) will say, “<em>Hah! Hah!!</em> <em>Laa adree</em> (Hah! Hah!! I do not know).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then they will say to him:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong><em>Maa Deenuk?</em></strong><strong> (What is your religion?) </strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the believer will say, “My religion is <em>al-Islaam</em>.” Whereas, the hypocrite and the doubter will say, <em>“Hah! Hah!! Laa adree</em> (Hah! Hah!! I do not know).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then they will say to him:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong><em>Man Nabiyyuk?</em></strong><strong> (Who is your Prophet?) </strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the believer will reply, “My Prophet is Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. Whereas, the hypocrite will say, <em>“Hah! Hah!! Laa adree</em> (Hah! Hah!! I do not know).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the believer will have his grave extended wide for him and he will have bedding provided for him from Paradise and a door will be opened for him leading to Paradise and its pleasant wind and its pleasant fragrance will come upon him and he will experience bliss in his grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whereas, the <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) and the hypocrite, his grave will be restricted upon him and he will be given bedding from the fire and the door to the fire will be opened for him and its heat and its poisonous wind will come upon him.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is the meaning of his saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And his soul will be restored to him so that Munkar and Nakeer can ask him about <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) and about its legislated duties.”</span></strong><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying,<span style="color:#993300;"><strong> “and the deceased recognises the one who visits him when he visit him,” </strong></span>and therefore it is legislated to visit the graves because the deceased takes comfort in the presence of the one who visits him and this is from the affairs of the <em>barzakh</em> (intermediate period). We do not know about the affairs of the Hereafter and the affairs of the intermediate period except what is established by proof because it is from the <em>ilm ul-ghaib</em> (knowledge of the hidden and unseen), which is not known except by Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is not to be derived from this that anything can be requested from the deceased such that it is said, “<em>Since he knows the one who comes to him then why shouldn’t we request what we need from him?</em>” We say, this was not legislated by Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, nothing may be requested from the deceased. The Companions (<em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>aabah</em>) had not used to request anything from the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> even though he was alive in his grave <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in a life of <em>barzakh</em> (intermediate period), not the life of this world.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“and the believer will experience bliss in the grave and the wicked will be punished however Allaah wishes.”</span> </strong>From the fundamentals of <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) is to have <em>eemaan</em> in the punishment of the grave and in its bliss, contrary to the Mu`tazilah; those who denied it. They say, “<em>The deceased in his grave is just the same as when we placed him in it, he receives no torment and no bliss</em>,” relying in this upon their intellects and what they see and on their own thinking and they do not believe in the <em>ghaib</em> (hidden and the unseen). An analogy is not to be made between this world and the Hereafter or between the Hereafter and this world. So, it is upon you to have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in the <em>ghaib</em> (hidden and the unseen).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the punishment of the grave and the bliss of the grave is established. Indeed it is <em>mutawaatir</em> in the a<u>h</u>aadeeth (meaning something that occurs; every level of transmission of narrations, just so many that every level of transmission, there’s so many people who report it that it’s impossible they could have got together and lied upon it) that the deceased will either be punished in his grave or otherwise, he will experience bliss.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, whoever denies the punishment of the grave and he knows of the texts and he knows of the proofs then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever). As for the one who denies it on account of <em>ta`weel</em> (wrong interpretation) or <em>taqleed</em> (blindly following) somebody else in that saying or <em>al-jahl</em> (ignorant) of it then this person, the truth is to be made clear to him and if he then persists after it has been clearly explained, then he is just to be a disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> You find all of this mentioned in the <u>h</u>adeeth of Baraa` ibn `Aazib <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>, reported by al-Bukhaariyy (1,369) and reported by Muslim (2,871) in abridged form. And in longer form by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad in his <em>Musnad</em> and by Aboo Daawood in his <em>Sunan</em> (4,753).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the angels being named as <em>Munkar</em> and <em>Nakeer</em> then that occurs in a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu,</em> reported by Tirmithee as <u>h</u>adeeth 1,071, said authentic by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“When one of you is placed in his grave then two angels; black-blue come to him. One of them is called al-Munkar and the other is called An-Nakeer”.</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Translator’s side point: <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said in his explanation on this point that they will ask about <em>eemaan</em> and about its <em>sharaai</em>`<em>ee</em> (legislated duties),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Perhaps what he intended by this is the general questioning because I do not know anything from the Sunnahs, which indicates that there will be questions about the details of <em>Islaam</em> and <em>Eemaan</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And likewise on the point that came, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“Then his soul will be gently taken out of him again without any pain.” ‘<em>Bilaa alam’</em> (without any pain)</span>, </strong>meaning without the pain which occurred for him at his first death.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Translator’s side point: <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said with regard to this point, <strong>“and the deceased in the grave recognises the one who visits him,”</strong> this is based upon the authenticity of the <u>h</u>adeeth which occurs about that. But there is disagreement about its authenticity as far as I know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s side point: The verifier <strong>Khaalid ar-Raddaadiyy</strong> said, “There are a number of a<u>h</u>aadeeth which mention that the deceased recognises the one who visits him when he visit him and takes comfort from his visit. However, nothing from them is authentic.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s side point: <strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong> <em><u>h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said in his explanation, “This is something, which I do not know any proof for, the point that the deceased in the grave recognises the one who visit him. Rather, what is indicated by the proof is just that he hears the footsteps of those who depart after they have buried him.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Majestic and Most High said:</p>
<p><strong>كُلُّ مَنْ عَلَيْهَا فَانٍ</strong> &#8211; 55:26</p>
<p><strong>وَيَبْقَىٰ وَجْهُ رَبِّكَ ذُو الْجَلَالِ وَالْإِكْرَامِ</strong> &#8211; 55:27</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Everyone upon the earth will perish but the Face of your Lord full of Majesty and Honour will remain.</span> </strong>(Sooratur-Ra<u>h</u>maan (55), <em>aayah</em> 26-27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of the creation will pass away and nothing will remain except Allaah, the Perfect and Most High and in His saying, He, the Perfect:</p>
<p><strong>كُلُّ نَفْسٍ ذَائِقَةُ الْمَوْتِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Every soul shall taste death.</span> </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>185)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He, the Perfect and Most High:</p>
<p><strong>وَنُفِخَ فِي الصُّورِ فَصَعِقَ مَن فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَن فِي الْأَرْضِ إِلَّا مَن شَاءَ اللَّهُ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And the Horn will be blown and all who are in the heavens and the earth will fall down dead except whomever Allaah wishes.</span> </strong>(Sooratuz-Zumar (39), <em>aayah </em>68)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of <em>illaah mann shaa-Allaah</em> (except whomever Allaah wishes). They (the People of Knowledge) said, “it means the angels or the wide-eyed <u>H</u>oor (women in Paradise) and Allaah knows best.”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the whole of the creation will die and then they will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p><strong>ثُمَّ إِنَّكُم بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ لَمَيِّتُونَ &#8211; 23:15</strong></p>
<p><strong>ثُمَّ إِنَّكُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ تُبْعَثُونَ &#8211; 23:16</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then after that you should die then on the Day of Resurrection, you will be raised up to life. </strong></span>(Sooratul-Mu·minoon (23), <em>aayah </em>15-16)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the Muslim should remember death and he should prepare for it with righteous deeds and he should ask Allaah that his life ends with a good conclusion (<em><u>h</u>usn ul-khaatimah)</em> and he should repent from evil deeds and this is the benefit of remembering death. When he remembers death then he should make preparation for it and therefore, he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Remember the cutter off of pleasures; death for you will not remember it over a large amount except that it will render it small nor over a small amount except that it will increase it.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is not befitting that the Muslim should be inattentive to death. Rather, he should remember death always at all times and he should prepare for it and he should have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) in the resurrection; the Day when mankind will rise from their graves, standing up for the Lord of the whole of creation.</p>
<p><strong>ثُمَّ نُفِخَ فِيهِ أُخْرَىٰ فَإِذَا هُمْ قِيَامٌ يَنظُرُونَ</strong> &#8211; 39:68</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then the Horn will be blown again and they will be standing, looking on.</strong></span>(Sooratuz-Zumar (39), <em>aayah </em>68)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The souls shall be restored to them after the bodies have been resurrected from the graves and then they will be led to the gathering place (<em>ma<u>h</u>shar)</em> to the end of what they encounter in the Hereafter from great hazards that they will have to pass through until they settle after that either in Paradise or either in the Fire for indeed Paradise and the Fire are the two abodes of permanent residents.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying <strong>“Everything will pass away except what Allaah has written to pass away will pass away but not Paradise, not the Fire and not the `<em>Arsh</em> (the Throne) and not the <em>Kursee</em> (Footstool),” </strong>for they will not pass away; those two (Paradise and the Fire), they will not pass away and they will not seize to exist. Allaah created them to persist. And as for the heavens and the earth then they will be changed. The heavens will split apart and the earth will split open and this universe will change.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p><strong>يَوْمَ تُبَدَّلُ الْأَرْضُ غَيْرَ الْأَرْضِ وَالسَّمَاوَاتُ ۖ وَبَرَزُوا لِلَّهِ الْوَاحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ</strong> &#8211; 14:48</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">On the Day when the earth is changed to other than the earth and the Heavens and they </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the people)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> will appear before Allaah; the One, the Irresistible Subduer.</span> </strong>(Soorah Ibraaheem (14), <em>aayah </em>48)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the `<em>Arsh</em> (Throne) then it will not change and Paradise and the Fire will not pass away and will not change. <em>W’al Kursee</em> (and the Footstool); it is below the `<em>Arsh</em> (Throne) and the `<em>Arsh</em> (Throne) is bigger than it and the <em>Kursee</em> is wider than the heavens and the earth and the `<em>Arsh</em> (Throne) is wider than the Footstool.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And the Horn,” </strong>the <em><u>S</u>oor</em> is the Horn, which is the Horn which is with the Angel Israafeel. It will be blown along with the souls in it and the souls will fly back into their bodies and come to life with the permission of Allaah.</p>
<p><strong>ثُمَّ نُفِخَ فِيهِ أُخْرَىٰ فَإِذَا هُمْ قِيَامٌ يَنظُرُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then it will be blown another time and they will be standing up looking.</strong></span>(Sooratuz-Zumar (39), <em>aayah </em>68)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And the Pen and the Preserved Tablet,” </strong><em>Al-Lawh ul-Ma<u>h</u>fudh</em> (Preserved Tablet) and the Pen with which Allaah wrote the decreed measures, meaning the decreed measures of how everything would be.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Nothing from this will ever pass away,” </strong>these things which Allaah created to persist; the Throne and the Footstool and the Preserved Tablet and the Pen and Paradise and the Fire and the souls, which were created then they will not pass away.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Then Allaah will resurrect the creation upon what He caused them to die upon on the Day of Resurrection,” </strong>meaning He will resurrect them upon what He caused them to die upon with regard to disbelief or true faith (<em>eemaan)</em>, everyone will be resurrected upon his deeds, meaning upon the deeds that he did. And having <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in the resurrection is one of the six pillars of <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) and having <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in the Last Day occurs joined along with <em>eemaan (true faith)</em> in Allaah in many <em>aayahs.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>W’al Ba’th</em> (and Resurrection), it is restoring mankind to life after their death in the world of the Hereafter. So, they live in this world for the purpose of action then they will die and they will be buried in the earth and they will remain in it for as long as Allaah wishes in the place of waiting and that is <em>Daar</em> <em>ul-Barzakh </em>(Place of Separation), the period separating this world and the Hereafter.Then they will be resurrected from these graves and they will arise from them alive just as they used to be, nothing from their bodies will be lost then the souls will be restored to their bodies then they will be led to the <em>mahshar</em> (gathering place) for the recompensing for their deeds, which they did in the world whether good or bad.</p>
<p> <strong>وَلَا تُجْزَوْنَ إِلَّا مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</strong> &#8211; 36:54</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And you will not be recompensed except for what you did. </strong></span>(Soorah Yaaseen (36), <em>aayah </em>54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, no-one will be rewarded for good that was done by somebody else or punished for the action of someone else.</p>
<p><strong>وَلَا تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَىٰ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of sins committed by someone else.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-An`aam (6), <em>aayah</em> 164)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everyone will be recompensed in accordance with his own deeds whether good or bad and this is justice (<em>adl)</em> from Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. He will not leave them without any recompensing when they had wearied themselves in this life in performing deeds and worship if they were righteous ones. Or wearied themselves, and Allaah’s refuge is sought, with disbelief and <em>shirk</em> and sin and causing corruption upon the earth if they were disbelievers. He will not leave them without a recompensing. This is justice from Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. So, this is the meaning of His saying here that everyone will be recompensed in accordance with his deeds. And since this is the case then it is obligatory upon the servant to look to his deeds, whilst he’s still alive. So, whatever is good then he should equip himself with that and whatever is evil then he should repent to Allaah from it and free himself from it as long as that is possible. He, the Most High said:</p>
<p><strong>يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَلْتَنظُرْ نَفْسٌ مَّا قَدَّمَتْ لِغَدٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe, fear and be dutiful to Allaah and let each soul look at what deeds it has put forward for tomorrow.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ashr (59), <em>aayah </em>18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Take account of yourself in this world before the reckoning, take account of yourself for your deeds and examine them and rectify whatever is corrupt from them and add to whatever is good from them and awaken from heedlessness. This is what is required from the person of intellect and therefore, he <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Al-kayyis (the wise one) (meaning al-`aaqil (the prudent one)), the person of intelligence, he takes account of his-self and acts for that which comes after death. This is the astute person, the `aaqil. And the incapable person is the one who allows himself to follow his desires (meaning in this world) and just has vain hopes in Allaah.</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The incapable person is the one who allows himself just to follow his desires and just has vain hopes in Allaah</strong>, he wants paradise and he wants salvation but he doesn’t do anything. So, this person is incapable, and Allaah’s refuge is sought, <em>aameen</em>, with blameworthy incapacity, it is not physical inability. If he is actually not able to do i.e he does not have the ability to perform deeds, then this one would not be taken to account.</p>
<p><strong>لَا يُكَلِّفُ اللَّهُ نَفْسًا إِلَّا وُسْعَهَا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah does not burden a soul except with what it is able to do.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>286)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, this one; the <strong>`<em>aajiz</em> </strong>(truly incapable person) has ability and he is able to act but the inability is due to laziness &amp; not-caring. This is the one who is truly incapable and yet along with this, he has vain hopes that in the Hereafter he will be from the people of Paradise without any deed, without any action. It is not possible that this one will be from the people of Paradise without any deed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And He will take account of them as He wishes, there will be a group in Paradise and a group in the blazing Fire,” </strong>He will take account of them for their deeds, He, the Perfect and Most High and <em>Al-<u>H</u>isaab</em> (the Reckoning), it is al-<em>munaaqashah</em> (examination) regarding the deeds. So, the people will be in different categories with regard to reckoning. Four categories of people with regards to reckoning in the herefater.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the believers, there will be those who will receive no reckoning so he will enter Paradise without any reckoning and any punishment. May Allaah make us from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them will be those who will be given an easy reckoning and that is just presentation of records.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them are those who will be interrogated in the reckoning :<br />
<strong>“Whoever is closely examined regard his record will be punished.”</strong><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) will not be reckoned with a reckoning involving weighing of deeds. Rather, he will only be reckoned with a reckoning that involves confessing that he will be shown his deeds and his disbelief and his <em>shirk</em> for him to confess it and he will not be able to deny anything at all then he will be sent to the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“There will be a group in Paradise and a group in the blazing Fire,” </strong>this is derived from the <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<p> وَتُنذِرَ يَوْمَ الْجَمْعِ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهِ ۚ فَرِيقٌ فِي الْجَنَّةِ وَفَرِيقٌ فِي السَّعِيرِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And warn them of the Day of the Gathering about which there is no doubt, there will be a group in Paradise and a group in the blazing Fire. </strong></span>(Sooratush-Shooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A group there will be in Paradise</strong> and they are the people of <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) <strong>and there will be a group in the blazing Fire</strong> and they are the people of disbelief and transgression.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>And He will say to the rest of the creation from those who are not created to persist, “Be dust”,” </strong>Allaah will raise up the creation on the Day of Resurrection; the humans and the animals and the birds.</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><strong>وَمَا مِن دَابَّةٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَلَا طَائِرٍ يَطِيرُ بِجَنَاحَيْهِ إِلَّا أُمَمٌ أَمْثَالُكُم ۚ مَّا فَرَّطْنَا فِي الْكِتَابِ مِن شَيْءٍ ۚ ثُمَّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يُحْشَرُونَ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is not a creature upon the earth nor any bird, which flies with its two wings except that they are communities like you. We have not neglected anything from the Book. Then they will be gathered to their Lord.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-An’aam (6), <em>aayah </em>38)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And, He, the Most High said:</p>
<p><strong>وَإِذَا الْوُحُوشُ حُشِرَتْ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And when the wild beasts are gathered. </strong></span>(Sooratut-Takweer (81), <em>aayah </em>5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The created beings will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection in order to establish justice between them to such an extent that revenge will be taken from some for others. The animals; revenge will be taken from some in favour of others to the extent that revenge will be taken for the hornless ram from the ram (male sheep) with horns as occurs in the authentic hadeeth.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then when vengeance has been taken from some for others, Allaah, the Majestic and Most High will say to them “Be dust” because they were not raised up to remain and persist in the Hereafter. Rather, they were only raised up for recompensing only and this is from the justice of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. Then the disbeliever will say:</p>
<p><strong> يَا لَيْتَنِي كُنتُ تُرَابًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> “would that I could be dust.” </strong></span>(Sooratun-Nabaa (78), <em>aayah </em>40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When it will be said to the animals “Be dust”, the disbeliever will vainly wish that he could be like them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> This was mentioned by Al-Baghawee in his Tafseer from A<u>d</u>&#8211;<u>D</u>a<u>hh</u>aak <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(A<u>d</u>&#8211;<u>D</u>a<u>hh</u>aak; famous <em>mufassir</em> of the Qur&#8217;aan referred from a group of <em>Taabi’een</em>, A<u>d</u>&#8211;<u>D</u>a<u>hh</u>aak ibn Muzaahim al-Hilaalee al-Khurasaanee who died in the year 105).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Baghawee mentions that he said (referring to the ones who are accepted), “they are Ridwaan and <em>Al-<u>H</u>oor</em> (the wide-eyed <u>H</u>oorees) and Maalik and Az-Zabaaniyah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> The first part of the <u>h</u>adeeth, <strong>“remember the cutter off of pleasures; death,”</strong> is reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad and at-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee and Ibn Maajah and an-Nasaa`ee and Ibn <u>H</u>ibbaan in his <u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>. That <u>h</u>adeeth up to that wording there was declared <em><u>h</u>asan</em>; <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (good; authentic) by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the full wording then al-Bayhaqee reports that wording <strong>“&#8230;for you will not remember it&#8230;”</strong> in <em>Shu’b al-Eemaan</em> as the <u>h</u>adeeth of ibn `Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhuma</em> and Shaykh al-Albaaniyy declared that particular narration weak in <em>Da`eef al-Jaami` W`Allaahu A`lam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Al-<em>Kursee</em> (the Footstool), Ibn Abee <u>H</u>aatim reported in his Tafseer from Muqaatil that he said in explanation of His saying, He, the Most High:</p>
<p> <strong>كُلُّ شَيْءٍ هَالِكٌ إِلَّا وَجْهَهُ</strong> &#8211; 28:88</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Everything will perish except for Allaah’s Face. </strong></span>(Sooratul-Qasas (28), <em>aayah </em>88)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“All the living things in particular from the inhabitants of the heavens and the angels and whoever is upon the earth and all animals; all living things and then the heavens and the earth will be destroyed after that and Paradise and the Fire will not be destroyed and whatever is within them nor the Throne and nor the Footstool.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> Reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad in his <em>musnad</em> and At-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee and Ibn Maajah and Al-<u>H</u>aakim and Al-Baghawee in <em>Sharhus-Sunnah</em> and others from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Shaddaad ibn Aws <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu </em>and it was declared authentic by Al-<u>H</u>aakim and declared <em><u>h</u>asan</em> (good) by At-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee and Al-Baghawee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> As for Shaykh Al-Albaaniyy then he declared this narration <em><u>d</u>a`eef</em> (weak) in his checking of <em>Mishkaat </em>in <em>A<u>d</u>&#8211;<u>D</u>a`eefah</em> <u>h</u>adeeth 5,319 because of the weakness of its narrator Aboo Bakr ibn Abee Maryam al-Ghassaanee, <em>W`Allaahu A’lam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Famous narration from `Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> with a similar meaning to the end of what’s reported. Imaam A<u>h</u>mad reports it in his book <em>Az-Zuhd</em> as the saying of Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>. <em>W`Allaahu A’lam</em>:<strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Take account of yourselves before you are taken account of.” </strong></p>

<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>[Listen to 32 (Part A) </strong></span><strong><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/12/15/there-is-to-be-no-obedience-to-any-human-in-disobedience-to-allaah/">Here</a></strong><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And know, that there is to be no obedience to any human in disobedience to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. </span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And whoever is from the people of Islaam then do not bear witness (of Paradise or the Fire) for him on account of his having done a deed, whether good or bad, since you do not know what his deeds will be concluded with at the point of death. You hope for Allaah’s Mercy for him and you fear for him (because of his sins). You do not know what is destined for him at the point of death with regard to his repenting to Allaah and what Allaah may bring about for him at that time if he dies upon Islaam. You hope for (Allaah’s) Mercy for him and you fear for him because of his sins. And there is no sin except that the servant may repent from it.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;">[only highlighted portion of the above point is covered in this post]</span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/bearing-witness-of-paradise-or-of-the-fire-for-a-specific-individual-without-a-proof" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And witness (meaning regarding Paradise or the Fire) may not be given against anyone nor for him based upon his having done a good or bad deed.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This matter of bearing witness of Paradise or of the Fire for a specific individual, this is that matter. So witness is not given for a specific individual that he will be in Paradise nor is witness given that he will be in the Fire, except with a proof from the Book and the Sunnah. As for one who there is no proof to state that he is from the people of Paradise, even if he is a righteous person, a believer, we do not do so because we do not know what his concluding action will be. And likewise, a sinful person or a disbeliever, we do not state for certain that the individual that he is from the people of the Fire because he might repent and we do not know. He <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“One of you may perform the actions of the people of Paradise until there is not between him and it except a cubit (forearm); but then what was written overtakes him and he acts with the action of the people of the Fire and therefore he enters it. And one of you may act with the actions of the people of the Fire until there is not between him and it except a forearm (a cubit) and then what was written overtakes him and he acts with the action of the people of Paradise and therefore he enters it.”</span></strong> [05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Actions are in accordance with their conclusions.”</span> </strong>[06 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the concluding actions are not known except to Allaah, the Knower of all hidden things, He, the Perfect and Most High. But as for us, then we have fear for the people of sins and we have hope for the people of acts of obedience but we do not state with certainty. Rather, we have hope for those who are obedient but we do not state with certainty, and we have fear for the sinful ones but we do not state with certainty. This is with regard to specific individuals. As for in general, then we state with certainty that the people of eemaan (true belief) are the people of Paradise and we state with certainty that the disbelievers are the people of the Fire. Allaah, the Most High, said with regard to the Fire:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">It has already been prepared for the disbelievers.</span></strong><br />
(Soorah-Aali `Imraan (3), aayah 131)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said with regard to Paradise:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">It has already been prepared for those who have taqwaa (those who are fearful of Allaah and dutiful to Him).</span> </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), aayah 133)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is with regard to in general. As for specific individuals and specific people, then this is entrusted to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. However, we behave and deal with them on the basis of what is apparent. We deal with the people of obedience in accordance with what appears from them and we deal with the people of sins in accordance to what is apparent from them. We pass judgement in accordance with what is apparent only, not stating the final destination and the final outcome, for that lies in the Hand of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. [07]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[05] Reported by al-Bukhaariyy in his Saheeh (no. 6594) and Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 2643) from the hadeeth of `Abdullaah ibn Mas`ood <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> the famous hadeeth of as-Saadiq al-Masdooq, the fourth hadeeth in an-Nawawiyy’s Forty Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[06] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> the wording of a hadeeth</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[07] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmiyy <em>rahimahullaah</em> dealt with a point, which wasn’t dealt with here directly: <strong><span style="color:#808000;">“And there is no sin except that the servant can repent from it.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmiyy <em>rahimahullaah</em> said in his explanation, “At-Towbah (repentance) is acceptable from every sin with regard to the rulings relating to the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong>Translator’s note:</strong> meaning, in the Hereafter that would be wiped away from him. When `Amr ibn al-`Aas came to accept Islaam and the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> told him to put out his hand to give his pledge &#8211; that’s when he withheld it for a moment. He said, “Because I want to make a condition.” So the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> asked him what condition he wanted to make. He said, “What I did before should be forgiven.” So therefore the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said the hadeeth the shaykh quotes here.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And the Prophet s<em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said to `Amr ibn al-`Aas radiyAllaahu `anhu,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">‘Do you not know that Islaam demolishes what came before it and that performing Hijrah demolishes what came before it and that the Hajj demolishes what came before it.’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Reported by Muslim (121) in the Book of Eemaan)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“And his saying with regard to the man who killed ninety-nine men, ‘And who can come between him and between repentance?’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The hadeeth reported by Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And the ahaadeeth in this regard are very clear. And the disagreement is with regard to a person who spoke with words of abuse against the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> or against the Qur·aan &#8211; is his repentance accepted with regard to this world or is judgement passed that he is to be executed, even if he makes clear his repentance? Then this has been clarified by Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah in his book As-Saarimul-Maslool `alaa Shaatimir-Rasool <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And Allaah is the One who grants success.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 19 : Point 19</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And to have eemaan in the siraat </span></strong><span style="color:#993300;">(the Bridge)</span><strong><span style="color:#993300;"> over the Hellfire. The Bridge will seize whomever Allaah wishes. And whoever Allaah wishes will cross over. And whoever Allaah wishes will fall into the Hellfire. And they will have lights in accordance with the level of their eemaan.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F365778335&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/eemaan-in-the-siraat-the-bridge-over-the-hellfire" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From that which will occur on the Day of Resurrection is the passing over the <em>siraat</em> (Bridge) as has already been mentioned. And the siraat, in the language means <em>at-tareeq</em> (a path). And what is meant here is the Bridge laid down over the top of the Hellfire. And it will be very thin, thinner than a hair and sharper than a sword and hotter than burning coals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The creation will pass over it in accordance with the level of their deeds. Their deeds will cause them to proceed. So whoever is saved then he has succeeded and whoever is not saved is destroyed. And the people crossing over it will be in accordance with the level of their deeds. So some of them will cross over like the blinking of the eye. And some of them will cross over like the flash of lightening. And some of them will cross over like the wind. And some of them will cross over like fast horses. And some of them will cross over like riders upon camels. And some of them will run, running upon feet. And some of them will walk. And some of them will crawl. And some of them will be seized and thrown down into the Hellfire. And this is mentioned in the Honourable Qur&#8217;aan and in the Prophetic Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So by your Lord We shall certainly gather them and the devils. Then We shall bring them around the Hellfire upon their knees.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Up until His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is not one of you except that he will have to cross over it. It is a binding decree from your Lord.</span> </strong>(Soorah Maryam (19), aayahs 68-71)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(‘Cross over it’)</strong> meaning the Hellfire. And this crossing, it is the crossing over the siraat, the Bridge. This is the crossing which is mentioned in the Qur&#8217;aan. And the address here is to the believers and to other than them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is not one of you except that he will have to cross over it. The believers and the disbelievers and the hypocrites will cross over it. All of the creation will cross over this Bridge. So whoever is saved from it (crosses it successfully) then he will enter Paradise. And whoever falls down is destroyed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Then We will save those who had taqwaa </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(those who were fearful of Allaah and dutiful to Him)</span> (Soorah Maryam (19), aayah 72)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nothing will bring about salvation except for <em><strong>taqwaa</strong> </em>(dutifulness to Allaah). Strength of body will not save nor will having plentiful wealth nor will status. Nothing will bring about salvation except taqwaa (being dutiful) to Allaah the Perfect and Most High. This is the textual statement in the Honourable Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And ahaadeeth occur in the Sunnah regarding the terrors of the Resurrection. And from them is the crossing over the siraat, the Bridge. So it is essential to have eemaan in the Bridge and in the crossing over it. And it is not sufficient to just believe in that; rather there must be action. So therefore a person should prepare for the crossing over it by having taqwaa (by being dutiful to Allaah); and that is righteous deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“The Bridge will seize whomever Allaah wishes and whoever Allaah wishes will cross over.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then We shall save those who were dutiful to Allaah and We will leave the disbelieving wrongdoers in the Hellfire upon their knees</strong></span> (Soorah Maryam (19), aayah 72)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because the siraat will have hooks upon it that will seize whomever they are commanded to seize.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“he will cross”</strong>. Meaning he will pass over it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And they (the people) will have light in accordance with the level of their eemaan.”</strong> On the Day of Resurrection, the people of eemaan (true believers), they will have light. And they will walk within it. Just as He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Their light will run before them. And their books will be in their right hands. They will say O our Lord, complete our light for us and forgive us. Indeed you have full ability over everything</strong></span> (Sooratut-Tahreem (66), aayah 8)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The Day when you shall see the believing men and the believing women with their light running before them and their books will be in their right hands. It will be said to them, glad tidings to you this day of gardens beneath which rivers flow. You will remain therein forever. That is the tremendous success.</strong> </span>(Sooratul-Hadeed (57), aayah 12)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The munafiqoon (hypocrites)</strong> will be given light initially, because of the fact that they entered into Islaam and they outwardly displayed Islaam (in the world). So therefore they will be treated in accordance with what they outwardly showed. They will be given light, but it will be as a trick, just as they sought to trick with their Islaam. So therefore they will be given light as a trick upon them and then their light will be extinguished and they will remain in darkness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">On the Day when the hypocrites men and women will say to the believers: &#8220;Wait for us! Let us get something from your light!&#8221; It will be said: &#8220;Go back to your rear! Then seek a light!&#8221; So a wall will be put up between them, with a gate therein. Inside it will be mercy, and outside it will be torment.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(The hypocrites)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> will call the believers: &#8220;Were we not with you?&#8221; The believers will reply: &#8220;Yes! But you led yourselves into temptations, you looked forward for our destruction; you doubted </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(in Faith)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">; and you were deceived by false desires, till the Command of Allah came to pass. And the chief deceiver </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Satan)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> deceived you in respect of Allah.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So this Day no ransom shall be taken from you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(hypocrites)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, nor of those who disbelieved, </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">. Your abode is the Fire, that is the proper place for you, and worst indeed is that destination.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Hadeed (57), aayahs 13 &#8211; 15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So eemaan will have light on the Day of Resurrection within which the person will proceed. Whereas the disbelievers and the hypocrites will be in darkness, and Allaah’s refuge is sought. They will not know where they are going.</p>

<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And to have <em>eemaan</em> in the Intercession (the Shafaa`ah) of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> on the Day of Resurrection for those guilty of sins; and upon the Bridge (as-Siraat), and to cause them to come out from within the Hell Fire. There is no Prophet except that he will have Intercession. And likewise will be the case with the eminently truthful and sincere followers of the Prophets, and the martyrs and the righteous people. And after that Allaah will bestow favour abundantly upon whomever He wishes; and people will come out of the Fire after they have been burnt and reduced to charcoal.</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/eemaan-in-the-intercession-of-allaahs-messenger-on-the-day-of-resurrection" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the fundamentals of the (creed and belief of) Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah is <em>eemaan</em> in ash-Shafaa`ah (the Intercession) with the preconditions which are mentioned by Allaah the Majestic and Most High. That it has to be with His Permission, and that the one being interceded for is from the people of <em>eemaan</em>. As for the one who is interceded for being from the people who are disbelievers, then Intercession will not be accepted for him. He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So the Intercession of those who intercede will not benefit them (the disbelievers).</span></strong> (Sooratul-Muddaththir (74), aayah 48)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The disbelieving wrongdoers will have no close friend nor any intercessor who will be given heed to</span></strong>. (Soorah Ghaafir (40), aayah 18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the disbeliever, there will never be any Intercession for him ever. As for the believer, then Intercession is established for him if Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, grants permission. And the greatest of the intercessors and the Noble Chief of those who intercede will be our Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So he will have Intercessions which will be specific to him and also Intercessions which he shares along with others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And to have <em>eemaan</em> in the Intercession of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> for those guilty of sins on the Day of Resurrection; and upon the Bridge (Siraat)”</strong>. The Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is the greatest one of those who will intercede on the Day of Resurrection. Indeed he will intercede for all of the people upon the standing place, so that Allaah relieves them from the standing and brings them to account; because the standing will be prolonged for them. Along with severe distress and severe heat and severe thirst and extreme fear, the standing will be prolonged for them, the standing of the Hashr, the Gathering. So therefore they will go to Oolil-`Azm, those Messengers who are firmest in resolve, and request from them that they should supplicate to Allaah to relieve them of the standing, so that they go either to Paradise or to the Fire. So they will go to Aadam and he will excuse himself. And they will go to Nooh and he will excuse himself. And they will go to Ibraaheem and he will excuse himself. And they will go to Moosaa and he will excuse himself. And they will go to `Eesaa and he will excuse himself. And they will go to Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and he will say, “I am the one for it.” Then he will go and he will fall down in prostration beneath the `Arsh, the Throne because there will be no intercession for anyone except with the permission of Allaah. Therefore he will fall down in prostration and make supplication to his Lord until it is said to him, “<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O Muhammad raise your head. Ask and you will be given. Intercede and your intercession will be accepted</strong></span>.” [03] So Allaah will grant permission for him to intercede and he will intercede on behalf of the people of the gathering place for them to move on from the gathering place to the <em>Hisaab</em>, Reckoning. This is <strong>ash-Shafaa`atul-Uzmaa</strong>, the Major Intercession which Allaah will favour him with over the creation. He, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And during the night pray tahajjud as an extra Prayer for you. Your Lord shall certainly raise you to a praiseworthy standing place.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Israa· (17), aayah 79)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This praiseworthy standing place (<strong>al-maqaamul-mahmood</strong>) is ash-Shafaa`atul-Uzmaa, the Major Intercession. And there occurs in the supplication which is said after the athaan,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><strong>Grant Muhammad al-waseelah (the place of honour in Paradise) and al-fadeelah (the position of superior virtue) and raise him to maqaamam-mahmoodaa (the praiseworthy standing place) which you have promised him.</strong></em> [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is ash-Shafaa`atul-Uzmaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise he will intercede with regard to the people guilty of major sins from the nation. He <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> will intercede for them that, either they do not enter the Fire, or otherwise that they be brought out from it if they do enter it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> will intercede for them, and this is not specific to him. So he will intercede, and all of the Prophets will intercede. And the owliyaa· (beloved and obedient servants of Allaah) will intercede and the afraat, they are those who die young, they will intercede for those Muslims who are guilty of major sins. This point is contrary to the Jahmiyyah and the Mu`tazilah and the Khawaarij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Khawaarij, they are those who rebel against the rulers, the rulers of the Muslims, by using the sword, and they break the due obedience. And they are also those who declare a Muslim to be a disbeliever on account of major sins which are less than shirk. They are the Khawaarij. They were called Khawaarij (literally those who depart or exit or revolt) because they depart from what is legislated and they revolt against the person in authority and they break the due obedience. Those people deny the Intercession and they say, “Whoever enters the Fire will never come out from it.” And they use as evidence His saying, He, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They will not come out from the Hell Fire</strong></span> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 167)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we say: This is with regard to the <em>kuffaar</em> (disbelievers). So the disbelievers will never come out from the Fire. But as for the Intercession which is meant here, then it is with regard to the people of <em>eemaan</em>, those who are believers who are guilty of major sins; and it is established. And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Who (none) can intercede with Him (Allaah) except with His permission</strong> </span>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 255)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It indicates that only if He grants permission can anyone intercede. And likewise His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And how many angels there are in the heavens whose Intercession will not benefit at all except after Allaah grants permission for whomever He wishes and is pleased with.</span></strong> (Sooratun-Najm (53), aayah 26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">This contains the two conditions for the Shafaa`ah</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">That Allaah grants permission; this is the first condition and</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">That He is pleased, this is the second condition, He is pleased with the one who is being interceded for. And He is not pleased except with a believer. As for the disbeliever, He will not be pleased with him.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So those who contradict the people of the Sunnah with regard to the Intercession take two opposite positions. From them are those who deny the Intercession. And they are the Khawaarij and the Mu`tazilah, those who declare people to be disbelievers on account of major sins which are less than shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the second group are those who go beyond the limits in affirming Intercession. And they are the Soofees and the grave worshippers, those who depend totally upon Intercession and who turn to the graves and who seek aid from the dead. They seek intercession from them, (from the dead). Just as He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they worship besides Allaah others who cannot harm them nor benefit them and they say, “Those are our intercessors with Allaah.”</strong></span> (Soorah Yoonus (10), aayah 18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They worship them in order that they should intercede for them with Allaah. As for those who take the middle position, and they are the Ahlus-Sunnah walJamaa`ah, they do not deny Intercession totally and they do not affirm it unrestrictedly. Rather they affirm it with the two conditions which occur in the Book and the Sunnah. This is the conclusion on the topic of the Intercession.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, <strong>“And Intercession is established for those who are sinful, guilty of sins.”</strong> Meaning Intercession will be for the believers who are guilty of sins. Those who do not reach the level of <em>kufr</em>, disbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And it will occur upon the Siraat (Bridge) over the Fire.”</strong> Meaning:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> will intercede for the believers whilst they are crossing the Bridge</strong>. And he will intercede for those who have entered the Fire that they should be brought out from it, if they are from the people of towheed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he will intercede upon the Bridge when the people are passing over it, and it is the Bridge which will be laid across the upper part of the Hell Fire. The people will cross over it in accordance with their deeds. So some of them will cross over it in the blinking of an eye. And some of them will cross over it like lightening. And some of them will cross over it like the passing of the wind. And some will cross over it like fast horses. And some will cross over it like the riders of camels. And some will be running over it. And some will be walking. And some will be crawling. And some will be snatched from it and thrown down into the Fire. All of the creation will have to pass over this Bridge, the believers and the disbelievers. And nothing will render them safe except for their deeds. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There is not one of you except that he will have to cross over it</strong></span> (Soorah Maryam (19), aayah 71)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning over the Bridge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">It is a binding decree from your Lord. Then We will rescue those who were dutiful to Allaah and We will leave the wrongdoing disbelievers upon their knees in the Hell Fire.</span> </strong>(Soorah Maryam (19), aayahs 71-72)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So no one will be saved except for the people of taqwaa, dutifulness to Allaah. As for the disbelievers then they will be destroyed in the Fire, and Allaah’s refuge is sought. This is the Siraat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And after that Allaah will bestow Favour abundantly upon whomever He wishes.”</strong> And Allaah will bring out from the Fire some of the believers without the Intercession of those who intercede. Rather by His Favour (<em>fadl</em>), He, the Perfect and Most High. He will bring out some people from the Fire by His <em>fadl</em>, by His Favour, He the Perfect, without the Intercession of anyone, rather just by His <em>fadl</em>, His Favour, He the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying,<strong> “And people will come out from the Fire after they have been burnt and turned to charcoal.”</strong> Allaah the Majestic and Most High informed that the people of the Fire who are to remain forever in it will not die in it nor will they live.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So remind if the reminding will benefit. Those who fear Allaah will take heed of the reminder. But the wretched will avoid it. The one who will enter the Great Fire, then he will not die in it nor will he live.</span></strong> (Sooratul-A`laa (87), aayah 9-13)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the person who does not accept the reminder and does not accept the admonition and continues upon his misguidance, this one will enter Hell Fire; and he will remain in it. And he will not live a life which allows him to rest, and he will not die a death which gives him relief, rather he will remain in torment. But as for the person who enters it from the disobedient people of towheed, then he will be burnt and turned to charcoal. And then he will come out from the Hell Fire and he will be placed in a river, the River of Life, and their bodies will grow. And when their bodies are completed, then permission will be granted for them to enter Paradise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 16 : Point 14</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And to have Eemaan in seeing Allaah on the Day of Resurrection. They will see Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, with the eyes of their heads. And He will bring them to account without any mediator </span></strong>[01]<strong><span style="color:#993300;"> or any interpreter.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F364407587&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-believers-will-see-their-lord-on-the-day-of-resurrection-openly-with-their-eyes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the tremendous and important matters of `<em>aqeedah</em> is: <span style="font-size:1rem;">Affirmation of the fact that the true believers will see their Lord on the Day of Resurrection openly with their eyes, just as they see the Moon on the night of the full Moon and just as they see the Sun clearly, not obscured by any clouds, as occurs in the authentic </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">ahaadith</em><span style="font-size:1rem;"> which are </span><strong style="font-size:1rem;"><em>mutawaatir</em> </strong><span style="font-size:1rem;">(reported by huge numbers of people at every level of transmission, so many that it is impossible to could have got together upon lie) affirming the believers seeing their Lord.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Imaam Ibnul-Qayyim brought in Haadiyul-Arwah (ilaa Bilaadil-Afraah) the hadeeth occurring about this. And he did so at great length, quoting their chains of narration; and they are <em>mutawaatir</em> (reported by huge numbers of people at every level of transmission) affirming that the believers will indeed see their Lord openly with their eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the people of misguidance from the deviant sects, such as the Mu`tazilah and those who took their position, they opposed this and they denied ar-ru&#8217;yah (the Seeing, that the believers will indeed see Allaah on the Day of Resurrection). And it is something mentioned in the Qur&#8217;aan. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">For those who did well in the world, will be al-husnaa</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (the finest reward of Paradise)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> and <em>ziyaadah</em> </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(an increase)</span> [02] (Soorah Yoonus (10), aayah 26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There occurs in Saheeh Muslim that the ziyaadah, the increase, is looking at the Face of Allaah the Perfect and Most High. [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They shall have whatever they (the believers in Paradise) wish therein and with Us there is something extra.</span></strong>(Soorah Qaaf (50), aayah 35)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em><strong>al-mazeed</strong></em>, that which is extra, is looking at the Face of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. And there occurs in Sooratul-Qiyaamah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Some faces on that day (Day of Resurrection) will be radiant, looking at their Lord</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Qiyamah(75), aayahs 22-23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Naadirah</em> with a <em>daad</em> from <em>an-nudrah</em>, radiance, which means that which is shining and beautiful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You will recognise upon their faces <em>nadrah</em> (the radiance) of bliss</strong></span> (Sooratul-Mutaffifeen (83), aayah 24)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8230;looking at their Lord</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With a <em>zaa</em>· (<em>naazirah</em>) meaning with their eyes. They will be looking at Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, feeling more joy at that than the joy which they experience on account of the bliss in Paradise. This occurs in the Honourable Qur&#8217;aan. In Sooratul-Mutaffifeen He said with regard to the disbelievers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">But no, on that Day, the disbelievers will be screened away and prevented from seeing their Lord</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Mutaffifeen (83), aayah 15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning screened and blocked from seeing Allaah. So if the disbelievers are blocked from seeing Allaah, then this is a proof that the believers will see their Lord the Mighty and Majestic. [04] And that is because the believers believed in Him in this world, yet they did not see Him. Rather they relied upon the evidences and therefore believed in Him. And they believed in His Messengers. So they believed in Him even though they did not see Him in this world. So therefore Allaah will honour them in Paradise that He will show Himself to them, so that they will see Him openly because they believed in Him in this world and did not see Him. But as for the disbelievers, because of the fact that they disbelieved in Him in this world, therefore Allaah will block them from seeing Him on the Day of Resurrection as a recompense (punishment) for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">as a fully appropriate recompense.</span> </strong>(Sooratun-Naba· (78), aayah 26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the false doubts which the Mu`tazilah rely upon, and those who held their saying, is that Allaah said to Moosaa: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">You shall not see Me.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And when Moosaa came to Our appointed place and His Lord spoke to Him, he </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Moosaa)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> said O My Lord show Yourself to Me, so that I may look upon You. So He </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Allaah the Most High) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">said You will not see Me. However look at the mountain. So if it remains settled in its place, then You will see Me</span> </strong>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), aayah 143)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said, “And this is a proof that Allaah cannot be seen.” We say: Yes this is with regard to this world, because the event occurred in this world. We agree that Allaah cannot be seen in this world. So Moosaa asked to see Him in this world, so Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, said: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">He said You will not see Me </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8211;</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> </span></strong>Meaning in this life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And an-nafee, negation, with <strong><em>Lan</em> </strong>(in Arabic it is negation of something that is occurring in the future) does not necessitate <em>ta&#8217;beed</em> (its being something forever). Rather it is a negation for a certain time. So (His saying) : <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He said You will not see Me &#8211; </strong></span>Meaning, ‘You will not see Me in this world.’ And there occurs in the Arabic language that negating something with <em>Lan</em> does not necessitate its being forever (a negation forever). And therefore Ibnu Maalik [05] said in al-Kaafiyatush-Shaafiyah in nahw (Arabic grammar):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Whoever holds the opinion that negating something with Lan means forever, Then reject his saying and support other than it.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning that <em>Lan</em> does not necessitate a negation that is forever. And the proof is also that Allaah said with regard to the Jews:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Then wish for death if you are truthful. But they will never wish for it</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayahs 94-95)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet it occurs that in the Hereafter they will indeed wish for death in order to be relieved from the torment. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They will call out ‘O Maalik! Let Your Lord put an end to us’</span></strong> (Sooratuz-Zukhruf (43), aayah 77)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they will request death. So this proves that <em>Lan</em> does not mean negation without end. This is what is necessitated by the Arabic language and it is what is necessitated by what is indicated in the Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They say also that what proves that Allaah cannot be seen is His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Sight cannot encompass Him (Allaah) but He encompasses Sight</span></strong> (Sooratul- An`aam (6), aayah 103)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We say to them: this does not contain a negation of Seeing (ru·yah), rather it only negates totally encompassing (idraak). He did not say, “Sight will not see Him.” He said, &#8220;it will not encompass Him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And denying <strong>encompassing</strong> is something different to denying <strong>seeing</strong>. So sight will see Him, however it will not encompass Him. So idraak means encompassing Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. So Even though they will see Him in Paradise, they will not fully encompass Him, He the Perfect and Most High. So what is negated here is encompassing him. [06] So they will see Him but they will not fully encompass Him. They will see Him as is proven by the evidences. And harmonizing the texts is what is obligatory. If there are differences between texts, then as far as it is possible to harmonize between them, this must be done. And this is clear; and all Praise is for Allaah. And the Speech of Allaah can never contradict itself. Rather some parts of it explain other parts. As for the person who takes one aayah and abandons a different ayaah, then this is from the people of deviation. He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So as for those people in whose hearts is deviation, then they follow that which is unclear, seeking discord and seeking to falsely interpret it</span> </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), aayah 7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So evidence is taken from the Qur&#8217;aan in totality.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">All of it is from our Lord</span> </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), aayah 7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as the <em>raasikhoon</em> (those firmly grounded in knowledge) say. So the Qur&#8217;aan, some parts of it explain the rest. And there can never be any contradiction in it because Allaah has negated from it any contradiction. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Will they not ponder/reflect upon the Qur&#8217;aan. If it had been from other than Allaah, they would certainly would have found in it many contradictions</span> </strong>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), aayah 82)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if you have a problem in understanding an aayah, then you look into the Qur&#8217;aan for that which will explain it. And if you do not find that, then you go to the Sunnah to find that which will explain it in the Sunnah. And if you do not find its explanation in the Sunnah, then you go to the sayings of the Companions, those who narrated from the Messenger sallAllaahu ` alayhi wa sallam, to find in their sayings that which will explain the aayah which you have a problem in understanding. The Qur&#8217;aan, and all Praise is for Allaah, is preserved in its wording and in its meaning. It neither opposes nor contradicts itself, rather contradictions only occur in the understandings of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise those false claimants to knowledge, those who did not truly study knowledge and did not take the principles of deriving evidence and of how to reach conclusions, they derive proof without understanding (fiqh). And they affirm things which no-one before them affirmed from the people of knowledge because of jahl, ignorance, and because of ta`aalum, pseudo-knowledge/false knowledge. So these are tremendous matters which require learning and require precision and require careful consideration and require verification, because the `aqeedah (creed and belief) is the foundation. And if there are deficiencies in it, this will be a deficiency in the foundation (of your religion). So in summary, this is the disagreement of the people with regard to seeing Allaah the Mighty and Majestic on the Day of Resurrection. So Allaah cannot be seen in this world. He will only be seen by the believers in the Hereafter. And He will be screened away from the disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And having Eemaan in ar-ru&#8217;yah (seeing Him) on the Day of Resurrection.”</strong> Why did he say on the Day of Resurrection? Because He, the Majestic and Most High, cannot be seen in this world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, <strong>“They will see Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, with the eyes of their heads.”</strong> He said with the eyes of their heads to negate ta&#8217;weel, false interpretation/ misinterpretation, of those who say the meaning of ‘they will see their Lord’ means: with their hearts, not with their sight.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And He will bring them to account without any mediator and without any interpreter.”</strong> Meaning, on the Day of Resurrection at the <em>hisaab</em>, Reckoning, the servant will be in private with his Lord. And Allaah will call him to account for his deeds in his language which the servant will understand. There will be no interpreter between him and Him. The interpreter is one who conveys the meaning from one language to another language, like the one who conveys the meaning from the English language to the Arabic language or vice versa because the languages are many.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> ‘without any screen’ in some editions</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Muhammad ibn Jareer At-Tabaree, the famous mufassir of the Qur&#8217;aan, explained this part of the aayah by saying, “For those from His creation who performed the worship of Allaah well in this world, such that they obeyed Him with regard to what He commanded them and forbade them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] Reported by Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 181) (in the Book of Eemaan) (Hadeeth of) Suhayb radiAllaahu `anh, from the Prophet sallAllaahu ` alayhi wa sallam that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“When the people of Paradise enter Paradise, Allaah, the Exalted and Most High, will say, ‘Do you wish for Me to give you any increase?’ So they will say, ‘Have You not made our faces white? Have You not entered us into Paradise and saved us from the Fire.’ He said: So then He will uncover the screen and they will not have been given anything which is more beloved to them than looking at their Lord the Mighty and Majestic. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">And then he recited this aayah:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">For those who did well in the world, there will be the best reward (of Paradise) and an increase (looking upon their Lord).</span></strong> (Soorah Yoonus (10), aayah 26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> As Imaam ash-Shaafi`ee also said, that this is mentioned as being a punishment for the disbelievers that they will blocked, not able to see their Lord. So therefore the believers who will not be punished, this is affirmation that they will indeed see their Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[06] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Some of the people of knowledge mention a point that a person for example from a distance may see the walls of a town, but not see what is beyond the walls, he may see the town but he doesn’t see what is beyond the town, what is inside the town and all the details, all around the town from every aspect. He does not encompass the town he can just see the town. So there is a clear difference between idraak, totally encompassing something, and between seeing it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">This article is comprised of a single ḥadīth that, when presented with the various wordings and additions, illustrate with clear descriptions the distinction between a believer and a disbeliever at the time of death. This ḥadīth, though recorded in earlier ḥadīth collections, was translated from “Aḥkām al-Janāiz wa Bidau’hā” (no. 105, pp. 198-202) by Muḥammad Nāṣir al-Dīn al-Albānī with the scholar’s accompanying notes included.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Explanation – Point [84] <span style="color:#003366;">(continued from Lesson 22)</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(In the previous lesson, we ended with the saying of <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Fawzaan: This is the intercession which is confirmed, with its conditions, and it is of different types.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From them are: some types which are specific for the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and there are some types which are shared between him and between other prophets, and angels and righteous people and the children who die before reaching puberty. All of these people will intercede with Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>As for the intercession which is specific for the Prophet </strong><strong><em><u>s</u></em></strong><strong><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em></strong>, then there are various types for this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: His intercession, <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>, interceding for the people of the <em>mawqif</em> (الموقف<em> – </em>the standing place) when the standing becomes very prolonged on the Day of Resurrection, and when the distress becomes severe and when the crowding together of the people is severe and the sun is drawn close to the people’s heads and tremendous distress comes about. Then the people in the gathering place will want someone to intercede for them for the Judgment to be carried out for them so that they can leave the stopping place and go either to Paradise or to the Fire. So they will go to Aadam <em>`alayhis-salaam</em> and he will excuse himself because of how dreadful and serious the standing will be. Then they will go to Noo<u>h</u> <em>`alayhis-salaam – </em>the first of the Messengers, and he will excuse himself. Then they will go to Moosaa – the one to whom Allaah spoke directly, and he will excuse himself. Then they will go to `Eesaa <em>`alayhis-salaam</em> and he will excuse himself also. Then they will go to Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and he will say, “I am the right one for that; I am the right one for that.” Then he (<em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) will go and fall down in prostration (<em>sajdah</em>) in front of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and he will praise Him and repeat words of praise upon Him and he will make supplication to Him until it is said to him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Raise your head and ask and you will be given it! And intercede and your intercession will be accepted.”[1]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He will be granted that he can intercede) after he makes <em>du`aa·</em> (supplication) and after he has sought permission; he will not just intercede straight away. Rather, he will make prostration (<em>sajdah</em>) and he will make <em>du`aa·</em> (supplication) and he will repeat words of praise upon Allaah, and he will seek to draw nearer to Him by means of His Names and His Attributes. Then, permission will be given to him for him to intercede; then he will intercede for judgment to be passed between the creation, and Allaah will accept his intercession. And Allaah the Perfect and Most High will come to pass judgment between His servants. He, the One free of all imperfections, said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">But no! When the earth is crushed to dust; and your Lord comes, and the angels – row upon row.</span></strong>  (Sooratul-Fajr (89), <em>aayaat </em>21-22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the One free of all imperfections, said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do they but await that their Lord comes, screened by clouds, and the angels, and the affair is ended.</span></strong>  (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>210)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is his, <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>, intercession regarding judgment being passed between the creation. And this is a tremendous station (which Allaah will give to him) and through it, will give honour and nobility to the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And this is <em>Al-Maqaam Al-Ma<u>h</u>mood</em> (المقام المحمود) – the Praiseworthy Station about which Allaah, the One free of all imperfections, said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And during the night get up and pray as something extra for you. Indeed Allaah will certainly raise you to a Praiseworthy Station.</span></strong>  (Sooratul-Israa· (17), <em>aayah </em>79)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because the first to the last of the people will praise him for it, and his, <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>, virtue will be made manifest in this tremendous station.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second intercession</strong> which is particular for the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam,</em> is his interceding for the people of Paradise to enter into Paradise.[2] So, the first one who will request that the gate of Paradise is opened will be Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, and he will be the first one who enters into it.[3] And the first nation who will enter it will be his nation <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third intercession</strong> which is particular to the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam,</em> is his interceding for the people of Paradise, that Allaah should raise their stations and levels. So, he will intercede for some people so that Allaah should raise their levels higher in Paradise; so Allaah will raise them higher through the intercession of the Prophet <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>.[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The fourth intercession: </strong>and it is shared (it’s something for the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>and for others besides him); it is the intercession with regard to the <em>Ahlil-Kabaa·ir</em> (أهل الكبائر – those guilty of major sins) from the believers, for those who deserved to enter into the Fire, (intercession) that they do not enter the Fire. And also with regard to those who have entered it, that they should be taken out of it. This is the place about which the sects disagree. So the <em>Jahmiyyah</em> and the <em><u>Kh</u></em><em>awaarij</em> and their like, they deny this and they say, “Whoever enters into the Fire will not come out from it.” Whereas the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah</em> (the people of the <em>Sunnah</em> and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>), they affirm it just as it occurs and they hold it as their creed and belief. And it is obligatory upon the Muslim that he holds this as his creed and belief and he has <em>eemaan</em> in it, and that he asks Allaah that He grants the right of intercession to His Prophet <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam </em>in this regard, since he is in need of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The fifth intercession:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is particular to the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, and it is his intercession with regard to his paternal uncle Aboo <u>T</u>aalib. Aboo <u>T</u>aalib died upon <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> and upon the religion of `Abdul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib who was a <em>mu<u>sh</u>rik</em> (a person of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>). And he said that he was upon the religion of `Abdul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib, and he died upon that; so he became of the people of the Hellfire who will remain in it forever. However, Allaah, the Mighty and the Majestic will grant His Messenger <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam </em>the right to intercede for Him (Allaah) to reduce the punishment for him so that he will be in a shallow part of the Fire, but even so, he (Aboo <u>T</u>aalib) will still think that there is no one who is suffering a worse torment that him, even though he is the person out of the people of the Fire who is suffering the lightest punishment.[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the intercession with regard to the people guilty of major sins is shared. So the angels will intercede, and the prophets will intercede and the beloved servants of Allaah (will intercede) and the righteous people will intercede,[6] and the children who died below the age of puberty will intercede for their parents.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [84][7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] <em><u>H</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree as <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> 3340, 4712, 7510 and by Muslim; it is from a longer <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] From Anas ibn Maalik <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh </em>that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“I am the first one who will intercede regarding Paradise.”</strong> Reported by Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s Side Point: In explanation of this <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>, A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>eebee said, “Meaning: I will intercede for the disobedient ones from my Ummah, for them to enter into Paradise. Or it is said: I am the first one who will intercede in Paradise with regard to raising the ranks of the people in it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] From Anas ibn Maalik <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh, </em>who said, “Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘I will come to the gate of Paradise on the Day of Resurrection and I will request that it be opened. So the gatekeeper will say, “Who are you?” So I will say, “Muhammad.” So he will say, “I have been commanded regarding you, that I should not open it for anyone before you.”’”</strong> Reported by Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Translator’s Side Point: Maybe there is a slight oversight in the text of the explanation here. <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Fawzaan <em>hafi<u>z</u>ahullaah,</em> says here that this intercession of the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, </em>for the people of Paradise who are in Paradise to have their ranks raised higher than what they deserve so that they are given higher places than what they deserve. Here, he says that this is specific to the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. However, as we had when the <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> <em>hafi<u>z</u>ahullaah </em>explained Al-`Aqeedah Al-Waasi<u>t</u>iyyah, he mentioned this type of intercession and he mentioned that it was not particular to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> – that it was for him and for others besides him as well from the Prophets, martyrs, righteous, and so on; they also have the right to this intercession. Likewise <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Ibn Baaz <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> in his explanation of Al-Wasai<u>t</u>iyyah, he mentioned the same point – that this type is not specific to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. Wallaahu a`lam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] From Al-Abbaas ibn `Abdul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu,</em> that he said to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, “Will you be able to suffice your uncle in anything since he used to look after you and become angry for you?” So, he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> replied,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“He will be in a shallow part of the Fire and if it were not for me, he would be in the lowest depth of the Fire.”</strong> Reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree as <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> 3883, and also by Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] So, from Aboo Sa`eed (Al-<u>Kh</u>udree) <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh,</em> from the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Allaah the Most High will say, ‘The angels have interceded and the Prophets have interceded and the believers have interceded and none remains except for the Most Merciful of those who show mercy. Then He will take a handful out of the Fire and will bring out a people who never did any good; they will become charcoal and He will cast them in a river at the mouth of Paradise called the River of Life, then they will sprout like the sprouting of seeds on the bank of a torrent, and then they will be entered into Paradise.’” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><u>H</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] Translator’s Side Point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) said in his small notes with regard to the intercession: “It is something <em>mutawaatir</em> (something supported by <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> which has many, many narrators at every level of narration) also. And Ibn Abee `Aa<u>s</u>im, in his book: As-Sunnah, he brings six chapters about it – from chapters 163 to168, with <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> numbers 784 to 832. And the explainer (Ibn Abil-`Izz), he mentions a number of them, <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, in his explanation, and they include the fact that his intercession, <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, is of eight (8) different types.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Translator’s Side Point:</strong> </span>Sometimes the people of knowledge abridge the types of intercession and sometimes they mention them in detail. When they mention them in detail they mention that they are eight (8) different types – the first three (3) of them being particular for the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam:</em></p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>The greater intercession – which is the intercession for the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>for the Judgment to be carried out when the people go to each of the Prophets and then they go to the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And as we have heard that occurs in the authentic <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em>, reported by Bu<u>kh</u>aaree and Muslim: that he will make <em>sajdah</em> beneath the Throne and make <em>du`aa·</em> to Allaah and praise Him and so on, and his intercession will be granted. This is the ‘greater intercession’ and the standing place there is the <em>Maqaam Al-Ma<u>h</u>mood</em> (the Praiseworthy Standing Place) which will be granted to no one except the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</li>
<li>The intercession for the people of Paradise to be able to enter into Paradise. <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-U<u>th</u>aymeen <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> mentions that after the people cross the bridge over the Hellfire, there will be an archway where they will be stopped and any remaining rancour or feeling in their hearts towards each other will be removed and after that is the gate of Paradise. It will not be opened until the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> intercedes for it to be opened. The evidence being the <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh,</em> reported by Muslim: “I am the first of those who will intercede with regard to Paradise.”</li>
<li>The intercession of the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> for his uncle Aboo <u>T</u>aalib – that his punishment in the Fire is reduced.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These three types are particular to the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. The next five are general – for the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and for other than him. The first and greater intercession is agreed upon by all the sects. It is agreed upon by the people of the Sunnah and the deviant sects as well (<em>Mu`tazilah</em>, <em><u>Kh</u></em><em>aawarij</em> etc.).</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;" start="4">
<li>The intercession for those people who deserve the Hellfire, from the people of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> who have committed major sins (the disobedient ones) – the intercession that they don’t have to enter the Fire. <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-U<u>th</u>aymeen <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> mentions as evidence for this: the supplication that is said in the funeral prayer for the deceased. This type of intercession is denied by the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> and the <em><u>Kh</u></em><em>aawarij</em>.</li>
<li>For those people of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> &#8211; the disobedient ones guilty of major sins who deserve entry into the Fire and who have entered into the Fire, intercession that they should be taken out from the Fire. <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-U<u>th</u>aymeen mentions that there are many <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> to support this. Amongst them is a <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> of Aboo Sa`eed al-<u>Kh</u>udree –one wording of which we heard – reported by Muslim and also in longer wording by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree as <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> Again, the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> and the <em><u>Kh</u></em><em>aawarij</em> deny this type.</li>
<li>For the ranks of the people of Paradise – that their ranks should be raised higher. The explainer of Al-Waasi<u>t</u>iyyah – Ibn Al Fayaa<u>d</u> mentions that there is agreement about this type as well. An evidence for it is the <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree as <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> 4323 – <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> of Aboo Moosaa <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh, </em>that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> made supplication for one of the Companions and said,</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“O Allaah! Forgive `Ubayd Aboo `Aamir.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“O Allaah! On the Day of Resurrection, make him above many of Your creation from the people.”</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;" start="7">
<li>The intercession with regard to believers whose good and bad deeds are equal &#8211; they are the people of ‘The Heights’ – <em>Al-A`raaf</em> (الأعراف) and are mentioned in the seventh <em>soorah</em>; the intercession that they should be allowed to enter into Paradise, and they will.</li>
<li>The intercession for some of the believers to enter into Paradise without there being any reckoning upon them. The evidence for that being the <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Ukkaa<u>sh</u>ah about the seventy thousand (70,000) people who would enter Paradise without reckoning. <em><u>H</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree, Muslim and others.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is an excellent book on this topic of <em>a<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>sh</u>afaa`ah</em> by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Muqbil <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>: <em>A<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>Sh</u>afaa`ah </em>(الشفاعة) where the <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> compiles all the different <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> about <em>a<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>sh</u>afaa`ah</em>. It is more than 300 pages long.</p>

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [83]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from that which the people of the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah hold as creed and belief, is what is mentioned in authentic reports from Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, from the affairs of the Resurrection and whatever will occur on the Day of Resurrection, from affairs. So, from that is: <em>Al-<u>H</u>aw<u>d</u></em> (الحوض<em> – </em>the great Lake or body of water), since the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> informed us that there will be for him a <em><u>H</u></em><em>aw<u>d</u></em> (Lake)[1] on the Day of Resurrection at the gathering place (<em>al-Ma<u>hsh</u>ar</em> – المحشر), to which his followers will come – those who had <em>eemaan</em> (truly believed) in him and who followed him. So, they will drink from it and when they have taken a single drink from it, they will never again become thirsty afterwards. And this is because the Day of Resurrection is a day which is severe and difficult and a day of severe heat; so it will result in severe thirst.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, Allaah has made this <em><u>H</u></em><em>aw<u>d</u></em> (great Lake) as a source of relief from thirst for the nation of Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>; and by it, He will bring relief from thirst for them. And as is known, the <em><u>gh</u></em><em>ay<u>th</u></em> (غيث –rainfall) which Allaah sends down from the skies, brings about life for the earth, and it brings about life for the souls. Then likewise, the <em><u>H</u></em><em>aw<u>d</u></em> (Lake) will be a <em><u>gh</u></em><em>iyaa<u>th</u></em> (source of relief from thirst) by which Allaah will relieve the thirst of the servants when they are in the direst need of water.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And ‘<em>A</em><em>l-<u>H</u>aw<u>d</u>’</em> is a place where water is gathered. And he <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam,</em> described it as being a tremendous lake; and that its length is the length of a month’s journey and its width is the width of a month’s journey; and that its drinking vessels would be as numerous as the stars in the sky; and that whoever drinks a single drink from it, then after that he will never ever become thirsty again; and that its water is whiter than milk and sweeter than honey.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he, <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam,</em> informed that some people would come to it, but then they will be pushed away and prevented from drinking from it. So the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> will say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O my Lord, my nation, my nation!”</strong> So then Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic will say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“You do not know what things they innovated after you.”</strong> So then he, `alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam, will say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Be away, far away, those who changed and altered!”</strong> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the people of innovations (<em>Ahlul-Bid`ah</em>) which take people astray will be prevented from coming to it to drink: those who are disobedient to Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, those who disbelieved and turned back upon their heels, those who abandoned the Sunnah, those who went off with their own desires and opinions taking deviated positions – they are the ones who will be prevented from the lake (<em><u>H</u></em><em>aw<u>d</u></em>) of the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>because they altered and changed away from the way of the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.</em> So no one will go to it to drink except one who was a follower of the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in his sayings and his actions and his creed and belief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And some of the people of knowledge, they hold that <em>Al-Kaw<u>th</u>ar</em> (الكوثر – the plentiful river) which is mentioned in His saying, He the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We have certainly granted you <em>Al-Kaw<u>th</u>ar</em> (abundant good and a great river)</strong></span><br />
(Sooratul-Kaw<u>th</u>ar (108), <em>aayah </em>1)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Some of the scholars hold that this <em>Kaw<u>th</u>ar</em> mentioned in this <em>aayah</em>) is the <em><u>H</u></em><em>aw<u>d</u></em>, whereas some of the people of knowledge, they hold that the meaning of the <em>Kaw<u>th</u>ar</em> is: abundant good. And there is no doubt that the <em><u>H</u></em><em>aw<u>d</u></em> (great Lake) enters within the ‘abundant good’ because this <em><u>H</u></em><em>aw<u>d</u></em> (Lake) is indeed something good for this nation.[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the <em><u>H</u>aw<u>d</u></em> (Lake) of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>; so it is obligatory to have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) in it and to hold it as creed and belief, and that the person adheres to the Sunnah so that he can go on drink from the <em><u>H</u>aw<u>d</u></em> (great Lake) and not be repelled from it on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> End of explanation of point [83][5]<sup>,[6]</sup></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] From Anas ibn Maalik <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu, </em>that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The width of my lake will be like the distance between Aylah and <u>S</u>an`aa· in Yemen and it will have as many drinking cups as the number of the stars in the sky.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree as <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> 6580, and by Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s Side Point: They mention that Aylah is a little town on the coast, at the top of the Red Sea – the lowest tip where Palestine is.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] From `Abdillaah ibn `Amr <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>, who said, “The Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘My lake is a wide as a month’s journey, its water is whiter than milk and its smell is better than musk, and its drinking vessels are like the stars in the sky; whoever drinks from it will never ever become thirsty.’”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree as <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> 6579, and by Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s Side Point:</strong> In [the explanation of] Al-`Aqeedah Al-Wasa<u>t</u>iyyah, we had the point that Shaykh Al-`U<u>th</u>aymeen <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> made about this <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>: there is another <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> where the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> mentioned that the drinking vessels around the <em><u>H</u>aw<u>d</u></em> (Lake), their number would be like the number of stars in the sky. As for this wording here, there is an addition: that the drinking vessels would be ‘like’ the stars in the sky. This shows an additional point &#8211; not only would they be as many as the stars in the sky, but also they will be brilliant like the stars in the sky.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree as <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> 6582, 6584 and 7051, and also reported by Muslim. It is from a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Anas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] From Sa`eed ibn Jubayr from Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>, that he said about the <em>Kaw<u>th</u>ar,</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“It is the great good which Allaah will give to him.” (The narrator) Aboo Bi<u>sh</u>r said, “So I said to Sa`eed ibn Jubayr: Then, there are some people who claim that it is a river in Paradise.” So Sa`eed said, “The river which is in Paradise is from the good which Allaah will give to him.” </em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><u>H</u>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree as <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> 4966 and 6578.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from Anas ibn Maalik <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu </em>who said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“Whilst Allaah’s Messenger <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam was amongst us one day he dozed off briefly, then he raised his head and he was smiling. So we said, ‘What has caused you to laugh, O Messenger of Allaah?’ So he said, ‘Just now a soorah has been sent down to me.’ and he recited sooratul-Kaw<u>th</u>ar.”</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narration in Muslim mentions that he said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Then he said, “Do you know what Al-Kaw<u>th</u>ar is?” So we said, “Allaah and His Messenger know best.” So he said, </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“Then it is a river which my Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, has promised me. Upon it there is abundant good and it is a Lake to which my Ummah will come to drink on the Day of Resurrection.”</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Muslim in the Book of the Prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Translator’s Side Point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) made a small point connected to this. He said, “And the <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> which mention the <em><u>H</u></em><em>aw<u>d</u></em> (Lake) are very many, so many that they reach the level of being <em>mutawaatir</em> as was clearly stated by a group of the scholars. These narrations are reported by thirty and odd Companions and Al-<u>H</u>aafi<u>z</u> Ibn Ka<u>th</u>eer he brings their chains of narration in detail in his book: Al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah, at the end of his history (at the end of the book – that which will occur on <em>Yawmul-Qiyaamah</em>). And also, Al-<u>H</u>aafi<u>z</u> Ibn Abee `Aa<u>s</u>im in his Kitaab As-Sunnah, he brings seven whole chapters (chapters 155-161) and <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> numbers: 697-776 (79 <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>) and at the end of them he mentions that they are <em>mutawaatir</em> (reported by a huge number of people at every stage of narration) and he said, ‘The narrations which we have mentioned about the <em><u>H</u>aw<u>d</u></em> (Lake) of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> necessitate certain knowledge.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] Translator’s Side Point: Ibn Abil-`Izz, mentions in his explanation about exactly where the <em><u>H</u></em><em>aw<u>d</u></em> would be. He makes it clear that it would be before crossing over the Bridge over Hellfire – the place where the people would be gathered (the <em>Ma<u>hsh</u>ar</em>); that is where the <em><u>H</u></em><em>aw<u>d</u></em> would be. The question may arise: How is that connected to the <em>Kaw<u>th</u>ar</em> (the river in Paradise)? He answers it, and likewise <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-`U<u>th</u>aymeen <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> answers the same point in the explanation of Al-Wasa<u>t</u>iyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-`U<u>th</u>aymeen <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, mentioned nine points that we need to know about the <em><u>H</u>aw<u>d</u></em>, the second of them was that he said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This <em><u>H</u>aw<u>d</u></em> (great Lake) will have water pouring into it through two channels which flow from <em>Al-Kaw<u>th</u>ar</em> (the river in Paradise). The <em>Kaw<u>th</u>ar</em> is the great, tremendous river which the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> will be granted in Paradise. So these two channels of water will flow down into the <em><u>H</u>aw<u>d</u></em> (Lake).</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The evidence for this is two <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Muslim; one from a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Aboo <u>Dh</u>arr and one from a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of <u>Th</u>awbaan  <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As part of a longer <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>, the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Aboo <u>Dh</u>arr <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh </em>contains the wording that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> mentioned about the <em><u>H</u>aw<u>d</u></em> (Lake) and he said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“Two channels of water will flow into it from Paradise.”</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of <u>Th</u>awbaan, it contains the wording:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“One of these channels will be of gold and the other one will be of silver.”</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Both reported by Muslim.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">[Point 117] <strong><span style="color:#008000;">  And the Throne (<em>Al-`Ar<u>sh</u></em>) and the Footstool (<em>Al-Kursee</em>) are true.</span></strong></p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F330334335&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe><br />
—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [117]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, created the heavens and He created the earth, and He created the Footstool (<em>Kursee</em>) and He created the <em>`Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne), all of these are things created by Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. The heavens are above the earth, and above the heavens is <em>al-ba<u>h</u>r</em> (البحر &#8211; the ocean) and above the ocean is the Footstool, and above the Footstool is the <em>`Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne). So that is the highest of all of the created things; and that is as occurs in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That the seven heavens compared to the Kursee (Footstool) are just like seven dirhams (small silver coins) thrown in a shield. [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: the seven heavens and their greatness, and whatever is within them, compared to the Kursee (Footstool) are just like seven dirhams (small silver coins) thrown in the like of a large circle of metal which the fighter uses as a shield. So what are seven dirhams compared to the large circular shield? In comparison, they are very little. In that regard, there is His saying, He the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">His (Allaah’s) <em>Kursee</em> (Footstool) extends over the heavens and the earth.</span><br />
</strong> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah 2</em>55)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne) is even greater than the <em>Kursee</em> (Footstool). So the <em>Kursee</em> (Footstool) compared to the <em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne) is just like a ring thrown in a desert, as occurs in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>. So if you were to throw a little ring into a broad, expansive piece of land, what would the size of the ring be compared to the size of that whole desert? Nothing!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These created things are tremendous and extremely vast, (so vast) as is known to none except Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the <em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne) is the highest of all the created things. And Allaah, the Perfect, is High and Exalted above His <em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne), above His creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, the <em>Kursee </em>(Footstool) is beneath the<em> `</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne). And there occurs in a narration that it (the <em>Kursee &#8211; </em>Footstool) is the place of the two Feet.[2] So, the <em>Kursee </em>(Footstool) is something created and it does not mean <em>al-`Ilm</em> (العلم &#8211; Knowledge) as has been attributed to Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>, that he said with regard to the saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>His <em>Kursee</em> extends over …</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That he (Ibn `Abbaas) said it means: “His Knowledge;”[3] meaning that His Knowledge extends over the heavens and the earth. This meaning is correct; however, that is not what is meant by the <em>aayah</em>. So, the <em>Kursee </em>(Footstool) is something created whereas <em>al-`Ilm</em> (Allaah’s Knowledge) is an Attribute from the Attributes of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic; it is not from that which He has created. So therefore, it is obligatory to have <em>eemaan </em>(truly believe) in the <em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne) and in the<em> Kursee </em>(Footstool); this being something true upon its true reality. And the <em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne) is not as the <em>A<u>sh</u>`arees</em> say, and whoever proceeds along their way, that the <em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne) means <em>Al-Mulk</em> (الملك &#8211; Kingship or Sovereignty). So they say, with regard to His saying, He the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Allaah) ascended over the Throne</span><br />
</strong> (Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They (the <em>A<u>sh</u>`arees</em>) say it means: “He gained control over Sovereignty or Kingship.” And this is misguidance. So the Throne (<em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em>) is something created.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And His Throne was above the water</span><br />
</strong> (Soorah-Hood (11), <em>aayah </em>7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, beneath the Throne (<em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em>) is the <em>Kursee </em>(Footstool), and beneath the <em>Kursee </em>(Footstool) is the heavens, and the earth is beneath the heavens. And there occurs in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> (the saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>),</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So if you ask Allaah for Paradise (Jannah), then ask Him for the highest Firdaws because it is the middle part of Paradise and the highest part of Paradise, and above it is the Throne (`Ar<u>sh</u>) of the Most Merciful.” [4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, <em>Al-Firdaws</em> is the highest of the Gardens of Paradise and above it is the Throne (<em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em>) of the Most Merciful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, His Throne (<em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em>) is something created and it has carriers/bearers (حملة – <em><u>h</u>amalah</em>) and they are groups from the Angels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And on that Day (the Day of Resurrection), eight carriers will carry the Throne of your Lord</span> </strong> (Sooratul-<u>H</u>aaqqah (69), <em>aayah </em>17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So before the Day of Resurrection, it will be carried by four (Angels) but when the Day of Resurrection comes they will be doubled and they will become eight. And each one of the Angels (who will carry the Throne) is such that his created form, his tremendous size and his strength cannot be imagined.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And could it be said: if someone says that the Throne means ‘Sovereignty’, could it be said that Sovereignty will be carried by the Angels?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [117][5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Footnotes:</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s Note: Reported as a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> by Ibn Jareer At-Tabaree in his Tafseer, and by others; and verifiers make it clear that its chain of narrations is weak – it is not authentic. Its chain of narrations contains a weak narrator called `Abdur-Ra<u>h</u>maan ibn Zayd ibn Aslam; and its chain of narration is also broken after that. This is pointed out by the verifiers of Kitaab At-Taw<u>h</u>eed such as <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Jaasim ad-Dawsaree in his book An-Nahaj As-Sadeed (النهج السديد) his checking of Kitaab At-Taw<u>h</u>eed. And this point is also made by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> in Silsilah Al-A<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u> A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah (سلسلة الأحاديث الصحيحة) no. 109. So this <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> with this wording is not authentic. An authentic wording will follow <em>in<u>sh</u>aa· Allaah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Translator’s Side Point: As for this narration, then it is declared <em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (Authentic) by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee and others as a saying of Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa </em>with an authentic chain of narration reported by Al-<u>H</u>aakim and Ibn Abee <u>Sh</u>aybah in his book and <u>S</u>ifatul-Jannah (صفة الجنة) that Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em> stated this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Translator’s Side Point: The verifiers, amongst them <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Muqbil <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, in his checking of Ibn Ka<u>th</u>eer, and other verifiers as well, they make clear that this report from Ibn `Abbaas is not authentic. The reason being, that the narrator from Ibn `Abbaas is quoted as being his student Sa`eed ibn Jubayr, and the narrator from Sa`eed ibn Jubayr is Ja`far ibn Abil-Mu<u>gh</u>eerah, and the verifiers such as Ibn Mandah, they mention this narrator (Ja`far ibn Abil-Mu<u>gh</u>eerah) is weak in his narrations from Sa`eed ibn Jubayr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] This <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> is reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree as <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> 2790 and 7423; and it is from a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Translator’s Side Point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, he said in his notes:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Know that the <em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne) is a very great creation as is proven in the <em>aayaat</em> of the Qur·aan and in the <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> of the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.</em> And this is why He, the Most High, attributed it to Himself in His saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah described Himself as being “<strong>the Possessor or the Owner of the Throne</strong>”, and you will find other <em>aayaat</em> (about the Throne) in the explanation (of Ibn Abil-`Izz).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the language, it (<em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em>) means: the throne (seat) of the king. And from its characteristics mentioned in the Qur·aan is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And eight (Angels) will bear the Throne of your Lord on the Day of Resurrection</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>aaqqah (69), <em>aayah </em>17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that it is upon the water. And in the <em>Sunnah</em> there is mentioned that from the Angels who bear the Throne, there is one Angel who, from his earlobe to his shoulder is a distance of seven hundred (700) years (he authenticates it in A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah (no. 151) – a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Aboo Daawood from Jaabir <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em>). And also that it (the <em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em>) has supports, and also that it is the ceiling of <em>Jannatul-Firdaws</em>. That occurs in authentic <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> which are mentioned in the explanation (of Ibn Abil-`Izz). And all of this nullifies the false interpretation that the <em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em> means <em>Al-Mulk</em> (Kingship) and extensive Sovereignty!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the <em>Kursee </em>(Footstool) then regarding that is His saying, He the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">His Footstool extends over the heavens and the earth</span><br />
</strong> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>255)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>Kursee </em>(Footstool) is in front of the Throne, and it is authentic from Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>, as his saying, that he said, “The <em>Kursee </em>(Footstool) is the place of the two Feet, and the Throne – no one knows its size except Allaah, the Most High.” (Reported by Al-<u>H</u>aakim and Ibn Abee <u>Sh</u>aybah in his book <u>S</u>ifatul-Jannah, and <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee said that it is authentic.)”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee then mentions that he has verified this narration in his book Mu<u>kh</u>ta<u>s</u>ar Al-`Uloo of A<u>dh</u>&#8211;<u>Dh</u>ahabee (مختصر العلو للذهبي), and he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There is nothing authentic from the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> as his saying, except for his saying <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>, (with regard to the <em>Kursee </em>(Footstool)),</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The seven heavens compared to the Footstool are just like a ring thrown into a desert, and the size of the `Ar<u>sh</u> compared to the Footstool is like the size of that desert compared to the size of that ring.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So that nullifies also, the misinterpretation of the Footstool to mean <em>al-`Ilm</em> (Knowledge) and this interpretation is not authentic from Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa, </em>as I have verified in my book A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah (no. 109).”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus whoever spends something today will benefit from it tomorrow and whoever does not spend will come to find nothing, and he will have a great loss in the house of dwelling (in the Hereafter).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the Salaf said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>O son of Adam, you will only live on the Day of Judgment in what you have built, and you will find on that day what possessions you have prepared in your life</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A women entered upon &#8216;A&#8217;ishah (radiy Allaahu anha), and her hand was paralysed. She said, “O mother of the Believers, I went to sleep yesterday and my hand was healthy, and I woke up and it was paralysed. ‘A’ishah said, “How is that?” She said, “I had wealthy parents, and my Father used to pay zakat, host guests, and give to beggars, and he did not see any good except that he would do it. As for my mother, she was stingy, and did nothing good with my Father’s wealth. Then my Father died, and my mother died only two months after him. So I saw my Father in a dream last night, and he was wearing two yellow garments and in front of him was a flowing river. I said, “Father, what is this?’ He said, “Whoever does good in this life will see it, this is what Allah has given me.” I said, “What has happened to my mother?” He asked, “Your Mother dies?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, “She has been turned away from me, so look for her on your left” So I turned to my left, and I saw my mother standing naked, covering her lower half with a rag and in her hand was a piece of fat. She was calling out, “My sadness, my thirst&#8217; When she became tired she would rub the fat with her hand and then lick it, while in front of her was a flowing river. I said, ‘O mother, why are you crying out of thirst, and there is a flowing river in front of you?’ She said, ‘I am not allowed to drink from it.’ I said, Can I give you some of the water?’ She said, ‘I wish you would do that.’ So I filled my hand with water and let her drink, and when she swallowed it I heard a voice on my right, ‘Whoever has given this woman water, may his hand be paralysed,’ and they repeated it twice. Then I awoke and my hand was paralysed, and I am not able to do anything with it. ‘A’ishah asked: ‘Did you recognise the rag she was wearing?’ I said, ‘Yes, O Mother of the Believers, it was exactly the same one I saw her wearing, for I had never seen my mother give anything as charity, except that one day my Father slaughtered a bull. So a beggar came to ask for some, so my mother gave him a bone that had some fat on it. And I saw one day that a beggar asked her for charity, so she gave him that exact rag.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A&#8217;ishah (radiy Allaahu anha) said, Allah is the Most Great! Allah has told the truth, and the Messenger has delivered the message.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ خَيْرًا يَرَهُ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ شَرًّا يَرَهُ</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;So whoever does an atom&#8217;s weight of good will see it,<br />
And whoever does an atom&#8217;s weight of evil will see it&#8221;</strong></span><br />
[al-Azalzalah (99): 7-8]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">* as-Saheehah (no.2926) of Shaikh al-Albaanee-rahimahullaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;From Jaabir ibn `Abdillaah who said: “Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&lt;&lt;Narrate from the Banoo Israa·eel. and there is no harm, because amazing things happened amongst them.&gt;&gt;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he began narrating, and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&lt;&lt; A group from the Banoo Israa.eel went out until they came to one of their grave- yards, and they said: &#8220;If only we were to pray two rak`ahs, and make supplication to Allaah- the Mighty and Majestic -that He should bring out for us a man from those who have died, so that we could ask him about death.&#8221; He said: So they did so. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So, whilst they were in that condition, a man put his head out from a grave from those graves. He was a brownish person, with the mark of prostration between his eyes. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said “O people what do you want with me? <span style="color:#993300;">I died a hundred years ago, and the heat of death has not subsided from me until just now</span>. So supplicate to Allaah- the Mighty and Majesticfor me so that He should return me to being just as I was”.&gt;&gt;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Reported by Ahmad in &#8220;az-Zuhd&#8221;(16-17), Ibn Abee Shaybah in &#8220;alMusannaf&#8221;(9/62)-without the story, and likewise by al-Bazzaar in his &#8220;Musnad&#8221;(1/108/192: &#8220;Kashful-Astaar&#8221;): from ar-Rabee` ibn Sa`d al-Ju`fee :he heard it from `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Saabit: from Jaabir ibn `Abdillaah who said: Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: &#8230;, and he mentioned it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: The narrators in this chain are reliable, however there is a disagreement about whether Ibn Saabit heard from Jaabir. So Ibn Ma`een was asked: &#8220;Did `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Saabit hear from Jaabir?&#8221; So he said: &#8220;No.&#8221; However Ibn Abee Haatim confirmed his having heard from him, so he said in &#8220;al-Jarh watTa`deel&#8221; (2/2/240): “He narrated from `Umar, but this is mursal; and from Jaabir, and it is connected.” And this is contrary to what he quoted in &#8220;alMaraaseel&#8221; (p.84), and this is more correct, because of what follows.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the hadeeth was reported by `Abd Ibn Humayd in &#8220;al-Muntakhab minalMusnad&#8221; (q.152/1), with its full wording, and likewise by Wakee` in &#8220;azZuhd&#8221;(1/280/56), and by Ibn Abee Daawood in &#8220;al-Ba`th&#8221;(30/5), and in it Ibn Saabit clearly states that he had it narrated to him directly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <strong>the hadeeth is &#8220;Saheeh&#8221;</strong>, and the chain is fully connected, and all praise is for Allaah&#8230;”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">(From &#8216;As-Saheehah&#8217; (no. 2604) of Shaikh al-Albaanee -rahimahullaah):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Khuraym ibn Faatik al-Asadee -radiyallaahu `anhu- that the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;The people are four, and the deeds are six.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the people are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[i] one granted plenty in this world and in the Hereafter, and</strong><br />
<strong> [ii] one granted plenty in this world, poor in the Hereafter and,</strong><br />
<strong> [iii] one poor in this world, granted plenty in the Hereafter and,</strong><br />
<strong> [iv] one wretched in this world and in the Hereafter;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and the deeds are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[i &amp; ii] The two which are binding, and</strong><br />
<strong> [iii &amp; iv] like for like, and</strong><br />
<strong> [v] ten times more, and</strong><br />
<strong> [vi] seven hundred times more:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[i &amp; ii] So the two which are binding are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever dies as a Muslim, a Believer, not associating anything with Allaah &#8211; then Paradise is binding for him; and whoever dies as a Disbeliever &#8211; then the Fire is binding for him; and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[iii &amp; iv] Whoever intends an evil deed but does not do it, and Allaah knows that his heart felt it and he desired it, then it is written as a good deed for him; and whoever intended an evil deed then it is not written against him; and whoever did it then it is written as one, and it is not multiplied for him, and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[v] whoever did a good deed &#8211; then ten times its like is written for him, and [vi] whoever spends something in Allaah&#8217;s cause, then it is multiplied for him seven hundred times over. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">Reported by Ahmad (4/345), Ibn Hibbaan (no.31), and Ibn Abee Shaybah in his &#8216;Musnad&#8217; (2/38/2).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaanee declared its chain of narration to be &#8216;Saheeh&#8217;.<br />

<p class="has-text-align-center"></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Certainly the most excellent favor and the most complete blessing for the people of paradise is seeing their Lord, The Most Greatest, The One Who Possesses, honor and beauty. This is the delight of their hearts and the comfort of their eyes, the greatest bliss and pleasure in the abode of delight.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">It was narrated by Muslim in his saheeh on the authority of Suhayb, that the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#008000;">When the people of paradise enter the paradise Allaah the Blessed and Most High will say: &#8220;Do you desire an increase in anything?&#8221; The people will say: &#8220;Have You not made our faces white? Have You not entered us into the paradise and saved us from the fire?!&#8221; He (the Prophet) said: ‘He (Allaah) will then remove the covering and they will not be given anything more beloved to them than looking at their Lord, the Mighty and Majestic.’ </span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">There is a connection between seeing Allaah and the prayer. Whoever is from the people who establish prayer, then he is much deserving of this favor. And the one who is neglectful (of the prayer) then he is worthy of being deprived (of this favor) and will be from the people of loss. Certainly, this connection is substantiated by the Book and the Sunnah. As for the Book, Allaah says:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#008000;">“Faces that Day will radiant (22) Looking towards their Lord, (23) And many faces, that day, will be gloomy, (24) Realizing that a back-breaking calamity is going to be afflicted on them. (25) Never, (you will never remain in this world forever!) When the soul (of a patient) reaches the clavicles, (26) And it is said, “Who is an enchanter (that can save him?)” (27) And he realizes that it is (the time of) departure (from the world,) (28) And one shank is intertwined with the other shank, (29) Then on that day, it is to your Lord that one has to be driven. (30) So (the denier of the Hereafter) neither believed, nor prayed, (31) But rejected the truth and turned away (from it)(32)”</span> (75:22-32)</p>



<p>So His statement:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Faces that day will be radiant&#8221;</strong> </span>(75:22)<br />Meaning; from the beauty, meaning a beautiful radiance; brightly pleased. And His statement:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Looking at their Lord&#8221;</strong> </span>(75:23)<br />Meaning: by seeing Him with their eyes, by their vision.</p>



<p>Hasan al-Basri said:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">&#8216;They have the right to be radiant while they are looking at the Creator. Then Exalted is He, mentioned another category (of people) the people whose faces will be contorted, completely gloomy. He mentioned from among their actions was abandonment of the prayer. This shows that the people of the first category are the people of radiance and are those who will see Allaah. These are from the people who establish the prayer.&#8217;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>As for (evidence from) the Sunnah</strong>, then in the two Saheeh&#8217;s, on the authority of Jareer ibn Abdillaah, who said:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">&#8220;We were sitting with the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) when he looked towards the moon on a full-moon night and said afterwards: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;Surely you will see your Lord just as you see this moon, you will not be obstructed in seeing Him. So if you are able to not be occupied and overcome by things which will distract you from the prayer before the sun rises and before it sets then do so!&#8217;</span> Meaning the Asr prayer and the Fajr. Then Jareer recited (the verse) <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And praise your Lord before the sun rise and before the sunset&#8221;</span> (20:130)</p>



<p>In this hadeeth is an indication to the connection between the prayer and seeing (Allaah).</p>



<p>Ibn Rajab (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">&#8220;It is said as it relates to the command with preserving these two prayers coming immediately after mention of the seeing (of Allaah) that the greatest (loftiest) thing in paradise is seeing Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and the most noble of actions in the life of this world are these two prayers. Therefore in guarding them it is hoped that the person will enter Paradise and will see Allaah there.&#8221;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And there is no doubt that the companions when they heard the statement of the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) : <span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;Surely you will see your Lord just as you see this moon, you will not be obstructed in seeing Him&#8217;</span>, a great yearning filled their souls and a wondering about the actions which will be the cause of obtaining this greatly sought pursuit. And from the excellence of the Prophet&#8217;s advice and completeness of his clarification, he answered it without being asked.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In this is an indication from him (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) that, seeing Allaah on the Day of Judgment will not be obtained by merely wishing. As Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;This is not a matter of your merely wishing or the wishing of the People of the Book&#8221;</span> (4:123) Rather it is a must to perform actions, be upright, strive hard and have full commitment to Allaah. For this reason the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) explained the means which will allow the servant to obtain seeing Allaah. Therefore he directed to two great prayers, namely Fajr and Asr. Many texts have been narrated in relation to the matter of these two (prayers) which point to their virtues. They are mentioned specifically for what is contained in them of great virtues and from the weightiness (of them) upon many people.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Therefore whoever elevates his concern and Allaah assists him and gives him success in preserving these two prayers then he must be much more preserving of the other prayers (as well) rather the Fajr prayer specifically, (as it ) is the commencement of the day. Whoever Allaah honors with getting up to perform this prayer and giving importance to it will be aided for the remaining prayers of that day. For how the servant acts in relation to the Fajr prayer applies (to his actions) for the rest of the day.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">As some of the Salaf would say: <strong>&#8220;Your day is like your camel; if you take hold of the beginning of it then the later part of it will follow you&#8221; </strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And the Prophet&#8217;s statement:<strong> &#8220;Do not become occupied…&#8221;</strong> Is an indication that in this life are many affairs that will distract and divert man from guarding these two prayers. And how much more are the things that divert in these days of ours! There are people whom drinking tea overcomes and diverts from these prayers which is the beauty of this worldly life. Some are distracted by petty conversation, immoral night chat, useless entertainment and evil viewings. And also from people are those whom sleep overcomes, and so on.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In this Hadeeth also is evidence that the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>correct sound belief</strong> </span>affects the actions of the slave and his ways. So the more his faith increases and his certainty strengthens, the more he increases in uprightness, diligence, (righteous) work, and observing the obedience of Allaah.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And because of this connection between the prayer and seeing Allaah our Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) used to supplicate at the end of his prayer before tasleem for this great delight and wealthy reward. Narrated by an-Nasai in his sunan on the authority of Ataa ibn as-Saaib from his father who said: &#8220;Ammaar bin Yaasir led us in prayer and he shorted it. So some of the people said to him:&#8217;you have made the prayer light or shorted it! He said: &#8216;As for that, I was supplicating with some supplications I heard from the Messenger of Allaah. So he when he stood a man from the people followed him, he was Ubay though he didn&#8217;t reveal his name and asked him about the supplication then the man came (back) and informed the people of it. (The supplication was)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O Allaah, by Your Knowledge of the unseen and by Your Power over the creation , let me live if You know that life is good for me , and let me die if You know that death is good for me . O Allaah , I ask You to grant me fear of You in private and in the open . I ask you for the word of truth in times of contentment and anger. I ask You for moderation in wealth and in poverty. I ask you for blessings never ceasing and the coolness of my eye (i.e. pleasure) that never ends. I ask You for pleasure after Your Judgment and I ask You for a life of coolness after death. I ask You for the delight of looking at Your Face and the earning of meeting You without any harmful distress and misleading trials befalling me. O Allah, dress us with the beauty of Faith, and make us guides who are upon (correct) guidance. </span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">May Allaah favor us all with guarding the prayer. We ask Allaah for the delight of looking at His Face and the yearning to meet Him without any harmful distress or misleading trial.</p>



<p>We ask Allaah to make this a benefit for us and for you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:center;" align="center"><span lang="EN-GB">Taken from </span>Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah of Shaykh Al-Albaani<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">From AbdulAziz bin al-Mukhtar bin Abdullaah ad-Danaaj who said he witnessed Abu Salmah bin AbdurRahman sitting in a <i>Masjid</i> at the time of Khalid bin Usayd; He said al-Hasan came and sat with him, and Abu Salmah narrated to us that Abu Hurairah narrated from theProphet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> who said:</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:center;" align="center"><span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA">&#8221; الشمس والقمر ثوران مكوران في النار يوم القيامة &#8220;.</span></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">‘The sun and the moon will both spin and erupt in the Hell-Fire on the Day of Judgement.’</span></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">So al-Hasan asked: ‘What was the sin of the sun and the moon?!’</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Abu Salmah said: ‘Rather what I do is narrate to you from theMessenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</i>.’</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">So al-Hasan remained silent.’</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Collected by Imam Tahawi in ‘Mushkill al-Athaar (1/66-67)</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Also collected by al-Bayhaqi in the book ‘al-Ba’ath wa Nashoor’, also by Bazaar, al-Isma’aili and al-Khattabi all by way of Yunus bin Muhammad that AbdulAziz bin al-Mukhtar narrated to us with this narration.</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">I (Albaani) say: This <i>Isnaad</i>  is <i>Saheeh</i>  upon the conditions of Bukhari, and he narrated it in his book ‘as-Saheeh’ in a summarized form, and he said: Mussadad narrated to us that he said AbdulAziz bin al-Mukhtar narrated to us with the wording:</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">‘The sun and the moon will both spin in the Hell-Fire on the Day of Judgement.’</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"><b>The Meaning of the Hadeeth</b></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">The intent of the Hadeeth is not what al-Hasan al-Basri presumed, that the sun and the moon will be in the Hell-Fire punished as a punishment for them, never, indeed Allaah –Azza wa Jal – does not punish he who obeys him from His creation, and from that creation is the Sun and the moon, as to what Allaah&#8217;s -Tabarak wa Ta’ala- saying indicates to:</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:center;" align="center"><span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA">أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ اللَّهَ يَسْجُدُ لَهُ مَنْ فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَنْ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَالشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ وَالنُّجُومُ وَالْجِبَالُ وَالشَّجَرُ وَالدَّوَابُّ وَكَثِيرٌ مِنَ النَّاسِ وَكَثِيرٌ حَقَّ عَلَيْهِ الْعَذَابُ</span></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:center;" align="center">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"> See you not that to Allaah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the mountains, and the trees, and <i>Ad-Dawaab</i> (moving living creatures, beasts, etc.), and many of mankind? But there are many (men) on whom the punishment is justified.</span> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- mentions that His punishment is deserving for those who prostrate for other than Allaah -Ta’ala- in this <i>Dunyaa</i>. Like Tahawi mentions, therefore, when Allaah throws them into the Hell-Fire, then this can have two meanings:</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"><i>The First:</i> that they are the fuel for the Fire.</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Al-Isma’aili said:</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">‘It does not necessitate that being placed in the Hell-Fire that they will be punished, since indeed Allaah has Angels and stones and other things in the Hell-Fire, so that they will be a punishment for the people of the Hell-Fire and a tool from the tools of punishment, and Allaah does what He wills of that punishment, but the Angels and stones will not be punished.’</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"><i>The second is:</i></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">They will both be thrown into the Hell-Fire as remorse for those who worshipped them.</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">al-Khattabi said:</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">‘The intent of them being in the Hell-Fire is not that they will be punished there, but they will be a remorse for those who worshipped them in the <i>Dunyaa</i>, so that those people know that their worship of them was false.’</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">I say: this is the closest to the wording of the hadeeth and what supports this is that in the hadeeth of Anas collected by Abu Ya’ala as is mentioned in ‘al-Fath’ (6/214) it says:</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"> ‘so that those who used to worship them could see them.’</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">But I did not see it in his ‘Musnad’ and Allaah Ta’ala knows best.</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">[Taken from &#8216;Silsilah Ahadeeth as-Saheehah&#8217; vol. 1 No. 124]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam <strong>Ibnul-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah</strong> (d.751H)<br />
Source : Kitaabur-Rooh<em> (p. 44)</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The soul (<i>ar-rooh</i>) is connected to the body in five different ways, to which different rules apply.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Its connection to the body as a fetus in his mother’s womb.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Its connection to the body after a person is born.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Its connection to the body when a person is asleep, when the soul is connected in one way and separated from it in another way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Its connection to the body in <i>al-Barzakh</i> (the period between a person’s death and the Day of Resurrection), when it has departed from the body and separated from it, but is not separated completely in such a way that there is no connection at all. We have mentioned at the beginning of this reply that there are <i>ahaadeeth </i>and reports which indicate that the soul is returned to the body when somebody sends the greeting of salaam to a deceased person. This returning is of a special nature which does not mean that the life is restored to the body before the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Its connection to the body on the Day when bodies will be resurrected. This is the most perfect type of connection to the body, and has no comparison to the previous types, because after that the body will never die, sleep or have anything wrong with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a person is asleep, his soul is in his body and he is alive, although his being alive is not the same as that of a person who is awake, for sleep is comparable to death. Similarly, when a dead person’s soul is returned to his body (when the greeting is sent upon him), he is in a state between one who is alive and one who is dead, whose soul is not restored to his body. This is like the case of a sleeping person who is in a state between life and death. We hope that this will dispel a lot of your confusion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Extracted with slight modifications from &#8220;Mysteries of the Soul Expounded&#8221; ©1994 Abul-Qasim Publishing House</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Scholars of various schools of thought [1] differ greatly regarding the nature and essence of the soul (nafs). Is it a part of the physical body or a non-essential characteristic [2] of it? Is it an entity consigned to dwell within the physical body?, or is it an independent essence in itself? Is the nafs the same as the rûh (spirit)? Finally, what happens to the soul upon death? Is it confined to its body and its grave? If not, is it free to move about in the unseen spiritual world and on the earth? [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding this subject, leading theologians of various sects have put forward a host of conflicting opinions. It would be beyond the scope of the present work to examine each and every view put forward by the various scholars; however, a brief mention of some of their opinions regarding this issue is necessary. The correct view [4] is given, supported by sound reason and statements from the Qur&#8217;ân and the authentic sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Various Incorrect Theories</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to the theologian, Abul-Hasan al-Ash&#8217;arî scholars differed regarding the rûh (spirit), nafs (soul) and hayâh (life force). An-Nadhdhâm, one of the leaders of the Mu&#8217;tazilah, [5] is attributed with having said that the nafs is the form of the rûh. He further claimed that the rûh is alive (i.e. animate) and e ists independently. In contrast to his view, other scholars alleged that the rûh is a non-essential characteristic of the human being, unable to exist independently of itself. Still others opposed both of these views and claimed that it is not known what rûh is &#8211; an essential characteristic or a non-essential characteristic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proponents of another theory claimed that man consists of a particular form contained within a physical body, however, they differed as to precisely what this form is. One group maintained that the form consists of four ingredients [6] from which the physical body originates and further develops. A second opinion was that it represents pure blood, free of impurities and contamination. Another view claimed that this form is the animate life in man, the sensual heat which pervades the body. And a fourth group proposed that the form is an essential element which causes all animate, living beings to function in a particular manner [7] yet is not separated from such beings and does not have a different structure. Although there are other opinions[8] defining this form within the physical body, the four previously mentioned views are a sufficient sample.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Correct View</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is considered as the most accurate view regarding the nafs and the rûh is that of Ibn al-Qayyim [9] which is affirmed by Ibn Abul-&#8216;Izz al-Hanafî in his commentary on al-&#8216;Aqeedat at-Tahâwiyyah. [10] They base their position on various verses of the Qur&#8217;ân and the traditions of the Prophet (S) as well as on sound logic and rational thought. According to them, man consists of a spirit and a body together. The spirit is an entity which differs from the physical, tangible body. It is a higher type of luminous (or light-like) being, alive and moving, and it penetrates the limbs, circulating through them as water circulates throughout the petals of a rose, as oil circulates throughout the olive and as fire circulates throughout the burning embers of coal. One may reasonably perceive the soul filling and occupying the body; its form, though non-physical, is molded into the body&#8217;s shape. [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The soul will maintain its penetration of the limbs of the physical body and continue to affect their sense, movement and will as long as these limbs remain sound. However, if they are overcome [12] and no longer accept the forces enacted upon them by the soul, the soul leaves the body and enters the spiritual world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Qur&#8217;ânic Evidence</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Certain circumstances of the human soul are mentioned in various places of the Qur&#8217;ân.[13] Two such examples follow:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allâh takes soul at the time of their death and [the souls] of those that do not die during their sleep. He retains those souls for which He has ordained death, whereas He releases the rest for an appointed term.&#8221; </b> [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this verse it is stated that there are only two points in time at which Allâh takes souls: at death and during sleep. [15] When one sleeps, Allâh separates the soul from the body. If He has decreed death for a person at this point, the separation becomes permanent and the body no longer functions. In the case of one for whom death has not been decreed at that time, the soul taken during sleep is returned to its respective body upon awakening. However, the soul for which Allâh has decreed death need not necessarily be taken during sleep but may be taken at a time other than sleep.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;If you could see when the wrongdoers taste the pangs of death and the angels stretch their hands out, [saying], &#8216;Deliver up your souls. This day you will be awarded a degrading punishment.&#8217; &#8221; </b> [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here it is stated that death is painful for the disbelievers. Although they are ordered to surrender their souls to the angels, they are unwilling; therefore, the soul must be forced out as it does not wish to meet its punishment. [17] The terms &#8220;akhrijû anfusakum&#8221; used in this Qur&#8217;ânic verse literally means &#8220;expel or push out your souls,&#8221; indicating that the soul becomes a separate entity from the physical body.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Evidence from the Sunnah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sunnah is replete with descriptions of the state and nature of the human soul. These hadîths substantiate the view held by the dependable scholars of ahl as-sunnah. An example of the physical and psychological punishment awaiting the disbelievers occurs in the following portion of a long, authentically related hadîth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;The Angel of Death.[says], &#8216;O you foul soul, come out to the anger and wrath of your Lord.&#8217; The soul inside the disbeliever&#8217;s body is overcome by terrible fear [and does not want to deliver itself up], whereupon the Angel of Death violently pulls it out like multi-pronged skewers being yanked out of wet wool &#8211; tearing with them the arteries and nerves.&#8221; </i> [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also narrated in an authentic tradition:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umm Salamah reported: <i>&#8220;Allâh&#8217;s Messenger (S) entered upon Abû Salamah [i.e. his corpse], whose eyes were wide open. The Prophet (S) closed the lids and then said, &#8216;When the rûh [spirit] is taken out, the eyesight follows it [i.e., watches it ascend].&#8217; &#8220;</i> [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These hadîths indicate in two ways that the soul is indeed a form. First of all, something must have a form in order to be grasped and extracted. And second of all, eyes can only visualize something that has a form. [20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration the Prophet (S) described how the believer&#8217;s soul comes out of the body:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;The Angel of Death comes to the [dying] believer, sits at his head and says, &#8216;O you good soul, come out and receive your Lord&#8217;s forgiveness and pleasure.&#8217; Then the soul flows out effortlessly just as water flows from the mouth of a waterskin.&#8221; </i> [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is related in the same hadîth that as the soul is being carried up through the skies, the angels ask, &#8220;Who is this?&#8221; This question reaffirms the soul&#8217;s separate existence from the body. The angels would not pose such a question unless they had seen a distinct form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the following hadîth also affirms that the soul separates from the body:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abû Hurayrah narrated that Allâh&#8217;s Messenger (S) said: <i>&#8220;When the soul of the believer comes out [of its body], two angels receive it and rise with it towards the heavens, whereupon the inhabitants of the heavens say, &#8216;A good soul has come from the earth. Allâh has blessed you and the body which you used to occupy.&#8217; &#8220;</i> [22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabic expression &#8220;kunti ta&#8217;mureenah&#8221; (&#8220;you used to occupy&#8221;) suggests that the soul inhabited the body, filling and possessing the whole of it. The soul&#8217;s dwelling within the body and departure from it clearly confirms the soul&#8217;s own entity.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>FOOTNOTES</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Not the four famous schools of fiqh (jurisprudence) but rather leading scholars and thinkers who represent various unorthodox sects, such as the Mu&#8217;tazilites, Rafidhites and philosophers. They have expressed various incorrect views and opinions on this and other subjects of &#8216;aqeedah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] In Arabic, &#8216;aradh. According to the terminology of the philosophers, it refers to things which cannot exist independently, like color, smell, length, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] See Kitâb ar-Rûh, p. 272.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] It is &#8220;correct&#8221; in the sense that it is not contrary to the beliefs of ahl as-sunnah, literally, &#8220;the people of the established way or path&#8221; (those who sincerely and firmly adhere to the Qur&#8217;ân and the authentic sunnah as their complete way of life). Indeed, there is little authentic information about the rûh. Referring to the rûh Allâh says in the Qur&#8217;ân: <b>&#8220;And you have not been given knowledge except for a little.&#8221;</b> Sûrah al-Isrâ&#8217;, 17:85. (ed.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] A misguided sect which introduced speculative dogmatics into Islâm. The school of thought is characterized by a slanted, so-called &#8220;rationalistic&#8221; approach to matters of faith. They interpret clear texts of the sharî&#8217;ah &#8211; those from the Qur&#8217;ân and the sunnah &#8211; in such a manner as to coincide with their preconceived notions based on what they termed &#8220;sense.&#8221; Ibn al-Qayyim has aptly refuted their views and those of other who have been influenced by philosophical thought foreign to Islâm. Whoever wishes to delve deeply into this aspect is referred to his celebrated treatise, Kitâb ar-Rûh, pp. 266-293, where he meticulously details his refutation with logic and reasoning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] There is a philosophical view which claims that the human body originates from earth, air, fire and water. However, as mentioned in the Qur&#8217;ân and authentic sunnah, man originates from clay (i.e., earth).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] See al-Ghazâlî&#8217;s treatise on the soul, Ma&#8217;ârij al-Qudsfee Madârij Ma&#8217;ârifat an-Nafs, pp. 27-35.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] See pp. 443-444.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] Descriptions of the spirit as &#8220;light,&#8221; its mode of penetration of the body, as well as its shape cannot be proven by the Qur&#8217;ân or the sunnah. As such, these descriptions can only be considered conclusions based upon their own understanding of the &#8220;proofs.&#8221; (ed.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12] Physical accidents, diseases or disorders may destroy the sound, physical harmony and delicate balance of the body&#8217;s functions, causing a person to die (the point at which the soul leaves the body). In any case, there need not always be a physical dysfunction for divine forces to cause death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] Ibn al-Qayyim identifies over ninety supporting statements from the Qur&#8217;ân, the sunnah and sayings of the companions, which altogether give a complete picture of the nature of the human soul and the conditions which surround it. See Kitâb ar-Rûh, pp. 249-261 for details.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: <strong>Al-Ibaanah Magazine</strong>, Issue No.2 &#8211; Rabi ul-Awwal 1416H / August 1995</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>PAST HISTORY:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From those early sects which denied <i>eemaan</i> (firm faith) in the Punishment of the Grave were the <i>Khawaarij</i> and a group from the <i>Mu’tazilah</i>. [1] The <i>Mu’tazilah</i> said, “Our scholars deny the Punishment of the Grave and its rewards.” [2] This is because they innovated a rule that only <i>mutawaatir</i> [3] <i>ahaadeeth</i> amount to knowledge, whereas the authentic <i>aahaad</i> [4] <i>ahaadeeth</i> do not.  And this statement of theirs, that the <i>aahaad ahaadeeth</i> do not amount to knowledge means that such <i>ahaadeeth</i> – in their false opinion – are not free from the possibility of falsehood, nor error.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this innovated principle, they denied those <i>ahaadeeth</i> affirming that the Punishment of the Grave in indeed a true fact, and that it will definitely occur for the disbelievers and some of the sinful ones from this <i>Ummah</i> – may Allaah protect us from it – since these <i>ahaadeeth</i> were to them of the <i>aahaad</i> category.  So this false principle caused them to deny <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave – not holding it as part of the <i>’aqeedah</i> (belief) which is in total opposition to that of the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> (Righteous Predecessors) and the <i>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah</i> who followed them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>PRESENT-DAY TRAGEDY:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the last few years, some of the innocent <i>du’aat</i> (callers to Islaam) have stumbled across the same innovated principle – that the authentic <i>aahaad hadeeth</i> does not amount to knowledge, and therefore cannot be taken as proof for matters of <i>’aqeedah</i> – causing a great number of them to doubt and to reject that the Punishment of the Grave is indeed a true fact; and that it was part of the <i>’aqeedah</i> held fast to by our <i>Salaf</i>.  The result is that discord – and it’s vile fruit – has raised it’s head again amongst some of the precious youth of this <i>Ummah</i>, encircling them just as a ring encircles the finger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Abul-Madhaffar as-Sam’aanee [5] – <i>rahimahullaah</i> – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“If a narration is authentically reported from the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) – and related by reliable narrators and scholars – and they report it in connected form – their latter people from their predecessors – back to the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>), and it is accepted by the scholars, then it necessitates knowledge, where it leads to knowledge.  This is the statement of the great majority of the People of <i>Hadeeth</i>, and those who are precise, and those who work to preserve the <i>Sunnah</i>.  But this saying of theirs, that the <i>aahaad</i> narration does not amount to knowledge, and that it must be narrated in <i>mutawaatir</i> form in order to result in knowledge, then this is something innovated by the <i>Qadariyyah</i> and the <i>Mu’tazilah</i>.  Their intention behind it was to reject the narrations.  It (the principle) was seized from them, without understanding, by some scholars of <i>Fiqh</i>, those who did not have a firm footing in knowledge, nor realize what the intent of this saying was.”[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE DESIRED HOPE:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this article will attempt to clarify – by the permission of Allaah – that having <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave is an obligation upon all Muslims, and that it was indeed part of the <i>’aqeedah</i> of our <i>Salafus-Saalih</i>, previously being denied only by a group of innovators.  It is hoped that those who have erred from the way of the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> – the way of <i>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah</i> – would re-assess their stance in light of the evidences presented, hoping that they will return to the truth.  “For indeed the truth is cherished by the Believer, and in returning to it is nobility.  Whereas remaining upon falsehood and defect is despicable.” [7]  Remembering that, “the select and correct way is that which the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> were upon – that being the truth.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>EVIDENCES FROM THE PURE SUNNAH:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We shall – for the sake of brevity – consider the evidences from the pure <i>Sunnah</i>, and then look at the sayings of our <i>Salafus-Saalih</i>, and the scholars of <i>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah </i>who followed them – omitting the evidences from the <i>Qur‘aan</i> and it’s explanation from the Companions and the <i>Taabi’een</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[i] From ’Aa‘ishah (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhaa</i>) who said that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Jewess came to her and mentioned the Punishment of the Grave, saying to her: May Allaah protect you from the Punishment of the Grave.  So she asked the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) about it and he said, “Yes, there is Punishment in the Grave!”  ’Aa‘ishah (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhaa</i>) said: After that, I never saw the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>), except that he sought refuge from the Punishment of the Grave in every Prayer that he prayed. [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ii] From Ibn ’Abbaas (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhumaa</i>) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) once passed by two graves and said, “They are being punished, not for something great.”  Then he said, “Rather one of them used to spread gossip and carry tales, whilst the other never protected himself from being soiled by his own urine.”  Ibn ’Abbaas said: He then took a green leaf and spread it into two pieces and places each piece upon each grave, and then he said, “May their punishment become lightened until these two pieces dry.” [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[iii] From Ibn Mas’ood (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhu</i>) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, “Indeed the dead are punished in their graves, and the animals hear them.” [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[iv] Haanee, the freed slave of ’Uthmaan, related:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever ’Uthmaan (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhu</i>) stood at a grave he would weep until his beard became soaked in tears.  It was said to him: Paradise and Hell are mentioned to you, and you do not weep, but you weep over this.  So he said: Indeed the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, “Indeed the grave is the first stopping place for the Hereafter.  So if he is saved therein, then what comes after that is easier than that.  If he is not saved therefrom, then that which comes after is harder.” [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[v] From Aboo Hurayrah (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhu</i>) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, “When one of you finishes the last <i>tashahhud</i> (testimony of faith), he should seek refuge in Allaah from four things: From the Punishment of Hell, from the Punishment of the Grave, from the trials of life and death, and from the evil trials of the <i>Maseehud-Dajjaal</i> (Anti-Christ).” [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[vi] From Umm Khaalid Bint Khaalid (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhaa</i>) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, “Seek the Refuge of Allaah from the Punishment of the Grave, since the Punishment of the Grave is <i>haqq</i> (a true fact).” [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE STATEMENTS OF THE SALAF OF THIS UMMAH:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now consider – O honourable reader – the statements of the <i>Salaf</i> of this <i>Ummah</i> with respect to having <i>’aqeedah </i>(firm belief) in the Punishment of the Grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<b>1</b>] Sufyaan Ibn ’Uyaynah (d.197H) – <i>rahimahullaah</i> – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The <i>Sunnah</i> is ten.  Whosoever accepts them has completed the <i>Sunnah</i>, and whosoever abandons anything from them has abandoned the <i>Sunnah</i>: Affirming <i>al-Qadar</i> (pre-destination), giving precedence to Aboo Bakr and ’Umar, the Pond in Paradise, <i>Shafaa’ah</i> (Intercession), the Scales, the Bridge over Hellfire, <i>eemaan</i> is statement and action, the <i>Qur‘aan</i> is the speech of Allaah, Punishment in the Grave, being raised-up on the Day of Judgement and not testifying that any Muslim will definitely be in Paradise or Hell.” [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<b>2</b>] Imaam ash-Shaafi’ee (d.204H) – <i>rahimahullaah</i> – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Indeed <i>al-Qadar</i> (pre-destination); both good and evil consequences are from Allaah – the Mighty and Majestic.  Indeed the Punishment of the Grave is a true fact, the Resurrection is a true fact, the Accountability is a true fact, Paradise and Hellfire are true facts.  Whatever else is related in the <i>Sunnah</i> and so mentioned by the scholars, and their followers throughout the lands of the Muslims is also true.” [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<b>3</b>] Imaam Ahmad (d.241H) – <i>rahimahullaah – </i>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“From the essential <i>Sunnah</i>, which if a person leaves any one of its points – not accepting it and not having <i>eemaan</i> in it – then he will not be from amongst its people are: (he then mentions) <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave.” [17] He also said, “Punishment in the Grave is a true fact.  The servant will be questioned about his Religion and his Lord.  Munkar and Nakeer and Paradise and Hellfire are also true facts.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<b>4</b>] Aboo Daawood (d.275H) – <i>rahimahullaah</i> – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Chapter: Questioning in the Grave and the Punishment of the Grave.’’ [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<b>5</b>] Ibn Qutaybah (d.278H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘The People of <i>Hadeeth</i> are united upon the fact that whatever Allaah wills, happens, and whatever He does not will, does not happen; that He is the Creator of good and evil; and that the <i>Qur‘aan</i> is the Speech of Allaah, uncreated; that Allaah will be seen on the Day of Judgement, giving precedence to Aboo Bakr and ’Umar, upon <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave.  They do not differ in need of these fundamentals.  Whosoever opposes them in any of these matters, then they reject, hate, and declare such a one an innovator, and cut themselves off from him.’’ [20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<b>6</b>] Imaam at-Tahaawee (d.321H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘This is an explanation of the <i>’aqeedah</i> of <i>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah</i> upon the way of the scholars of this Religion; Aboo Haneefah an-Nu’maan Ibn Thaabit al-Koofee, Aboo Yoosuf Ya’qoob Ibn Ibraaheem al-Ansaaree, and Aboo ’Abdullaah Muhammad Ibnul-Hasan ash-Shaybaanee &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with them all &#8211; and the beliefs they held concerning the fundamentals of the Religion, and their <i>’aqeedah</i> concerning the Lord of the Worlds.’’  Up until he said, ‘‘We have <i>eemaan</i> in the Angel of Death who is charged with taking the souls of all the worlds; and in the Punishment of the Grave for those who deserve it.’’ [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<b>7</b>] Abul-Hasan al-Ash’aree (d.324H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘The <i>Mu’tazilah</i> denied the Punishment of the Grave.  It has been related by the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) through many paths, and by his Companions (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhum</i>).  Nothing has been related from a single one of them denying or negating this, to the point where there is <i>ijmaa’</i> (consensus) from the Companions of the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>).’’ [22] He also said, ‘‘There is consensus that the Punishment of the Grave is a true fact, and that the people will be tested and questioned in their graves.  So may Allaah establish us upon that which He loves.’’ [23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<b>8</b>] Imaam al-Aajurree (d.360H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘Chapter: <i>Tasdeeq</i> (affirmation) and <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave.’’ Here he brings many of the <i>ahaadeeth</i> related by al-Bukhaaree and Muslims and ends the chapter by saying, ‘‘So what is the condition of those who deny these <i>ahaadeeth</i>, except that they have deviated very far and are in a huge loss.’’ [24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<b>9</b>] Ibn Abee Haatim (d.327H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘Our chosen way is to follow the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>), the Companions, the <i>taabi’een</i>, and all those who followed them in goodness; along with the abandonment of looking into the innovated matters, to hold fast to the way of <i>Ahlul-Athar</i> (People of Narrations), such as Aboo ’Abdullaah Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, Ishaaq Ibn Ibraaheem, Aboo ’Ubayd al-Qaasim Ibn Sallaam and ash-Shaafi’ee; to hold fast to the Book and the <i>Sunnah</i> upon the way of the <i>Imaams</i> who follow the narrations of the <i>Salaf</i>; adopting what was adopted by the <i>Ahlus-Sunnah</i> from the various cities.’’ Up until his statement, ‘‘Faith increases and decreases, and we have <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave.’’ [25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<b>10</b>] Imaam al-Barbahaaree (d.329H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘<i>Eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave, and Munkar and Nakeer.’’ [26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<b>11</b>] Al-Ismaa’eelee (d.371H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘Know &#8211; may Allaah have mercy upon us and you &#8211; that the way of the <i>Ahlul-Hadeeth</i>, <i>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah</i> is to affirm belief in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, and to accept whatever is recorded in the Book of Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; and whatever is authentically reported from the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>),’’ up until he said, ‘‘Punishment in the Grave is a true fact.’’ [27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<b>12</b>] Al-Qayrawaanee (d.386H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Under the chapter, ‘‘What is related in the <i>Sunnah</i> about the <i>’aqeedah</i> of the heart from the obligatory matters of the Religion.  From this is <i>eemaan</i> in the heart, and pronouncing with the heart that Allaah is the only deity worthy of worship, none has the right to be worshipped except Him.’’  Up until he statement, ‘‘And the Punishment in the Grave is a true fact, and the Believers will be tested in their graves.’’ [28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<b>13</b>] Ibn Abee Zamneen (d.399H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘<i>Ahlus-Sunnah</i> have <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave, may Allaah protect us and you from this.’’ [29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<b>14</b>] Imaam al-Laalikaa‘ee (d.418H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘Chapter: A report of what is related from the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) with regards to the fact that when the Muslims are lowered into their graves, they will be questioned by Munkar and Nakeer, and that the Punishment in the Grave is a true fact, and <i>eemaan</i> in it is obligatory.’’ [30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<b>15</b>] Imaam al-Bayhaqee (d.458H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘Chapter: <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave.’’ [31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE MEANING OF EEMAAN:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajar (d.852H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘<i>Eemaan</i> in the language means: <i>tasdeeq</i>: (attesting to the truth).  In the <i>Sharee’ah</i>, it means: <i>tasdeeq</i> of what the Messenger (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) brought from his Lord &#8211; and this much is agreed upon.  Then there is difference.  Is anything else a condition on top of that, such as stating this <i>eemaan</i> upon the tongue, as well as it being in the heart, or action upon what is attested to by what is ordered and leaving what is forbidden.’’  Up until where al-Haafidh said, ‘‘So the <i>Salaf</i> say, <i>eemaan </i>is <i>’aqeedah</i> in the heart, statement of the tongue, and action of the limbs.  They mean by this, that actions are a condition for its completeness.  So from this comes their saying that it increases and decreases, as will follow.  The <i>Murji’ah</i> say, it is <i>’aqeedah</i> and a statement upon the tongue only.  The <i>Karraamiyyah</i> say, it is the statement of the tongue only.  And the <i>Mu’tazilah</i> say, it is action, statement and <i>’aqeedah</i>.  But the difference between the <i>Mu’tazilah</i> and the <i>Salaf</i> is that the <i>Mu’tazilah</i> make actions a condition for the correctness of <i>eemaan</i>, whereas the <i>Salaf</i> make it a condition for its completeness.  As for the second point, then the <i>Salaf</i> hold that it increases and decreases, whereas most of the people of <i>kalaam</i> (theological rhetoric) reject this by saying that if it is liable to decrease, then it is doubt.’’ [32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, the <i>Salaf</i> agreed that <i>eemaan</i> is <i>’aqeedah</i>, statement, and action.  So, whosoever denies <i>’aqeedah</i> in the Punishment of the Grave, has likewise denied <i>eemaan</i> in it.  Since <i>’aqeedah</i> in the heart is the foundation of <i>eemaan</i> &#8211; about which there is agreement from the scholars of <i>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Baghawee (d.535H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘The Companions and the <i>Taabi’een</i>, and those who came after them from the scholars of the <i>Sunnah</i> are agreed that actions are a part of <i>eemaan</i>…and they say: Indeed <i>eemaan</i> is a statement, action and <i>’aqeedah</i>.  It increases with obedience, and decreases with disobedience.’’ [33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having understood this, the falsehood of those who claim to have <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave, whilst denying <i>’aqeedah</i> in it, will become very clear.  Since our <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> held that the root of <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave is to have <i>’aqeedah</i> in it &#8211; so if there is no <i>’aqeedah</i> in the Punishment of the Grave, then there is &#8211; by default &#8211; no <i>eemaan</i> in it as well!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE GRAVE MISTAKE:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is thus clear, that the <i>Salaf</i> and those who followed them were agreed that the Punishment in the Grave will definitely occur (for the disbelievers and some of the sinful ones from amongst the Muslims) and that it is obligatory to have <i>eemaan</i> in it, and to consider it as part of the Islaamic <i>’aqeedah</i> &#8211; and no one whose saying is taken account of opposes them in that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the founder of the modernist party <i>Hizbut-Tahreer</i>, like the <i>Mu’tazilah</i> before, also denied <i>’aqeedah</i> in the Punishment of the Grave, explaining his position by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘Indeed from them (the <i>aahaad ahaadeeth</i>) are those which require an action, so it is acted upon.  So from Aboo Hurayrah who said: The Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: ‘‘When any of you finishes the last <i>tashahhud</i>, he should seek refuge in Allaah from four things: from the Punishment of the Hellfire, from the Punishment of the Grave, from the trials of life and death, and from the evil trials of the <i>Dajjaal</i>.’’  And from ’Aa‘ishah: from the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>), that he used to make supplication in the Prayer saying: ‘‘O Allaah!  I seek refuge in You from the Punishment of the Grave, I seek refuge in You from the trials of the <i>Maseehud-Dajjaal</i>, I seek refuge in You from the trials of life and death.  O Allaah!  I seek refuge in You from debt and sin.’’  So these two <i>ahaadeeth</i> are <i>aahaad</i> narrations, and they contain the requirement of an action, i.e. to carry out this supplication after finishing the <i>tashahhud</i>.  So it is recommended to make this supplication after finishing the <i>tashahhud</i>, and it is permissible to make <i>tasdeeq</i> (attest) of what is contained in them.  However, what is <i>haraam</i> (prohibited) is to hold it with certainty &#8211; meaning: to have it as part of ones <i>’aqeedah</i> &#8211; as long as it has only been reported in the <i>aahaad</i> <i>hadeeth</i>, a <i>dhannee</i> (non-<i>mutawaatir</i>) proof.  However, if it occurs in <i>mutawaatir</i> form, then it is obligatory to make it part of ones <i>’aqeedah</i>.’’ [34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This saying contains a number of short-comings:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[i] Differentiating between the <i>aahaad</i> and <i>mutawaatir</i> <i>ahaadeeth</i> in matters of <i>’aqeedah</i> is an innovation of the <i>Qadariyyah</i> and the <i>Mu’tazilah</i> &#8211; as has already been explained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ii] Making <i>tasdeeq</i> of the Punishment of the Grave, whilst prohibiting a person to have <i>’aqeedah</i> (belief) in it, is a contradiction in terms.  Since &#8211; as has preceeded from the words of al-Haafidh Ibn Hajar &#8211; <i>tasdeeq</i> is attesting to the truth of something in the heart, which is the same as <i>’aqeedah</i> and which thereby necessitates <i>eemaan</i>.  However, differentiating between <i>tasdeeq</i> and <i>’aqeedah</i> is innovated speech, opposing the way of our <i>Salaf</i>.  Unfortunately, the likes of this innovation has clearly been stated by the present leader of <i>Hizbut-Tahrir</i> in Britain, when he said: ‘‘We trust it; and I encourage all of you <i>’an tasaddiqoo bi ’adhaabil qabr</i> (to have <i>tasdeeq</i> in the Punishment of the Grave).  I encourage all of you <i>’an tasaddiqoo bi ’awdatil-Mahdee</i> (to have <i>tasdeeq</i> in the return of the <i>Mahdee</i>).  I encourage you for that, but whoever believes in that, then he is sinful.’’ [35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[iii] How is it possible to affirm the Punishment of the Grave upon the tongue, whilst prohibiting <i>’aqeedah</i> (belief) of it in the heart &#8211; is this not but <i>nifaaq</i> (hypocrisy)?!  Rather, <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave necessitates &#8211; as a foundation &#8211; <i>’aqeedah</i> in the heart!!  May Allaah have mercy upon Imaam Ahmad, who said: ‘‘You should beware of speaking about an issue in which you are not preceded by a scholar.’’ [36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[iv] Along with all this, it must be remembered that: ‘‘It is not permissible to invent an interpretation about an <i>aayah</i>, or about a <i>Sunnah</i>, which was not there in the time of the <i>Salaf</i>; nor did they have any knowledge about it; nor explain it to the <i>Ummah</i>.  Since this would imply that the <i>Salaf</i> were ignorant of the truth in this matter and failed to reach it, whereas the late-coming opponent is somehow guided to the truth!’’ [37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Awzaa’ee (d.157H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘Hold fast to the narrations of the <i>Salaf</i>, even if the people were to abandon you.  Beware of the opinions of the people, no matter how much they beautify it with their speech.’’ [38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Haneefah (d.150H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘Stick to the <i>athar</i> (narration) and the way of the <i>Salaf</i> and beware of newly invented matters, for all of it is innovation.’’ [39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So denying <i>’aqeedah</i> in the Punishment of the Grave, declaring this to be something sinful and prohibited, declaring also that it is not a matter which will definitely occur, but it is a matter which may possibly occur &#8211; is speech in opposition to that of the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> &#8211; the like of which was previously uttered by only the <i>Khawaarij</i>, and a group from amongst the <i>Mu’tazilah</i>; and there is no doubt in its being a deviation from the Straight Path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, outwardly affirming <i>tasdeeq</i> and apparently affirming <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave, whilst denying <i>’aqeedah</i> in it, is only a contradiction in terms &#8211; since <i>tasdeeq</i>, <i>eemaan</i>, and <i>’aqeedah</i> in the opinion of the <i>Salaf</i>, all imply certainty and being definite &#8211; even if the modernists dislike this!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad (d.241H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘The Punishment of the Grave is a true fact; and no one denies it except one who is misguided and misguiding others.’’ [40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Naasiree (d.652H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said in <i>an-Noorul-Laami’</i> (no. 110):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘We have <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave and its bliss…this is the <i>madhhab</i> of <i>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah</i>.  So it is obligatory to have <i>’aqeedah</i> in this.’’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam an-Nawawee (d.676H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said in <i>Sharh Saheeh Muslim</i> (5/85):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘This chapter shows the virtue of seeking refuge &#8211; between the <i>tashahhud</i> and <i>tasleem</i> &#8211; from these (four) matters; and in it is an affirmation of the Punishment of the Grave, and it is the position of the people of the truth &#8211; as opposed to the <i>Mu’tazilah</i>.’’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Qurtubee (d.671H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘To have <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave and its trials is obligatory, due to what the most truthful (Muhammad &#8211; <i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) has mentioned.  This is the belief of <i>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah</i>.’’ [41]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>NEED FOR VERIFICATION:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘So examine &#8211; may Allaah have mercy upon you &#8211; the speech of everyone you hear from, particularly in your time.  Do not act in haste, nor enter into anything from it until you ask and see: Did any of the Companions of the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) speak about it, or any of the Scholars.  So if you find a narration from them about it, then cling to it.  Do not go beyond it for anything, and do not give precedence to anything over it, and thus fall into the Fire.’’ [42]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Seereen (d.110) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘This knowledge is the Religion, so be careful from whom you take your Religion.’’ [43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qaadee Shareek (d.177H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">’Ibaad Ibnul-’Awwaam said: Shareek Ibn ’Abdullaah came to us more than fifty years ago, so we said to him: O Abaa ’Abdullaah!  There are a group of the <i>Mu’tazilah</i> who deny the <i>ahaadeeth</i> about Allaah descending to the lowest heaven and that the people shall see their Lord.  So Shareek quoted about ten <i>ahaadeeth</i> like that, and then said: ‘‘As for us, then we have taken our Religion from the sons of the <i>Taabi’een</i>, from the Companions.  From whom did they take theirs?’’ [44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there is in what has preceded &#8211; if Allaah wills &#8211; a clear explanation for those whose hearts have been enlightened by Allaah with the light of Revelation, and whose has hearts have found peace and delight in the narrations of the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i>.  Indeed it is this which brings about a firmness of understanding and is a remedy against the darkness of <i>hizbiyyah</i> (party-spirit).  This, in turn, produces the purity and quality, even if numbers are small.  Indeed mere numbers in opposition to the <i>manhaj</i> (methodology) of the <i>Salaf</i> &#8211; the <i>manhaj</i> of <i>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah</i> &#8211; leads to nothing but deception, destruction and extreme disappointment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Taken from “Tayseerul-Kareemir-Rahmaan fee tafseer Kalaamil-Mannaan” of Shaikh Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Naasir as-Sa‟dee.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Meaning: <span style="color:#339966;">And no soul shall bear the burden of sin of another, and if a soul heavily laden with sin calls someone else to bear its sins, nothing of it will be lifted even though he be near of kin</span>.][Sooratul-Faatir (35): Ayah 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Naasir as-Sa‟dee- rahimahullaah-said in his Tafseer of the Aayah: “And the last meaning is indicated by what He mentioned after it, in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Meaning: <span style="color:#339966;">And no soul shall bear the burden of sin of another</span>], meaning: on the Day of Resurrection everyone shall be recompensed for his own deeds, and no one shall carry the sins of anyone else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Meaning: <span style="color:#339966;">And if a soul heavily laden with sin calls someone else to bear its sins</span>]: i.e. a soul weighed down with sins and evil deeds: if it calls on someone to take on some of its sins,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Meaning: <span style="color:#339966;">Then nothing from it will be carried, even if the one asked were a close relative</span>], for sins cannot be carried (even) for a close relative. So the Hereafter is not the same as this world, where relatives can help each other, and close friends. Rather on the Day of Resurrection a person will wish that he had some right due to him from anyone, even if it be his parents or his close relatives.”</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">[Translated by Aboo Talhah Daawood ibn Ronald Burbank -rahimahullaah]</span><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"><strong>And worship your Lord till the certainty comes to you </strong></span>. [al Hijr :99]</p>
<p>al Hasan said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Persistence, persistence! Surely Allaah  has appointed the time of cessation of deeds to be just before death,&#8221; </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and the he recited the above verse. He also said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> &#8220;Your souls are your mounts ,so tend to your mounts, in this way they will convey you to your Lord, Mighty &amp; Magnificent.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of tending to one&#8217;s mounts is to be easy on them, to keep them fit &amp; healthy, &amp; not  to overburden them.</p>
<p>Therefore if one feels his soul is coming to a halt in its travel, he tends to it by inculcating in its the desire to finish the journey,as the situation may demand .</p>
<p>One of the salaf said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8221; Hope is the guide &amp; fear is the driver &amp; the soul will stop &amp; it will then need gentle treatment &amp; song to provoke it to into recommencing its journey&#8221;</strong>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this respect the camel leader, who drives on his herd by singing,said,<br />
&#8220;its guide gave it glad tidings saying: Tomorrow shall you see bananas &amp; mountains.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fear is like a whip &amp; when a person is excessively whips the animal, it could die.As such one must also strike it with  &#8220;songs&#8221; of hope that would encourage it to eagerly revitalize its efforts until it arrives at the destination .</p>
<p>Abu Yazeed said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8221; I have persistently guided my soul to Allaah without letting up, it weeping all the way, then i urged it to on until it laughed&#8221;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">it is said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;When it complained of the burdens of the journey,</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"> <strong> he promised  it Of the relief of arrival so it revitalized of its efforts.&#8221;</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>There is not a person except he has four eyes: two in his head with which he sees the matters of this worldly life, and two in his heart with which he looks to the matters of the hereafter.

Thus he is saved from the unseen [punishment] through the unseen [reward for the obedient].</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Source</strong>: AL-FAWA&#8217;ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings, Imam Ibn al Qayyim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The body of the son of Adam was created from the earth and his soul from the government of Heaven and then they were joined. If he is hungry, stays awake, and keeps his body busy in serving Allah, his soul will find itself lighter and more peaceful so that it would long for the place from which it was created and miss its heavenly world. But if he secures food, blessings, sleep, and rest, the body will incline to remain at the place from which it was created and the soul would be pulled along with it and be in a prison. If it was not for the fact that it would get used to that prison, it would ask for help, as a tortured person does, to find relief from the pain resulting from the separation and departure from its own world from which it was created.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In general, the more the body is light, the more the soul will be light and seek its heavenly world, and the more the body is heavy and seeks desires and relief, the heavier the soul will be and it will come down from its heavenly world and become lower and more earthly. You may see the soul of a man in Heaven while his body is on the earth. Another person serves Allah with his body and his soul is low and wandering about in lowly matters. When the soul separates from the body, it would either catch up with its high or low place. With the high, it would  find every blessing, happiness, beauty, pleasure, and good living while with the low it would find every distress, grief, suffering, sadness, and bad and difficult thing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says, which means,<br />
<em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;But whosoever turns away from My Reminder (i.e. neither believes in this Qur&#8217;an nor acts on its orders, etc.) verily, for him is a life of hardship.&#8221;</span></em>(Taha, 20:124)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;My Reminder&#8221; is His words, which He revealed to His Messenger, and &#8220;turns away&#8221; is by neglecting and abandoning working according to these words, and the majority of explanations saw that &#8220;life of hardship&#8221; is torture in the grave. Ibn Mas&#8217;ud, Abu Hurairah, Abu Sa&#8217;eed AI-Khudry, and Ibn &#8216;Abbas agreed on that and it has a traceable hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This life of hardship is in return for relieving the body and soul with pleasures, desires and relief. The more you enrich the soul, it will restrain the heart until you live a life of hardship, and the more you restrain the soul, it will enrich the heart until that heart will be delighted and relieved. Hardship in this worldly life, following piety will find its relief in partition and the Hereafter, and relief in this worldly life following desires will find its hardship in the partition and the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should choose one of the two: the better, more pleasant, and more lasting.You may distress the body in order to relieve the soul but do not distress the soul to relieve the body; relief and distress of the soul is greater and more lasting while relief and distress of the body is shorter and easier.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The servant exists between hands of Allah at two times: while standing during performing prayer and standing on the Day of Resurrection. Whoever fulfills the rights of the first standing, will in fact be facilitating the second one, and whoever considers this easy and does not pay due attention to it, he will be making the other one difficult for himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Almighty says, which means,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And during night, prostrate yourself to Him (i.e.the offering of Maghrib and &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayers), and glorify Him a long night through (i.e. Tahajjud prayer). Verily! These (disbelievers) love the present life of this world, and put behind them a heavy Day (that will be hard).&#8221;</span> (AI-Insan, 76:26-27)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Hadith regarding the seven to whom Allah gives shade to, on the day when there will be no shade except His — is it specific to men, or will women receive the reward mentioned if they do exactly the same deeds?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ans:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reward mentioned in this Hadith is not specific to men, but rather, it includes both men and women. The Hadith applies to a young girl, for instance, who grows up worshipping Allah Almighty. Similarly, it applies to women who love one another for the sake of Allah, or to a woman who, when she is seduced by a handsome man of good position, says, “Indeed, I fear Allah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also applies to a woman who gives charity from good and honestly earned wealth, yet her left hand doesn’t know what her right hand has spent, and to the woman who remembers Allah when she is alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the quality of being a just Imam (ruler), or congregational prayer in the Masjid, these two are specific to men, for the prayer of a woman in her home is better for her, a fact that is related in authentic narrations from Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him).</p>
