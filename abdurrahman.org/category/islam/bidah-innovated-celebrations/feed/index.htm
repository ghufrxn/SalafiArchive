<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>12- Ruling on celebrating birthdays </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Q: Some scholars say that celebrating birthdays is not correct. Is this true or not? </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ans by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah) :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yes, celebrating birthdays is an act of Bid&#8217;ah (innovation in religion). It is not permissible to celebrate birthdays. It is neither permissible to celebrate the Mawlid (the Prophet&#8217;s birthday) nor the birthday of anyone else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is because the Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Beware of newly-introduced matters in religion), for every newly-introduced matter is a Bid&#8217;ah and every Bid&#8217;ah is a Dalalah (deviation from what is right).&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (peace be upon him) said in his sermon on Friday: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Ama Ba&#8217;d (Now then), the best of speech is the Book of Allah, the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam), the most evil of matters are those which are newly introduced in religion), and every Bid&#8217;ah is a Dalalah (deviation from what is right).</span></strong>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">&#8220;Celebrating birthdays is a Bid&#8217;ah that neither the Prophet (peace be upon him) nor his Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) did.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is sufficient for a Mu&#8217;min (believer) to follow the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and carry on his tradition, and keeping far from Bid&#8217;ahs. Love for the Prophet (peace be upon him) is not in committing Bid&#8217;ahs, but in following his wa<em>y (</em>peace be upon him), abiding by his commands, avoiding his prohibitions, and invoking peace and blessings upon him whenever he is mentioned. May Allah&#8217;s peace and blessings be upon him at all times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Introducing Bid&#8217;ahs is a means that incurs his anger and the wrath of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He). As for denouncing the people of Bid&#8217;ah, Allah (Glorified be He) says: Or have they partners (with Allâh — false gods) who have instituted for them a religion which Allâh has not ordained?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Part No. 3; Page No. 43)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory upon every Muslim to follow Shari&#8217;ah (Islamic law), not to introduce Bid&#8217;ahs. Following the Shari&#8217;ah is sufficient, praise be to Allah. Innovation in religion is a way to evil and trial. All praise is due to Allah, the religion is perfect and no one is permitted to introduce any thing that Allah (Exalted be He) did not prescribe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is equally applied to celebrating birthdays and other innovations such as building over the graves and taking them as places of Worship. These are types of Bid&#8217;ahs and a means to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Similarly, plastering graves, building domes, and hanging curtains over them are acts of Bid&#8217;ah and a means that lead to Shirk</strong></span>. It is obligatory on the people of Islam to warn against Bid&#8217;ahs, and keep apart from them so as not to contradict their Prophet (peace be upon him). Thus, they follow the commands that he (peace be upon him) ordered and abstain from the prohibitions that he (peace be upon him) forbade.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Statement from the Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta’ concerning the ruling on celebrating the Gregorian Year 2000 and related issues</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allah, Alone, and peace and blessings be upon the Last of the Prophets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">..</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The questioners have asked about the ruling on dedicating attention to the Gregorian millennium, celebrating it, and other issues relating to the event. It is sufficient for us to quote just two of the posed questions:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The first question says,</strong> “Nowadays we see the programs that the mass media is broadcasting about the celebrations and preparations held for the arrival of the Year 2000, and the beginning of the third millennium. The Kafirs (disbelievers) from among the Jews, Christians, and others, are very happy about it and pin their hopes on this event. My question, Your Eminence, is that some Muslims have become interested in it and are considering it a happy occasion to get married or do business on. Others are advertising this event in their shops or companies, and doing other things that offend Muslims. What is the Shari‘ah (Islamic law) ruling on celebrating this event and exchanging verbal congratulations and cards on it? May Allah reward you with the best for the efforts you exert for Islam and Muslims!”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The second question says,</strong> “The Jews and the Christians are preparing to celebrate the arrival of the Year 2000 according to their calendar, in an extraordinary way to promote their plans and beliefs in the world, particularly in Muslim countries. Some Muslims have been influenced by this propaganda and have also started preparing for it and many of them are announcing sales on this occasion. We fear that this may affect the Muslims’ ‘Aqidah (creed) in relation to their loyalties to non-Muslims. We hope you will explain the ruling on Muslims’ following the Kafir (disbelievers) in their special occasions, propagating and celebrating them, and the ruling on giving workers the day off in some organizations and companies to mark this occasion?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Does doing any of these or similar things, or approving them, have any effect on a Muslim’s ‘Aqidah?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Having studied the questions, the committee answered as follows:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam and the guidance to the Straight Path are the greatest blessings that Allah has bestowed upon His Servants. It is through His Mercy that Allah (Exalted be He) obligates His Believing Servants to ask Him for guidance during Salah (Prayer). They ask Him to guide them to and keep them on the Straight Path. Allah (Glorified be He) describes this Straight Path as being the path of those on whom He has bestowed His Grace from among the Prophets, the Siddiqin (the followers of the prophets who were first to believe in them, such as Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq), the martyrs, and the righteous, and not the path of those who have gone astray from the Jews, Christians, and other Kafirs (disbelievers) and Mushrikin (those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once this is learned, it is obligatory on a Muslim to realize the greatness of Allah’s Blessing upon them. They should give thanks to Allah (Glorified be He) in words, deeds, and beliefs. They should guard this blessing, protect it, and adopt the means necessary to keep from loss.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An insightful look into Allah’s Din (Religion) in today’s world, in which the truth and falsehood have become mixed and confused for many people, will clearly see the efforts the enemies of Islam are exerting to destroy its realities, extinguish its light, distance Muslims from it, and sever all their connections with it by any possible means. Not only that, but they are also attempting to distort its image and bring accusations and forge lies against it, to avert people from the Way of Allah,and from Iman (Faith) in what Allah revealed to His Messenger, Muhammad ibn ‘Abdullah (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) confirms this by saying (what means): <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 109" target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="ManyofthepeopleoftheScripture"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Many of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) wish that if they could turn you away as disbelievers after you have believed, out of envy from their ownselves, even after the truth (that Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم is Allâh’s Messenger) has become manifest unto them</span>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-&#096;Imran, 3: 69" target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="ApartyofthepeopleoftheScripture"></a><span style="color:#008000;">A party of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) wish to lead you astray. But they shall not lead astray anyone except themselves, and they perceive not.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-&#096;Imran, 3: 149" target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="Oyouwhobelieve!Ifyouobey"></a><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! If you obey those who disbelieve, they will send you back on your heels, and you will turn back (from Faith) as losers</span>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-&#096;Imran, 3: 99" target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="Say:OpeopleoftheScripture"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Say: &#8220;O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Why do you stop those who have believed, from the Path of Allâh, seeking to make it seem crooked, while you (yourselves) are witnesses [to Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم as a Messenger of Allâh and Islâm (Allâh’s religion, i.e. to worship none but Him Alone)]? And Allâh is not unaware of what you do.</span>&#8220;<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There as also many other Ayahs (Qur’anic verses) to this effect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nevertheless, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) has made a promise to protect His Religion and Book, as He says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-Hijr, 15: 9" target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="Verily,We,itisWeWhohavesent"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Qur’ân) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption</span>).<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /> All praise is to Allah! Moreover, the Prophet (peace be upon him) has informed that a group of his Ummah (nation based on one creed) will continue on the Truth, triumphant, and they will not be harmed by those who forsake or oppose them until the Day of Judgment. All praise is to Allah! We ask Allah (Exalted be He), Who is the Ever-Near and the Responsive, to make us and our Muslim brothers among this group. Indeed, He is the Most Generous Bestower.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta’ has seen and heard about the huge preparations and great interest shown by the Jews, the Christians, and those so-called Muslims who are influenced by them to mark the end of the year and welcome the new millennium according to the Gregorian calendar, and the committee cannot but provide advice and clarification for all Muslims on the facts of this occasion and give the ruling of the sanctified Shari‘ah on it, so Muslims will be enlightened about their Din and beware of the deviations of those who earned Allah’s Anger and those who went astray.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>To continue:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>First</strong></span>: The Jews and the Christians have attached events, sufferings, and pinned hopes on the arrival of this millennium, which they are certain &#8211; or almost certain &#8211; that they shall come to pass, as they are the outcome of their researches and studies, as they claim. They have also attached some of their creedal issues to this millennium, which they claim to have been mentioned in their distorted books. It is obligatory on Muslims not to pay attention to this or believe it; instead they should be content with the Book of their Lord (Exalted be He) and the Sunnah of His Prophet (peace be upon him), and any theory or opinion contrary to these is just an illusion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">Second</span></strong>: This and other similar occasions are never devoid of mixing the truth with falsehood, and inviting to Kufr (disbelief), Dalalah (deviation from what is right), licentiousness, atheism, and the emergence of Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect).Among these invitations are the calls to unify the religions, equate Islam with false creeds and sects, ask for the blessing of the Cross, and practice the Jewish and Christian rites. This is in addition to the words and deeds that either imply that the distorted abrogated Christian and Jewish creeds can lead to Allah, or express approval of some of their beliefs which contradict the Din of Islam or constitute Kufr (disbelief) in Allah, His Messenger, and Islam, by the Ijma‘ (consensus) of the Muslim Ummah. Moreover, this occasion is one of the means of alienating Muslims from their Din.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Third</strong></span>: The Qur’an, Sunnah, and authentic Athar (narrations from the Companions) give detailed evidence on the prohibition of imitating the disbelievers in what is particular to them. This includes imitating them in their ‘Eids or celebrating them. ‘Eid (festival) is a generic term which (in the context of these reports) includes every day or occasion which is repeated and is venerated by the Kafirs, or any place in which the Kafirs hold religious gatherings, or any action which they do in these places or at these times &#8211; all of that is part of their ‘Eids or festivals. The prohibition applies not only to their festivals, but to any times or places which they venerate that have no basis in the Din of Islam; and all the invented acts that they do at them are prohibited also. The days preceding and following their festivals are also covered by this prohibition, as pointed out by Shaykh Al-Islam, Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful to him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the Ayahs (Qur’anic verses) which specifically forbid imitating Non-Muslims in their festivals is Allah’s Saying: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-Furqan, 25: 72" target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="Andthosewhodonotbearwitness"></a><span style="color:#008000;">And those who do not bear witness to falsehood</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /> This is stated as one of the characteristics of Allah’s Believing Servants. A group of the Salaf (righteous predecessors), including: Ibn Sirin, Mujahid, and Al-Rabi‘ ibn Anas, interpreted the word &#8220;<strong>Al-Zur (falsehood)</strong>&#8221; as referring to the festivals of the Kafirs. It was authentically reported that Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said, <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="WhentheMessengerofAllah(peace"></a><span id="13870"></span>“<span style="color:#008000;">When the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) came to Al-Madinah, they had two days on which they would celebrate. He (peace be upon him) asked, ‘What are these two days?’ They said, ‘We used to celebrate on these two days during the Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic time of ignorance).’ The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, “Allah has given you two days instead of these that are better than them: the Day of Al-Adha (the Festival of the Sacrifice) and the Day of Al-Fitr (the Festival of Breaking the Fast)</span>.”<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /> (Reported by Al-ImamAhmad, Abu Dawud, and Al-Nasa&#8217;y, through Sahih [authentic] Sanad [chain of narrators])</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was authentically narrated by Thabit ibn Al-Dahhak (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said, <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="Amanvowedtosacrificesomecamels"></a><span id="10255"></span>“<span style="color:#008000;">A man vowed to sacrifice some camels in Buwanah (a hill beyond Yanbu`) during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). So, he came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and said, ‘I have vowed to sacrifice some camels in Buwanah.’ The Prophet (peace be upon him) asked, “Were there any idols of the Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic time of ignorance) there that were worshipped?” They said, ‘No.’ He (peace be upon him) asked, ‘Were any of their festivals held there?’ They said, ‘No.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, ‘Fulfill your vow, for there is no fulfillment of a vow which involves disobedience to Allah, or with regard to a thing the son of Adam does not own</span>.’”<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /> (Reported by Abu Dawud through a Sahih Sanad)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said, “<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do not enter to the Mushrikin (those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) in their churches on the day of their festivals, for Wrath descends upon them</strong></span>.” He (may Allah be pleased with him) also said, “<span style="color:#008000;">Keep away from the enemies of Allah on their festivals.</span>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also reported that `Abdullah ibn `Amr ibn Al-`As (may Allah be pleased with them both) said, “<span style="color:#008000;">Anyone who settles in the land of the non-Muslims and celebrates their Nayruz (New Year’s Day) and their Mahrajaan (two non-Islamic Persian festivals), and keeps imitating them until they die in that state, will be gathered with them on the Day of Resurrection</span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">Fourth</span></strong>: Muslims are prohibited from observing the festivals of the Kafirs for many reasons, some of which are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Imitating them in some of their festivals will give them delight and complacency in their falsehoods.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Imitation and similarity in external matters will inevitably leads one to imitating them and behaving like them in internal matters such as their corrupt beliefs, and being slowly and subtly won over to their way of thinking.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. One of the gravest ensuing corruptions is that imitating the Kafirs in external matters generates a kind of love, friendship and loyalties that are incompatible with Iman (Faith), as Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5: 51" target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="Oyouwhobelieve!Takenotthe"></a><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Auliyâ’ (friends, protectors, helpers), they are but Auliyâ’ of each other. And if any amongst you takes them (as Auliyâ’), then surely he is one of them. Verily, Allâh guides not those people who are the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers and unjust)</span>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-Mujadalah, 58: 22" target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="You(OMuhammad%D8%B5%D9%84%D9%89%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%87%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%85)"></a>Y<span style="color:#008000;">ou (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will not find any people who believe in Allâh and the Last Day, making friendship with those who oppose Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم)</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Fifth</strong></span>: Based on the above, it is not permissible for a Muslim who believes in Allah as their Lord, Islam as their religion, and Muhammad as their Prophet to celebrate any festival that has no basis in the Din of Islam, and that includes the so-called new millennium. Neither are they permitted to attend such festivals or take part in them, or to help others do so in any way whatsoever, because this is sin and transgression of the limits set by Allah. Allah (Exalted be He) says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5: 2" target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="Oyouwhobelieve!Violatenot"></a><span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allâh. Verily, Allâh is Severe in punishment</span>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Sixth</strong></span>: It is not permissible for a Muslim to cooperate, in any way, with the Kafirs with regard to their festivals &#8211; including the new millennium under discussion &#8211; by publicizing and announcing them, or propagating them by any means, whether through the mass media, or by setting up digital clocks and notice boards, manufacturing clothing and memorabilia, printing cards or school notebooks, announcing sales, offering prizes, organizing sport events, or producing special slogans or logos.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Seventh</strong></span>: It is not permissible for Muslims to consider the festivals of the Kafirs &#8211; including the millennium &#8211; to be happy occasions or blessed times for taking the day off work, getting married, starting a business or beginning new projects, etc. It is not permissible to believe that these days are more special than other days; because these are just like any other days.This is a corrupt belief that does not change the reality of these days in the slightest. Such beliefs are nothing but sin upon sin. We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Eighth</strong></span>: It is not permissible for a Muslim to congratulate the Kafirs on their festivals, as this implies a kind of approval of their false beliefs and makes them happy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn Al-Qayyim</strong> (may Allah be merciful to him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“As for offering congratulations on the special ritualistic occasions of Kufr (disbelief), this is agreed to be Haram (prohibited), such as congratulating them (the Kafirs) for their festivals and fasts by saying, ‘Happy or blessed festival to you’ and the like. Even if the one who says so escapes committing Kufr, it is still Haram. It is like congratulating someone for prostrating to the Cross; in fact it is even more sinful in the Sight of Allah and more hateful than congratulating someone for drinking Khamr (intoxicants), killing a soul, or committing adultery, and so on. Many of those who have no respect for their Din fall into this error; they do not realize the abhorrence of their action. Anyone who congratulate a person for committing an act of disobedience, Bid‘ah (innovation in religion) or Kufr exposes themselves to the Hate and Wrath of Allah.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Ninth</strong></span>: It honors the Muslims to abide by the <strong>Hijri (lunar) calendar</strong> which is based on the date of Hijrah (migration) of their Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) to Madinah, upon which the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet, may Allah be pleased with them) consensually agreed, and they dated events according to it without celebrating it. Muslims have followed in their footsteps and passed on this heritage for fourteen centuries to our present day. Therefore, it is not permissible for a Muslim to abandon the Hijri calendar and adopt the calendar of any other nation on earth, such as the Gregorian. This means exchanging that which is better for that which is worse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We, therefore, advise all Muslims to have Taqwa (fear/wariness of offending Allah) and to act in obedience to Allah, keep away from sins, and to exhort one another to persevere in this and be patient.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let every believer be true to their soul and strive to save it from the Wrath of Allah and His Curse in this world and the Hereafter by actualizing their knowledge and Iman. They should take Allah as their Guide, Helper, Lawgiver, and Protector, for He is the Best Protector and the Best Helper. Indeed, sufficient is your Lord as a Guide and Helper.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let them also repeat the Du‘a’ (supplication) of the Prophet (peace be upon him):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="OAllah!LordofJibril,Mika%E2%80%99il,"></a><span id="19858"></span>“<span style="color:#008000;">O Allah! Lord of Jibril, Mika’il, and Israfil, Creator of the heavens and the earth, Knower of the Unseen and the Seen, You will judge between Your servants concerning that over which they used to differ. Guide me to the truth of that wherein they differed, by Your leave, for You guide whomsoever You will to the Straight Path</span>.”<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Some of our Muslim brethren hold birthday parties for themselves and their children, what is the ruling on such festivals? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The basic principle regarding acts of <strong>Ibadah</strong> (worship) is that they are <strong>Tawqifiy</strong> (bound by a religious text and not amenable to personal opinion), and as such, no one is allowed to worship Allah in a way other than which He ordained, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) said in the Sahih (authentic) Hadith:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Anyone who introduces anything into this matter of ours (Islam) that is not part of it will have it rejected. </span></em>[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (peace be upon him) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Anyone who does an action which is not in accordance with this matter of ours (Islam) will have it rejected. </span></em>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Birthday parties are an act of Bid&#8217;ah (innovation in religion) that should not be done for any person, regardless of their rank or role in life. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most honorable of all creation and the best of all Messengers (peace be upon them), i.e. Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdullah (peace be upon him) was never reported to have held a festival for the day he was born, or even instructed his Ummah (nation based on one creed) to celebrate it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, the best of this Ummah after its Prophet (peace be upon him) are the Rightly-Guided Caliphs and the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet), but none of them is reported to have made a festival for the Prophet&#8217;s birthday, or for any of them (may Allah be pleased with them), and all goodness is to be found in following their pathand patterning oneself after the teachings of the Prophet (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, such Bid`ah pave the way to<strong> imitate the Jews, Christians and other Kafirs</strong> (non-Muslims) in terms of their newly invented festivals. Allah is the One sought for help!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling on organizing celebrations for the birthdays of children or for wedding anniversaries?</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are no celebrations in Islaam except Friday the weekly ‘Eid, the first day of Shawwal – ’Eidal-Adha. The day of ’Arafah might be called an ‘Eid for those who are at’Arafah on that day, and the days of Tashreeq, following ’Eidul-Adha.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As for birthday celebrations for a person or his children, or wedding anniversaries or the like, none of them are legislated and they are closer to being innovations than to being allowed</strong></span>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer to a <a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;PageID=801&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Question</strong> </a>Posed to Permanent Committee :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: `Eid (festival) means in Arabic gatherings that Ta&#8217;ud (comes again) on a habitual manner. It may come again in a year, a month, or a week. Therefore, the word &#8216;Eid means a day that comes again like `Eid-ul-Fitr (the Festival of Breaking the Fast) or Friday, the gathering on that day and the acts done as acts of worship or habits on that day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: Anything that is meant to worship Allah, seek to be closer to Him to get reward through doing so or any thing meant to be similar to disbelievers and the like is a Bid`ah that is included in the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him): &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">He who innovates things in our affairs for which there is no valid (reason) (commits sin) and these are to be rejected.</span>&#8221; This Hadith was reported by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. <strong>Celebrating the Prophet&#8217;s Mawlid, Mother&#8217;s Day, and National Day fall into this category.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first one includes an act of worship that was not legislated by Allah. Moreover, it contains similarity to the Christians and other disbelievers. <strong>The second and the third are prohibited as it is imitating disbelievers</strong>. Whatever is in the interest of the Ummah (nation) and arranging its affairs as the Week of the Traffic, arranging the times of studying, holding meetings with employees to arrange work and the like are not acts of worship, they are of the innovated habits that are not included in the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him): <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;He who innovates things in our affairs for which there is no valid (reason) (commits sin) and these are to be rejected.&#8221;</span> Then, there will be no blame for doing so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Excerpts from Works by a Numerous People of Knowledge<br />
Translated &amp; Compiled by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Salaf as-Salih Did Not Celebrate It</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said regarding the<em>Mawlid</em> of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Salaf as-Salih did not do this even though they could have done it and there was no prevention in doing so.  If the <em>Mawlid</em> was good or seen as beneficial the Salaf <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhum</em><em>&#8211;</em> would have had more of a right to it than us because they were the greatest in love for the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and in respect for him, compared to us, and were more concerned for goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed loving him completely and respecting him is by following him <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>, obeying him and following his commands, reviving his Sunnah outwardly and inwardly and conveying what he was sent with, striving upon that with the heart, hand and tongue, as this was the way of the foremost to embrace Islaam from the Muhajireen, the Ansar and those who followed them in goodness.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘Iqtida’ as-Siraat al-Mustaqeem’ Vol.2 p.619</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> was asked, as occurs in ‘Fatawa al-Misreeyah’, regarding completing the Qur’aan every year on the night of the <em>Mawlid</em> of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> is that a recommended action or not?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘All Praise belongs to Allaah, the gathering of people for food on the two Eids and the days of stoning in the Hajj is sunnah and is from the distinguishing features of Islaam which the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> established as a Sunnah for the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Helping and feeding the poor in the month of Ramadan is also from the <em>Sunnan</em> of Islaam.  The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever opens a fasting person’s fast then he has the reward similar to the fasting person.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Giving the poor recitors what aids them in reciting the Qur’aan is a good action at all times, and whoever helps them in this shares in the reward.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for taking a season other than the legislated seasons, like some of the nights of the month of Rabi al-Awwal- which it is said is the night of the <em>Mawlid</em>&#8211; or taking some of the nights of Rajab or the 18<sup>th</sup> of Dhul-Hijjah, the 1<sup>st</sup> Jumu’ah of Rajab or the 8<sup>th</sup> of Shawwal which the ignorant people call <em>Eid al-Abrar</em> then all of this is from Bida’ (innovations) which the Salaf neither recommended nor did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘Rasil fee Hukm al-Ihteefal bil-Mawlid an-Nabawi’ Vol.2 p.429</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Is it Obligatory or Recommended?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   The ‘Allaama Shaykh Taj-Uddeen Faakihanee[1] who died in the year (734 A.H.) said in his unique booklet about this subject entitled: ‘al-Mawrid fee Amal al-Mawlid’ and this is its wording and text:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘In The name of Allaah, The Most Kind and Most Merciful</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allaah who guided us to follow the leader of the Messengers and supported us with the guidance to aid the <em>Deen</em>, Who made it easy for us to follow the <em>Athaar</em> of the Salaf as-Saliheen until our hearts filled up with the light of the knowledge of the<em>Sharia’</em> and the definite clear truth and Who purified our hearts from introducing new innovations and innovating in the <em>Deen</em>.  I praise Allaah with what He has favoured us with of the light of certainty and I thank Him for what He has conferred on us holding on to the strong rope of the <em>Deen</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I testify that none is worthy of worship except Allaah – Alone who has no partner- and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger, the leader of the earlier people and of those who came later.  May Allaah send His prayers upon His Messenger, his Family, his Companions and his pure wives, who are the Mothers of the Believers, continuously until the day of Judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Amma Ba’d:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed a question has been repeated from a group of blessed people about a gathering which some of the people organize in the month of Rabi al-Awwal and they call it ‘<em>al-Mawlid</em>’:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Does it have an origin in the <em>Sharia’</em>?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or is it a Bida’ and innovation in the <em>Deen</em>?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They wanted the answer to this to be clear and to clarify it specifically.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I say – and success is with Allaah – :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I do not know of an origin for this <em>Mawlid</em> neither in the Book of Allaah nor in the Sunnah, nor was it narrated that any of the scholars of the <em>Ummah</em> performed it; those scholars who are an example for the <em>Deen</em>, holding on to the <em>Athaar</em> of the predecessors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, <em>Mawlid</em> is a Bida’, it was innovated by magicians; those parasites who followed their desires and became rich by it.  The evidence for this is that if we applied the five types of <em>Sharee’ah</em>rulings to it we would say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is either obligatory (<em>Waajib</em>), recommended (<em>Mandoob</em>), permissible (<em>Mubaah</em>), disliked (<em>Makrooh</em>) or prohibited (<em>Muharam</em>)!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By consensus it is neither obligatory nor recommended; because the reality of a recommended act is: an act which is sanctioned by the<em>Sharia’</em> without any disapproval for the one who leaves it.  The<em>Sharia’</em> did not give permission for the <em>Mawlid</em> and the Companions did not do it, neither the <em>Tabieen</em> nor the religious scholars – as far as I know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is my response to this before Allaah –Ta’ala – if I am asked about it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nor is it correct that it is permissible (<em>Mubaah</em>), because innovating in the <em>Deen</em> is not permissible – and all the Muslims are in agreement regarding this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So nothing remains except that it is disliked (<em>Makrooh</em>) or prohibited (<em>Muharam</em>).’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘al-Hukm al-Haqq fee al-Hihteefal biMawlid sayyid al-Khalq’  p.11</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Differing on the Date of Birth</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   Ustadh Abu Abdullaah Muhammad al-Haffar[2]  – who died in the year (811 A.H.) as stated in the book ‘al-Ma’yeyar al-Ma’arab’ (7/99-101):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Salaf as-Salih – and they are the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and those who followed them – never used to gather on the night of the <em>Mawlid</em> for worship, they would not do anything on that night which they would not do on any other night of the year because the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>is not revered except due to that which the <em>Sharia’</em> regards as reverential.  Revering the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> is from the greatest of ways of drawing closer to Allaah but drawing closer to Allaah – the Magnificent – is only with what He has legislated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The evidence that the Salaf never used to do anything extra on that night – over what they did on any other night – is that they differed in the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It had been said: the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> was born in Ramadan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It had been said: in Rabia’ al-Awwal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They differed regarding the day on which he was born with four different sayings!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if there was worship that occurred due to the birth of the best of creation <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> on the night preceding the day on which he was born – then it would have been well-known and widespread and no difference would have occurred regarding it, but observing extra reverence was not legislated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do you not see that Friday is the best day upon which the sun rose?! And the best thing to do on the best day is to fast.  Despite this, the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> prohibited fasting on Fridays – even though it is an excellent day.  So this indicates that no worship occurs for any time or place except that which is legislated and if it is not legislated, then it is not done, since the last of this <em>Ummah</em>cannot bring guidance better than what the first of this <em>Ummah</em>brought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this door to unlegislated worship were opened then people would come and say: the day the Messenger migrated to Madeenah was the day Allaah honoured Islaam, so there should be a gathering and worship should be performed!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Others will say: the night on which the Messenger was taken on the night journey he received honour that cannot be valued!  Then worship would be innovated on that night…..so, they would not stop at this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And good – all of it – is in following the Salaf as-Salih; whom Allaah chose for Himself, so whatever they did we do and whatever they left we leave.[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if this is understood, then gathering on that night is not required by the <em>Sharia’</em> rather it is commanded to leave it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘al-Hukm al-Haqq fee al-Hihteefal biMawlid sayyid al-Khalq’ p.14</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Following the Salaf</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   ‘Allaama Ibn al-Haaj who died in (737 A.H.) said in the book ‘al-Madkhal’ (2/11-12) – clarifying the ruling of performing al-Mawlid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘….that it is an addition to the <em>Deen</em> and is not from the actions of the Salaf of the past.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Following the Salaf takes precedence – rather it is more obligatory than intending increase to the <em>Deen</em> by opposing that what they were upon – because they were the greatest of the people in following the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and in proclaiming greatness for him and his Sunnah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.</em>  The Salaf have the superiority and excellence of haste to the Sunnah and it is not narrated from anyone of them that the Messenger suggested observing the <em>Mawlid</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We follow the Salaf; so what was permissible for them is what is permissible for us, and it is known that following them should be in following their sources and their pathways to watering holes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘al-Hukm al-Haqq fee al-Hihteefal biMawlid sayyid al-Khalq’  p.16</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   Hafidh Abu Fadl bin Hajr al-Asqalani who died in the year (852 A.H.) said in his <em>Fatawa</em> about celebrating the <em>Mawlid</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The origin of celebrating the <em>Mawlid</em> is a Bida’.  It has not been conveyed from anyone from the Salaf as-Salih of the first three generations.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘Hasan al-maqasid fee Amal al-Mawlid’ by Suyootee. &amp; From: ‘Rasil fee Hukm al-Ihteefal bil-Mawlid an-Nabawi’ Vol.2 p.444</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   As-Sakhawi said in his <em>Fatawa</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Celebrating the noble <em>Mawlid</em> has not been conveyed from anyone of the Salaf as-Salih from the first three excellent generations, rather it was invented after them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘Subal al-Huda wa Rashad Fee Seerat Khair al-Abaad’ by Muhammad bin Yusuf Salih p.439 &amp; From: ‘Rasil fee Hukm al-Ihteefal bil-Mawlid an-Nabawi’ Vol.2 p.444</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Not From the Way of the Arabs</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   As-Sayyid ‘Alee Fikri who died in the year (1372 A.H.) in the sixteenth lecture of the book ‘al-Muhadaraat al-Fikreeyah’ (p.128):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It was not from the ways of the Arabs that they would celebrate the date of birth of anyone from amongst them and it was not the way of the Muslims – in the times that have preceded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is mentioned in the books of history – and in other books – that the practice of celebrating the <em>Mawlid</em> of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> is from the innovated ways.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘al-Hukm al-Haqq fee al-Hihteefal biMawlid sayyid al-Khalq’  p.17</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   The ‘Allaama ash-Shaykh Abdul Lateef bin Abdur Rahman bin Hasan bin Imaam Muhammad bin AbdulWahhab said explaining the <em>Da’wah</em> of Imaam Muhammad bin AbdulWahhab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Muhammad bin AbdulWahhab criticized what the people were doing in that and other countries, from proclaiming the greatness of the <em>Mawlid</em> and the Eid celebrations of <em>Jahileeyah</em> for which there was no revealed authority raising its status and for which there was no<em>Sharia’</em> evidence or proof; because in those celebrations and in their time and place is resemblance of the misguided Christians’ Eid celebrations and it is falsehood and rejected in the <em>Sharia’</em> of the leader of the Messengers.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from ‘Majmoo’ ar-Risail wal-Masail an-Najdeeyah’ Vol.4 p.440 &amp; ‘Durrar as-Saneeyah’ Vol.4 p.409 &amp; From: ‘Rasil fee Hukm al-Ihteefal bil-Mawlid an-Nabawi’ Vol.2 p.438</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The best of generations and the best of the people of knowledge did not </strong>celebrate the<strong> <em>Mawlid</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   Shaykh Zuhair ad-Deen Jafar at-Tazmantee who died in the year (682 A.H.) said clarifying the ruling of Mawlid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This action was not performed by the Salaf as-Salih in the early period, even though they revered the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>greatly, those whose love for him was so great that if you were togather our love for him, it would not reach the amount of love of even one of them for him, not even a fraction of it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this is a principle which is free from a need for elaboration and it is not in need of any form of evidence, since the Salaf were more knowledgeable and more pious, nobler and more guided.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘al-Hukm al-Haqq fee al-Hihteefal biMawlid sayyid al-Khalq’ p.18</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   The Imam Ibn Katheer ad-Damishqi ash-Shaafia’e who died in the year (774A.H.) said in his ‘Tafseer’ (13/12)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Explaining the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And those who disbelieve (strong and wealthy) say of those who believe (weak and poor): ‘Had it been a good thing, they (weak and poor) would not have preceded us thereto!’ &gt;&gt; [al-Ahqaaf: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Which means that they – the unbelievers – said about those who believed in the Qur’aan, ‘that if the Qur’aan was good then they would not have preceded us to it;’ meaning by this Bilaal, ‘Ammar, Suhaib, Khabbab – and their likes, their peers from the weak, the male-slaves and female slaves.  That was only because they believed, with regard to themselves that they had a high rank with Allaah and that He had concern for them!!  But they were mistaken, horrendously mistaken!  They clearly erred!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Thus We have tried some of them with others, that they might say: ‘Is it these (poor believers) that Allaah has favoured from amongst us?’ &gt;&gt; [An’aam: 53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means: they are amazed; ‘How were these people guided and not us?!’  That is why the disbelievers said: &lt;&lt; ‘Had it been a good thing, they (theweak and poor) would not have preceded us thereto!’&gt;&gt; [al-Ahqaaf: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jamaah they say about every action and statement – which is not proven from the Companions – that it is a Bida’, since if it was good they would have preceded us to it, because they did not leave anything of the qualities of good except that they hastened to it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘al-Hukm al-Haqq fee al-Hihteefal biMawlid sayyid al-Khalq’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Principles of Loving according to the <em>Sharia’</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The claim of those who celebrate <em>Mawlid</em> is that they do it due to the love of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>-.  This is a false claim since the evidence for love is to follow and not to go beyond limits in matters just as Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Say: ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me &gt;&gt; [Al-Imraan: 31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah – Subhanahu – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; So stand (ask Allaah to make) firm and straight (on the religion of Islaamic Monotheism) as you are commanded and those who turn in repentance (unto Allaah) with you, and transgress not. Verily, He is All-Seer of what you do.  &gt;&gt; [Hud: 112]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Katheer said in his ‘Tafseer’ (1/358) explaining the first<em>Ayah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This <em>Ayah</em> is a ruling upon everyone who claims the love of Allaah – while he is not upon the way of the Prophet –that he is a liar in his claim unless he follows the legislation of Muhammad and the Prophetic religion in all his sayings and actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As is established in ‘the Saheeh’ on the authority of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> that he said: ‘Whoever does an action which we have not commanded then it will be rejected.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why Allaah said &lt;&lt;Say: ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me&gt;&gt; [Al-Imraan: 31] which means: you achieve more than what you request due to your love for Him, which is Him loving you, which is greater than the former.  Also, as some of the scholars and wise-people said: ‘The issue is not whether you love Him; rather the issue is whether you are loved.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan al-Basri and others from amongst the Salaf have said: ‘A people claimed that they loved Allaah; so Allaah tried them with this<em>Aayah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Say: ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me, Allaah will love you and forgive you of your sins.  And Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.’&gt;&gt;[Al-Imraan: 31]’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Qadi ‘Ayyaad mentioned in ‘Shifaa bi Haqqooq al-Mustafaa’ (2/24): ‘Know that whoever loves something then he follows it and he follows that which it agrees upon otherwise he will not be truthful in his love and will be a mere claimant.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the one who is truthful in his love for the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> is the one who makes those signs outwardly manifest; the first of which is taking the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> as an example, implementing his Sunnah, following his sayings and actions, fulfilling his commands, keeping away from what he prohibited and to follow his character in ease and hardship and in times of strength and weakness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof for this is Allaah’s -Ta’ala – saying: &lt;&lt;Say: ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me, Allaah will love you&gt;&gt; i.e. following what Allaah legislated above his own desires making his desires in agreement with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala- said: &lt;&lt; and they have no jealousy in their hearts for that which they have been given (from the booty of Banî An-Nadîr), and give them (the emigrants) preference over themselves, even though they were in need of that. &gt;&gt; [Hashr : 9]’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘al-Hukm al-Haqq fee al-Hihteefal biMawlid sayyid al-Khalq’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and blessings be upon our final</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Prophet Muhammad, his</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">family, his companions</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and all those who</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">follow his</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Imaam Ibn Katheer mentioned his biography in ‘al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah’ (18/370): ‘Shaykh, al-Imaam, possessor of skills…..distinguished &amp; advanced in the knowledge of Arabic grammar –  &amp; other sciences – …’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Farhoon al-Malikee said in ‘ad-Deebaaj al-Madhab’ (2/80): ‘He was a scholar, respected, had many skills in hadeeth, Fiqh, al-Usool, Arabic, literature….’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Ustadh Muhammad bin Muhammad Makhloof mentioned in his biography in the book ‘Shajaratul noor az-Zakeeyah’ : (1/247) saying: ‘He was the Imaam of Garnaatah (a city in Andalus) he was its Muhaddith, its Mufti… he was a Faqihi, scholar, a righteous exemplary…’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]Here we can say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every good is in the following of the Salaf * and every evil is in the innovations of the Khalaf</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The transliteration of which is: ‘Kullu khairin fee ittiba’ man Salaf * wa Kullu Sharrin fee Ibtida’ man Khallaf’ (T.N.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> The First Point: </strong></span></p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">No authentic proof has been related affirming the specific date of al-Israa&#8217; wal-Mi&#8217;raaj.</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Al-Imaam Ibn Taymiyyah stated, as in &#8220;Zaad al Ma&#8217;ad,&#8221; 58/1: &#8220;No known proof has been established. Neither concerning its month, which part of the month it was in nor its specific date. Rather, what has been narrated related to all of this has been narrated with conflicting narrations and with discontinuous chains of narrations and thus none of them can be affirmed with surety.</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">● Ash-Shareef Ibn al-Ameer as-San&#8217;aanee said in &#8220;At-Tanweer&#8221;, 7710: &#8220;It is a specific night yet nothing from the authentic Sunnah has been narrated specifying when exactly it is.&#8221;</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> The Second Point: </strong></span></p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">The scholars have differed concerning the time of its occurance and there are numerous opinions regarding this.</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">It is said that it is in Rajab. It is said that it is in Rabee al-Awwal, just as it is said it is in Rabee ath-Thaani.</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">It is also said that it is in Ramadhaan and it is said that it is in Shawwal. Also, it is said that it is in Dhil Qa&#8217;dah.</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Some of them say it was in the begining of the month, others say the middle and others say the later part of the month.</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Many of the scholars have pointed out these conflicting views:</p>
<ul>
<li style="color:#444444;"><span style="color:#444444;">From the Hanafis: al-Mulla &#8216;Ali Qaaree and Abu al-Fadhl al-Aloosee</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#444444;">From the Maalikis: Ibn &#8216;Abdil Barr and Abu &#8216;Abdillah al-Qurtubee</span></li>
<li>From the Shaafi&#8217;ees: an-Nawawee, Ibn Katheer and Ibn Hajr al-Asqalaanee</li>
<li>From the Hanbalis: Ibn al-Jawzee and al-&#8216;Uthaymeen.</li>
</ul>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Third Point: </strong></span></p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">The weakest position with regards to specifying (when it took place) is the position which posits that it was in the month of Rajab.</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Abu al-Khattaab Ibn Dahiyah al-Maaliki stated in &#8220;Adaa mal Wajab min Bayyan Wadh&#8217;i al Waadh&#8217;iyoon fi Rajab,&#8221; pg. 110: &#8220;Some of the storytellers mention that al-Israa&#8217; was in Rajab and according to the people of Praise and Criticism (Scholars of Hadeeth) this is without a doubt a lie.&#8221;</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Also, Ibn al-&#8216;Attar ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee mentioned in &#8220;Hukm Sawm Rajab wa Sha&#8217;baan wa Maa Ahdatha Feehima&#8221;, pg.34: &#8220;From those who considered the hadeeth of al-Israa&#8217; and al-Mi&#8217;raaj happening on the 27th to be weak include:</p>
<ul>
<li style="color:#444444;"><span style="color:#444444;">From the Maalikis: Abu al-Khattaab al-Kalbee</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#444444;">From the Shaafi&#8217;ees: Ibn al-&#8216;Attar, Ibn Katheer and Ibn Hajr al-Asqalaanee</span></li>
<li>From the Hanbalis: Ibn Taymiyyah, Ibn Rajab, Ibn Baaz and al-&#8216;Uthaymeen.</li>
</ul>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fourth Point:</strong></span></p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Celebrating the rememberance of al-Israa&#8217; and al-Mi&#8217;raaj has not been narrated from the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم, nor his Companions, nor the Taabi&#8217;een, nor the Taabi&#8217; at-Taabi&#8217;een, nor was it an action of the Imaams of the well known madhaahib: Abu Haneefah, Maalik, ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee or Ahmad.</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">The previously mentioned individuals are the example for the individual who does not celebrate al-Israa&#8217; wal-Mi&#8217;raaj.</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">However, concerning the one who celebrates it, who is his example in doing such?</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Without a doubt, his example is the Raafidhah Shi&#8217;a and those who follow them from the extremist Sufis!</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifth Point: </strong></span></p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Whoever has the zeal and vigor to do good deeds and to increase in doing such, then let him ask himself:</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">&#8220;How many actions of obedience have clearly come in the Qur&#8217;aan and authentic Sunnah and I do not do them, nor do I exert myself in trying to do so?</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Verily, it is shameful that I fall short and am lazy in those acts of worship which have come in the Qur&#8217;aan and authentic Sunnah, yet I exert myself in that which has neither come in the Qur&#8217;aan or authentic Sunnah, nor did the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم or his Companions who came after him do so!&#8221;</p>
<p style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"><em>Summarized from the book &#8220;At-Tadhkeer al-Baahith bi Annhu Laa Yasihu fi Tahdeed Taareekh Haaditha al-Israa&#8217; wal-Mi&#8217;raaj Athar wa Laa Hadeeth&#8221; by Shaykh &#8216;Abdul Qaadir al-Junayd.  </em><em>Translated by Abu Afnaan Muhammad &#8216;Abdullah</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">By the Shaykh &#8211; the noble Scholar &#8211; &#8216;Abdul-Azeez bin Baaz [1]<br />
Al-Istiqaamah Issue No.3 &#8211; Rabî&#8217;ul-Awwal 1417H / August 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah and the blessing of Allaah and His peace be upon the Messenger, and upon his Family, his Companions and all those who follow his guidance. After that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible to celebrate <i>Milaadun-Nabee</i> (the birthday of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>), nor the birthday of anyone else, since this is from the acts of <i>bid&#8217;ah</i> (innovations) that have been newly-invented into the religion. 2 Neither did Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, nor the Rightly-Guided <i>Khaleefahs</i> (Successors), nor the Companions, may Allaah be please with them all, nor any of their followers from the first three excellent generations, celebrate this day &#8211; and they were the most knowledgeable of people concerning the <i>Sunnah</i> (the Prophetic guidance), and had the greatest love for Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and were the foremost in following his <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i> (Prescribed Laws).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been authentically established from the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> that he said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever introduces into this affair of ours, that which is not part of it, will have it rejected.&#8221;</i> 3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another authentic narration, he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Hold fast to my Sunnah (guidance) and the way of the Rightly-Guided Khaleefahs after me, cling to it tightly. And beware of newly-invented matters, for every newly-invented matter is an innovation, and every innovation is misguidance.&#8221;</i> 4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these two narrations contain a strong warning against innovations in the religion, and acting upon them. This is why Allaah &#8211; the One free of all defects &#8211; says in His Clear Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And whatever the Messenger gives you, take it. Whatever he forbids you from, then keep away from it.&#8221; </b>[Soorah al-Hadeed 59:7].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Let those beware who withstand the command of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, unless some trials and afflictions befall them, or unless they are afflicted with a painful punishment.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Noor 24:63].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And the first to embrace Islaam from the <i>Muhaajirs</i> and the <i>Ansaar</i>, and those who followed them in goodness, beliefs and actions. Allaah is well-pleased with them, and they are well-pleased with Him. He has prepared for them Gardens of Paradise, beneath which rivers flow, to live therein forever. That is the supreme achievement.&#8221;</b> [Soorah at-Tawbah 9:100].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen Islaam as your way of life.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:3].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The verses with this meaning are plenty. So to accept this celebration, or any other newly-invented act of worship, implies that Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; did not complete and perfect the religion for this Ummah, and that the Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> did not completely convey to his Ummah what was necessary regarding their duties, until the advent of those who came later and innovated in the religion of Allaah that for which they had no permission, claiming that they would draw closer to Allaah by such innovations. And this &#8211; without doubt &#8211; is a great danger and amounts to criticising Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; and His Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. For Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects &#8211; has indeed perfected this religion for His servants, and has completed His favour upon them. And the Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> has clearly conveyed the Message, not leaving any way that leads to Paradise, nor any way that distances a person from the Fire, except that he explained it to his Ummah. This has been established in an authentic narration, from &#8216;Abdullaah ibn &#8216;Amr <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i>, in which Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Allaah did not send any Prophet except that it was his duty to inform his Ummah of the good that he knew, and to warn them about the evils that he knew.&#8221;</i> 5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is known that our Prophet <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> is the best of all the Prophets and the last of them and the most perfect of them with regards to conveying the Message and advising the people. So if celebrating his <i> milaad</i> (birthday) was a part of the religion that Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect chose, then the Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> would have most certainly explained it to his Ummah, or he would have celebrated it himself, or his noble Companions <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhum</i> would have celebrated it. However, since nothing like this happened, then we know that the celebration of <i> milaad</i> has nothing to do with Islaam whatsoever. Rather, it is from those innovations which the Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> warned his Ummah from, as has been shown in the preceding narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is another authentic narration similar in meaning to the two preceding ones, and it is his <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s</i> saying in his <i> Jumu&#8217;ah khutbah</i> (Friday sermon):<i> &#8220;Indeed the best speech is the Book of Allaah, and the best guidance and example is that of Muhammad sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam. And the worst affairs are the newly-invented ones, and every newly-invented matter is an innovation, and every innovation is misguidance.&#8221;</i> 6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this, a group of the Scholars rejected the practice of <i>milaad</i> and warned against it, acting upon the aforementioned proofs, and their like. However, some of the later Scholars differed, in that they have allowed such a practice, providing it does not entail any sinful and evil matters; such as exaggerating in the praise of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, or free-mixing between men and women, or the playing of musical instruments and singing, and other such matters which are rejected by the pure <i> Sharee&#8217;ah</i> (Prescribed Law). They think that such a practice is a <i> bid&#8217;ah hasanah</i> (a good innovation in the religion). 7 However, the <i> Sharee&#8217;ah</i> principle is: whenever any dispute arises amongst the people, then the issue should be referred back to the Book of Allaah and to the Sunnah of His Messenger, Muhammad <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;O you who believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger and those in authority amongst you. If you differ in anything amongst yourselves, then refer it back for judgment to Allaah and His Messenger, if you do truly believe in Allaah and the Last Day. That is better and more befitting for final determination.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:59].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And in whatever you differ, the judgement is with Allaah.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ash-Shooraa 42:10].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if we refer this issue &#8211; about the validity of celebrating <i> milaad</i> &#8211; back to the Book of Allaah, we find that the Book (i.e. the Qur&#8217;aan) commands us to follow the Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> in that which he brought, and it warns us against that which he prohibited. It also informs us that Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; has perfected the religion of Islaam for this Ummah. Thus, from this angle, there is nothing in what the Messenger came with concerning this celebration, and therefore it cannot be part of the religion which Allaah perfected for us and ordered us to adhere to by following the Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then if we turn to the <i> Sunnah</i> of the Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> we do not find in it that he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> celebrated his own birthday, nor ordered its celebration, nor do we find any of the Companions <i> radiallaahu &#8216;anhum</i> celebrating it! Therefore, it will be absolutely clear to anyone who has the slightest insight and is desirous of truth and justice, that the practice of celebrating the <i> Milaadun-Nabee</i> (the birthday of the Prophet) is not part of t he religion, rather it is a <i> bid&#8217;ah</i> (innovation) which we have been warned against and ordered to abandon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also a form of blind imitation of the Jews and Christians in their festivals. Therefore, the sensible person should not be deceived by the large number of people, from the various lands, who practice this, since the truth is not known by mere numbers, but the truth is known by the <i> Sharee&#8217;ah</i> proofs. Allaah &#8211; the Most High said concerning the Jews and the Christians:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And they say: None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian! These are their own desires. Say to them: Bring your proof if you are indeed truthful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:111].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And if you were to obey most of those on earth, they would mislead you far away from Allaah&#8217;s path.&#8221; </b>[Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:116].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most of these <i>milaad</i> celebrations &#8211; as well as being an innovation &#8211; involve other types of evils as well; such as the free-mixing between men and women, singing and playing musical instruments, and the drinking and smoking of intoxicants. There are in such celebrations, something which is worse than all this, and it is the greater form of shirk (associating partners in the worship of Allaah), through exaggerating about Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, or the dead awliyaa (pious servants of Allaah), by supplicating to them, seeking their aid and help, or by believing that they have the knowledge of the <i> ghayb</i> (hidden Unseen), and other such matters of <i>kufr</i> (disbelief). Whereas it is authentically related from Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> that he said: <i> &#8220;Beware of ghuloo (exaggeration) in the religion. For indeed those who came before you were destroyed due to their exaggerating in the religion.&#8221;</i> 8 And he <i>&#8216;alayhis-salaatu was-salaam</i> also said:<i> &#8220;Do not over-elevate me as the Christians over-elevated Jesus, Son of Mary, but rather I am just a slave of Allaah. So call me the slave of Allaah and His Messenger.&#8221;</i> 9</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the strangest matters is that a great number of people who actively participate in this innovated celebration, and who defend it vigorously, do not take care of fulfilling those matters which Allaah has made obligatory upon them, such as praying the five daily Prayers, and this does not even bother many of them at all. Indeed many of them do not even think that they are committing a great sin! There is no doubt that this is due to their weak <i> eemaan</i> (faith) and their short sightedness and the Fact that their hearts are covered with the filth of sins and disobedience. We ask Allaah to protect and forgive us and all of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the strangest matters also is that some of them believe that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> is actually present at their <i> milaad</i> celebrations, so consequently the participants stand to greet and welcome him. However, this is from the greatest of lies and the worst form of ignorance, because the Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> shall neither come out of his grave before the Day of Judgement, nor will he meet anyone, nor attend their gatherings. Rather, he shall remain in his grave until the Day of Judgement, whilst his noble <i>rooh</i> (soul) resides in the highest of places with his Lord in the home of the exalted, as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Then you shall surely die, then you shall be raised-up again on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Mu&#8217;minoon 23:15-16].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said: &#8220;I will be the leader of the children of Aadam on the Day of Resurrection, and I will be the first for whom the earth will split open, and will be the first to intercede and the first whose intercession will be accepted.&#8221; 10</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this noble <i> aayah</i> (verse) and this noble <i> hadeeth</i> &#8211; and those verses and <i> ahaadeeth</i> with a similar meaning &#8211; prove that the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and others that have also died, will only come out of their graves on the Day of Resurrection. And this is a matter about which there is an agreement amongst the Muslim Scholars, there being no difference between them. So it is a must upon every Muslim, to carefully consider these matters and to beware of those innovations and deviations that have been introduced by the ignorant ones and their like, for which Allaah has not sent down any authority. It is Allaah&#8217;s help that is sought, and He alone is relied upon, and there is no might, nor any power, except with Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for sending the <i> salaah</i> and the <i> salaam</i> (invoking praises and blessings of peace) upon Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, then this is from one of the best ways of drawing closer to Allaah and from those actions which are righteous. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed Allaah sends His <i>salaah</i> upon the Prophet (i.e. Allaah praises the Prophet to the angels), as do the angels (by supplicating for forgiveness for him) O you who Believe! Send your <i> salaah</i> upon him and invoke the best <i> salaam</i> (blessings of peace) for him.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:56].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said</i>: &#8220;Whosoever sends a single blessing upon me, then Allaah will send upon him ten blessings.&#8221; 11 So this is prescribed at all times, particularly at the end of every Prayer. Rather, a group from the people of Knowledge actually consider it obligatory in the final sitting of every Prayer, and consider it highly recommended at other times, such as after the <i> adhaan</i> (call to Prayer), and after mentioning the Prophet, <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s</i> name, and also on the day of <i>Jumu&#8217;ah</i> (Friday), as is proven by the various authentic narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah help us and all the Muslims to attain a sound understanding of the religion, and that He favours us all by causing us to cling to the <i> Sunnah</i> and causing us to beware of <i>bid&#8217;ah</i> (innovations in the religion). Indeed He is the Most Generous, the Most Kind. And may the <i>salaah</i> and <i> salaam</i> (Allaah&#8217;s praises and blessings of peace) be upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his Family, his Companions and his followers.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <i>At-Tahdheer minal-Bid&#8217;ah</i> (pp.3-6) of Shaykh Ibn Baaz.<br />
2. Ash-Shaatibee said in <i>al-&#8216;ltisaam</i> (1/33), about the technical definition of the word <i> bid&#8217;ah</i> (innovations): &#8220;A newly invented way in the Religion, in imitation of, or corresponding to the <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i>, through which nearness to Allaah is sought. Such action is not supported by any authentic proof &#8211; neither the action itself, nor the way in which it is performed.&#8221;<br />
3. Related by al-Bukhaaree (2/166) and Muslim (5/133), from &#8216;Aaishah <i> radiallaahu &#8216;anhaa</i>.<br />
4. <b>Saheeh</b>: Related by Ahmad (4/126) and Abu Daawood (no.4607), from al-&#8216;lrbaad ibn Saariyah radiallaahu &#8216;anhu. It was declared authentic by al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr in <i> Takhreej Ahaadeeth Mukhtasar-Ibnul-Haajib</i> (1/137).<br />
5. Related by Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 1844).<br />
6. Related by Muslim (6/153), from Jaabir ibn &#8216;Abdullaah <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i>.<br />
7. Refer to the following article in refutation of this concept.<br />
8. Saheeh: Related by Ahmad (1/215) and Ibn Maajah (no.3064), from Ibn &#8216;Abbaas <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i>. It was authenticated by al-Haafidh Ibn Taymiyyah in <i>Majmoo&#8217;ul-Fataawaa</i> (3/383).<br />
9. Related by al-Bukhaaree (no.3445) and Muslim (no.1691), from &#8216;Umar <i> radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i>.<br />

11. Related by Muslim (no.408), from Abu Hurayrah <i> radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Original State</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Battah relates in <i>Ibaanah</i> (no.136), that the noble Scholar and <i>taabi&#8217;ee</i>. Abul-&#8216;Aaliyah (d.90H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Learn Islaam. Then when you have learnt Islaamic do not turn away from it to the right, nor the left. But be upon the Straight Path and upon the Sunnah of your Prophet sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam and that which his Companions were upon and beware of these innovations because they cause hatred and enmity amongst you. But stick to the original state of affairs which was there before they divided.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (radhiyAllahu ‘anhumaa)</em> reported, “The Messenger of <strong>Allah</strong> <em>(sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em>observed <em>Saum</em> (fasting) on the day of <em>‘Ashoora </em>and commanded us to fast on this day.” [Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><em>Abu Qatadah (radhiyAllahu ‘anhu)</em> reported, The Messenger of <strong>Allah</strong> <em>(sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em> was asked about observing <em>As-Saum</em> (the fast) on the tenth day of <em>Muharram</em>, and he replied, &#8220;It is an expiation for the sins of the preceding year.&#8221; [Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (radhiyAllahu ‘anhumaa)</em> reported, The Messenger of <strong>Allah</strong> <em>(sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em> said, &#8220;If I remain alive till the next year, I shall also observe fast on the ninth of <em>Muharram</em>.&#8221; [Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Despite these clear cut ahadeeth, there are many accursed innovations practiced on this day particularly by the Shi’a who claim to mourn the murder of <em>al-Husayn</em> <em>(radhiyAllahu ‘anhu)</em> by performing acts which blatantly oppose the <em>Sunnah</em> of the Messenger <em>(sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reiterating this point, <em>Shaykh Ibn Baaz (rahimahullah)</em> stated, “Again, mourning on the Day of<em> ‘Ashoora</em>` is one of the condemned Bid‘ahs introduced by <em>ar-Raafidhah</em>, with which they contradicted <em>Ahlus Sunnah wal-Jamaa‘ah</em> (those adhering to the <em>Sunnah</em> and the <em>Muslim</em> main body), and the path of the <em>Sahaabah</em>(Companions of the Prophet). Consequently, it is not permissible to imitate them in this matter.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reference: Ibn Baaz, &#8216;Abdul &#8216;Azeez. &#8220;Hadith: Anyone who bathes on the Day of â€˜Ashuraâ will not be sick during that whole year.&#8221; The General Presidency of Scholarly Research and Ifta.<a href="http://alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Page&amp;PageID=154&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=10" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://alifta.net</a>  (accessed November 6, 2013).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh ‘Abdullah an-Najmi (hafidhahullah)</em> will clarify for us the established <em>Sunan</em> of the day of <em>‘Ashoora</em>`and by the Permission of <strong>Allah</strong> refute the acts of innovation associated with it according to the <em>Qur&#8217;aan</em> and<em>Sunnah</em> upon on the understanding of the <em>Salaf-us-Saalih</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask <strong>Allah</strong> to guide us to all that He loves and is pleased with and that He protects us from falling into innovation in the <em>Deen</em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Scholar</strong>: Imâm Muhammad bin Sâlih bin ´Uthaymîn<br />
<strong>Source</strong>: islamcast.wordpress.com/2009/03/29<br />
<strong>Reference</strong>: Darulhadith.com<br />
<strong>Translation &amp; video:</strong> aFatwa.com</p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymîn:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I warn my Muslim brothers against what some stupid people do when they narrate april jokes. This lie have they taken from the jews, the christians, fire-worshipers (Majûs) and other disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Not only is this act a lie, which is in itself forbidden according to the Sharî’ah, it also involves imitating the disbelievers, which is forbidden. The prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Whoever imitates a people belongs to them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh-ul-Islâm Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullâh) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“Its chain of narration is good.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The least one could say is that it is forbidden, even if it seemingly entails disbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Together with these two sins, the Muslim becomes humiliated before his enemy. It is generally known that the one who is imitated boasts before the imitator and sees himself as being in front of him. The imitator thus becomes weak so that he imitates him. The believer thusly becomes degraded since he subjugates himself and follows the disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth sin is that this filthy lie is often about taking someone else’s money unjustly and scaring the Muslims. They maybe lie and tell the family that they will be having guests. As a result thereof they prepare a great meal and meat and the like. They might also lie and tell them horrifying news of a relative being run over by a car or the like. This is not allowed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Fatwa no. 21203<br />
Fatwa from Permanent Committee :</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question</strong> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Some people celebrate Valentine&#8217;s Day on February 14 by exchanging red roses, dressing in red, and congratulating one another on that day. Some cake shops make heart-shaped cakes in red and draw hearts on them and other shops advertise special items on sale for this day. What is your opinion on: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>First</strong>: Celebrating this day?</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Second</strong>: Buying from these stores on this day? </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Third</strong>: Shop owners who do not celebrate this day selling gifts to be given by those who do celebrate it? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">May Allah reward you with the best!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The clear-cut evidence from the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah, upon which the <em>Salaf</em> (righteous predecessors) of this <em>Ummah</em> (nation based on one creed) unanimously agreed, confirms that there are only two <em>Eids</em> (festivals) in Islam: <em>Eid-ul-Fitr</em> (the Festival of Breaking the Fast) and <em>Eid-ul-Adha</em> (the Festival of the Sacrifice). Any other festival, whether peculiar to a person, a group, an event, or any other reason, is an invented festival that is not permissible for Muslims to celebrate, approve of, enjoy, or support in any way, because this is considered to be a transgression of the Limits of Allah.  Anyone who transgresses the limits set by Allah has wronged themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we add to this fabricated festival the fact that it is one of the festivals of the <em>Kafirs</em> (disbelievers), this heaps sin upon sin, because it entails resembling them and is a type of support of them. Allah (may He be Glorified) forbids the <em>Mumins</em> (believers), in His Ever-Glorious Book, from imitating or supporting the <em>Kafirs</em>. It is authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Anyone who imitates a people is one of them</strong></span>.&#8221; (Abu Dawud, Sunan, Book on clothing, no. 4031; Ahmad, Musnad, vol. 2, p. 50). Valentine&#8217;s Day falls under this heading, as it is one of the idolatrous Christian festivals. It is not lawful for a Muslim who believes in Allah and the Last Day to celebrate, approve of, or congratulate people on it; it is forbidden to them. Rather, it is obligatory for them to ignore and avoid it, in obedience to Allah and His Messenger and to keep away from that which will arouse Allah&#8217;s Anger and incur Punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is also <em>Haram</em> (prohibited) for Muslims to support this festival or any other <em>Haram</em> festival by any means, whether by supplying food or drinks; selling, buying, manufacturing, gift-giving, correspondence, advertising etc., because all this comes under cooperating in sin and transgression and disobeying Allah and His Messenger. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Help you one another in <em>Al-Birr</em> and <em>At-Taqwa</em> </strong>(virtue, righteousness and piety)<strong>; but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is Severe in punishment.&#8221;</strong></span> (Surah Al-Ma&#8217;idah, 5: 2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory for Muslims to adhere to the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah in all matters, especially in times of <em>Fitnah</em> (trial) when corruption is widespread. They must be sagacious enough and on their guard to avoid falling into the misguidance of those who have earned Allah&#8217;s Anger, those who went astray, or the <em>Fasiqs</em> (those flagrantly violating Islamic law) who have no fear of Allah nor have pride in being Muslims. Muslims should resort to Allah, asking for guidance and steadfastness in Islam, as it is Allah Alone Who guides and keeps us steadfast.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, and his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fatwa no. 21079</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: On 12/8/1420 A.H. notices were placed on the roads of Riyadh conveying congratulations from the Banque Saudi Fransi on the <span id="ContentParagraph" style="font-family:tahoma;">New Year</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Employees of the Banque Saudi Fransi wish the Saudi people a merry year. Respected shaykh, it undoubtedly hurts every Muslim to find things like this common in the land of Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah/monotheism) and Al-Haramayn Al-Sharifayn (the Two Sacred Mosques, the Sacred Mosque in Makkah and the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque in Madinah).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">I hope that Your Honor will clarify the ruling of Islam on this matter.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A Muslim is prohibited to congratulate the disbelievers, Christians, Jews or whomever, on their distinctive occasions. This involves a sort of agreeing with them on their falsehood and being loyal to them. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Similarly, a Muslim is prohibited to congratulate his Muslim brother on the feasts and celebrations of the disbelievers. By doing so, a Muslim imitates them.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslims must resent disbelievers, dissociate themselves from them and hate their disbelief and disobedience to Allah, as Allah (Exalted be He) states,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />It was authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><strong>Anyone who imitates a people becomes one of them</strong>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph">the Shaykh of Islam Ibn Taymiyyah </span>commented on this Hadith saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>This Hadith at least implies that it is prohibited for a Muslim to imitate the disbelievers though it apparently signifies the disbelief of the imitator</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) states,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;and if any amongst you takes them as Auliyâ’, then surely he is one of them</span>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">You (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will not find any people who believe in Allâh and the Last Day, making friendship with those who oppose Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم)</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) states,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5: 51" target="_blank" rel="nofollow' id=" name="Oyouwhobelieve!Takenotthe"></a><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Auliyâ’ (friends, protectors, helpers), they are but Auliyâ’ of each other. And if any amongst you takes them as Auliyâ’, then surely he is one of them. Verily, Allâh guides not those people who are the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers and unjust)</span>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, <span style="color:#ff0000;">Muslims are not permitted to express joy or congratulate disbelievers on their festive occasions, whether by word of mouth, posters, newspapers, magazines, cards or the like</span>. The legal authorities must remove these notices.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success . May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

Fatwas of Ibn Baz, Volume 1, Warning against Bid’ahs,<br />
Third Treatise: Ruling on celebrating the night before the fifteenth of Sha’ban,<br />
Page No. 186 – 192, <a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Page&amp;PageID=39&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=14" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">alifta.net</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allah Who has perfected the religion for us and has completed the favor upon us! Peace and blessings of Allah be upon His Prophet and Messenger Muhammad, the Prophet of repentance and mercy!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed: Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<span style="color:#008000;">This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion</span>”</strong> [al-Maa’idah 5:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<span style="color:#008000;">Or have they partners (with Allah — false gods) who have instituted for them a religion which Allah has not ordained?</span>”</strong> [al-Shooraa 42:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, it is reported in the two the Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) from ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“Anyone who introduces anything into this matter of ours (Islam) that is not part of it will have it rejected”</em></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, it is reported in the Sahih of Muslim from Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to address people in the Friday Sermon by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“<span style="color:#008000;">To proceed, the best of speech is the Book of Allah, the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the most evil of matters are those which are newly-introduced in religion, and every Bid’ah (innovation in religion) is Dalalah (a deviation from what is right)</span>.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many other Qur’anic verses and Hadiths to the same effect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All these verses and Hadiths clearly indicate that Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) has perfected for this Ummah (nation based on one creed) its religion and has completed upon it His Favor and did not cause His Prophet (peace be upon him) to die until he had conveyed the clear message, explained to the Ummah all what Allah has legislated for it of sayings and actions and he (peace be upon him) had pointed out that all what the people innovate after him and relate to the religion of Islam of sayings and actions are Bid’ah (innovation in religion) rejected to those who innovate it, even if done with good intention. The Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and the scholars of Islam after them had realized this matter, and thus, they denied such innovations in religion and warned against them as mentioned by all the scholars who wrote about the great status of the Sunnah (supererogatory act of worship following the example of the Prophet) and the denial of Bid’ah, such as Ibn Waddah, At-Tartushy, Abu Shamah and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">From the Bid’ah which have been introduced into the religion by people is the Bid’ah of celebrating the Mid-Sha’ban night and fasting on its day, and there is no reliable evidence for such actions. There are weak Hadiths reported with regard to the virtue of the Mid-Sha’ban night, but it is not allowed to rely on them as evidence. As for what is reported regarding the virtue of praying during the Mid-Sha’ban night, they are all fabricated Hadiths as confirmed by many Muslim scholars, and we will, Insha’a-Allah (if Allah wills), mention some of their comments on that.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Besides, there are some other narrations regarding the virtue of this night reported from the righteous predecessors of the people of Al-Sham (the Levant) and others. What the majority of Muslim scholars agreed upon is that the celebration of this Mid-Sha’ban night is Bid’ah and that the Hadiths reported regarding the virtue of this night are all weak Hadiths and some of them are fabricated Hadiths. From those who drew the attention to the weakness and fabrication of these Hadiths is Al-Hafiz ibn Rajab in his book entitled: (Lata’if Al-Ma’arif) and people other than him. It is to be noted that the weak Hadiths can be applied only in the types of worship, the origin of which have been established by sound and authentic evidence. As for celebrating the Mid-Sha’ban night, there is no sound and authentic evidence supporting it to justify reliance on the weak Hadiths in this regard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This great rule has been mentioned by Imam: Abul-’Abbas Shaykhul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy upon him). Dear reader, I will convey for you some of what the people of knowledge say about this issue in order to be on clear evidence regarding it. Moreover, the majority of Muslim scholars (may Allah have mercy upon all of them) said that it is an obligation to refer the issues what the people differ over to the Book of Allah (Exalted be He) and to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), and thus, what both these sources or either of them approve, then it is the legislation which should be followed and what contradicts them should be set aside and what is not mentioned in these two sources of worships, then it is Bid’ah which is not allowed to be practiced, let alone inviting people to it and encouraging it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority. (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم), if you believe in Allah and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination.</span>”</strong> [al-Nisaa’ 4:59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<span style="color:#008000;">And in whatsoever you differ, the decision thereof is with Allah (He is the ruling Judge)</span>.”</strong> [al-Shooraa 42:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, Allah (Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<span style="color:#008000;">Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم to mankind): “If you (really) love Allah then follow me (i.e. accept Islamic Monotheism, follow the Qur’an and the Sunnah), Allah will love you and forgive you your sins</span>.”</strong> [Aal &#8216;Imraan 3:31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<span style="color:#008000;">But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.</span>”</strong> [al-Nisaa&#8217; 4:65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition to that, there are many verses supporting this principle and they are clear evidence of the obligation to refer the debatable issues to the Book of Allah and to the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace be upon him) and the obligation to be pleased and satisfied with their rulings, and to know that this is the natural outcome of faith, the best for the slaves during this lifetime and in the Hereafter and the best in result: namely, the end result.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafiz ibn Rajab (may Allah have mercy upon him) in his book entitled: “Lata’if Al-Ma’arif” with regard to this issue – after previous similar talk – said in wording:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Regarding the Mid-Sha’ban night, the followers from the people of Al-Sham; such as Khalid ibn Ma’dan, Makhul, Luqman ibn ‘Amir and others used to exalt it and exert their efforts therein to perform more worships and people followed them with regard to its virtue and exaltation. It is said that some Israelite narrations and traditions have reached them regarding the virtue of this night, and when this became widespread in countries, people differed regarding it, and therefore, some of them accepted it and agreed with them with regard to the magnification of this night such as a group from the worshippers of the people of Basra and others. On the other hand, this act was denied by the majority of Muslim scholars of Al-Hijaz such as: ‘Ata and Ibn Abu Mulaikah, and it was transmitted by ‘Abdul-Rahman ibn Zayd ibn Aslam from the jurists of the people of Madinah, and it is the opinion of the disciples of Imam Malik and others. They said that all these acts are mere Bid’ah. However, the scholars of the people of Al-Sham differed regarding the way of celebrating it into two opinions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First:</strong> It is recommended to celebrate it collectively in the Masajid (Mosques). It is reported that Khalid ibn Ma’dan and Luqman ibn ‘Amir and others used to put on their best clothes, apply incense and kohl (antimony powder eyeliner) and spend the entire night in the Masjid. Their act was approved by Ishaq ibn Rahawyah who said about celebrating it in congregation in the Masjid, that it is not Bid’ah. This is reported by Harb Al-Kirmany in his book titled: “Al-Masa’il” (Religious Issues).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second:</strong> It is reprehensible to gather during that night in the Masjid for prayer, narrating stories and supplication, but is not reprehensible for one to pray individually during that night for himself. This is the opinion of Al-Awza’iy, who was the Imam of the people of Al-Sham, their jurist and their scholar, and this, Insha’a-Allah (if Allah wills), is the closest opinion to the truth, until he said: It is not known if Imam Ahmad said something about the Mid-Sha’ban night. There are two narrations reported from Al-Awza’iy regarding the recommendation to stay up late for prayer during the Mid-Sha’ban night relying on the two narrations reported from Imam Ahmad regarding staying up late for Prayer during the two nights of ‘Eid. In one narration, he did not recommend staying up late in congregational prayer during the two nights of ‘Eid because it was not reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) or from his Companions that they did that. In another narration he recommended staying up late for Prayer during those nights following the act of ‘Abdul-Rahman ibn Yazid ibn Al-Aswad who was one of the Tabi’un (Followers, the generation after the Companions of the Prophet), in that. By the same token, there is no sound and authentic narration reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) nor from his Companions regarding staying up late for Prayer during the Mid-Sha’ban night. However, it is reported from a group of the Followers from among the noble jurists of the people of Al-Sham”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the end of the statement of Al-Hafiz ibn Rajab (may Allah have mercy upon him), which <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#800000;text-decoration:underline;">clearly states that no sound and authentic narration was reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) nor from his Companions (may Allah be pleased with all of them) regarding the Mid-Sha’ban night.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the opinion chosen by Al-Awza’iy (may Allah have mercy upon him) regarding the recommendation of staying up late individually for Prayer during the Mid-Sha’ban night and Al-Hafiz ibn Rajab’s preference of this opinion, it is strange and weak, because if something has not been established by the legal evidence that it is legislation, then it is not allowed for a Muslim to introduce it into the religion of Allah, whether one does it individually or in congregation, and whether one practices it secretly or openly, due to the comprehensiveness of the Prophet’s (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saying:<em><span style="color:#008000;"> Anyone who does an action which is not in accordance with this matter of ours (Islam) will have it rejected</span>.</em> and other evidence indicating the rejection of innovations in religion and warning against them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also reported from Imam Abu Bakr Al-Tartushy (may Allah have mercy upon him) in his book entitled: (Al-Hawadith Wal-Bida’) that he said in wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It is reported by Ibn Waddah from Zayd ibn Aslam that he said: ‘We have not found anyone from our Shaykhs or our jurists paying attention to the Mid-Sha’ban night. Moreover, they did not pay attention to that Hadith reported by Mak-hul and they did not consider any special virtue for this night to the exclusion of other nights.’ Moreover, it was said to Ibn Abi Mulaikah : Indeed, Ziyad An-Numairiy says: ‘Verily, the reward of the Mid-Sha’ban night is like the reward of Laylat-ul-Qadr (the Night of Decree)’, then he said: ‘If I hear him saying that and I have a staff in my hand, I will hit him’. It is noteworthy that Ziyad was a narrator of stories.” End of the statement of Abu Bakr Al-Tartushy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the erudite scholar: Al-Shawkany (may Allah bestow His mercy upon him), in his book entitled: (Al-Fawa’id Al-Majmu’ah), said in wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Hadith: O ‘Ali, whoever prays a hundred Rak’ah (a unit of the prayer) during the Mid-Sha’ban night and reads in every Rak’ah (unit of Prayer) Al-Fatihah (the Opening Chapter of the Book) and Surah Ikhlas ten times, Allah will fulfil all their needs etc., is a <span style="color:#ff0000;">fabricated Hadith</span>, and within the words of the Hadith talking about the great reward for the one who performs this Prayer there is something which does not leave any doubt for a sound-minded person to know that it is a fabricated Hadith. Moreover, its narrators are unknown and it has been reported through a second and third narrations, all of which are inserted fabrications and their narrators are unknown. It is also said in “Al-Mukhtasar” (The Concise Book of Hadith) that the Hadith of performing Prayer during the Mid-Sha’ban night is null. and what is reported by Ibn Hibban from the Hadith of ‘Ali : When the Middle Night of Sha’ban comes, observe night vigil prayer during it and fast the following day is a weak Hadith. It is said in (Al-La’ali’, “Perals”) that Praying one hundred Rak’ahs with sincerity during the Mid-Sha’ban night ten times. along with the rest of the details about its virtue, which is reported by Ad-Daylamiy and others, and this is a false Hadith, and all its narrators in the three different narrations are unknown and thier narrators are weak. He said that the Hadith: And twelve Rak’ahs in which Surah Al-Ikhlas is recited thirty times. is a fabricated Hadith, and the Hadith: and fourteen Rak’as. is also a false Hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is noted that a group of jurists had been deceived by this Hadith, such as the author of the book entitled: (Al-’Ihya’) and others, as well as some Exegetes of the Qur’an. Performing prayer on this night – namely, the Mid-Sha’ban night- has been reported in different ways, all of which are null and fabricated narrations. This does not contradict the narration reported by Al-Tirmidhiy from the Hadith of ‘Aishah regarding his (peace be upon him) going to Al-Baqi’ and the descending of the Lord to the nearest sky during the Mid-Sha’ban night and that He forgives for more than the number of the hairs of the sheep of Banu Kalb, since we are talking about this prayer which has been falsely established in that night. Moreover, the Hadith reported by ‘Aishah has weakness and its chain of transmission is interrupted and the Hadith reported by ‘Ali which has been previously mentioned with regard to staying up late during that night for Prayer does not contradict the ruling that a special Prayer during that night is falsely established, in addition to the weakness in that Hadith according to the what we have mentioned.” End of Al-Shawkany’s comment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported from<strong> Al-Hafiz Al-’Iraqy</strong> that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Hadith of performing prayer during the Mid-Sha’ban night is falsely related to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and is lying about him. Moreover, it is reported by Al-Imam Al-Nawawy that he said in the book entitled: (Al-Majmu’): ‘The Prayer known as Salat-ul-Ragha’ib (Prayer for great bounties or wishes), which is twelve Rak’ahs performed between the Maghrib (Sunset) Prayer and ‘Isha’ (Night) Prayer during the night of the first Friday of the Month of Rajab and the Prayer during the Mid-Sha’ban night, which is a hundred Rak’ahs, are two evil Bid’ahs (innovations in religion) and no one should be deceived by their mentioning in the book entitled: (Qout A-Qulub), the book entitled: (Ihya’ ‘Ulum Ad-Din) nor by the Hadith reported regarding these two nights, since all this is void and no one should be deceived by some of the Imams who got confused about their ruling and wrote some papers regarding the recommended practices during these two nights, because they made a mistake in that”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, Shaykh Imam Abu Muhammad ‘Abdul-Rahman ibn Isma’il Al-Maqdisy wrote a very valuable book regarding the falsification of the special virtues of these two nights and he did a good job in this book. Moreover, people of knowledge talked very much about this issue, and if we trace all what has been said regarding this subject and try to convey it, then we will have a very long explanation, but we hope that what we have mentioned regarding this issue will be sufficient and convincing for the seeker of truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From what has been previously mentioned of verses, Hadith and the opinions of Muslim scholars, it becomes clear to the seeker of the truth that celebrating the Mid-Sha’ban night through performing Prayer and other activities and singling out the following day with Fast is an evil Bid’ah according to the opinion of the majority of Muslim scholars. It has no foundation in the purified Islamic Shar’ (law), but it has been newly introduced into Islam after the epoch of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with all of them). It is sufficient for the seeker of truth, about this subject and other subjects, to read Allah’s (may He be Exalted and Sublime) Saying: <strong>“This day, I have perfected your religion for you”</strong> and to read other Qur’anic verses confirming this meaning, as well as the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) saying: <em>“Anyone who introduces anything into this matter of ours (Islam) that is not part of it will have it rejected”</em>, in addition to what has been reported of the Hadiths confirming this meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, it is reported in the Sahih of Muslim from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“<span style="color:#008000;">Do not single out the night (preceding) Friday among the nights for prayer and do not single out Friday among days for fasting but only when anyone among you is accustomed to fast (on dates) which coincide with this day (Friday).</span>” </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it is allowed to single out a certain night with a special worship, then the night of Friday will be more deserving of this special worship, because its day is the best day on which the sun rises according to the sound and authentic Hadith reported from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Since the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) warned against singling out this night with special Prayer to the exclusion of other nights, then it is evidence that other nights should not be singled out with a certain type of worship unless there is a sound and authentic evidence indicating such specification.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since it is ordained to stay up late for Prayer during Laylat-ul-Qadr (the Night of Decree) and during other nights of Ramadan, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) drew the attention to that, encouraged the Ummah to do that and did it himself as reported in the two Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“<span style="color:#008000;">Whoever observes Optional Night Prayer during the month of Ramadan out of sincere Faith and hoping for a reward from Allah, then all his past sins will be forgiven, and whoever stands for prayers in the night of Qadr out of sincere Faith and hoping for a reward from Allah, then all his previous sins will be forgiven</span>.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, if the Mid-Sha’ban night, the night of the first Friday of Rajab or the night of Isra’ (Night Journey) and Mi’raj (Ascension to Heaven) were singled out with a certain type of worship, then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would guide the Ummah to it or would do it himself and if something like this had happened, the Companions (may Allah be pleased with all of them) would have transmitted it to the Ummah and would not conceal it from the following generations since they were the best people and the best in giving advice after the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon all of them) and may Allah be pleased with the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and may they be pleased by Allah. You have already known from the opinions of Muslim scholars that nothing has been established from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) nor from his Companions (may Allah be pleased with all of them) regarding the virtue of the night of the first Friday of Rajab or of the Mid-Sha’ban night, and therefore, it becomes clear that celebrating both of them is a Bid’ah, newly introduced in the religion. By the same token, singling them out with a special worship is an evil Bid’ah. The same ruling applies to the twenty-seventh night of Rajab, which some people believe is the night of Al-Isra’ and Mi’raj, that it should not be singled out with a certain worship and it is not allowed to celebrate it due to the above-mentioned evidence. This is the ruling if we know when Al-Isra’ and Mi’raj happened, how will it be if this night is unknown, according to the true view of Muslim scholars, and the saying of those who claim that it is the twenty-seventh night of Rajab is a false opinion having no basis within the sound and authentic Hadith. Indeed, he is good in speech the one who says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#666699;"><em>The best affairs are those previously established on true guidance<br />
and the worst of them are the newly introduced innovations in religion</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is Allah Whom we ask to guide us and all Muslims to abide by the Sunnah, to be steadfast on it and to be cautious of what contradicts it. Indeed, He is Bounteous and Generous! May Allah send His Peace and Prayers upon His Servant and Messenger, our Prophet Muhammad, his family and all his Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Source: <a href="http://alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Page&amp;PageID=213&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=10" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">alifta.net</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: My question is about celebrating the <em>Mawlid</em> (the Prophet&#8217;s birthday). In our locality there is a custom that after three days of a person&#8217;s death, the family of the deceased holds a celebration of the birthday of the Prophet (peace be upon him). Some people hold it one month or one year after a person&#8217;s death. They slaughter a cow or buy meat, prepare food and distribute it to the people of the village; afterwards, they hold a celebration of the birthday of the Prophet (peace be upon him). Is this permissible? Is it recommended to do this? Was it practiced by the <em>Sahabah</em> (Companions of the Prophet) or by anyone from the Salaf (righteous predecessors)? Please explain this issue, may Allah reward you with the best!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Celebrating the birthday of the Prophet (peace be upon him) is one of the Bid`ahs (innovations in religion) introduced into Islam. There is no difference between celebrating the birthday of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and other&#8217;s birthdays. The Prophet (peace be upon him) is the best of creatures and he is the teacher and adviser, yet he (peace be upon him) did not celebrate his birth. Similarly, his Rightly-Guided Caliphs did not celebrate his birthday, and the rest of Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them all) who were the most knowledgeable, loved the Prophet (peace be upon him) more than anyone of us, and were the most well-informed of his Sunnah did not celebrate it. This indicates that this celebration is Bid`ah and all kinds of Bid`ah are deviation from the right way as stated by the Hadith of the Prophet (peace be upon him): Every Bid‘ah is a Dalalah (deviation). The earliest and best three centuries of Islam passed and there was no celebration of the birthday of the Prophet (peace be upon him) during these times and, as far as we know, the Salaf did not celebrate it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="more-1952"></span>Therefore, it is Bid`ah introduced by those who came after the best centuries in virtue and righteousness. It is said that the first to introduce this Bid`ah were the rulers of Egypt from Al-&#8216;Ubaydiyyun, who were Shiites, as reported by a group of historians. They introduced it during the fourth century after Hijrah. It is said that they are the first who held these celebrations. In any case, it is a newly-introduced matter in Islam having no basis which some people from past centuries and in our age thought it to be recommended and there is nothing wrong in celebrating it, because it is a good Bid`ah. This is not only an incorrect opinion, but it goes against the Messenger (peace be upon him) as well. It is also in contradiction with the way of the Sahabah who were the most knowledgeable and the best people; however, they did not hold these celebrations. Therefore, it is a duty upon Muslims to reject this act. The biography of the Prophet (peace be upon him) can be studied in educational circles and daily and weekly lessons in which people can learn about the Sunnah of the Messenger (peace be upon him) and know his words and deeds. They can also learn the Islamic rulings brought by the Prophet (peace be upon him). This is what should be taught in school classes, in the educational circles in the Masjids (mosques) and in admonitions and reminders from which people learn the Sunnah and the biography of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and reject the celebration of the Mawlid and what takes place there. All these acts are possible and they are sufficient for Muslims and meet their needs. As for holding such birthday celebrations and preparing banquets, there is no basis for doing this. It is a newly-invented Bid`ah and every Bid`ah introduced in Islam is misguidance. It is not proper for any person of sound mind to be tricked by these people, because their actions are baseless and most of these people do not have insight into Islamic issues. The Almighty states: And most of mankind will not believe even if you desire it eagerly. Therefore, the decisive criterion is the evidence and proof.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) stated: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Anyone who introduces anything into this matter of ours (Islam) that is not part of it will have it rejected</strong></span>. He (peace be upon him) also stated: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Anyone who does an action which is not in accordance with this matter of ours (Islam) will have it rejected</span></strong>. Also, the manners of the Prophet (peace be upon him), his biography, his birth and his Hijrah (the Prophet&#8217;s migration to Madinah) are all taught by scholars at schools, in educational circles, in admonitions and reminders without any need to hold such celebrations invented by <em>Mubtadi`s</em> (those who introduce innovations in religion). Acts of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and excessive praising of the Prophet (peace be upon him) take place at some of these celebrations, and different forms of wrongdoing known only by Allah. Therefore, we need to shut this door and be satisfied with the Islamic lessons in the Masjids, in the educational circles, in reminders and admonitions related to important religious affairs and the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and its rulings. This is the truth, and what people do nowadays and in the past of celebrating the birthday of the Messenger (peace be upon him) or the birthdays of Al-Badawy, Shaykh `Abdul-Qadir or any other person are all innovations having no basis. It is obligatory to reject all these newly-introduced matters in compliance with the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him): Anyone who does an action which is not in accordance with this matter of ours (Islam) will have it rejected. And: E<strong>very Bid‘ah is a Dalalah (deviation).</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the ruling on celebrating the <em>Mawlid</em> (the Prophet&#8217;s birthday)? What is the ruling regarding those who attend it? Will those who celebrate it be punished if they die upon this practice?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: There is nothing in Shari`ah (Islamic law) which permits the celebration of birthdays, whether that of the Prophet (peace be upon him) or any other. What we know from the study of purified Shari`ah and from what has been established and confirmed by the verifiers from the people of knowledge is that such birthday celebrations are, undoubtedly, Bid`ah (innovation in religion). The Messenger (peace be upon him), who was the sincerest adviser, the most knowledgeable of Allah&#8217;s Law, who delivered Allah&#8217;s Message, did not celebrate his birthday or the birthday of any other person. By the same token, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>none of his Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet), his Rightly-Guided Caliphs or other followers celebrated his birthday</strong></span>. If such celebrations were correct, good or recommended, they would not have been neglected by the Prophet (peace be upon him) or by his Sahabah. The Prophet (peace be upon him) would not have disregarded it; rather, he would have taught his followers and would have done it himself. His Sahabah after him would have practiced this along with his Rightly-Guided Caliphs (may Allah be pleased with them all). The Sahabah not having held such gatherings gives us certainty that such celebrations are not part of Shari`ah. Furthermore, during the best centuries of Islam such celebrations were not conducted, and therefore, it becomes clear that they are Bid`ah. He (peace be upon him) stated: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Anyone who introduces anything into this matter of ours (Islam) that is not part of it will have it rejected</span></strong>. And: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Anyone who does an action which is not in accordance with this matter of ours (Islam) will have it rejected</strong></span>. There are other Hadiths referring to this meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Based on this, it is known that such celebrations of the Prophet&#8217;s birthday during the month of Rabi` Awwal or other days, as well as others birth celebrations of Al-Badawy, Al-Husayn and others are all condemned Bid`ahs which Muslims must reject because Allah has instead gifted us with two great annual celebrations: `Eid-ul-Fitr (the Festival of Breaking the Fast) and `Eid-ul-Adha (the Festival of the Sacrifice). These two festivals are sufficient for Muslims and protect them from inventing new festivals and rejected celebrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Love of the Prophet (peace be upon him) is not achieved by holding such birthday celebrations, but his love requires following him, acting according to the rules of his legislation, defending it, inviting others to it and being steadfast on it. This is the love of the Prophet (peace be upon him). Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted) states: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say (O Muhammad peace be upon him to mankind): &#8220;If you (really) love Allâh then follow me (i.e. accept Islâmic Monotheism, follow the Qur’ân and the Sunnah), Allâh will love you and forgive you your sins</span></strong>. Thus, the love of Allah and His Messenger is not expressed through birthday celebrations or Bid`ahs, but by obedience to Allah and His Messenger, being upright in Allah&#8217;s Legislation and striving in the Cause of Allah by inviting to the Sunnah of the Messenger (peace be upon him), raising it to the highest position, defending it and denying the actions of those who go against it. This is the way of expressing love of the Messenger (peace be upon him). It is also achieved by following his example in words and deeds, and following his path and inviting others to it. This is the true love proved by adherence to Islamic ethics and acting in accordance with Allah&#8217;s Legislation (may He be Glorified and Exalted).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the punishment of those holding these celebrations, it is a different issue because it is up to Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted). Bid`ahs and sins are among the reasons for being punished; however, Muslims may deserve punishment for their sins and Allah may forgive them, perhaps because of their ignorance of the ruling regarding these celebrations or because they just imitated those who think it is the right thing to do; or because of righteous actions and good deeds they forwarded for themselves and become a reason for obtaining Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness; or because of the Shafa`ah (intercession) of the Prophets, the believers, or children who died at an early age. The point is that sins and Bid`ahs are reasons for punishment and the perpetrator is subject to Allah&#8217;s Will (may He be Glorified and Exalted). This applies if the Bid`ah committed does not tantamount to <em>Kufr</em> (disbelief).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the Bid`ah introduced into religion leads to <em>Kufr</em>, such as those involving major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship), then the perpetrator will abide in Hellfire forever, we seek the refuge with Allah from this! On the other hand, if the Bid`ah does not involve major Shirk, but it is related to subsidiary matters that contradict Shari`ah (Islamic law) such as innovated <em>Salahs</em> (Prayers) or celebrations which do not include or lead to Shirk, then the perpetrator will be subject to Allah&#8217;s Will the same as all sins.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Our Shaykh, may Allaah reward you and treat you well. We are in need of you commenting on this affair as there is a time drawing near for the disbelievers in our land and many of the Muslims fall into participating in it and allowing their children to do so. It is as follows:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The disbelievers have a holiday called <span class="il">Halloween</span> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">الهالوين</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">It is also called: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">عيد الرعب</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">It is known that all of the holidays of the disbelievers are impermissible for the Muslims; however, this holiday has origins in Shirk and worship of the devils. It is said that the ancient Christians used to believe that on October 31st or around this day, the devils and demons were released from Hell and would cause havoc upon the lands. The only people whom they would not harm were those who made sacrifices by placing cakes and milk on the graves of the dead for the purpose of keeping the dead at ease. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Today, the people, on this day, dress up in costumes as monsters and devils and other things, some frightening and some not frightening, to simulate the dead and the devils coming out on this night. They dress their children up in these costumes and they walk about in the neighborhoods and knock on the people&#8217;s doors and say: &#8220;Trick or treat&#8221;. The meaning is: &#8220;Either you give me a treat or I will do a trick (i.e., some type of evil to you or your home.&#8221; And the occupants of the home usually buy candy to give the children who are dressed in the costume. This is a connection to the giving of cakes and milk to the inhabitants of the grave that the ancient Christians would do. The people also decorate their homes to look like scary haunted houses in celebration of this Satanic day.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">This holiday is very big in these lands, yet I have not found, in my research, any of the scholars speaking about it. My dear Shaykh, is it possible for you to comment on this in a recorded statement on Whatsapp, which I will translate and spread before the day of October 31st to warn the Muslims from participating in this day and allowing their children to do so. May Allah reward you and beautify you with Tawheed and the Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Fu’aad Al-‘Amree responds:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All the praise is for Allaah; may prayers and peace be upon the Messenger of Allaah, his family and companions altogether. As to proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say, in response to that the mention of which was presented in the question: It is not permissible for the Muslim who believes in Allaah and the last day to participate with the disbelievers and polytheists in their holidays. Allaah the Exalted says regarding the descriptions of the slaves of Ar-Rahmaan:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَالَّذِينَ لَا يَشْهَدُونَ الزُّورَ وَإِذَا مَرُّوا بِاللَّغْوِ مَرُّوا كِرَامًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And those who do not witness falsehood, and if they pass by some evil play or evil talk, they pass by it with dignity. (Al-Furqan 25:72)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujaahid and others have stated that: Az-Zoor الزُّورَ is the ‘Eids of the polytheists. When the Prophet, upon him be prayers and peace, came to Al-Madeenah and found them having two days in which they played he asked about them. He was informed that they were two days in which they would play during the days of Jahiliyah. He repudiated them with his statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has replaced them with that which is better than them; the day of Ad’haa and the day of Fitr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Participating in holidays of falsehood contains imitation of their people. It has been authentically narrated from the Prophet, upon him be prayers and peace, that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He who imitates a people is one of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory upon he who desires safety for himself to cling to the pure legislation and to bite onto the guidance of the Prophet, upon him be prayers and peace, with the molar teeth; and to abandon all of that which Allaah the Exalted has prohibited. Shaykhul-Islaam has written, regarding this issue, a magnificent treatise which the one who seeks the truth and desires felicity should refer to, entitled: Iqtidaa’ As-Siraat Al-Mustaqeem Mukhaalifah As’haabil-Jaheem</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Q: Is it permissible to stand in honor of a national anthem or flag?</p>
<p>A: It is not permissible for a Muslim to stand in honor of a national anthem or flag; this is a repudiated Bid‘ah (innovation in religion) as it did not happen during the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) or that of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs (may Allah be pleased with them). It also runs counter to the perfection of due, pure Tawhid (monotheism) and to the sincerity of dedicating all glorifications to Allah Alone. It is a means that can lead to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and involves imitation of the Kufar (disbelievers) and their bad customs, as well as their excessive glorification of their leaders and their exaggerated ceremonies. The Prophet (peace be upon him) prohibited acting like and imitating the disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">We see some people specifying the 15th of Sha&#8217;baan with particular supplications and reciting the Qur.aan and performing naafilah prayers. So what is the correct position concerning this, and may Allaah reward you with good?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Response</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That which is correct is that fasting the 15th of Sha&#8217;baan or specifying it with reciting (the Qur.aan) or making (particular) supplications has no basis. So the day of the 15th of Sha&#8217;baan is like any other 15th day of other months. So from that which is known is that it has been legislated for a person to fast the 13th, 14th and 15th of every month, however, Sha&#8217;baan is characterised unlike the other months in that (except for Ramadhaan) the Prophet (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam) used to fast more in Sha&#8217;baan than any other month . So he used to either fast all of Sha&#8217;baan or just a little. Therefore, as long as it does not cause difficulty for a person, it is befitting to increase in fasting during Sha&#8217;baan in adherence to the example of the Prophet (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ibn &#8216;Uthaymeen<br />
al-Bid&#8217;u wal-Muhdathaat wa maa laa Asla lahu &#8211; Page 612<br />
Fataawa Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Saalih al-&#8216;Uthaymeen &#8211; Volume 1, Page 190</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><br />
Standing the night of the 15th of Sha&#8217;baan in prayer and fasting during it&#8217;s day</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question: <span style="color:#993300;">Is standing the night of the 15th of Sha&#8217;baan in prayer and fasting during it&#8217;s day legislated?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Response: Nothing firm and reliable has been established on the authority of the Prophet (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam) that he stood in prayer in the night and fasted during the day of the 15th of Sha&#8217;baan. So the night of the 15th of Sha&#8217;baan is like any other night, and if someone is a regular worshipper during other nights, then he may stand the night in prayer on this night without assuming anything special (because of it being the night of the 15th of Sha&#8217;baan). This is because specifying a time for any act of worship requires a authentic proof, so if there is no authentic proof then the act is regarded as an innovation and all innovations are misguidance. Likewsie, regarding specifically fasting during the 15th day of Sha&#8217;baan, then no (authentic) proof has been established on the authority of the Prophet (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam) to indicate the legislation of fasting on that particular day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for that which is mentioned from the ahaadeeth regarding this subject, then all of it is weak as the people of knowledge have indicated. However, whoever has the habit of fasting the 13th, 14th and 15th (of every month), then he can continue and fast during Sha&#8217;baan as he fasts during the other months, without assuming anything special about the 15th of Sha&#8217;baan. Also, the Prophet (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam) used to increase in fasting during this month (Sha&#8217;baan), however, he did not particularise the 15th day, rather proceeded as per norm.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><br />
Giving sadaqah specifically on the night of 15th of Sha&#8217;baan</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">When my father was alive, he entrusted me to give sadaqah (charity) according to my means on the 15th of Sha&#8217;baan every year, and likewise I have been doing this ever since. However, some people have admonished me for doing so saying it is not permissible. So is giving sadaqah on the night of the 15th of Sha&#8217;baan permissible according to the willment of my father or not? Kindly advise us and may Allaah reward you with good.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Response</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To specify the giving of sadaqah on the night of the 15th of Sha&#8217;baan every year is an innovation, and despite your father having entrusted you with that, it is not permissible. It is befitting you give this sadaqah without specifying the night of the 15th of Sha&#8217;baan, rather do so every year and in whichever month, but without particularising any one month (on a consistent basis). However, it is permissible to do so in the month of Ramadhaan (for the evidence which indicates so).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And with Allaah lies all success and may Allaah send prayers and salutations upon our Prophet (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam) and his family and his companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AsSalam Alaikum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakaatuhu</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><strong>Source</strong>: The Islamic View Point on Celebrations Mawlid, The Night of Isra and Miraj , Mid Shaban Night &#8211; by <strong>Shaykh Ibn Baaz</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The night wherein the event of Isra’ and Mi’raj occurred had not been particularized in the authentic Hadith. All that was in this concern, according to the scholars of Hadith, has not been asserted as valid by the Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Such is the extensive judiciousness of the Almighty Allaah that He made people forget it. Even if its particularization had been asserted, Muslims should have not favoured it with any devotional services whatsoever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are not permitted to celebrate its anniversary, since the Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and his companions –May Allaah be pleased with them- never did it. Neither did they favour it with certain acts of devotion. Should such celebration of the Night be a licit matter, the Apostle (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), would have expounded it to the nation, either by word or by deed. And if such a thing had occurred, it would have been known and become common, and the companions-may Allaah be pleased with them- would have transmitted it to us. They, in fact, passed on from their Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), everything Muslims are in need of. Never were they remiss with regard to religion, nay, they were outstrippers to every good. Should celebration of this anniversary Night were licit, they would have been the first to do it. The Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), is most sincere in guiding people. He most truly fulfilled his mission, and performed his noble duty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the glorification and celebration of that Night had something to do with Islam, the Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), would have never neglected it. Neither would he have concealed it. And since nothing of such a matter have ever occurred, it has become known that glorification and celebration of that Night has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with Islam, because the Almighty Allaah has perfected for this nation its religion, completed His favour upon it, and rebuked the innovators who introduce in religion that which Allaah had not allowed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Almighty-glory be to Him- says in the Quranic Chapter Al-Ma’ida: (This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed my favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion).[5:3]. Allaah –may He be exalted- also says in Chapter Al-Shura: (What! Have they partners [godhead], who have established for them some religion without the permission of Allaah? Had it not been for the Decree of Judgement, the matter would have been decided between them [at once]. But verily the wrongdoers will have a grievous Penalty). Warning against heresies, and declaring that they are errors by way of reminding the nation of their gruesome peril, and estranging people from committing them, have been established as valid in the authentic Hadith of the Apostle (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It has been asserted as valid, among other traditions, in both Sahih Muslim and Sahih Al-Bukhari, on the authority of A’isha –may Allah be pleased with her- that the Prophet (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), said: (If anyone introduces into this affair of ours anything which does not belong to it, it is rejected). In another version by Muslim, the Prophet said: (Whoever performs a deed inconsistent with our principles, it will be rejected). Muslim transmitted in his Sahih, on the authority of Jabir-may Allaah be pleased with him- that the Apostle (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), was always used to saying in his speech on Fridays: (and now to our topic; the best speech is that of the Quran, and the best guidance is that of Muhammad (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and the most wicked matter is that of heretic innovations and each heresy is an error). It is reported in the Sunan (precepts) on the authority of Al-‘irbad ibn Sariah-may Allaah be pleased with him-who said: the Apostle (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), gave us an eloquent exhortation that scared the hearts, and shed tears from the eyes. We said: O Apostle of Allah, it looks as if it were a farewell exhortation. Admonish us. He then said: “I enjoin you to fear Allah, and to hear and obey your commander even if he were a slave; for those of you who live after me will see great disagreement. You must therefore follow my Sunnah and that of the rightly guided Caliphs. Hold to it, and stick fast to it. Avoid novelties; for every novelty is an innovation, and every innovation is an error). The traditions to that effect are numerous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Caution and intimidation against heresies have been established as a matter of fact, on the authority of the companions of the Apostle (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and the pious ancestors thereafter. Such was the case only for its being an unnecessary addition to religion, a prescription of something novel without the permission of Allaah, and an imitation of the adversaries of Allaah, as did the Jews and the Christians with regard to making additions to their religion, and inventing what was beyond the permission of Allaah, since that act of theirs was attended by their being prejudicial to Islamic religion, and accusing it of lack of perfection. This matter is quite known to be rife with a great deal of gross corruption, ignominious file actions, contradiction with the saying of the Almighty Allaah: (<strong>This day I have perfected your religion for you…</strong>.), and an obvious contrast to the traditions of the Apostle (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), that caution against, and estrange from heresies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I hope that the aforementioned evidences are quite enough for the truth-seeker to reject this heresy, namely, that of celebrating the anniversary Night of ‘Isra’ and Mi’raj, and to caution against it, considering that it has absolutely nothing to do with Islam. In view of the fact that Allaah has enjoined the duty to give Muslims sincere advice, to elucidate the divine prescription for them, and to proscribe concealing of knowledge to them, I decided to call the attention of my Muslim brethren to this heresy which became so rife in a lot of countries that some people deemed it pertaining to religion</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>About Shaykh Ibn Baaz</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He held the position of Grand Muftee of Saudi Arabia, the Presidency of many Islaamic Committees and Councils, the prominent among these being: Senior Scholars Committee of the Kingdom, Permanent Committee for Islaamic Research and Fataawa, the Founding Committee of Muslim World League, World Supreme Council for Mosques, Islaamic Jurisprudence Assembly Makkah; and the member of the Supreme Council of the Islaamic University at al-Madeenah, and the Supreme Committee for Islaamic Propagation, until he passed away on Thursday 27 Muharram 1420 A.H./May 13 1999 C.E. May Allaah (Subhaanahu wa Ta&#8217;aala) have Mercy upon his soul, aameen.</p>
