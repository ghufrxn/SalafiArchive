<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>ḤADĪTH 1</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The messenger of Allah (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>أتَانِي جِبْرِيْلُ ، فَقَالَ : يَا مُحَمَّدُ ، عِشْ مَا شِئْتَ فَإِنَّكَ مَيِّتٌ ، وَأَحْببْ مَنْ شِئْتَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>فَإِنَّكَ مُفَارِقُهُ ، وَاعْمَلْ مَا شِئْتَ فَإِنَّكَ مَجْزِيٌّ بهِ ، وَاعْلَمْ أَنَّ شَرَفَ الْمُؤْمِنِ قِيَامُ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>اللَّيْلِ ، وَعِزَّهُ اسْتِغْنَاؤُهُ عَنْ النَّاسِ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">Jibrīl came to me and said, “Oh Muhammad, live how you like for you will certainly die. Love whom you like for you will certainly leave him. Do as you like for you will certainly be compensated for it. And know that the dignity of a believer is his standing at night (in prayer), and his honor is his managing himself without need of other people.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Albānī’s Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ṣaḥīḥah (no. 831)]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">ḤADĪTH 2</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abū Hurayrah (رضي الله عنه) reported that Allah’s messenger (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) asked:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"> أَتَدْرُوْنَ مَا الْمُفْلِسُ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Do you know what a bankrupt person is?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They replied, “A bankrupt person among us is the one with no money or possessions.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) continued:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الْمُفْلِسَ مِنْ أُمَّتِي يَأْتِي يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ بصَلاةٍ وَصِيَامٍ وَزَكَاةٍ، وَيَأْتِي قَدْ شَتَمَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">هَذَا.، وَقَذَفَ هَذَا ، وَأَكَلَ مَالَ هَذَا ، وَسَفَكَ دَمَ هَذَا ، وَضَرَبَ هَذَا ، فَيُعْطَى هَذَا </span><span style="color:#000000;">مِنْ حَسَنَاتِهِ ، وَهَذَا مِنْ حَسَنَاتِهِ ، فَإِنْ فَنِيَتْ حَسَنَاتُهُ قَبْلَ أَنْ يُقْضَى مَا عَلَيْهِ ، </span><span style="color:#000000;">أُخِذَ مِنْ خَطَايَاهِمْ فَطُرِحَتْ عَلَيْهِ ، ثُمَّ طُرِحَ فِي النَّارِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">The bankrupt person from my nation is the one who will come on the Day of Resurrection with prayer, fasting, and charity. But he had insulted this person, slandered that person, cheated this person out of money, spilled this person’s blood, and hit that person. Each of these people (he harmed) will then be given some of his good deeds. And if his good deeds run out before settling his affairs, their sins will be taken and put upon the man, then he will be thrown in the fire.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Albānī’s Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ṣaḥīḥah (no. 847)]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>ḤADĪTH 3</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jābir Ibn ‘Abdullah (رضي الله عنه) reported that the messenger of Allah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">اِتَّقُوْا الظُّلْمَ ، فَإِنَّ الظُّلْمَ ظُلُمَاتٌ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ ، وَاتَّقُوْا الشُحَّ ، فَإِنَّ الشُّحَّ </span><span style="color:#000000;">أَهْلَكَ مَنْ كَانَ قَبْلَكُمْ ، حَمَلَهُمْ عَلَى أَنْ سَفَكُوْا دِمَاءَهُمْ وَاسْتَحَلُّوْا مَحَارِمَهُمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">Beware of oppression because oppression will become darkness on the Day of Resurrection. And beware of stinginess because stinginess destroyed those who came before you. It led them to shed each other’s blood and declare each other’s sanctity permissible to violate.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Albānī’s Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ṣaḥīḥah No. 858]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">ḤADĪTH 4</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Faḍālah Ibn ‘Ubayd reported in a marfū’[<span style="color:#ff0000;">5</span>] form:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">اجْعَلُوْا بَيْنَكُمْ وَبَيْنَ النَّارِ حِجَابًا ، وَلَوْ بشِقِّ تَمْرَةٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">Construct between yourself and the fire a barrier even with half a date (given in charity).</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Albānī’s Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ṣaḥīḥah No. 897]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">5</span>] Ibn al-‘Uthaymīn, in Muṣṭalaḥ al-Ḥadīth, explained a marfū’ ḥadīth as one that is either raised to the status of being directly attributed to the prophet (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) as his explicit statement, action, approval, or as a physical or character description, or it is determined for a number of reasons that the statement carries the ruling of being attributed to the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">ḤADĪTH 5</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas (رضي الله عنه) reported in a marfū’ form:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا أَرَادَ اللَّهَ بعَبْدٍ خَيْرًا عَجَّلَ لَهُ العُقُوْبَةَ فِي الدُّنْيَا ، وَإِذَا أَرَادَ اللَّهَ بعَبْدٍ شَرًّا </span><span style="color:#000000;">أَمْسَكَ عَلَيْهِ ذُنُوْبَهُ حَتَّى يُوَافِيْهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>When Allah wants good for a servant, He hastens his punishment (for his sins) in this life. And if Allah wants bad for a servant, he preserves his sins for him until he meets Him on the Day of Resurrection.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Albānī’s Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ṣaḥīḥah No. 1220]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">ḤADĪTH 6</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Amr Ibn al-Ḥamaq (رضي الله عنه) reported in a marfū’ ḥadīth:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا أَرَادَ اللَّهُ بعَبْدٍ خَيْرًا عَسَّلَهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>When Allah wants good for a servant, He makes others pleased with him. It was asked, “And what is this pleasing respect others have for him, messenger of Allah?” He answered:</strong></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَفْتَحُ لَهُ عَمَلاً صَالِحًا بَيْنَ يَدَيْ مَوْتِهِ حَتَّى يَرْضَى عَنْهُ مَنْ حَوْلَهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">He makes the person able to do good deeds at the time of his death so that those around him are pleased with him.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Albānī’s Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ṣaḥīḥah No. 1114]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">ḤADĪTH 7</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Uqbah Ibn ‘Āmir (رضي الله عنه) reported in a marfū’ form:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا رَأَيْتَ اللَّهَ يُعْطِي الْعَبْدَ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا عَلَى مَعَاصِيْهِ مَا يُحِبُّ ، فَإِنَّمَا هُوَ</span><span style="color:#000000;"> اسْتِدْرَاجٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">If you see that Allah provides for a servant in this life from what he likes because of his sins, it is only <em>Istidrāj </em>(allowing him to gradually increase in sin).</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The messenger of Allah then recited the verse:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">If you were to commit sins so much that your sins reached the sky but then you repented, He (Allah) would accept your repentance.</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">Whoever makes the hereafter his (main) concern, Allah will place his richness in his heart, organize his affairs, and the worldly life will come to him without seeking it. But whoever makes this life his concern, Allah will place his poverty before his eyes, scatter his affairs, and nothing of the worldly life will come to him except what has already been destined for him.</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abū Hurayrah said: I replied, “I will, messenger of Allah.” He (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) then took my hand and counted on five fingers, saying:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">I swear by the One in whose hand is my soul, this worldly life is more insignificant to Allah than this sheep is to its owner.</span></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>The World and its Allurements</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the second external factor, which bears effect on a person&#8217;s eemaan by decreasing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, one of the causes of the decrease and weakness of eemaan is to be engrossed with the transient things of this temporary worldly life; to occupy one&#8217;s time with it; be devoted to seeking it and to race after its pleasures, temptations and seductions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever the servants longing for this world intensifies and his heart becomes attached to it, his obedience will weaken and his eemaan will decrease accordingly. Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy upon him, says: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;The extent of the servants desire for the world and of his pleasure with it determines his slackness towards obedience of Allaah and seeking the Hereafter.&#8221;</strong></span> [al-Fawaa&#8217;id, pg. 180]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, Allaah, the Wise, the All-Aware, censured the world in His Book and made clear its vileness and wretchedness in many aayaat in the Noble Qur&#8217;aan, Allaah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">اعْلَمُوا أَنَّمَا الْحَيَاةُ الدُّنْيَا لَعِبٌ وَلَهْوٌ وَزِينَةٌ وَتَفَاخُرٌ بَيْنَكُمْ وَتَكَاثُرٌ فِي الْأَمْوَالِ وَالْأَوْلَادِ ۖ كَمَثَلِ غَيْثٍ أَعْجَبَ الْكُفَّارَ نَبَاتُهُ ثُمَّ يَهِيجُ فَتَرَاهُ مُصْفَرًّا ثُمَّ يَكُونُ حُطَامًا ۖ وَفِي الْآخِرَةِ عَذَابٌ شَدِيدٌ وَمَغْفِرَةٌ مِّنَ اللَّهِ وَرِضْوَانٌ ۚ وَمَا الْحَيَاةُ الدُّنْيَا إِلَّا مَتَاعُ الْغُرُورِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Know that the life of this world is only play and amusement, pomp and mutual boasting among you, and rivalry in respect of wealth and children, just like the vegetation after rain, which pleases the tillers; afterwards it dries up and you see it turning yellow; then it becomes straw. But in the Hereafter there is a severe torment</b> (for the disbelievers, evil-doers)<b>, and there is forgiveness from Allaah and </b>(His)<b> Good Pleasure </b>(for the believers, good-doers)<b>, whereas the life of this world is only a deceiving enjoyment.&#8221;</b></span>[Soorah al-Hadeed (57):20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَاضْرِبْ لَهُم مَّثَلَ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا كَمَاءٍ أَنزَلْنَاهُ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ فَاخْتَلَطَ بِهِ نَبَاتُ الْأَرْضِ فَأَصْبَحَ هَشِيمًا تَذْرُوهُ الرِّيَاحُ ۗ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ مُّقْتَدِرًا الْمَالُ وَالْبَنُونَ زِينَةُ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا ۖ وَالْبَاقِيَاتُ الصَّالِحَاتُ خَيْرٌ عِندَ رَبِّكَ ثَوَابًا وَخَيْرٌ أَمَلًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And put forward to them the example of the life of this world, it is like the water </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(rain)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;">,which We send down from the sky. The vegetation of the earth mingles with it, and becomes fresh and green. But </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(later)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;"> it becomes dry and broken pieces, which the winds then scatter. And Allaah is Able to do everything. Wealth and children are the adornment of the life of this world. But the everlasting righteous deeds are better with your Lord, for rewards and better in respect of hope&#8221;</span></b>[Soorah al-Kahf (18):45-46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَفَرِحُوا بِالْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا وَمَا الْحَيَاةُ الدُّنْيَا فِي الْآخِرَةِ إِلَّا مَتَاعٌ &#8230;</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;&#8230; and they rejoice in the life of the world, whereas the life of this world as compared with the Hereafter is but a brief passing enjoyment&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah ar-Ra&#8217;d (13):26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ لَا يَرْجُونَ لِقَاءَنَا وَرَضُوا بِالْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا وَاطْمَأَنُّوا بِهَا وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ عَنْ آيَاتِنَا غَافِلُونَ أُولَٰئِكَ مَأْوَاهُمُ النَّارُ بِمَا كَانُوا يَكْسِبُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Verily, those who hope not for their meeting with Us, but are pleased and satisfied with the life of the present world, and those who are heedless of Our Aayaat </b>(proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.)<b>. Those, their abode will be the Fire, because of what they used to earn.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah Yoonus (10):7-8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This contains the greatest warning to one who is pleased with the life of this world, is comforted by it, is heedless of the aayaat of Allaah and who does not hope to meet Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, Allaah says in censuring those of the believers who are pleased with this world:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا مَا لَكُمْ إِذَا قِيلَ لَكُمُ انفِرُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ اثَّاقَلْتُمْ إِلَى الْأَرْضِ ۚ أَرَضِيتُم بِالْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا مِنَ الْآخِرَةِ ۚ فَمَا مَتَاعُ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا فِي الْآخِرَةِ إِلَّا قَلِيلٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;O you who believe! What is the matter with you, that when you are asked to march forth in the Cause of Allaah </b>(i.e., Jihaad)<b> you cling heavily to the earth? Are you pleased with the life of this world rather than the Hereafter? But little is the enjoyment of the life of this world as compared with the Hereafter.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah at-Tawbah (9):38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;By Allaah, it is not poverty that I fear for you, but l fear that the world will be spread out for you just as it was spread out for those before you and then you will compete for it just as they competed for it and then you will be destroyed just as they were destroyed.&#8221; </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hadeeth is agreed upon [i.e., both al-Bukhaaree and Muslim relate it. [t]. Al-Bukhaaree, (6/258, 7/320 Fath) and Muslim, 4/2273 from the hadeeth of &#8216;Amr Ibn &#8216;Awf, may Allaah be pleased with him]. In another wording of theirs, <i>&#8220;… you will be distracted just as they were distracted.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are other such texts, which are great in number. Thus, one who wants his eemaan to have growth, strength, safety from weakness and decrement must strive against his soul in distancing himself from this world, its temptations, seductions and distracting amusements, and what a multitude they are.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This can only be achieved and become true after considering two matters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The first:</strong></span> to consider and look at the world, its rapid termination, passing away and disappearance; its deficiency and vileness; the pains of competing against one another for it and coveting it and what this contains of agony, embitterment and adversity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The end of all that will be disappearance and discontinuance along with the regret and sorrow that follows on from it. Thus, its seeker can never be free of anxiety and worry before he attains it or even when he actually achieves it and he can never be free of grief and distress after it passes on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">The second:</span></strong> to consider and look at the Hereafter and its approach and arrival that is inevitable; its perpetuity and eternity; the glory of what it is within it of blessings and joy; the disparity between such things and what is in this world. It is as Allaah said:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَالْآخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ وَأَبْقَىٰ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Although the Hereafter is better and more lasting&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah al-A&#8217;laa (87):17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are blessings that are perfect and everlasting, whereas these (things of the world) are fantasies that are deficient, sporadic and transitory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one contemplates over these two matters and considers them and looks into them in a proper manner, this will direct him to prefer the Everlasting Hereafter to the transient world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The greatest aid for him in fulfilling this is to take a look at the state of Messenger and his biography as well as his Companions. The fact that they renounced the world, turned their hearts away from it and discarded it. They never accustomed themselves with it and instead deserted it. They never inclined towards it and they regarded it to be a prison and not a heaven and thus, abstained from it in a true manner and if they had desired it they would have acquired every loved thing and arrived at every cherished matter from it. Indeed, the keys to the treasures of the world were offered to the Prophet but he rejected them. The world also poured out to the Companions but they did not opt for it and did not exchange their portion of the Hereafter for the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They knew that the world was a crossing point and passageway not a place of dwelling and settling, that it was a place of transit (&#8216;<em>uboor</em>) and not a place of happiness (<em>suroor</em>) and that it was a summer cloud which will soon disperse and an apparition no sooner is it completed than is it on the brink of departure.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Allaah has said:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">أَفَرَأَيْتَ إِن مَّتَّعْنَاهُمْ سِنِينَ  ثُمَّ جَاءَهُم مَّا كَانُوا يُوعَدُونَ مَا أَغْنَىٰ عَنْهُم مَّا كَانُوا يُمَتَّعُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Tell Me, if We do let them enjoy for a number of years, then afterwards comes to them that </b>(punishment) <b>which they had been promised; all that with which they used to enjoy shall not avail them&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah ash-Shu&#8217;araa&#8217; (26):205-207]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَيَوْمَ يَحْشُرُهُمْ كَأَن لَّمْ يَلْبَثُوا إِلَّا سَاعَةً مِّنَ النَّهَارِ يَتَعَارَفُونَ بَيْنَهُمْ ۚ قَدْ خَسِرَ الَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا بِلِقَاءِ اللَّهِ وَمَا كَانُوا مُهْتَدِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;And on the Day when He shall gather </b>(resurrect)<b> them together, </b>(it will be as if)<b> they had not stayed </b>(in the life of this world and graves, etc.)<b> but an hour of a day. They will recognize each other.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah Yoonus (10):45]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَيَوْمَ تَقُومُ السَّاعَةُ يُقْسِمُ الْمُجْرِمُونَ مَا لَبِثُوا غَيْرَ سَاعَةٍ ۚ كَذَٰلِكَ كَانُوا يُؤْفَكُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;And on the Day that the Hour will be established, the <em>Mujrimoon</em> </b>(criminals, disbelievers, polytheists, sinners, etc.)<b> will swear that they stayed not but an hour…&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah ar-Room (30):55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is the one who is beseeched to aid us with eemaan and to protect us from trials and temptations, the apparent and hidden.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PEOPLE OF KNOWLEDGE</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Commander of the Believers (radhi Allaahu anhu) has described this category from the carriers of knowledge with certain attributes:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among them is that: “<strong>Through them, the knowledge is fortified upon the reality of evidences</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of this is that the knowledge directs them to the highest of goals and this is the awareness of Allaah. Thus they fear Him and love Him to the point that everything that is difficult upon others becomes easy for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they do not look for a way towards that which others seek a way towards, from those who stop with this worldly life, its attractions and its pleasures. And from those who have pride in that and do not spread the knowledge, exaltation and honoring of Allaah in their hearts. Rather, they are the ones who turn towards that which the self-sufficient ones have abandoned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Verily, the self-sufficient one, who has fallen and given into the desires of the world and its pleasures, finds difficulty in abandoning its desires and pleasures. This is because there is no substitute that could replace his desire for this world if he were to abandon it. So he does not have the patience to abandon it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the hearts of this type of people, for what they seek a way towards, is the biggest substitute over the desire to acquire the knowledge of Allaah and the love and honor for Him. This is as Al-Hasan (rahimahullaah) used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily, the ones who love Allaah are only those who inherit the good life and taste its pleasures due to what they seek a way towards, such as the private attachment to their Beloved (Allaah), and due to what they find from the sweetness of their love for Him in their hearts.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These individuals only befriend that which the ignorant feel repelled by because those who are ignorant about Allaah are opposed to abandoning the worldly life and its pleasures. And this is because they don’t know anything that can compare to it (i.e. the worldly life) and thus it is that which they love and befriend. On the other hand, these individuals feel repelled by that and instead find love in Allaah, His remembrance, awareness of Him, love for Him, and the recitation of His Book. Meanwhile, those who are ignorant about Allaah feel repelled by these things and do not find any love or enjoyment in them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another of their attributes, which the Commander of the Believers described them with, was that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>They accompany the world with their bodies while their souls are drawn towards the great abode</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates that they do not take this world as their home nor are they content with it as a place of residence or a place of rest. Indeed, they only see it as a transition and they do not take it as a final abode. All of the messengers and revealed Books advised towards this aspect. Allaah informed us in His Book of the believing man from the house of Pharaoh who said to his people while he was lecturing them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O my people! Truly, the life of this world is nothing but a (quick passing) transition, and verily, the Hereafter that is the home that will remain forever.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Ghaafir: 39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said to Ibn ‘Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> “Be in this world as if you were a stranger or a passer-by.”</strong> [34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is to be in this world as if you did not exist and in the next life as if you did not cease to exist.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another report it is stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Count yourself amongst the inhabitants of the graveyards.”</strong> [35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the advice that the Maseeh ‘Eesaa gave, was his words to his companions: <strong>“Pass through it and do not become an inhabitant of it.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he also said:<strong> “Who is the one who will build a home upon the waves of the ocean? This is the worldly life, so do not take it as a home that will last forever.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, the believer, in this world is like the stranger crossing through a land other than his own, longing for his homeland and the day when he will return to it. He makes provision of what is necessary for his path back homeward. He does not compete for status with the people of the land he is passing through. Nor does he grieve over the degradation he experiences while amongst them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Fudayl bin ‘Iyaad (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The believer in this world is worried and distressed. His main concern is to repair his equipment (as one who is stranded fixes his vehicle).”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The believer in this world is like a stranger. He does not become upset when it (the world) degrades him, nor does he compete with others with regard to what it gives of honor. For him is a condition and for the people is a condition.” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In reality, the believer is a stranger in this world because his forefather (Aadam) used to originally reside in the eternal abode and was then cast out from it. So he is constantly longing to return to his first place of residence. And he is always concerned with returning to the home from which he was cast out of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is as is said: “Love of one’s homeland is part of Faith.” [36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as it is said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;How many homes in the world does the young man take charge of. Yet his longing will forever be for his first home.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of our scholars [37] have said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">“So rush to the Gardens of Eden for indeed<br />
It is your original home, and in it is a place of rest.<br />
However, we are in the captivity of the enemy, so don&#8217;t you see?<br />
Shall we return to our homes and find peace?<br />
And it has been determined that when the stranger is far away<br />
and his home has disappeared, then he is lost.<br />
So what type of strangeness is greater than our strangeness<br />
which the enemies amongst us have manifested?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[34] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree (Eng.): vol. 8, no. 425</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[35] Sunan Ibn Maajah (no. 4114). This addition was graded weak in Da’eef Sunan Ibn Maajah (no. 895)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[36] This statement is based on a fabricated hadeeth: “Love of ones homeland is part of Eemaan (Faith).” Imaam Al-Albaanee declared it mawdoo’ (fabricated) and he listed several scholars from the past that held the same opinion. It is perhaps for this reason, that the author (Ibn Rajab) has not attributed it to the Prophet, but merely claimed it as a saying. However, the meaning of the statement itself seems to be incorrect. The scholars have discussed various meanings for it. What is the most correct is that if it is used as a saying, then it is correct in the context that the author (Ibn Rajab) has put it in here, in the sense that the homeland refers to the original abode of Paradise. Therefore, the love for this original abode is from the aspects of Faith. The saying taken in any other sense would breed love for nationalism and party spirit and these two are abhorred and detested in the Religion. Refer to Imaam Al-Albaanee’s long discussion of this statement in his al-Ahaadeeth ad-Da’eefah (vol. 1, no.36).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[37] He is referring here to his teacher Ibn Al-Qayyim. See his book Haadee Al-Arwaah (pg. 7).</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Narrated Abu Huraira ( رضي الله عنه ) :</p>
</div>
<div class="text_details">
<p style="text-align:justify;">By Allah except Whom none has the right to- be worshipped, (sometimes) I used to lay (sleep) on the ground on my liver (abdomen) because of hunger, and (sometimes) I used to bind a stone over my belly because of hunger. One day I sat by the way from where they (the Prophet (ﷺ) and his companions) used to come out. When Abu Bakr ( رضي الله عنه )  passed by, I asked him about a Verse from Allah&#8217;s Book and I asked him only that he might satisfy my hunger, but he passed by and did not do so. Then `Umar ( رضي الله عنه ) passed by me and I asked him about a Verse from Allah&#8217;s Book, and I asked him only that he might satisfy my hunger, but he passed by without doing so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally Abu-l-Qasim (the Prophet (ﷺ) ) passed by me and he smiled when he saw me, for he knew what was in my heart and on my face. He said, &#8220;O Aba Hirr (Abu Huraira)!&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Labbaik, O Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ)!&#8221; He said to me, &#8220;Follow me.&#8221; He left and I followed him. Then he entered the house and I asked permission to enter and was admitted. He found milk in a bowl and said, &#8220;From where is this milk?&#8221; They said, &#8220;It has been presented to you by such-and-such man (or by such and such woman).&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Aba Hirr!&#8221; I said, &#8220;Labbaik, O Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ)!&#8221; He said, &#8220;Go and call the people of Suffa to me.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These people of Suffa were the guests of Islam who had no families, nor money, nor anybody to depend upon, and whenever an object of charity was brought to the Prophet, he would send it to them and would not take anything from it, and whenever any present was given to him, he used to send some for them and take some of it for himself. The order of the Prophet upset me, and I said to myself, &#8220;How will this little milk be enough for the people of As- Suffa? <strong>[1]</strong> though I was more entitled to drink from that milk in order to strengthen myself&#8221;, but behold! The Prophet (ﷺ) came to order me to give that milk to them. I wondered what will remain of that milk for me, but anyway, I could not but obey Allah and His Apostle so I went to the people of As-Suffa and called them, and they came and asked the Prophet&#8217;s permission to enter. They were admitted and took their seats in the house. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, &#8220;O Aba-Hirr!&#8221; I said, &#8220;Labbaik, O Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ)!&#8221; He said, &#8220;Take it and give it to them.&#8221; So I took the bowl (of milk) and started giving it to one man who would drink his fill and return it to me, whereupon I would give it to another man who, in his turn, would drink his fill and return it to me, and I would then offer it to another man who would drink his fill and return it to me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally, after the whole group had drunk their fill, I reached the Prophet (ﷺ) who took the bowl and put it on his hand, looked at me and smiled and said. &#8220;O Aba Hirr!&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Labbaik, O Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ)!&#8221; He said, &#8220;There remain you and I.&#8221; I said, &#8220;You have said the truth, O Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ)!&#8221; He said, &#8220;Sit down and drink.&#8221; I sat down and drank. He said, &#8220;Drink,&#8221; and I drank. He kept on telling me repeatedly to drink, till I said, &#8220;No. by Allah Who sent you with the Truth, I have no space for it (in my stomach).&#8221; He said, &#8220;Hand it over to me.&#8221; When I gave him the bowl, he praised Allah and pronounced Allah&#8217;s Name on it and drank the remaining milk.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes</span>:</strong></p>
<p>[1] They were about eighty men or more and it is one miracle of the prophet(ﷺ) that a small  bowl of milk (hardly one kilogram) could be sufficient for over eighty men to drink to their fill.</p>

<p><strong>Posted from</strong> : <a title="Book of Ar-Riqaaq – Softening of the Heart – Al-Bukhaari – Dr. Saleh as Saleh" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2014/11/08/book-of-ar-riqaaq-softening-of-the-heart-al-bukhaari-dr-saleh-as-saleh/">Al-Bukhari Book of Ar-Riqaaq</a> – Based upon the explanation of Shaykh Ibn Al-‘Uthaymeen</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The below is from Tafseer Ibn Kathir, darussalam publication</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>O mankind! Verily, the promise of Allah is true. So, let not this present life deceive you, and let not the chief deceiver deceive you about Allah. Surely, Shaytan is an enemy to you, so take (treat) him as an enemy. He only invites his followers that they may become the dwellers of the blazing Fire.</strong> [Surah Fatir ver 5-6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(O mankind! Verily, the promise of Allah is true.)</strong> meaning the Resurrection will undoubtedy come to pass.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(So, let not this present life deceive you,)</strong> means, `this life is as nothing in compare to the great good that Allah has promised to His close friends and the followers of His Messengers, so do not let these transient attractions distract you from that which is lasting.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(and let not the chief deceiver deceive you about Allah.)</strong> This refers to Shaytan, as stated by Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him. Meaning, do not let the Shaytan tempt you and divert you away from following the Messengers of Allah and believing what they say, for he is the chief deceiver and arch-liar. This Ayah is like the Ayah that appears at the end of Surah Luqman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(let not then this (worldly) present life deceive you, nor let the chief deceiver deceive you about Allah) (31:33). Then Allah tells us of the enmity of Iblis towards the sons of Adam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Surely, Shaytan is an enemy to you, so take (treat) him as an enemy.)</strong> meaning, `he has declared his enmity towards you, so be even more hostile towards him, oppose him and do not believe the things with which he tries to tempt you.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(He only invites his followers that they may become the dwellers of the blazing Fire.)</strong> means, `he only wants to misguide you so that you will enter the blazing Fire with him.&#8217; This is a manifest enemy, and we ask Allah, the All-Powerful and Almighty to make us enemies of Shaytan and to make us followers of the Book of Allah and of the way of His Messengers. For He is able to do whatever He wills and He will respond to all supplication. This is like the Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And (remember) when We said to the angels: &#8220;Prostrate yourselves unto Adam.&#8221; So they prostrated themselves except Iblis. He was one of the Jinn; he disobeyed the command of his Lord. Will you then take him (Iblis) and his offspring as protectors and helpers rather than Me while they are enemies to you What an evil is the exchange for the wrongdoers.) (18:50)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira ( رضي الله عنه ) : The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Allah will not accept the excuse of any person whose instant of death is delayed till he is sixty years of age.&#8221;</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;The heart of an old man remains young in two respects, i.e., his love for the world (its wealth, amusements and luxuries) and his incessant hope.&#8221;</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Bismillah wa -Alhamdulillah wa Salaatu wa Salaam &#8216;alaa Rasulillah &#8216;amma ba&#8217;d<br />
</i><br />
The Noble <i>Shaykh Muhammad &#8216;Awaaji al-Madkhalee</i> (May <b>Allah </b>Preserve Him) from the <i>mashaayikh </i>of <i>Jeezan, Saudi Arabia</i> delivered a LIVE tele-lecture with <i>Muwahhideen </i>Publications on Saturday 13th September 2014. The <i>Shaykh </i>is a student of <i>Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmi </i>(<i>rahimahullah</i>) and<i>Shaykh Zayd al-Madkhalee</i>. He is a teacher at the <i>Salafi </i>Institute in <i>Jeezan</i>, and is recommended by <i>Shaykh Fawaaz al-Madkhalee, Shaykh Zayd al-Madkhalee</i> and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>This lecture event was translated LIVE into English.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• This lecture is based on the <i>aayaah</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>&#8220;So, when they forgot (the warning) with which they had been reminded, We opened to them the gates of every (pleasant) thing, until in the midst of their enjoyment in that which they were given, all of a sudden, We took them to punishment, and lo! They were plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows.&#8221;</i></b> [al-An&#8217;aam 6:44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• When the people of <i>Eemaan </i>hear this verse their skin trembles out of fear because they are living and enjoying the blessings of <b>Allah </b>and they do not know if they have truly thanked <b>Allah </b>for those blessings. So we fear that this <i>aayah </i>might apply to us for not giving thanks for those blessings bestowed upon us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• <i>Istidraaj </i>refers to when <b>Allah </b>continuously bestows blessings upon a person in order to lead them further into sins due to them not being thankful. <b>Allah </b>performs this action to whomever He wants, whenever He wants and the worse type is that which incurs <b>Allah&#8217;s </b>anger. This is when the person does something to incur the anger of <b>Allah</b>, despite the fact that He is the One Who brought him to life and He is the One who will cause him to die.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• The greatest type of <i>Istidraaj </i>is a person falling into <i>shirk</i>, which is without doubt the greatest of all sins. <b>Allah </b>continuously pours out blessings upon His servant to the extent that he cannot enumerate them, yet he takes these blessings and uses them for the purpose of other than pleasing <b>Allah</b>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• <i>&#8220;So, when they forgot (the warning) with which they had been reminded&#8221;</i> &#8211; evidence that <b>Allah </b>has established the burden of proof and clarified the message to the creation but some were caused to forget the message due to their own sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• <b>Allah </b>punishes His servant with whatever He wishes and He has a great wisdom in doing that. The greatest punishment is causing the heart of the servant to be negligent and forgetful of the remembrance of its Lord. <b>Allah</b>pours out His blessings upon His servants and despite that many of them are forgetful of these blessings and they do not remember their Lord so they live in a state of heedlessness, just like an animal. O my blessed brother, you should know that if a person falls into a state such as this, he has fallen into the greatest and worst type of <i>Istidraaj</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• How does a <i>Muslim </i>know if the blessings he is enjoying is actually <i>Istidraaj</i>? The answer: If a person uses the blessings of <b>Allah </b>to worship and be obedient to Him and to do what is permissible, then he is giving thanks for the blessings of <b>Allah</b>. However, if he uses these blessings for other than worshipping <b>Allah </b>and they distract him from the remembrance of his Lord, then he should know that these blessings are <i>Istidraaj</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• Just as <i>Istidraaj </i>is a punishment that befalls some individuals, it likewise befalls groups of people and can in fact befall the entire <i>Muslim </i>nation. This is the case if they busy themselves with the blessings that they have been given and in doing so they forget their Lord and do not practice the <i>Sunnah</i>of His Messenger (<i>sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) and they do not practice the Divine Law that <b>Allah </b>has revealed for them to make the source of ruling.<b>Allah </b>says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>“Such is the Seizure of your Lord when He seizes the (population of) towns while they are doing wrong. Verily, His Seizure is painful, and severe.” </i></b>[Soorah Hood 11:102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• <b>Allah </b>does not punish these nations, villages and groups of people when they initially start committing these sins. Rather, if they continually engage in sin and fail to command the good and forbid the evil, this is when <b>Allah</b>punishes them as a group.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• <b>Allah </b>informed us about the conditions of the nations of the past and what happened with the Prophets and Messengers He sent. <b>Allah </b>clarified the proofs and showed them the right way and sent to them Prophets and Messengers who came with miracles. But these miracles increased them in nothing but arrogance and turning away from their Lord. Thus, <b>Allah </b>seized them with a painful punishment. This was the case with the people of <i>Nooh, Hood, Saalih, Shu’ayb, Moosaa, Ibraaheem</i> and many other nations to whom <b>Allah </b>sent Prophets and Messengers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• The Prophet (<i>sallAllahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) clarified that the servant would be in a condition where <b>Allah </b>gives him plenty of time and does not punish him hastily. Rather, He gives him health and well-being and continues to give him an opportunity to repent from his sins and seek forgiveness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• It is found in a <i>Hadeeth Qudsi </i>that the Prophet (<i>sallAllah ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said that <b>Allah </b>said: “I am according to the servant&#8217;s opinion of Me. If he mentions me to himself, I will mention him to Myself and if he mentions Me in a gathering, I will mention him in a gathering better than it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• In another <i>hadeeth</i>, the Prophet (<i>sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: “<b>Allah</b>extends His Hand out at night in order to accept the repentance of the one who sinned by day. And He extends His Hand out during the day in order to accept the repentance of the one who sinned by night, and He continues to do this until the sun rises from the West.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Allah </b>(<i>Subhaanahu wa Ta’aalaa</i>) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>&#8220;And nothing prevents men from believing, now when the guidance has come to them, and from asking Forgiveness of their Lord, except that the ways of the ancients be repeated with them (i.e. their destruction decreed by Allah) ,or the torment be brought to them face to face? And We send not the Messengers except as giver of glad tidings and warners. But those who disbelieve, dispute with false argument, in order to refute the truth thereby. And they treat My Aayaat and that with which they are warned, as jest and mockery!&#8221;</i></b>[Soorah al-Kahf 18:55-56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• The following <i>aayah </i>sums up the topic of <i>Istidraaj </i>and how the people are punished for it:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>&#8220;And who does more wrong than he who is reminded of the Aayaat of his Lord, but turns away from them forgetting what his hands have sent forth. Truly, We have set veils over their hearts lest they should understand this (the Qur&#8217;aan) and in their ears, deafness. And if you (O Muhammad) call them to guidance, even then they will never be guided.&#8221;</i></b> [Soorah al-Kahf 18:57]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• This <i>aayah </i>clarifies that whoever turns away from the remembrance of<b>Allah </b>will be punished by having a seal placed over his heart such that he will not understand the truth and he will not benefit from his sight or hearing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>“And these towns (population, ‘Aad, Thamood, etc.) We destroyed when they did wrong. And We appointed a fixed time for their destruction.”</i></b> [Soorah al-Kahf 18:59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• <b>Allah </b>destroyed them only after giving them ample time to repent from their sins, but they did not benefit from this time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• There is a question I would like you all to pay close attention to, may <b>Allah</b>bless you: Is everyone who commits a sin fallen into <i>Istidraaj </i>of <b>Allah</b>?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• The answer: The human being will fall into sins and no person is safe from falling into sin. However, the sins we commit are not a form of Istidraaj until the person continues doing the sin and fails to repent from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• For this reason, <b>Allah </b>commands the human being to repent sincerely because He knows the human beings are going to commit sins. So it is obligatory upon us to fear the punishment of <i>Istidraaj</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Allah </b>says in His Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>“Did they then feel secure against the Plan of Allah. None feels secure from the Plan of Allah except the people who are the losers.” </i></b>[Soorah al-A’raaf 7:99]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>“Draws near for mankind their reckoning, while they turn away in heedlessness. Comes not unto them an admonition (a chapter of the Qur’aan) from their Lord as a recent revelation but they listen to it while they play, With their hearts occupied (with evil things) those who do wrong, conceal their private counsels, (saying): ‘Is this (Muhammad) more than a human being like you? Will you submit to magic while you see it?’”</i></b> [Soorah al-Anbiyaa` 21:1-3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• It is obligatory upon us all to beware of the punishment of <b>Allah </b>and strive against our own selves such that whenever we fall into some sin we hasten to return to <b>Allah </b>and repent to Him. We should frequently make <i>du’aa</i>asking <b>Allah </b>to prevent us from doing anything that will incur His anger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• If a person is to continually perform righteous deeds and is sincere in doing them only for the Pleasure of <b>Allah </b>and follows the <i>Sunnah </i>of the Messenger (<i>sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) in doing those deeds and asks his Lord for firmness upon His <i>Deen</i>, <b>Allah </b>will make easy his affair and expand this chest and guide him to all that is good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• Let us take for example one of the many blessings <b>Allah </b>has given all of us, one of those physical blessings <b>Allah </b>has given us in our bodies. Do we use this blessing in order to obey our Lord such that we give thanks for this blessing as we should or do we use this blessing in order to disobey our Lord?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• This is the blessing of sight. If we use our sight to look at what is around us, we see the roads that we are walking on and we look at what we need to around us to keep ourselves safe, then we have used that blessing properly. And likewise if we guard our sight and lower our gaze from looking at anything <b>Allah </b>has prohibited. If we use our eyes to cry out of fear for <b>Allah</b>and we look at those beautiful things <b>Allah </b>has created and think about their beauty and tie that back to the Power and Omnipotence of our Creator, then and only then have we given thanks for this blessing of sight.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• On the other hand, if we use the blessing of sight to look at things that are prohibited such as looking at women who are not our relatives, looking at the private parts of the <i>Muslims </i>and entering into places that we are not permitted to enter into or looking at prohibited books such as the books of magic and other than that, in this case we have used the blessing of sight for other than what <b>Allah </b>has allowed us to use it for and thus we would be committing a sin. And we should fear in such a situation. We should fear that by using this blessing of sight and looking at things that are prohibited that we are incurring <b>Allah’s </b>anger upon ourselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• We ask <b>Allah </b><b>Al-‘Adheem</b>, <b>Rabbul ‘Arsh al-&#8216;Adheem</b> to make us amongst those who worship Him upon clarity and who implement the<i>Sunnah </i>of His Messenger (<i>sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) and we ask Him not to make us of those who use His blessings to incur His anger by way of<i>Istidraaj</i>. And we ask Him to grant us life and keep us all upon the <i>Deen </i>of<i>Islaam </i>and upon the <i>Sunnah </i>of His Messenger as long as we live and to die upon them as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• We should not forget our brothers around the world who are being oppressed when we are making <i>du’aa</i>. We should ask <b>Allah </b>to rectify their affairs, to strengthen their weaknesses and to raise from amongst them people who will govern by the rule of <b>Allah </b>in their lands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• We should spread the <i>Deen </i>of <i>Islaam </i>by our good character, by the good treatment of others and by being patient; this is something that we have been commanded by <b>Allah </b>to do. The Prophet (<i>sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: “By <b>Allah</b>, if <b>Allah </b>guides one man because of you, it would be better for you than the red camel.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• We should also take a firm position in warning against the errors that take place at the hands of some of those who attribute themselves to <i>Islaam </i>from the deviant sects who are far away from the true teachings of <i>Islaam </i>such as ISIS, I<i>khwaan al-Muslimeen, Jamaa’ah at-Tableegh</i> and other than them from the deviant groups. These groups are ruining the reputation of <i>Islaam</i>in the non-<i>Muslims </i>countries. When the non-<i>Muslims </i>see their faulty actions they think that all of the <i>Muslims </i>believe and act as they do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• Spread the <i>Sunnah </i>of the Prophet (<i>sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) and teach it to the people and be patient with them and treat the people kindly in order to guide them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">A person’s craving after status is even more destructive than his craving after wealth. Seeking after worldly status, position, leadership and domination causes more harm to a person that his seeking after wealth – it is more damaging and harder to avoid since even wealth is expended in seeking after leadership and status. Craving after status is of two types.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First Type of Craving for Status</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first is seeking status through authority, leadership, and wealth and this is very dangerous – since it will usually prevent a person from the good of the Hereafter and nobility and honour in the next life, Allaah, the Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“That home of the Hereafter We shall assign to those who seek neither haughtiness nor any corruption on earth. The good end is for the pious.”</span></em> [Al-Qasas (28):83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is rare that a person seeks after position in this world by seeking authority and is guided to and granted what is good for him. Rather he is entrusted to his own self, just as the Prophet (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said to `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Samurah, radiyallaahu `anhu, “O `Abdur-Rahmaan! Do not ask for authority since if you are given it due to requesting it then you are abandoned to it, but if you are given it without requesting it then you will be aided in it.” [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the Salaf said, “ No one seeks after authority and then behaves justly in it.” Yazeed ibn `Abdillaah ibn Mawhib was a just judge and one of the righteous people and he used to say, “Whoever loves wealth and status and fears adversity will not behave with justice.” There occurs in Saheeh al-Bukharee from Aboo Hurairah, radiyAllaahu`anhu, from the Prophet (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) that he said, “You will be keen to attain authority and it will be a source of regret on the Day of Resurrection. So what an excellent wet-nurse it is and what an evil weaner.” [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Al-Bukhaaree) also reports from Aboo Moosa al-Ash`aree, radiyAllaahu `anhu, that two men said to the Prophet (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), ‘O Messenger of Allaah! Appoint us to some position of authority.’ So he said, ‘We do not appoint to authority in this affair of ours one who requests it, nor one who is keen to have it.” [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that craving after status and position inevitably causes great harm before its attainment due to the striving necessary to attain it, and also afterwards due to the person’s strong desire to hold onto it which produces injustice, haughtiness and other evils.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Aboo Bakr al-Aajurree</strong>, who was one of the wise scholars and teachers at the start of the fourth century, wrote at treatise about the manners and the sentiments of the scholars and it is one of the best works on this topic. One who studies it will know from it the way of the scholars of the Salaf, and will know the innovated ways contrary to their way. So he describes the evil scholar at length, from this description is that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>‘He has become infatuated with love of this world, and with praise, honour and position with the people of this world. He uses knowledge as an adornment just as a beautiful woman adorns herself with jewellery for this world, but he does not adorn his knowledge with action upon it.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="more-29224"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then mentions a lengthy speech and then says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“So these characteristics and their like predominate in the heart of one who does not benefit from knowledge, so whilst he carries these attributes his soul will come to have love of status and position – so that he loves to sit with kings and the sons of this world. The he loves to share in their opulent lifestyle, sharing their lavish attire, their comfortable transport, servants, fine clothing, delicate bedding and delicious food. He will love that people throng to his door, that his saying is listened to, and that he is obeyed – and he can only attain the latter by becoming a judge (qaadee) – so he seeks to become one. Then he is unable to attain it except at the expense of his Religion, so he debases himself to the rulers and their helpers, serving them himself and giving them his wealth as a tribute. He remains silent when he sees their evil actions after entering their palaces and homes. Then on top of this he may praise their evil actions and declare them good due to some false interpretation in order to raise his position with them. So when he has accustomed himself to doing this over a long period of time and falsehood has taken root in him – then they appoint him to the position of judge (qaadee) and in so doing slaughter him without a knife.”</em> [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then they have bestowed such a favour upon him that he is obliged and has to show his gratitude to them – so he takes great pains to make sure that he does not anger them and cause them to remove him from his position. But he has no concern about whether he angers his Lord, the Most High, so he misappropriates the wealth of orphans, widows, the poor and the needy, and wealth bequested as waaf (religious endowment) for those fighting Jihaad and the nobles of Makkah and al-Madeenah, and wealth which is supposed to be of benefit to all the Muslims – but instead he uses it to satisfy his clerk, chamberlain and servant. So he eats that which is haraam and feeds with that which is haraam and increases that which is a proof against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So woe to the one whose knowledge which the Prophet (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) sought refuge from and ordered us to seek refuge from. This is the knowledge which the Prophet (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) mentioned, saying, <span style="color:#008000;">“Those amongst the people receiving the severest punishment on the Day of Resurrection is the scholar who is not given benefit through his knowledge by Allaah.”</span> [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) used to say, <span style="color:#008000;">(Allaahumma innee a’oodhubika minal arba’i, min `ilmin laa yanfa`u, wa min qalbin laa yakhsha`u, wa min nafsin laa tashba`u, wa min du`aa in laa yusma`u) “O Allaah I seek Your refuge from knowledge which does not benefit; from a heart which does not fear; from a soul which is never satisfied; and from a supplication which is not heard.”</span> [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Allaahumma inne as`aluka `ilman naafi`an, wa a`oodhubika min `ilman laa yanfa`u)</span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;">“O Allaah I ask You for beneficial knowledge, and I seek Your refuge from knowledge which does not benefit.”</span> [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was said by Imaam Aboo Bakr al-Aajuree, rahimahullaahu ta`aala who lived at the end of the fourth century [17] and corruption increased and multiplied greatly since his time – and there is no might and no strength except by Allaah’s will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the subtle afflictions caused by love of status is seeking after and aspiring positions of authority – this is something whose reality is hidden and obscure. It is not understood except by those who have knowledge of Allaah, those who love Him and who are at enmity with those ignorant one’s from His creation who desire to compete with Him with regard to His Lordship and Divinity and right to worship, despite their despicability and the contemptible position they have before Allaah and in the eyes of His chosen servants who have knowledge of Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is just as <strong>al-Hasan (al-Basree)</strong>, rahimahullaah, said about them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“Even if the hooves of mules clatter for them and riding beasts strut for them, yet still the humiliation of sin rests upon their necks. Allaah has refused except that He will humiliate those who are disobedient to Him.” </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that love of status attained by having one’s orders and prohibitions obeyed and enacted, and by merely the attainment of a position above the people and to have importance over them, and that it be seen that the people are in need of him and seek their needs from him – then the soul of this person is seeking to compete with Allaah in His Lordship and His Divinity and right to worship. Some such people may even seek to put the people into such a condition of need that they are compelled to request their needs from them, and to display their poverty before them and their need of them. Then he is inflated with pride and self-importance because of that, whereas this befits none except Allaah alone. He who has no partner. Allaah, the Most High, Says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“Verily, We sent (Messengers) to many nations before you (O Muhammad (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)). And We seized them with extreme poverty (or loss in wealth) and loss in health with calamities so that they might believe with humility.”</span></em> [Al-An`aam (6):42]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also occurs in some narrations that Allaah, the Most High, sends adversity upon His servant in order to hear him call upon him with full humility. There also occurs in the narrations that when the servant whom Allaah loves supplicates to Allaah, the Most High, then He, the Most High, says, <em><span style="color:#008000;">“O Jibreel! Do not hasten to carry out his need, for I love that I should hear him calling with full humility.”</span></em>[18] So these matters are worse and more dangerous than mere injustice and are more sinister, and they are a part of shirk – and shirk is the greatest injustice and transgression with Allaah. It is reported in the Saheeh from the Prophet (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) that he said, <em><span style="color:#008000;">“Allaah, the Most High, says, ‘Pride is my cloak and majesty is my lower-garment so whoever vies with Me regarding them I will punish him.’”</span></em> [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also happened that one of the people of the past was a judge and he saw in a dream that someone was saying to him, “You are a judge and Allaah is a Judge.” So he awoke in a distressed state and removed himself from the position of a judge and abandoned it. Some of the pious judges used to prevent the people from calling them ‘Judge of judges’ (Qaadiyyul-Qudaat) since this name resembles the name ‘King of kings’ which the Prophet (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) censured that one should use as a title, and ‘Judge of judges’ is like that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also related to this is the one having status and authority loves that he is praised and commended for his actions and seeks that from the people. Those who do not comply with this suffer as a result. It may even be that his actions are actually more deserving of blame than of praise, or he manifests something that is apparently good – and loves to be praised for it, yet in reality he is intending something evil and is happy that he is able to deceive the people and fool them about it. This falls under the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“Think not that those who rejoice in what they have done (or brought about), and love to be praised for what they have not done, think not that they are rescued from the torment, and for them is a painful torment.”</span></em> [Aal-‘Imraan (3):188]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since this Aayah was sent down regarding those who have these attributes, and this attribute (i.e. seeking praise from the creation and loving it and punishing those who do not give it) is not fitting except for Allaah, alone, having no partner. This is why the rightly guided leaders used to forbid people to praise them for their actions and any good which if they did, and they would order that rather praise be given to Allaah alone, having no partner – since all blessings are from Him.<!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>`Umar ibn Abdul &#8211; `Azeez</strong>, rahimahullaah, was very particular about this and he once wrote a letter to be read out to the people performing Hajj. It contained an order that they should be treated well and that oppression of them should stop, and in it there occurred, “And do not praise anyone for this except Allaah, since if He abandoned me to my own desiresI would be just like the others.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a also a well-known narration about what occurred with him concerning the woman who requested from him that he should provide an allowance for her orphaned daughters. She had four daughters and he gave an allowance to two of them and she praised Allaah. Then he gave an allowance to the third so she thanked him, so he said, “We were giving an allowance to them as long as you were giving praise to the One to whom it is due, but now order this third one to share her allowance with the fourth,” or as he said, radiyAllaahu `anhu. He wanted to make it known that the position of leadership is only established so that Allaah’s commands are carried out, and so that the servants can be commanded to obey Allaah, the Most High, and forbidden from those things which Allaah has prohibited, and so that the leader acts with sincerity towards Allaah’s servants by calling them to Allaah. His intention is that the Deen should in its entirety be for Allaah, and that honour be for Allaah. Along with this he is fearful that he is himself falling short with regard to the rights of Allaah, the Most High. So as for those who love Allaah, then the limit of their desire with regard to the creation is that they should also love Allaah, obey Him and single Him out with all worship and recognise His Divinity alone. (Then how about one who seeks to vie with Him in this?!) Rather this type of person does not desire any reward or any thanks from the creation, but hopes for reward for his actions from Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“It is not (possible) for any human being to whom Allaah has given al-Hukma (knowledge and understanding of the laws of Religion etc.) and Prophethood to say to the people: “Be my worshippers rather than Allaah’s.’ On the contrary (he would say): ‘Be you rabbaaniyyoon (learned men of Religion, who practice what they know and also preach to others) because you teach the Book, and you study it.’ Nor would he order you to take angels and Prophets for lords (gods). Would he order you to disbelieve after you have submitted to Allaah’s Will?”</span></em> [Aal-`Imraan (3):79-80]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said, “<em><span style="color:#008000;">Do not exaggerate in praising me as the Christians praised the Messiah, the son of Maryam. Indeed I am only a slave. So say the slave of Allaah and His Messenger.</span></em>” [20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) also used to criticise anyone who did not keep to this manner of address with regard to him, just as he (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said, <em><span style="color:#008000;">“Do not say, ‘Whatever Allaah has willed and Muhammad has willed, ` but rather say, ‘Whatever Allaah has willed, then what Muhammad has willed.’”</span> </em>[21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also replied to a person who said, “Whatever Allah and yourself have willed,” by saying, <em><span style="color:#008000;">“Have you made me a rival for Allaah! Rather say, ‘Whatever Allaah alone has willed.’”</span></em> [22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this khulafaa who have succeeded the Prophets, and their followers – the just rulers and their successors, and their judges, never used to call to glorification of themselves but rather to the glorification of Allaah alone and that He is to be singled out with worship and divinity. From them were those who did not wish for leadership at all except as an aid to calling to Allaah alone. Some of the righteous people who accepted the position of judge said, “Indeed I accepted this in order to use it to help me in ordering the good and forbidding the evil.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the Messengers and their followers would persevere in the face of injury and harm which they suffered whilst calling to Allaah, and in carrying out Allaah’s commands they were put into the severest hardship by the people and yet they bore it with patience. Indeed being pleased with that, since one who has love may find pleasure in any harm he meets whilst seeking to please the one whom he loves. Just as `Abdul-Maalik ibn `Umar ibn `Abdul-Azeez used to say to his father when he was the khaleefah and he had keen desire that the truth and justice be established, “O father I would have loved that we had been forced into boiling cooking pots for the sake of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another righteous person said, “I would have loved that my flesh were cut away with scissors if it meant that all the creation would obey Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.” This saying of his was related to a certain wise person, so he said, “If what he was speaking of was sincere concern for the creation, otherwise I do not know.” Then he fainted. The meaning of this is that the one who said this had true and sincere concern  for the creation and pity for them, fearing Allaah’s punishment for them, so he would have loved that they could have been saved from Allaah’s punishment at the expense of his ownself. It could also be that he was considering the Majesty and Greatness of Allaah and the glorification, honour, obedience and love due to Him, so he wished that the creation would fulfil that even if it meant the most severe harm to himself. This is the state of mind of the distinguished ones who love Allaah and have knowledge of Him and keep Him in mind. This is what caused the man to faint.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, also described in His Book those who love Him as being those who fight Jihaad in His cause and do not fear the blame of those who seek to blame.[23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning this someone said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I find that being blamed whilst pursuing what you desire is delightful, For having love for your remembrance let those who wish  to blame me do so.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] Reported by Ahmad and al-Bukhaaree (transl.9/194/no.260)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] Reported by al-Bukhaaree (transl.9/196/no.262) and others. Note: His saying, “It will be a source of regret.” Means one who does not behave correctly having attained it – and the proof of this is what Muslim reports from Aboo Dharr who said, ‘I said, “O Messenger of Allaah! Will you not appoint me to some position?” He said, “You are weak and it is a trust and on the Day of Resurrection it will be a source of humiliation and regret, except for one who fulfils its obligations and carries out the duties required from him.” (Saheeh Muslim, transl.3/1015/4491). An-Nawawee said, “This is a great reason to avoid positions of authority especially those who are weak – and this refers to those who are not suitable and those who do not act justly in the position – then he will regret his negligence when he is humiliated on the Day of Resurrection. However one who is suitable for the position and behaves justly in it – then there is a great reward as shown in a number of reports. However entering into it carries a great danger therefore the great scholars avoided it. His saying, “What a good wet-nurse” (i.e. the one who feeds the baby at breast) meaning in this world, and “What an evil weaner” meaning after death – since he will be taken to account for it. So he is like one who is weaned away from breast milk before he can manage without it – so this causes his destruction. And it is said, “What a good wet nurse” due to the status, wealth, authority, attainment of physical and imagined enjoyment which it produces whilst one has it, but “What an evil weaner”, meaning when one is removed from it by death or other causes – due to the even consequences one faces in the Hereafter.” (Abridged and edited from Fathul-Baaree of Ibn Hajar (13/125-126)).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12] Reported by al-Bukhaaree (transl.9/196/no.263) and Muslim (transl. 3/1014/no.4489)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] Alluding to the saying of the Prophet (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), “He who is appointed as a judge has been killed without a knife.” Reported by Ahmad, Aboo Daawood (transl.3/1013/no.3564) and at- Tirmidhee who declared it hasan. I say: its isnaad is saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14] Reported by Ibn `Abdul-Barr in Jaami` Bayaanil-`Ilm (1/162) and al-Aajuree (pp.93-94) and at- Tabaraanee in as-Sagheer (1/1831) and others and its chain of narration is very weak since it contains `Uthmaan ibn Miqsam al-Burree who was accused of lying and fabrication. It is however reported as being the saying of Abud-Dardaa only, with an authentic chain of narration. It is reported by ad- Daarimee (1/82) and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15] Reported by Ahmad, Aboo Daawood (transl. vol.1/p.401/no.1543) and others, all with the wording, “O Allaah I seek Your refuge from four: from knowledge which does not benefit…” The hadeeth was declared to be saheeh by al-Haakim and adh-Dhahabee agreed, and it has supports from a number of the Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[16] Reported with this wording by al-Aajuree (p.134) and Ibn Hibbaan (no.2426). It also reported by Ibn Maajah (no.3843) and Ibn `Abdul-Barr (1/162) with the wording, “Ask Allaah for beneficial knowledge and seek Allaah’s refuge from knowledge which does not benefit.” Its chain of narration is hasan (good) and there is similar narration from Umm Salamah reported by Ibn Majah and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[17] Al-Aajurree, rahimahullaah, died in the year 360H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[18] The meaning of this is reported in the hadeeth qudsee which is mentioned by Shaikh Muhammad al- Madanee in his book al-Ittihaafaatus-Sunniyyah fil-Ahaadeethil-Qudsiyyah (no.438) – and he mentioned that Ibn `Asaakir reported it with a chain of narration containing Ishaaq ibn `Abdillaah ibn Abee Farwa who is abandoned as a narrator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[19] Reported by Ahmad, Aboo Daawood (transl.3/1141/no.4079) and Ibn Maajah from the hadeeth of Ibn Maajah, except that their wording ends, “…So whoever vies with Me regarding any of them…” and in a wording, “…. Anything from them, I will fling him into Hell-Fire.” And in a wording, “…the Fire.” Its chain of narration is saheeh. Muslim (transl. 4/1381/no.6349) also reports one version of the hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[20] Reported by al-Bukhaaree (transl.vol.4, p.435, no.654) and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[21] Reported by ad-Daarimee (2/295) with this wording and its chain of narration is saheeh. It is also reported with the wording, “Do not say, ‘Whatever Allaah and so and so have willed.’ but rather say, ‘Whatever Allaah has willed and then what so and so has willed.’” It is reported by Ahmad, Aboo Daawood (transl. vol.3, p.1386, no.4962) and others and its chain of narration is saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[22] Reported by Ahmad, Al-Bukhaaree in al-Aadabul-Mufrad (no.783) and others, and its chain of narration is hasan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) has forbidden us from certain types of business transactions due to what they contain from sinful means of earning and what is found in them from dangers to mankind and the taking of wealth unjustly. From these types of prohibited transactions are:</p>
<p><strong>When the buying and selling keeps one preoccupied from performing worship</strong> , i.e. they take away from the time of the worship, such as when a person is busy buying and selling and holds back from praying in congregation in the masjid, to the point that he misses it or misses part of it. This is forbidden. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“O you who believe, when the prayer is called for on the Day of Jumu’ah, then rush to the Remembrance of Allaah and leave off the trading (commerce). That is better for you if you did but know. So when the prayer is finished then spread throughout the land and seek from Allaah’s Bounty and remember Allaah much in order that you may be successful.”</span> </em>[Surah Al-Jumu’ah: 9-10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says in another ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“O you who believe! Do not let you wealth or your children divert you from the Remembrance of Allaah. And whoever does that, then such are the losers.” </em></span>[Surah Al-Munaafiqoon: 9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Take note of Allaah’s saying: <strong>“…then such are the losers.” </strong>He rules upon them that they are losers even though they may be wealthy, having amassed hoards of money even if they may have many children.This is because their wealth and their children cannot replace what they missed out on from the Remembrance of Allaah. So even if they gain a profit or earn income in this world, they will still be losers in every sense of the word. They can only be profiting in reality if they combine between these two good things. If they were to combine between the seeking of sustenance and the worship of Allaah, by buying and selling when it is time for buying and selling and attending the prayer when it is time for prayer, then they would have combined between the good of this life and the good of the Hereafter. And they would have acted on Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;"> “So seek your provision from Allaah and worship Him (alone)”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em> “So when the prayer is finished then spread throughout the land and seek from Allaah’s Bounty.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, commerce is of two types – <strong>the commerce of the worldly life and the commerce of the next life (Hereafter)</strong>. The commerce of this life is with wealth and with earnings while the commerce of the next life is with righteous actions. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“O you who believe, shall I not direct you to a trade (i.e. commerce) that will save you from a painful punishment? Believe in Allaah and His Messenger and strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allaah with your wealth and your lives. That will be better for you, if you but knew! (If you do so), He will forgive you your sins and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow and pleasant dwellings in the gardens of ‘Adan (i.e. Paradise). That is indeed the great success. And He will also give you another (blessing), which you will love – help from Allaah and a near victory. So give glad tidings to the believers.”</span></em><strong><em> </em></strong>[Surah As-Saff: 10-13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the immense commerce, which is profitable. So if the permissible commerce of this worldly life is attached to it, it becomes good upon good. But if a person limits his commerce to solely that of this worldly life while abandoning the commerce of the Hereafter, he becomes a loser, as Allaah says: <strong>“…then such are the losers.”</strong>[Surah Al-Munaafiqoon: 9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, if a person were to turn his attention to performing worship and establishing the prayer, and if were to remember Allaah much, by doing what Allaah commanded him to do, Allaah would surely open the doors of sustenance for him. As a matter of fact, the prayer is a means for attaining sustenance (<em>rizq</em>), as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“And command your family with prayer and be patient in offering them. We are not asking you to provide Us with sustenance (rizq). (Rather), We will provide for you and the good end is for those who have Taqwaa.” </em></span>[Surah TaHa: 132]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the prayer, which some people claim takes time away from them seeking after the <em>rizq </em>(sustenance) and from buying and selling, is in fact the opposite of what they claim. It opens for them the door of provision, comfort and blessing. This is because the sustenance (<em>rizq</em>) is in the Hand of Allaah. So if you were to turn your attention towards remembering Him and worshipping Him, He would facilitate and open the door of sustenance for you. <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And Allaah is the best of Providers.” </strong></span>[Surah Al-Jumu’ah: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says, describing the worship of the believers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“In houses (masaajid), which Allaah has ordered to be raised, and in which His name is mentioned. He is glorified therein during the mornings and the evenings. (They are) Men whom neither business nor commerce diverts them away from the Remembrance of Allaah, nor from performing the Prayer or giving the Zakaat. They fear a day when the hearts and the eyes will be overturned out of fear (of the horrors of the Day of Judgement).”</span> </em>[Surah An-Noor: 36-37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In explanation of this ayah, some of the Salaf said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“They (the Sahaabah) would buy and sell, but when one of them heard the mua’dhin calling to prayer, and the scale was still in his hand, he would drop the scale and head out for the prayer.”</strong></span> So as stated before, the point is that if the buying and selling preoccupies you from performing your prayer, then this commerce is forbidden and futile. And the money earned from it is Haraam (unlawful) and filthy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">Collected &amp; Translated  by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- From Maymoon who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I entered upon Ibn Umar <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> and I added up everything that was in his house from a bed or a blanket or a rug and I found that it was only equivalent to one hundred Dirham! !’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Zuhd – by Abu Dawood / 294]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- From Abu Hamza who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I said to Ibraheem, verily Farqad as-Subkhee does not eat meat, and he does not eat such and such food.’ Ibraheem said: ‘The Companions of Muhammad <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> were better than him and they used to eat meat and clarified butter, and such and such food.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Mussanaf  &#8211; 7/236]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – From Sha’abee who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘No one leaves a thing in the Dunyaa for the sake of Allaah except that Allaah gives him that which is good for him in the Hereafter.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Hileeyah – 4/312]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- From Jafar who said: ‘I heard Malik bin Dinaar saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Concern for the Hereafter leaves your heart due to the amount you grieve over the Dunyaa and concern for the Dunyaa leaves your heart due to the amount that you grieve over the Hereafter.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Zuhd – by Ahmad /387]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 – From al-Hasan al-Basari who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed the believer in this Dunyaa is like a stranger, he does not surrender to the humiliation of the Dunyaa, nor does he compete with the people of the Dunyaa for the honour of this Dunyaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people according to him are relaxing, while his soul according to himself is busy (with the Hereafter). As a result Toobah (a tree in Paradise) is for the slave of Allaah who earns goodness and submits a virtuous action for a day when he will be poor and in need. (i.e. the Day of Judgment.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Zuhd by Ahmad 333/Muhasib an-Nafs by Ibn Abi Dunyaa 78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 – From Yahya bin Mu’adh who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘We will not achieve everything that we wish from the Dunyaa however, we just submit our good actions for the Hereafter, as for the Day of Judgment, we do not know what our condition will be.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Hileeyah – 10/56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7 – From Bilal bin Sa’ad who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O people of piety, you have not been created in order to become extinct, however you will transfer from one land to another land, just as you transferred from the loins to wombs, and from wombs to this Dunyaa, and from the Dunyaa to graves and from the graves to the area of standing (Day of Judgment) and from that area to eternity in Paradise or Fire.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Seera ‘Aalaam 5/91]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8 – From Malik bin Dinaar who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The worldly people leave this Dunyaa without having tasted the best thing in the Dunyaa.’ It was asked and what is that thing?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘Knowing Allaah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Seera ‘Aalaam 5/236]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9 – From Malik bin Dinaar, that a thief entered upon Malik bin Dinaar but did not find anything to steal, whereby Malik called out to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘You won’t find any worldly thing to take, however, do you desire something for the Hereafter?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Thief answered: ‘Yes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Malik said: ‘Make Wudu and pray two Rakah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he did likewise, then Malik sat for a while and went out to the Masjid and the thief went with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Malik was asked: ‘Who is this?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘He came to steal from us but we ended up stealing him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Seera ‘Aalaam 4/190]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10 – From Hatim al-Assam who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Sadness has two aspects: Sadness that is in your favour and Sadness that is against you, as for the sadness which is against you, then it is for everything which passed you by of the Dunyaa and you were saddened as a result of that, therefore this is against you.  As for everything that passed you by of the Hereafter and you were Saddened as a result of that, then that is in your favour.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The explanation of this is; if you had two Dirham and you lost both of them, and you were saddened as a result of that, then this is a sadness for the sake of the Dunyaa, and if an error, shortcoming or jealousy is committed or something causing sadness and regret (due to that error etc.) then that is in your favour.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Hileeyah – 8/77]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11 – From Rabee’a who said: Shafi’ee said to me:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Adhere to Zuhd, since Zuhd for a Zahid is better than jewelry on a mature woman!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Seera ‘Aalaam 10/36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12 – From Wahab bin Munabbih who said: Malik ibn Dinaar said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘A man asked a person who was higher in status in terms of knowledge than himself: ‘How big shall I build my home? The person answered: ‘That which is sufficient to shelter you from the sun and protect you from a lot of rainfall.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man asked: ‘How much food should I eat?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘Enough not to remain hungry and less than being satisfied.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man asked: ‘How much shall I laugh?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘Enough to bring colour to your face but not enough to hear your voice.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man asked: ‘How much shall I cry?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘Enough that you do not get bored from crying from the fear of Allaah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man asked: ‘How many of my good actions should I hide?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘So much so that the people think that you do not do any good actions.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man asked: ‘How many of my good actions shall I make known?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘Just enough to encourage a miser to do good actions (based on your example).’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Hileeyah – 4/45]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13 – From al-Fudayl who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘General Zuhd amongst people means that a person does not love people’s praise of him, nor does he not concern himself with their criticism.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continued:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If you are capable of not being known then do so, and do not look to the people if the people do not praise you. And it is not upon you that you are criticized if you are praised by Allaah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever loves to be mentioned then he is not mentioned, and whoever dislikes to be mentioned then he is mentioned.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Hileeyah – 8/88]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14 – From Ayoob Sakhteeyani who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘A man should fear Allaah – Subhana wa Ta’ala- if he has Zuhd then he should not make his Zuhd as a punishment upon the people, indeed it is better for a man to hide his Zuhd than to announce it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Hileeyah – 2/6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15  – From al-Hasan al-Basari who used to say, when a person who was attached to the Dunyaa was mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘ I swear by Allaah, he did not remain for the Dunyaa, nor did the Dunyaa remain for him, nor did he secure himself from its trials nor from its evil nor from its account, rather he left the Dunyaa in rags (a shroud).’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Hileeyah – 2/144]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16 – From al-Hasan who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O you youth, adhere to seeking the Hereafter, we have often seen a person seek the Hereafter and he achieves the Hereafter along with the Dunyaa, however we have not seen anyone who seeks the Dunyaa and by that he also gains the Hereafter along with the Dunyaa.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Zhud al-Kabeer /12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">17 – From al-Hasan who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed I met many people who were not overjoyed with what they received from the Dunyaa, nor would they grieve over what passed them by of the Dunyaa.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Hileeyah 6/270]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">18 –  From Abdullaah bin al-‘Aayzaar who said: Umar bin AbdulAziz gave us a Khutbah in Shaam  standing on a Mimbar made of mud, and he praised and glorified Allaah and then he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O you believers rectify your secret actions and your manifest actions will be rectified, work for the Hereafter in order to protect the affair of your religion.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Hileeyah 5/298]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19 – From Abdullaah bin Wahhab who said: I heard Sufyaan at-Thawri say in Makkah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Pleasing the people is a goal which cannot be achieved, and seeking the Dunyaa is a goal which cannot be achieved.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Hileeyah 6/386]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">20 – From Sufyaan bin Uayainah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Seeking from the Dunyaa what is necessary for yourself is not considered loving the Dunyaa.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Hileeyah 7/273]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">21 –  From Sufyan at-Thawri who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Zuhd of the Dunyaa is Zuhd of the people, and the foremost of that is Zuhd of yourself.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Seera ‘Aalaam 7/268]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">22 – From Abdullaah bin ‘Awn who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed those who were before us would give to the Dunyaa that which was left over after from their Hereafter, and you give to the Hereafter that which is left over from your Dunyaa.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Compiled and Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Indeed Allaah hates every person who is arrogant, rude, rough, and is greedy, thinks he knows it all and shouts loudly in the market places, who is like a corpse during the night and a donkey during the day, knowledgeable about worldly affairs, ignorant about the matters of the hereafter.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Da’eef</em> – ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth ad-Da’eefah’ no. 2304</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth which has been narrated by Ibn Hibban and al-Bayhaqi, it has been declared weak by Shaykh al-Albaani.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Initially the Shaykh had authenticated this hadeeth in ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth as-Saheehah’ no.195.  However, the Shaykh retracted and declared it to be weak.  He removed it from ‘Silsilah as-Saheehah’ and placed it in ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth ad-Da’eefah’ no.2304.  The Shaykh also declared it <em>Da’eef</em> in his book ‘Daeef Targheeb wa Tarheeb’ no.378.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Although this hadeeth can be found authenticated in his book ‘Saheeh al-Jami as-Sagheer’, the Shaykh didn’t rely upon this book since it had been in the hands of untrustworthy publishers.  The Shaykh never amended the book. However the Shaykh in latter part of his life began a journey to divide the Ahadeeth of ‘Saheeh  al-Jami as-Sagheer’  into a more precise division of hadeeth  terminology of<em>‘Saheeh  li dhaatihi</em>‘ ( authentic by itself) and <em>‘Saheeh li ghayreehi</em>‘ (authentic due to other hadeeth) and <em>‘hasan li dhaatihi</em>‘ (hasan by itself) and <em>‘hasan li ghayreehi’</em> (<em>hasan</em> due to other hadeeth).  This is a colossal task in itself. The Shaykh – may Allah have mercy on him- was sadly unable to complete this work.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh commented on the hadeeth after declaring it weak by saying: “how applicable is this hadeeth – even though it is weak – to those <em>kuffar</em> who do not pay any importance to their hereafter, despite them having knowledge of many worldly affairs, Allaah<em>Ta’ala</em>  says about them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong>They know only the outside appearance of the life of the world, and they are heedless of the Hereafter.</strong>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ Soorah ar-Rum : 7 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many Muslims have a large percentage of this characteristic in them. Those who spend their days roaming around in the market places, shouting and yelling in those places, and they neglect the obligatory actions and prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&lt;&lt; So woe unto those performers of prayers (hypocrites), who delay their <em>Salaat</em> from their stated fixed times, those who do good deeds only to be seen (of men), and refuse <em>Al-Ma’un</em>(small kindnesses</strong>)&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Soorah Maa&#8217;oon : 4-7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from: ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth ad-Da’eefah’ no. 2304</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>What Can This Eternal Life be Bought With?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">WHEN A PERSON THINKS about the life of this world before entering it, he considers it long. Likewise, when he thinks about it after leaving it, he sees a long period of time and knows that the stay in the grave is long. When he thinks about the Day of judgment, he knows that its fifty thousand years long, and when he thinks about Paradise and Hell, he knows that they will never end.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now, when he goes back to look at the time spent in this world, lets say 60 years, he can see that thirty of it is spent sleeping, fifteen or so is spent in childhood and most of what&#8217;s left goes to chasing after desires, food and money. When he accounts for what is left, he finds that much of it is nothing but showing off and heedlessness. The price of eternal life is the hours of his life, but what is left of them for him to buy it with?!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The first type of craving for wealth is that a person has extreme love for wealth and also relentlessly exerts efforts to attain it &#8211; via means which are lawful &#8211; being excessive in that, striving hard and making painstaking efforts and toiling in order to attain it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been reported that this hadeeth was in response to the appearance of some elements of th is, as at-Tabaraanee reports from `Aasim ibn `Adiyy, radiyallaahu `anhu, who said, `I bought a hundred shares from the shares of Khaybar and that reached the Prophet sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam so he said, <b>&#8220;Two ravenous wolves remaining amongst sheep whose owner has lost them will not be more harmful than a Muslim`s seeking after wealth and status is to his Deen.”</b> [It is quoted by al-Haithumee in Majma` uz-Zawaa`id (10/250) and he attributed it to at-Tabaraanee in al-Awsat and said, &#8220;Its isnaad is hasan (good).&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing more to chasing after wealth than the wastage of a person&#8217;s noble life for that which has no value. Instead he could have earned a high rank (in Paradise) and everlasting bliss, but he lost this due to his craving after provision &#8211; which had already been assured to him and allotted to him, and it was not possible for anything to come to him except what was decreed for him &#8211; then on top of this he does not benefit from that, but rather abandons it and leaves it for someone else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He departs from that and leaves it behind so that he will be the one held accountable for it, yet someone else benefits from it. So in reality he is only gathering it for someone who will not praise him for that, whilst he himself goes on to One who will not excuse him for that &#8211; this itself would indeed be enough to show the blameworthiness of this craving.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The person who has this craving wastes his valuable time and engages himself in that which is of no benefit to himself &#8211; in journeying and exposing himself to dangers in order to amass that which will only benefit someone else, so it is as is said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;So one who spends his days in gathering wealth<br />
Out of fear of poverty &#8211; then he has achieved only poverty.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was said to a wise man, &#8220;So and so has amassed wealth,&#8221; so he said, &#8220;Then has he amassed days in which to spend it?&#8221; It was said, &#8220;No.&#8221; So he said, &#8220;Then he has amassed nothing!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was also said in some narrations from the People of the Book, &#8220;Provision has already been allotted and the one greedy for wealth is deprived. Son of Aadam! If you spend your life in seeking after this world then when will you seek after the Hereafter?&#8221; &#8220;If you are unable to do good deeds in this world, then what will you do on the Day of Resurrection?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas`ood, radiyallaahu `anhumaa, said, &#8220;Certain faith (yaqeen) is that you do not make the people happy by angering Allaah, and that you do not envy anyone for that which Allaah has provided, and that you do not blame anyone for something which Allaah has not given you &#8211; since provision will not be brought on by a person&#8217;s craving after it, nor will it be repelled by a person&#8217;s disliking it. Indeed Allaah through His Justice has made joy and happiness dependant upon having certain faith and contentment, and He has made worries and sorrow spring from doubt and displeasure.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the Salaf (predecessors) said: &#8220;Since predecree (qadr) is a reality then craving is futile. Since treachery exists in people&#8217;s characters then trusting everybody is to expose oneself to humiliation. Since death awaits everybody, then being satisfied with this world is foolishness.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdul-Waahid ibn Zayd (from the successors of the Taabi`een of Basrah, died after 150H) used to swear by Allaah that a person&#8217;s craving after this world was more fearful to him than his worst enemy. He also used to say, “O my brothers! Do not grow up craving after his riches and increase in earnings or wealth, rather look upon him with the eye of one who detests that he is preoccupying himself with that which will cause his ruin tomorrow in the Place of Return &#8211; and is proud with that.&#8221; He also used to say, &#8220;Craving is of two types: Craving which is an affliction and craving which is beneficial. As for the craving which is beneficial, then it is one&#8217;s desire for that which is obedience to Allaah, and as for the craving which is an affliction then it is a person&#8217;s craving after this world.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Craving after this world torments a person, he is preoccupied and does not attain joy or pleasure whilst amassing &#8211; since he is preoccupied. He does not find time &#8211; due to his love of this world – for the Hereafter, and is preoccupied with that which will perish and forgets that which will abide and remain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this regard a person said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Do not envy a brother who craves after riches –<br />
rather look upon him with aversion.<br />
Indeed the one who craves is preoccupied with his<br />
wealth from having any happiness due to his belongings.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Someone else said in this regard:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“O gatherer and miserly one being watched closely by time<br />
which is wondering which of its doors it should close.<br />
You have gathered wealth, but think have you gathered for it &#8211;<br />
O gatherer of wealth &#8211; days in which you can spend it.<br />
Wealth is hoarded away with you for those who will inherit it &#8211;<br />
The wealth is not yours except on the day when you spend it.<br />
Satisfaction is for the one who settles in its neighbourhood<br />
And in its shade he finds no worries to disturb him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A wise person wrote to a brother of his who desired this world: &#8220;To proceed, you have become one who craves after this world. It will serve you whilst taking you away from it with accidents, illnesses, calamities and infirmity. It is as if you have not seen one who craves prevented from what he desires, nor one who shuns this world granted provision, nor one who died despite having great wealth, nor one who is fully satisfied in this world with a small amount.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A desert Arab rebuked a brother of his for covetousness, saying, &#8220;O my brother you are a seeker and one sought. You are being sought by One whom you cannot escape, and you are seeking that for which you have been sufficed. O brother, it is as if you have not seen one who craves being prevented, nor one who shuns the world being granted provision.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A wise man said, &#8220;The people who have the greatest degree of restlessness are the envious, those who have the greatest degree of happiness are the contented. Those who persevere most through suffering are those who are covetous. Those who have the simplest and most pleasant life are those who most strongly refuse this world. The one who will suffer the greatest regret is the scholar whose actions contradict his knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second type of craving after wealth is that in addition to what has been mentioned in the first type, he also seeks wealth through unlawful means and withholds people&#8217;s rights &#8211; then this is definitely blameworthy greed and covetousness. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And whoever is saved from his covetousness, such are those who are successful.” [Soorah al-Hashr (59):9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported in Sunan Abee Daawood from `Abdullaah ibn `Amr, radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu, from the Prophet sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam that he said, &#8220;Beware of greed (avarice) for indeed greed (avarice) destroyed those who came before you. It ordered them to cut off ties of relationship so they cut off ties of relationship, and it ordered them to be miserly so they were miserly, and it ordered them to commit sins so they committed sins.&#8221; [Reported by Aboo Daawood (transl. vol.2, p.445, no.1694), and al-Haakim (1/415) who declared it saheeh and adh-Dhahabee agreed, and Ahmad reports it (2/159, 195) with similar wording. I (Badr `Abdullah al-Badr) say: Its isnaad is saheeh.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported in Saheeh Muslim from Jaabir, radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu, that the Prophet sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam said, &#8220;Beware of greed (avarice), since greed (avarice) destroyed those who came before you. It led them to shed their blood and make lawful what was forbidden for them.&#8221; [Reported by Muslim (transl. vol.4, p.1366, no. 6248) and others, an-Nawawee said in explanation of the hadeeth, &#8220;al-Qaadee `Iyaad said: It is possible that this destruction was the destruction of those whose blood was spilled who were mentioned here, and it is possible that it is destruction in the Hereafter &#8211; and this is more apparent, and it is possible that it means destruction in both this world and the Hereafter. A number of people have said that avarice/greed (<i>shuhh</i>) is more severe than miserliness (<i>bukhl</i>) and causes the person to withhold to a greater degree. Some say that it is miserliness combined with covetousness. Some say that miserliness is with reference to specific actions whereas avarice/greed is general. Some say that miserliness is in particular actions and avarice/greed is with reference to wealth and good actions. Others say that avarice/greed is desiring that which one does not possess and being miserly about what one does possess.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the scholars say, &#8220;Avarice is eager craving which causes a person to take things which are not lawful for him, and to withhold the rights of others. Its reality is that a person craves that which Allaah has forbidden and prohibited him from, and that one is not contented with the wealth and womenfolk and whatever else Allaah has made lawful for him. So Allaah, the Most High, has made lawful for us that which is good from foods, drinks, clothing and women and has forbidden us to acquire these things except by lawful means and He made lawful for us the blood and wealth of the Unbelievers and those fighting against us. He also forbade us from everything impure from foods, drinks, clothing and women, and He forbade us from seizing people&#8217;s wealth and spilling their blood unjustly. So he who limits himself to that which is permitted for him is a Believer, and one who goes beyond that into what he has been forbidden &#8211; then this is blameworthy avarice which is inconsistent with <i>Eemaan</i> (true faith in belief, word and action).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore the Prophet sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam informed that avarice causes a person to cut off relations, commit sins and to be miserly &#8211; and miserliness is a person&#8217;s clinging on greedily to what he has in his hand. Whereas avarice is seeking to obtain that which does not belong to him unjustly and wrongfully &#8211; whether it is wealth or something else. It is even said that it is the head of all sins &#8211; this was how Ibn Mas`ood, radiyallaahu `anhu, and others from the Salaf explained avarice and greed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from this the meaning of the hadeeth of Aboo Hurairah, radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu, will be understood. He reports that the Prophet sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam said, &#8220;Avarice (<i>shuhh</i>) and <i>Eemaan</i> will not combine in the heart of a Believer.&#8221; [This is part of a hadeeth whose wording is, &#8220;Dust in the way of Allaah and the smoke of Hell-Fire will never combine in the belly of a servant, nor will avarice and Eemaan ever combine in the heart of a servant.&#8221; It is reported by Ibn Abee Shaibah (5/344), Ahmad, an-Nasaa&#8217;ee (6/13,14)&#8230; and its chain of narration is hasan lighairihi (good due to supports).] Also in another hadeeth from the Prophet sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam he said &#8220;The best of <i> Eemaan</i> is self-restraint (<i>sabr</i>) and compliance/liberality (<i>musaamahah</i>).&#8221; [This hadeeth has been reported from four Companions: (i) `Umayr ibn Qataadah al-Laythee, by al-Bukhaaree in at-Taareekhul-Kabeer (3/2/530) and al-Haakim (3/ 626), (ii) Jaabir ibn `Abdillaah &#8211; by Ibn Abee Shaibah in al-Eemaan (no.43) and Ibn Hibbaan in al-Majrooheen (3/136), (iii) `Amr ibn `Abasah &#8211; by Ahmad (4/375) and (iv) `Ubaadah ibn as-Saamit &#8211; by Ahmad (5/319), and the hadeeth is saheeh due to these chains &#8211; and Allaah knows best.] <i>Sabr</i> here has been explained to be withholding oneself from forbidden things, and <i>musaamahah</i> as the carrying out of the obligatory actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also the word <i>shuhh</i> (avarice) may sometimes be used to mean <i>bukhl</i> (miserliness) and vice-versa, however in origin they are different in meaning, as we have mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the person&#8217;s craving after wealth reaches this level then the deficiency it causes in a person&#8217;s Religion is clear &#8211; since failing to fulfill what is obligatory and falling into what is forbidden reduce one&#8217;s Religion and <i> Eemaan</i> without a doubt to the point that nothing but a little remains of it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imam Ibn Kathir<br />
</strong>Tafsir Ibn Katheer (Abridged) Volume 9<br />
© Darussalam 2000</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Know that the life of this world is only play and amusement, pomp and mutual boasting among you, and rivalry in respect of wealth and children.  (It is) like a rain (Ghayth), thereof the growth is pleasing to the tiller; afterwards it dries up and you see it turning yellow; then it becomes straw.  But in the Hereafter (there is) a severe torment, and (there is) forgiveness from Allah and (His) pleasure.  And the life of this world is only a deceiving enjoyment.&#8221; [57:20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted degrades the significance of this life and belittles it by saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;that the life of this world is only play and amusement, pomp and mutual boasting among you, and rivalry in respect of wealth and children.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, this is the significance of this life to its people, just as He said in another Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Beautified for men is the love of things they covet; women, children, much of gold and silver (wealth), branded beautiful horses, cattle and well-tilled land.  This is the pleasure of the present world&#8217;s life; but Allah has the excellent return with Him.&#8221; ( 3:14 )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted also sets a parable for this life, declaring that its joys are fading and its delights are perishable, saying that life is,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Like a rain (Ghayth),&#8221; which is the rain that comes down to mankind, after they had felt despair.  Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And He is it Who sends down the Ghayth (rain) after they have despaired.&#8221; (42:28)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;thereof the growth is pleasing to the tiller;&#8221; meaning that farmers admire the vegetation that grows in the aftermath of rain.  And just as farmers admire vegetation, the disbelievers admire this life; they are the most eager to acquire the traits of life, and life is most dear to them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;afterwards it dries up and you see it turning yellow; then it becomes straw.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, that vegetation soon turns yellow in color, after being fresh and green.  After that, the green fades away and becomes scattered pieces of dust.  This is the parable of this worldly life, it starts young, then matures and then turns old and feeble.  This is also the parable of mankind in this life; they are young and strong in the beginning.  In this stage of life, they look youthful and handsome.  Slowly, they begin growing older, their mannerism changes and their strength weakens.  They then grow old and feeble; moving becomes difficult for them, while doing easy things becomes beyond their ability.  Allah the Exalted said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allah is He Who created you in (a state of) weakness, then gave you strength after weakness, then after strength gave (you) weakness and gray hair.  He creates what He wills.  And He is the All-Knowing, the All-Powerful.&#8221; (30:54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This parable indicates the near demise of this life and the imminent end of it, while in contrast, the Hereafter is surely coming.  Those who hear this parable should, therefore, be aware of the significance of the Hereafter and feel eagerness in the goodness that it contains,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;But in the Hereafter (there is) a severe torment, and (there is) forgiveness from Allah and (His) pleasure.  And the life of this world is only a deceiving enjoyment.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, surely, the Hereafter that will certainly come contains two things either severe punishment or forgiveness from Allah and His good pleasure.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And the life of this world is only a deceiving enjoyment.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, this life is only a form of enjoyment that deceives those who incline to it.  Surely, those who recline to this life will admire it and feel that it is dear to them, so much so, that they might think that this is the only life, no life or dwelling after it.  Yet, in reality, this life is insignificant as compared to the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah said that the Messenger of Allah, sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam, said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; Paradise is nearer to any of you than the strap of his shoe, and so is the (Hell) Fire.&#8221; [Ahmad 1:387]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari collected this Hadith through the narration of Ath-Thawri [Fath al-Bari 11:328].  This Hadith indicates the close proximity of both good and evil in relation to mankind.  If this is the case, then this is the reason Allah the Exalted encouraged mankind to rush to perform acts of righteousness and obedience and to avoid the prohibitions.  By doing so, their sins and errors will be forgiven and they will acquire rewards and an exalted status.  Allah the Exalted said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Race with one another in hastening towards forgiveness from your Lord, and Paradise the width whereof is as the width of the heaven and the earth.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And march forth in the way (to) forgiveness from your Lord, and for Paradise as wide as the heavens and the earth, prepared for those who have Taqwa.&#8221; (3:133)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said here,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;prepared for those who believe in Allah and His Messengers.  That is the grace of Allah which He bestows on whom He is pleased with.  And Allah is the Owner of the great bounty.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, &#8220;This, that Allah has qualified them for, is all a part of His favor, bounty and compassion.&#8221;  We mentioned a Hadith collected in the Sahih in which the poor emigrants said to the Messenger, sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger!  The wealthy people will get higher grades and permanent enjoyment.&#8221;  He asked, &#8220;Why is that?&#8221;  They said, &#8220;They pray like us and fast as we do.  However, they give in charity, whereas we cannot do that, and they free servants, whereas we cannot afford it.&#8221;  The Prophet, sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam, said, &#8220;Shall I tell you of a good deed that, if you acted upon, you would catch up with those who have surpassed you? None would overtake you and be better than you, except those who might do the same.  Say, &#8220;Glorious is Allah,&#8221; Allah is Most Great&#8221;, and &#8220;Praise be to Allah&#8221;, thirty three times each after every prayer.&#8221;  They later came back and said, &#8220;Our wealthy brethren heard what we did and they started doing the same.&#8221;  Allah&#8217;s Messenger, sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam, said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This is the favor that He gives to whom He wills.&#8221; [Muslim 1:416]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>a) AbdurRahmaan bin Ali bin Muhammad Ibn Jawzi (d. 598 A.H.) said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Zuhd is not just leaving wealth or giving wealth to show that you are generous and strong, nor to get people’s hearts to incline to you, on the contrary Zuhd is leaving worldly things due to having the knowledge that it is insignificant in relation to the immeasurable value of the Hereafter.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Taken from: ‘Mukhtasir Minhaj al-Qasideen’ p.324]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>b) Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751 A.H.) -Rahimullaah- said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The intent of Zuhd is not rejection of having possessions, since in fact Sulayman and Dawood –alayhim as-Salaam- were the ones who had the most Zuhd from amongst the people at their time and they had been endowed with wealth, land and women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- had definitely the most Zuhd above all mankind, and he had nine women. ‘Ali bin Abi Taalib, AbdurRahman bin ‘Awf, Zubayr and Uthmaan -Radi Allaahu anhum- were from those who had Zuhd even though they had wealth, and there were many others like them.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Taken from ‘Madarij as-Salikeen’ by Ibn al-Qayyim (d. 751 A.H.) Volume 2/13-14)]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>c) Al-Hasan said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Having Zuhd of the Dunyaa is not prohibiting oneself from that which is Halaal, nor by wasting money, but it is knowing that what is in Allaah’s Hand is more trustworthy than one’s own-self and what he has in his hand (i.e. possesses).’</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Taken from ‘Madarij as-Salikeen’ by Ibn al-Qayyim (d. 751 A.H.) 285]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>d) Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali (d.795) -Rahimullaah- said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abu Sulayman said: <span style="color:#008000;">‘Do not testify for anyone that he has Zuhd, since indeed Zuhd is in the heart.’</span></p>
</blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn al-Qayyim</strong> (Rahimahullah) narrated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported that in Egypt, there was a man who would maintain the mosques, making the call to prayer, etc. He was, by all outward means, an obedient person and devout worshipper.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One day, as he usually would, he ascended the minaret to make the call to prayer. At the base of the minaret, there was a Christian woman standing. He saw her, and was seduced by her looks. So, he descended the minaret, went to her, and entered her home. She said to him: “Who are you, and what do you want?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied: “I want you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said: “Why?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: “You have enslaved my eyes, and you have captured my heart.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said: “I will never answer your desire in a doubtful or suspicious manner.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: “Ok, so, I will marry you, then.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said: “You are a Muslim, and I am a Christian. My father will never allow me to marry you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: “So, I will become a Christian.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said: “If you wish to do so, go ahead.“</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the man became a Christian in order to marry this woman, and lived with the woman’s family in her house. Later on that day, however, he was on the roof of the house. He fell from the roof and died without even having enjoyed his new bride. So, he lost the woman, and he lost his religion.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Source</strong>: AL-FAWA&#8217;ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings, Imam Ibn al Qayyim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The body of the son of Adam was created from the earth and his soul from the government of Heaven and then they were joined. If he is hungry, stays awake, and keeps his body busy in serving Allah, his soul will find itself lighter and more peaceful so that it would long for the place from which it was created and miss its heavenly world. But if he secures food, blessings, sleep, and rest, the body will incline to remain at the place from which it was created and the soul would be pulled along with it and be in a prison. If it was not for the fact that it would get used to that prison, it would ask for help, as a tortured person does, to find relief from the pain resulting from the separation and departure from its own world from which it was created.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In general, the more the body is light, the more the soul will be light and seek its heavenly world, and the more the body is heavy and seeks desires and relief, the heavier the soul will be and it will come down from its heavenly world and become lower and more earthly. You may see the soul of a man in Heaven while his body is on the earth. Another person serves Allah with his body and his soul is low and wandering about in lowly matters. When the soul separates from the body, it would either catch up with its high or low place. With the high, it would  find every blessing, happiness, beauty, pleasure, and good living while with the low it would find every distress, grief, suffering, sadness, and bad and difficult thing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says, which means,<br />
<em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;But whosoever turns away from My Reminder (i.e. neither believes in this Qur&#8217;an nor acts on its orders, etc.) verily, for him is a life of hardship.&#8221;</span></em>(Taha, 20:124)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;My Reminder&#8221; is His words, which He revealed to His Messenger, and &#8220;turns away&#8221; is by neglecting and abandoning working according to these words, and the majority of explanations saw that &#8220;life of hardship&#8221; is torture in the grave. Ibn Mas&#8217;ud, Abu Hurairah, Abu Sa&#8217;eed AI-Khudry, and Ibn &#8216;Abbas agreed on that and it has a traceable hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This life of hardship is in return for relieving the body and soul with pleasures, desires and relief. The more you enrich the soul, it will restrain the heart until you live a life of hardship, and the more you restrain the soul, it will enrich the heart until that heart will be delighted and relieved. Hardship in this worldly life, following piety will find its relief in partition and the Hereafter, and relief in this worldly life following desires will find its hardship in the partition and the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should choose one of the two: the better, more pleasant, and more lasting.You may distress the body in order to relieve the soul but do not distress the soul to relieve the body; relief and distress of the soul is greater and more lasting while relief and distress of the body is shorter and easier.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A Precious Gem: This Life of Deception</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This worldly life is like an unchaste woman, who is not satisfied with one husband. So! be satisfied with whatever Allah grants you from this worldy life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Walking thereon is like walking in a land that is filled with beasts, and water that teams with crocodiles. That which causes delight, turns to be the source of grief. Pain is found in the midst of pleasures, and delights are derived from its sorrows. As a bird sees the wheat, so does one&#8217;s insight perceive polytheism, while vain desires render its holder blind. Lusts were granted in abundance to humans, but those who believed in the unseen turned away from them! while those who follow their lusts were caused to regret.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first category, are those, in which Allah says,which means, &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">They are on (true) guidance from their Lord, and they are the successful.</span>&#8221; (AI-Baqarah, 2:5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the other category, are those to whom Allah says which means, <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;(0 you disbelievers)! Eat and enjoy yourselves (in this worldly life) for a little while. Verily, you are the Mujrimun (polytheists, disbelievers, sinners, criminals, etc.).&#8221;</span> (AI-Mursalat,77:46)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the successful ones are aware of the reality of this worldly life being sure of the inferiority of its degree, they overcame their vain desires for the sake of the Hereafter. They have been awakened from their heedlessness to remember what their enemies took from them during their period of idleness. Whenever they perceive the distant journey they must undertake, they remember their aim, so it appears easy for them. Whenever life becomes bitter, they remember this verse, in which Allah says,  which means,<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;This is your Day which you were promised&#8221;.</span> (Al Anbiya&#8217;, 21:103)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Khâlid b. ‘Umayr Al-’Adawî reports, ‘Utbah b. Ghazwân – Allâh be pleased with him – once gave us a sermon. He praised Allâh, then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The life of this world has announced its departure and is quickly turning away, and nothing remains of it save the likes of the last drop of water in a vessel as its possessor tries to catch it. You are moving on to an abode that has no end, so move on with the best [deeds] that you have. For it has been said to us that a rock can be dropped from the edge of Hell and fall for seventy years without reaching the bottom. Yet, by Allâh, it will be filled. Do you not then wonder? And it has been said to us that a single entrance to Paradise is as wide as a journey of forty years, yet there will come a day when it will be crowded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have seen myself as the seventh of seven [followers of] Allâh’s Messenger – Allâh’s peace and blessings be upon him; we had no food save the leaves of trees which put sores round our mouths. I once got a cloak which I tore in half to share with Sa’d b. Mâlik: I used half as my waist-wrap and he used the other. And yet today, there is not one of us except he has become a governor over some city – and I seek refuge with Allâh that I consider myself great and important when I am small in front of Allâh. Verily there was never prophet-hood except that it gradually changed until it ended up being a kingship, and verily you will see what the governors after us are like.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Surah As-Saffaat</strong>  &#8211; <span style="color:#008000;">(50. Then they will turn to one another, mutually questioning.) (51. A speaker of them will say: &#8220;Verily, I had a companion (in the world),&#8221;) (52. &#8220;Who used to say: `Are you among those who believe.) (53.

Truly, this is the supreme success!) (61. For the like of this let the workers work.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They mentioned the story of two men among the Children of Israel who were partners and who are included in the meaning of this Ayah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Ja`far bin Jarir recorded that Furat bin Tha`labah Al-Bahrani said concerning the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Verily, I had a companion)</span> [ 37. As-Saffaat verse 51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There were two men who were partners and had collected eight thousand Dinars. One of them had a craft and the other did not. The one who had a craft said to the other, `You do not have a craft, so I think I will divide the money with you and leave you.&#8217; So he left him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Then the first man bought a house</strong>, belonging to a king who had died, for the price of one thousand Dinars. He called his companion and showed him the house, saying, `What do you think of this house I bought it for one thousand Dinars.&#8217; He said, `How beautiful it is.&#8217; When he went out he said, `O Allah, this companion of mine has bought this house for one thousand Dinars; I ask You for one of the houses of Paradise &#8211; and he gave one thousand Dinars in charity.&#8217; Then as much time passed as Allah willed should pass.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first man married a woman</strong> with a dowry of one thousand Dinars, and invited his companion and made food for him. When he came, he said, `I have married this woman with a dowry of one thousand Dinars.&#8217; He replied; `How beautiful this is.&#8217; And when he left, he said, `O Lord, my companion has married a woman with a dowry of one thousand Dinars; I ask you for a wife from among Al-Hur Al-`Iyn&#8217; &#8212; and he gave one thousand Dinars in charity. Then as much time passed as Allah willed should pass.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Then the first man bought two gardens for two thousand Dinars</strong>, then he called his companion and showed them to him. He said, `I have bought these two gardens for two thousand Dinars.&#8217; He replied, `How beautiful this is.&#8217; When he came out, he said, `O Lord, my companion has bought two gardens for two thousand Dinars; I ask you for two gardens in Paradise&#8217; &#8212; and he gave two thousand Dinars in charity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the angel came to them and took their souls in death. He took the one who had given his money in charity and put him in a house that he liked. There, there was a woman who was so beautiful that the ground shinned under her, then he (the angel) took him to two gardens and gave him other things which are known only to Allah. The man said, `This is like a man who has such and such.&#8217; The angel said, `That is exactly what it is; this house, these gardens and this wife are all for you.&#8217; The man said, `I had a companion who used to say: Are you among those who believe&#8217; It was said to him, `He is in Hell.&#8217; He said, `Will you look down&#8217; So he looked down and saw him in the midst of Hell. At this, he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(By Allah! You have nearly ruined me. Had it not been for the grace of my Lord, I would certainly have been among those brought forth (to Hell).)&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn Mas’ud</strong> said to his companions, ‘You fast and pray more than the Companions of Muhammad (sal’Allahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) but they were better than you.’ They asked, ‘How so?’ He replied, ‘<strong>They were more abstinent of this world and desirous of the Hereafter</strong>.’ Hence he indicated that the superiority of the Companions lay in the attachment of their hearts to the Hereafter, their desire for it, their turning away from this world, and their thinking little of it even if it be readily available to them. Their hearts were empty of the world and filled with the Hereafter. This is what they inherited from their Prophet (sal’Allahu ‘alayhi wa sallam). He (sal’Allahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) was one whose heart was most devoid of the world and most attached to Allah and the Abode of the Hereafter, this despite his outwardly interacting with the creation, fulfilling the duties of Prophethood, and implementing the politics of religion and world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the state of the Khulafa who came after him and those who followed them in goodness such as al-Hasan and ‘Umar ibn ‘Abdul-‘Aziz. There were, in their times, those who fasted more than them and prayed more than them, but their hearts had not attained the levels of theirs in terms of leaving the world and turning to the Hereafter, and settling there.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Jabir b. Abdullah reported that Allah&#8217;s Apostle (Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam) happened to walk through the bazar coming from the side of &#8216;Aliya and the people were on both his sides.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There he found a dead lamb with very short ears. He took hold of his ear and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who amongst you would like to have this for a dirham?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: We do not like to have it even for less than that as it is of no use to us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: Do you wish to have it (free of any cost)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: By Allah, even if it were alive (we would not have liked to possess that), for there is detect in it as its ear is very short; now it is dead also.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: By Allah, this world is more insignificant in the eye of Allah as it (this dead lamb) is in your eye.</p>
