<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Day of Resurrection: The Tenth Event</strong></span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Bridge</strong></span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabic word صِرَاط (Ṣirāṭ) is the bridge stretched over Hell over which people will cross to get to Paradise. About it, Allah ( تعالى ) says:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِن مِّنكُمْ إِلَّا وَارِدُهَا ۚ كَانَ عَلَىٰ رَبِّكَ حَتْمًا مَّقْضِيًّا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And there is none of you except that he will pass over it. This is with your Lord a decree which must be accomplished</span>.[Sūrah Maryam, 19:71]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abdullāh Ibn Mas’ūd, Qatādah, and Zayd Ibn Aslam explained this verse to mean the crossing of the bridge. Others, including Ibn ‘Abbās, explained that it describes those who will enter the fire but will be saved from it.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ يُضْرَبُ الْجِسْرُ عَلَى جَهَنَّمَ ، وَتَحِلُّ الشَّفَاعَةُ وَيَقُولُونَ : اللَّهُمَّ سَلِّمْ سَلِّمْ</span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the bridge will be placed over Hell and intercession will be permitted. They (the messengers) will say, “Oh Allah, save (us), save (us).” [<span style="color:#ff0000;">113</span>]</p>





<p style="text-align:justify;">Scholars have differed as to the exact nature of this bridge. Some say it is a wide path over which people will cross according to the deeds they did in this life. They say it is wide because the word “bridge,” taken at face value, means just that and because Allah’s messenger ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) described it as being slippery and elusive. They understood that the bridge must be somewhat wide because a very narrow path would not be described with the specific Arabic words (slippery and elusive) that the prophet used. When asked about the bridge, the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَدْحَضَةٌ مَزِلَّةٌ عَلَيْهِ خَطَاطِيفُ وَكَلالِيبُ وَحَسَكَةٌ مُفَلْطَحَةٌ لَهَا شَوْكَةٌ عُقَيْفَاءُ</span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;"><span style="color:#808000;">It is slippery, elusive with hooks and grapples, and broad spikes and curved thorns</span>.</span>[Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the ḥadīth narrated by Abū Hurayrah, the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَبِهِ كَلالِيبُ مِثْلُ شَوْكِ السَّعْدَانِ غَيْرَ أَنَّهَا لا يَعْلَمُ قَدْرَ عِظَمِهَا إِلاَّ اللَّهُ فَتَخْطَفُ </span><span style="color:#000000;">النَّاسَ بِأَعْمَالِهِمْ</span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">It has hooks like the thorns of al-Sa’dān (a place in Najd) except that no one but Allah knows the huge size of them. They will seize people according to their deeds</span>.[Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Other scholars said no, it is actually a very narrow bridge just as has come in a ḥadīth narrated by Abū Sa’īd al-Khudrī ( رضي الله عنه ) in which he said:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">بَلَغَنِي أَنَّ الصِّرَاطَ أَحَدُّ مِنَ السَّيْفِ وَأَدَقُّ مِنَ الشَّعْرَةِ</span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">He informed (or: It has reached) me that the bridge is sharper that a sword and thinner than a hair.</span>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">116</span>]</p>
<p>

</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Here we come to a question: How is it possible for people to actually pass over a bridge like this? The answer is that the events and things to occur in the hereafter cannot be compared to or measured based solely on what we know of things of this life. Allah is capable of anything, and we do not know exactly how people will cross it. Will they cross in groups or one at a time? Allah knows best.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">But regarding this issue—whether the bridge is wide or narrow—it is not incumbent on people to accept one position over the other because both groups of scholars have strong points.</p>



<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Crossing the Bridge</span></strong></h3>



<p style="text-align:justify;">No one will cross the bridge except the believers. As for the disbelievers, they will be taken straight to the fire. The believers will cross it according to their deeds based on the ḥadīth narrated by Abū Sa’īd al-Khudrī ( رضي الله عنه ) that the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَيَمُرُّ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ كَطَرْفِ الْعَيْنِ وَكَالْبَرْقِ وَكَالرِّيحِ وَكَالطَّيْرِ وَكَأَجَاوِيدِ الْخَيْلِ  </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَالرِّكَابِ فَنَاجٍ مُسَلَّمٌ وَمَخْدُوشٌ مُرْسَلٌ وَمَكْدُوسٌ فِي نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ</span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">The believers will cross: some as fast as the blink of an eye, some like lightning, some like the wind, some like a bird, some like horses, and some as fast as camels. Some people will be safe a secure, some will be scratched but delivered, and others will fall into the fire of Hell</span>.[Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">The speed at which a person crosses is obviously not by his choice. If it were, naturally everyone would want to cross quickly. Rather, the passage across is according to the speed at which he used to accept religious teachings in this life. So whoever was always quick to accept the teachings of the messengers, he will pass quickly over the bridge. Whoever was slow to accept them will pass slowly over the bridge. It is a suitable reward and the reward is according to the deed.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people will be seized by hooks that are on the bridge and, again, this will only be according to their deeds. As for the prophet’s statement, “others will fall into the fire of Hell,” it is understood that the fire into which sinners will fall is the same fire the disbelievers will be in. However, these believing sinners will still not experience the same punishment as disbelievers will. Some scholars have even said that this fire will be cool and safe for them just as the fire was cool and peaceful on Prophet Abraham. [<span style="color:#ff0000;">118</span>]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">However, what is more apparent is that this is not the case; the fire will likely be hot and painful but not as intense as the heat the disbelievers in Allah will experience. As a side note, the points on the body upon which believers prostrate during prayer will never be touched by the fire just as it has been reported by the prophet in “Ṣaḥīḥ al- Bukhārī” and “Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim.” [<span style="color:#ff0000;">119</span>] The places of prostration are those that touch the ground: the forehead, nose, palms, knees, and the toes.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">In a ḥadīth in “Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim,” the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) also said:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">تَجْرِي بِهِمْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ وَنَبِيُّكُمْ قَائِمٌ عَلَى الصِّرَاطِ يَقُولُ : رَبِّ سَلِّمْ سَلِّمْ حَتَّى تَعْجِزَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">أَعْمَالُ الْعِبَادِ حَتَّى يَجِيءَ الرَّجُلُ فَلا يَسْتَطِيعُ السَّيْرَ إِلاَّ زَحْفًا</span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Their deeds will carry them (over the bridge) while your prophet is standing on the bridge saying, “My Lord, save (them), save (them).” Some servants’ deeds will hinder them so much that a man will be unable to pass over except while crawling.</span> [Recorded by Muslim.]</p>





<p style="text-align:justify;">And in “Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī:”</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">حَتَّى يَمُرَّ آخِرُهُمْ يُسْحَبُ سَحْبًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">…until the last of them crosses being dragged.</span>[Recorded by al-Bukhārī]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">The first of the prophets to cross the bridge will be Muhammad ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) and the first of all religious nations will be his nation as the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَأَكُونُ أَنَا وَأُمَّتِي أَوَّلَ مَنْ يُجِيزُهَا ، وَلا يَتَكَلَّمُ يَوْمَئِذٍ إِلاَّ الرُّسُلُ ، وَدَعْوَى الرُّسُلِ </span><span style="color:#000000;">يَوْمَئِذٍ : اللَّهُمَّ سَلِّمْ سَلِّمْ</span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">I and my nation will be the first to be allowed to cross it. On that day, no one will speak except the messengers and the prayer of the messengers that day will be, “Oh Allah, save (us), save (us)!</span> [Recorded by al-Bukhārī]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah says, “After they cross, they will stop at a bridge/platform between Paradise and the fire and they will settle any unresolved issues between themselves.”</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">This area is a small bridge or platform, and this settling of disagreements between them is not the major settling of affairs and retribution that occurs between people on the Day of Resurrection. Instead, this particular reconciliation is to resolve any bad feelings, grudges, or anger that may still remain in people’s hearts. So in a sense, this is a period of purification because the major settling of disagreements does not necessarily remove all feelings of resentment within people’s hearts.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">So this bridge or platform between Paradise and Hell is to purify the hearts so that the believers enter Paradise having no bad feelings for one another as Allah ( تعالى ) says:</p>





<h2><span style="color:#000000;">ادْخُلُوهَا بِسَلَامٍ آمِنِينَ وَنَزَعْنَا مَا فِي صُدُورِهِم مِّنْ غِلٍّ إِخْوَانًا عَلَىٰ سُرُرٍ مُّتَقَابِلِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Enter it with peace, safe and secure. And we will remove whatever is in their breasts of resentment, (so they will become) brothers, on thrones facing each other</span>.[Sūrah al-Ḥijr, 15:46-47]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">About this bridge before Paradise, the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا خَلَصَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ مِنَ النَّارِ ، حُبِسُوا بِقَنْطَرَةٍ بَيْنَ الْجَنَّةِ وَالنَّارِ ، فَيَتَقَاصُّونَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">مَظَالِمَ كَانَتْ بَيْنَهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا ، حَتَّى إِذَا نُقُّوا وَهُذِّبُوا أُذِنَ لَهُمْ بِدُخُولِ الْجَنَّةِ ،</span><span style="color:#000000;">فَوَالَّذِي نَفْسُ مُحَمَّدٍ بِيَدِهِ لأَحَدُهُمْ بِمَسْكَنِهِ فِي الْجَنَّةِ أَدَلُّ بِمَنْزِلِهِ كَانَ فِي الدُّنْيَا</span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">When the believers are delivered from the fire, they will be detained at the bridge between Paradise and the fire to settle whatever injustices may have occurred between them in life. When they have all become refined and purified, entrance into Paradise will be granted. And I swear by the one in whose hand is Muhammad’s life, each individual will recognize his home in Paradise even more so than he does his home in this life.</span> [Recorded by al-Bukhārī]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[113] Recorded by by al-Bukhārī and Muslim. The wording of Muslim is above; the wording of al-Bukhārī is:</p>
<p>

</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يُضْرَبُ جِسْرُ جَهَنَّمَ ، فَأَكُونُ أَوَّلَ مَنْ يُجِيزُ ، وَدُعَاءُ الرُّسُلِ يَوْمَئِذٍ : اللَّهُمَّ سَلِّمْ سَلِّمْ</span></h2>
<p>

</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">The bridge of Hell will be placed and I will be the first to be permitted. The supplication of the messengers that day will be, “Oh Allah, save (us), save (us).”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[116] Recorded by Imām Aḥmad in a marfū’ form meaning some ḥadīth scholars accept it as being “raised” to the status of an actual statement of the prophet himself ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ). Imam Muslim also mentioned it in his authentic collection as a comment to another ḥadīth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[118] This is when the disbelieving people attempted to burn Abraham for destroying their idols. About this, Allah says in Sūrah al-Anbiyā, 21:68-69:</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;">قَالُوا حَرِّقُوهُ وَانصُرُوا آلِهَتَكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ فَاعِلِينَ قُلْنَا يَا نَارُ كُونِي بَرْدًا وَسَلَامًا عَلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ</span></h2>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">They said, “Burn him and support your gods if you are to act.” We (Allah) said, “Fire, be coolness and safety upon Abraham.”</span></p>
<p>

</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[119] The ḥadīth, recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim, is:</p>
<p>

</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا أَرَادَ اللَّهُ رَحْمَةَ مَنْ أَرَادَ مِنْ أَهْلِ النَّارِ أَمَرَ اللَّهُ الْمَلائِكَةَ أَنْ يُخْرِجُوا مَنْ كَانَ يَعْبُدُ اللَّهَ فَيُخْرِجُونَهُمْ وَيَعْرِفُونَهُمْ بِآثَارِ السُّجُودِ وَحَرَّمَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُ عَلَى النَّارِ أَنْ تَأْكُلَ أَثَرَ السُّجُودِ</span></h2>
<p>

</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">When Allah wants mercy for someone from the people of the fire, he commands the angels to take out whoever used to worship Allah. So they (the angels) will recognize them by the marks of prostration because Allah has forbidden the fire from destroying the marks of prostration.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 48: Point 81</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> that Allaah will punish the creation in the Fire in shackles, fetters and chains. The Fire will be inside them and above them and below them. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Whereas, the Jahmiyyah among them <u>H</u>ishaam al-Foo<u>t</u>ee said, “<em>Allaah will only punish them next to the Fire</em>” in rebuttal of Allaah and His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“<strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) that Allaah will punish the creation in the Fire in shackles, fetters and chains. The Fire will be inside them and above them and beneath them,” </strong></span>Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, will cause the Fire to blaze with the bodies of the disbelievers. So they are firewood for the Fire of Hell.</p>
<p><strong>وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمْ وَقُودُ النَّارِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (the disbelievers)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> are fuel for the Fire.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah-Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It will burn with them and use their bodies as fuel and Allaah’s refuge is sought.</p>
<p><strong>فَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا قُطِّعَتْ لَهُمْ ثِيَابٌ مِّن نَّارٍ يُصَبُّ مِن فَوْقِ رُءُوسِهِمُ الْحَمِيمُ ..</strong></p>
<p><strong>يُصْهَرُ بِهِ مَا فِي بُطُونِهِمْ وَالْجُلُودُ </strong></p>
<p><strong>وَلَهُم مَّقَامِعُ مِنْ حَدِيدٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So those who disbelieve will have garments of Fire put out for them, boiling water will be poured down from above upon their heads. It will melt their insides and their skins. And there will be for them hooked rods of iron with which they will be beaten.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ajj (22), <em>aayah </em>19-21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah mentioned that the torment will occur upon the bodies of the disbelievers and that the Fire will burn with them and blaze away consuming them.</p>
<p><strong> يُصَبُّ مِن فَوْقِ رُءُوسِهِمُ الْحَمِيمُ ..</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">…<strong> Boiling water will be poured down upon their heads from above. </strong></span>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ajj (22), <em>aayah </em>19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the Mu`tazilah, there are those who said, <em>“They will not be tortured and the Fire will not blaze away burning their bodies. Rather, they will be punished by the Fire only. As for their bodies then they will not actually burn.”</em> Whereas, Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says in the Qur&#8217;aan that they are the Fuel of the Fire and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The first of those whom the Fire will blaze on the Day of Resurrection will be the scholar who did not act upon his knowledge and the one who gave in charity who shows off in giving charity and the mujaahid (who fought in Allaah’s path) who fought to show off.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word <strong><em>al-aghlaal</em></strong> (shackles), its meaning is that his hands will be bound to his neck and Allaah’s refuge is sought. And <strong><em>al-ankaal</em></strong> (fetters) are instruments of torture.</p>
<p><strong>إِنَّا أَعْتَدْنَا لِلْكَافِرِينَ سَلَاسِلَ وَأَغْلَالًا وَسَعِيرًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We have prepared for the disbelievers iron chains and fetters to bind their hands and a blazing Fire. </strong></span><span style="font-size:1rem;">(Sooratul-Insaan (76), </span><em style="font-size:1rem;">aayah </em><span style="font-size:1rem;">4)</span></p>
<p><strong>إِنَّ لَدَيْنَا أَنكَالًا وَجَحِيمًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">We have fetters and a raging Fire.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Muzammil (73), <em>aayah </em>12)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This word <em>al-ankaal</em> (fetters), they are instruments of torture; Allaah’s refuge is sought. Chains and shackles and a blazing Fire. And the Fire will be in their bellies inside of them and above them and beneath them.</p>
<p><strong>لَهُم مِّن جَهَنَّمَ مِهَادٌ وَمِن فَوْقِهِمْ غَوَاشٍ ۚ وَكَذَٰلِكَ نَجْزِي الظَّالِمِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They (the disbelievers) will have the Hellfire as a bed. Over them, there will be coverings of Fire and likewise, We will recompense the disbelieving wrongdoers.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>41)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> With regard to this person mentioned here who needs refuting amongst others; <u>H</u>ishaam al-Foo<u>t</u>ee. In the footnotes they mention that Al-<u>H</u>aafidh ibn <u>H</u>ajar said about him in <em>Lisaan al-Mizaan</em>; he was <u>H</u>ishaam ibn Umar al-Foo<u>t</u>ee, he was from the companions of Al-Hu<u>dh</u>ayl and he was a caller to the position of the Mu`tazilah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong> mentions in his lectures of the explanation, he said, “His teacher was <strong>Al-Hu<u>dh</u>ayl</strong>, well-known as Al-`Allaaf and that he had this deviated belief that those who enter the Hellfire, after they have been in the Fire for some time, they will become of the same nature as the Fire so it will become natural for them to the extent that they will feel delight in the Fire. His student <u>H</u>ishaam al-Foo<u>t</u>ee differed with his teacher, he refused to accept that they would actually enter the Fire. Rather, they will be punished next to the Fire, they will be scorched outside it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 19 : Point 19</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And to have eemaan in the siraat </span></strong><span style="color:#993300;">(the Bridge)</span><strong><span style="color:#993300;"> over the Hellfire. The Bridge will seize whomever Allaah wishes. And whoever Allaah wishes will cross over. And whoever Allaah wishes will fall into the Hellfire. And they will have lights in accordance with the level of their eemaan.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F365778335&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/eemaan-in-the-siraat-the-bridge-over-the-hellfire" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From that which will occur on the Day of Resurrection is the passing over the <em>siraat</em> (Bridge) as has already been mentioned. And the siraat, in the language means <em>at-tareeq</em> (a path). And what is meant here is the Bridge laid down over the top of the Hellfire. And it will be very thin, thinner than a hair and sharper than a sword and hotter than burning coals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The creation will pass over it in accordance with the level of their deeds. Their deeds will cause them to proceed. So whoever is saved then he has succeeded and whoever is not saved is destroyed. And the people crossing over it will be in accordance with the level of their deeds. So some of them will cross over like the blinking of the eye. And some of them will cross over like the flash of lightening. And some of them will cross over like the wind. And some of them will cross over like fast horses. And some of them will cross over like riders upon camels. And some of them will run, running upon feet. And some of them will walk. And some of them will crawl. And some of them will be seized and thrown down into the Hellfire. And this is mentioned in the Honourable Qur&#8217;aan and in the Prophetic Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So by your Lord We shall certainly gather them and the devils. Then We shall bring them around the Hellfire upon their knees.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Up until His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is not one of you except that he will have to cross over it. It is a binding decree from your Lord.</span> </strong>(Soorah Maryam (19), aayahs 68-71)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(‘Cross over it’)</strong> meaning the Hellfire. And this crossing, it is the crossing over the siraat, the Bridge. This is the crossing which is mentioned in the Qur&#8217;aan. And the address here is to the believers and to other than them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is not one of you except that he will have to cross over it. The believers and the disbelievers and the hypocrites will cross over it. All of the creation will cross over this Bridge. So whoever is saved from it (crosses it successfully) then he will enter Paradise. And whoever falls down is destroyed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Then We will save those who had taqwaa </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(those who were fearful of Allaah and dutiful to Him)</span> (Soorah Maryam (19), aayah 72)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nothing will bring about salvation except for <em><strong>taqwaa</strong> </em>(dutifulness to Allaah). Strength of body will not save nor will having plentiful wealth nor will status. Nothing will bring about salvation except taqwaa (being dutiful) to Allaah the Perfect and Most High. This is the textual statement in the Honourable Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And ahaadeeth occur in the Sunnah regarding the terrors of the Resurrection. And from them is the crossing over the siraat, the Bridge. So it is essential to have eemaan in the Bridge and in the crossing over it. And it is not sufficient to just believe in that; rather there must be action. So therefore a person should prepare for the crossing over it by having taqwaa (by being dutiful to Allaah); and that is righteous deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“The Bridge will seize whomever Allaah wishes and whoever Allaah wishes will cross over.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then We shall save those who were dutiful to Allaah and We will leave the disbelieving wrongdoers in the Hellfire upon their knees</strong></span> (Soorah Maryam (19), aayah 72)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because the siraat will have hooks upon it that will seize whomever they are commanded to seize.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“he will cross”</strong>. Meaning he will pass over it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And they (the people) will have light in accordance with the level of their eemaan.”</strong> On the Day of Resurrection, the people of eemaan (true believers), they will have light. And they will walk within it. Just as He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Their light will run before them. And their books will be in their right hands. They will say O our Lord, complete our light for us and forgive us. Indeed you have full ability over everything</strong></span> (Sooratut-Tahreem (66), aayah 8)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The Day when you shall see the believing men and the believing women with their light running before them and their books will be in their right hands. It will be said to them, glad tidings to you this day of gardens beneath which rivers flow. You will remain therein forever. That is the tremendous success.</strong> </span>(Sooratul-Hadeed (57), aayah 12)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The munafiqoon (hypocrites)</strong> will be given light initially, because of the fact that they entered into Islaam and they outwardly displayed Islaam (in the world). So therefore they will be treated in accordance with what they outwardly showed. They will be given light, but it will be as a trick, just as they sought to trick with their Islaam. So therefore they will be given light as a trick upon them and then their light will be extinguished and they will remain in darkness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">On the Day when the hypocrites men and women will say to the believers: &#8220;Wait for us! Let us get something from your light!&#8221; It will be said: &#8220;Go back to your rear! Then seek a light!&#8221; So a wall will be put up between them, with a gate therein. Inside it will be mercy, and outside it will be torment.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(The hypocrites)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> will call the believers: &#8220;Were we not with you?&#8221; The believers will reply: &#8220;Yes! But you led yourselves into temptations, you looked forward for our destruction; you doubted </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(in Faith)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">; and you were deceived by false desires, till the Command of Allah came to pass. And the chief deceiver </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Satan)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> deceived you in respect of Allah.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So this Day no ransom shall be taken from you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(hypocrites)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, nor of those who disbelieved, </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">. Your abode is the Fire, that is the proper place for you, and worst indeed is that destination.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Hadeed (57), aayahs 13 &#8211; 15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So eemaan will have light on the Day of Resurrection within which the person will proceed. Whereas the disbelievers and the hypocrites will be in darkness, and Allaah’s refuge is sought. They will not know where they are going.</p>

<span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong> &amp; That They are Both Created</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[91] Ahl us-Sunnah testify and believe that Paradise and Hell are both created. They will remain eternally and the people of Paradise will never leave it. Also the inhabitants of Hell, who were created for it, will never come out of it. Death will be sacrificed on the wall between Paradise and Hell, then a call will be made that day:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">..O people of Paradise, there is eternity and no death. O people of Hell, there is eternity and no death.</span></strong>&#8220;</p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Hawd &amp; The Kawthar (The Pool &amp; The River)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[89] They believe in the Hawd [102] and the Kawthar. Also in the entering of a group of Ahl ut-Tawheed into Paradise without account. There will also be a group from them who will have an easy reckoning, without any harm befalling them, or any punishment overtaking them. A group from them who had sinned will enter the Fire, then they will be freed and led out of it and joined up with their brothers who preceded them in entering Paradise. [103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They ( i.e. Ahl Hadeeth ) know with certainty and truth that the sinful from amongst the Ahl ut Tawlieed will not remain in the Fire eternally, and will not be left there forever. [104] As for the unbelievers, they shall abide in Hell forever and never come out of it nor shall they ever be reprieved. Allaah will never leave in the Fire anyone, who was disobedient from Ahl ul-Eemaan.</p>

They (People of <em>Hadeeth</em>) do not pass judgement on a specific person that he will be from the people of Paradise or from the people of Hell, because that is something which is hidden from them. They do not know in which state a person will die, whether it is upon <em>Islaam</em> or unbelief, so due to this fact they say:</p>
<p>“Indeed we are Believers, if Allaah wills.”</p>
<p>That is, from those Believers who will have a good end, if Allaah wills [134]</p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;">[134] TRANSLATORS NOTE ~ The Prophet(صلى الله عليه وسلم), said:</span></p>
<p><em><span style="color:#008000;">Do not be delighted by the actions of anyone until you see how he ends up&#8221;.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;">Related by Ahmad [ 3:120,223 ] and lbn Abee ‘Aasim [ 393-395 ]. The isnaad is Saheeh.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Chapter 21: The Ruling Upon On One Who Died Upon Belief Or Unbelief</strong></span></p>
<p>[l16] And the People of <em>Hadeeth</em> witness for the one who dies upon <em>Islaam</em> that his end will be Paradise even if their fate was written by Allaah that they will be punished with the Fire for a period, as a result of their sins which they committed and did not repent from. They will eventually enter Paradise and no one from amongst the Muslims will remain in Hell eternally. This is a great blessing and favour from Allaah. If one dies upon unbelief, and Allaah’s protection is sought from this, he will be thrown into the Fire and he will not be saved from it, and he will stay there forever.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>20 &#8211; Exiting from the Fire for those who Worshipped Allaah Alone</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">225 – When the believers will have finished from the fire on the Day of Judgment and become secure. Then one of you arguing for the truth, in the Duniya for his companion will not be more intense than the debating of the believers with their Lord, regarding their brothers whom had been entered into the fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: they will say:<strong> Our Lord! These are our brothers they used to pray along with us, and fast along with us, and perform the Hajj along with us, and you have entered them into the fire</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: that Allaah will say: &#8220;go and take out those whom you know.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they will come to them, and they will know them by their faces. The fire would not have eaten their faces. From amongst them there will be, he whom the fire has reached half way up his shins, and he whom the fire has reached to his ankles, and they will take them out.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The believers will say: &#8220;We took out those whom You have commanded to take out.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah will say: &#8220;Take out he who has the weight of a dirham of Emaan in his heart. Then the one who has the weight of half a dirham,&#8217; until He says: He who has an atom’s weight in his heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sa&#8217;eed said: whoever does not believe this, then let him read this Ayaah : &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Surely! Allaah wrongs not even of the weight of an atom, but if there is any good (done), He doubles it, and gives from him a great reward</strong></span>. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said: The Believers will say: &#8220;O our Lord! Indeed we have taken out those whom You have commanded to take out.&#8217; Then there will not remain anyone in the fire who has good in himself.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said: Then Allaah will say: the Angels have interceded, and the Prophets have interceded, and the believers have interceded and The Most Merciful of those who shows mercy remains.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said : Then Allaah will grab a handful from the fire &#8211; or He said : two handfuls &#8211; of people who never did any good for Allaah at all, indeed they will be burnt so much that they will have become charcoal.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said: they will be brought to water, which is said to be called the water of life. It will be poured on them they will sprout out like the seed sprouts after what is left over by the torrential floods, they will come out of their bodies like pearls, and they will have a stamp on their necks, saying: those freed by Allaah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said: it will be said to them: Enter into Paradise, whatever you wish for or anything you see then it is for you, and I have something with Me which is better than that. He said: They will say: Our Lord! What can be better than this?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said: Allaah will say: My being pleased with you, I will never be angry with you.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1661- &#8220;Indeed Allaah Azza wa Jal will take out a people from the fire after nothing remains of them except for their faces and Allaah will enter them into Paradise.&#8221; The hadeeth is in saheeh al-Bukhari (4/463-464) by a different narration on the authority of Abu Sa&#8217;eed in a narration ascribed to the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, and he mentions the whole of the hadeeth of the intercession; and in it, is stated: &#8220;Allaah Ta&#8217;aala will say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Go to those whom you find in their hearts the equivalent to a dinar of Emaan and take them out of the fire, Allaah prohibits the fire from their faces…</strong>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1450 &#8211; &#8220;Take out of the fire whoever has in his heart the equivalent of an atom worth of Emaan.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1451- &#8220;Some people from the people of Tawheed will be punished in the fire, until they will be like charcoal, then mercy will reach them. They will be taken out and thrown at the doors of Paradise. He said: then the people of Paradise will sprinkle water upon them, they will sprout like seeds left over, sprouts after the torrential floods, then they will enter paradise.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>22- The Covenant that Allaah Took from His Slaves</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>172- “Allaah will say to the one who has been punished the least from the people of the Hell-fire on the Day of Judgment: ‘O son of Adam! How have you found your resting place?’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>He will say: ’An evil resting place!’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>It will be said to him: ‘If you had the world and everything in it, would you ransom yourself with it?’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>He will say: Yes.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Allaah will say: You have lied, what I wanted from you was less than that, while you were in the spine (and in another narration: in the back) of Adam, that you do not associate anything with Me, and I will not enter you into the fire, but you refused and committed Shirk. He will be ordered to be taken to the fire.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Regarding this hadeeth:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Regarding His saying: ‘He will say: you have lied.’</strong></span> An-Nawawee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It means: If We returned you to the Duniya, you would not have ransomed it, because you were asked for something easier than that but you refused. This will have the same meaning as in the saying of Allaah Ta&#8217;ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">But if they were returned (to the world), they would certainly revert to that which they were forbidden. And indeed they are liars</span> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the meaning of this hadeeth is combined with the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">If they had all that is in the earth, and as much again therewith to ransom themselves thereby</span> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Regarding, His saying: ‘I wanted from you’</strong></span>: i.e. I would have loved from you. When the word ‘Allaah’s Will’ (<strong>al-Irada</strong>) is mentioned in the Sharia&#8217;, it is used in the absolute sense. It means what is general both from the good and the bad, guidance and misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As is mentioned in the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">And whomsoever Allaah wills to guide, He opens his heart to Islaam, and whomsoever He wills to send astray, He makes his heart closed and constricted, as if he is climbing up to the sky</span>. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Will of Allaah (al-Irada) is that which will most definitely happen. Sometimes when this Will of Allaah (al-Irada) is applied it means, that which is the synonym of love and being pleased. As is mentioned in the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"> Allaah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you</span> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is the meaning of the intent of the saying of Allaah Ta’ala in this hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I wanted from you’ i.e. that I loved from you. The Will of Allaah (al-Irada) with this meaning might not happen, since Allaah Tabaraka wa Ta’ala does not force anyone to obey Him, even though He created them because of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">Then whosoever wills, let him believe, and whosoever wills, let him disbelieve</span> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, therefore Allaah Tabarak wa Ta’ala could want from His slave that what Allaah does not love from His slave, and Allaah loves from His slave that which His slave does not want.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim -may Allaah have mercy upon him &#8211; called this Will of Allaah (alIrada) a will of the order of being (al-Irada), taking that from the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">Verily, His Command, when He intends a thing, is only that He says to it, &#8220;Be!&#8221; and it is</span>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He called the other Will (al-Irada) which is a synonym for &#8216;being pleased&#8217;: the Sharia&#8217; Will (al-Irada).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever understands this division, then he has a solution to many of the problems of understanding the issues of <strong>al-Qadaa</strong> (Allaah&#8217;s ordainment of everything in creation) and <strong>al-Qadr</strong> (Allaah&#8217;s Pre-decree for the creation). And he will succeed from the fitna (tribulations) of the stance of those who say that a person does actions under force, or who hold the beliefs of the Mu&#8217;tazilah. The explanation of this can be found in the magnificent book ‘Shifaa’ al-Aleel al-Qadaa wal-Qadr wal-Hikmaah wa Ta’aleel’ by Ibn al-Qayyim -May Allaah have mercy upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Regarding His saying: ‘……. and you were in the spine of Adam.’</strong></span> Qadi Iyaad said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Messenger indicates to the saying of Allaah Ta’ala &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">And (remember) when your Lord brought forth from the Children of Adam, from their loins, their seed (or from Adam&#8217;s loin his offspring)</span>&gt;&gt;, in the Ayaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This covenant was taken from them while they were in the spine of Adam. So, whoever fulfills it after he is brought into this world then he is a believer, and whoever does not fulfill it, is a Kaffir.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the intent of this hadeeth is: I wanted from you when I took the covenant, but you refused so I took you to the Duniya but you committed Shirk.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is mentioned in &#8216;al-Fath&#8217;</p>

Thereupon Abdullah got up and said in anger. O people, fear Allah and say only that which one knows amongst you and do not say which he does not know and he should simply say: Allah has the best knowledge for He has the best knowledge amongst all of you. It does not behove him to say that which he does not know. Allah has the best knowledge of it. Verily Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, said to His Prophet (may peace be upon him) to state:&#8221; I do not ask from you any remuneration and I am not the one to put you in trouble,&#8221; and when Allah&#8217;s Mesqenger (may peace be upon him) saw people turning back (from religion) he said: O Allah, afflict thern with seven famines as was done in the case of Yusuf, so they were afflicted with famine by which they were forced to eat everything until they were obliged to eat the hides and the dead bodies because of hunger, and every one of them looked towards the sky and he found a smoke. And Abu Sufyan came and he said: Muhammad, you have come to command us to obey Allah and cement the ties of blood- relation whereas your people are undone; supplicate Allah for tlicm. Thereupon Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, said:&#8221; Wait for the day when there would be clear smoke from the sky which would envelop people and that would be grievous torivent&#8221; up to the words:&#8221; you are going to return to (evil).&#8221; (if this verse implied the torment of the next life) could the chastisement of the next (life) be averted (as the Qur&#8217;an states): On the day when We seize (them) with the most violent seizing; surely We shall exact retribution&#8221; (xliv. 16)?

This reflects the understanding of a person that he should say about that which he does not know that it is Allah who knows best. The fact is that when the Quraish disobeyed Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) he supplicated Allah that they should be afflicted with famine and starvation as was done in case of Yusuf. And they were so much hard pressed that a person would ace the sky and he would see between him and the sky something like smoke and they were so much hard pressed that they began to cat the bones, and a person came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger. seek forgiveness for the tribe of Mudar for (its people) have been undone.

When there was some relief for them they returned to the same position as they had been before, and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed this verse:&#8221; So wait for the day when the heaven brings a clear smoke enveloping people.

Then one amongst them comes and says: I did not spare so and so until I sowed the seed of discord between a husband and a wife. The Satan goes near him and says: &#8216;You have done well. A&#8217;mash said: He then embraces him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:center;" align="center"><span lang="EN-GB">Taken from </span>Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah of Shaykh Al-Albaani<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">From AbdulAziz bin al-Mukhtar bin Abdullaah ad-Danaaj who said he witnessed Abu Salmah bin AbdurRahman sitting in a <i>Masjid</i> at the time of Khalid bin Usayd; He said al-Hasan came and sat with him, and Abu Salmah narrated to us that Abu Hurairah narrated from theProphet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> who said:</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:center;" align="center"><span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA">&#8221; الشمس والقمر ثوران مكوران في النار يوم القيامة &#8220;.</span></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">‘The sun and the moon will both spin and erupt in the Hell-Fire on the Day of Judgement.’</span></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">So al-Hasan asked: ‘What was the sin of the sun and the moon?!’</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Abu Salmah said: ‘Rather what I do is narrate to you from theMessenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</i>.’</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">So al-Hasan remained silent.’</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Collected by Imam Tahawi in ‘Mushkill al-Athaar (1/66-67)</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Also collected by al-Bayhaqi in the book ‘al-Ba’ath wa Nashoor’, also by Bazaar, al-Isma’aili and al-Khattabi all by way of Yunus bin Muhammad that AbdulAziz bin al-Mukhtar narrated to us with this narration.</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">I (Albaani) say: This <i>Isnaad</i>  is <i>Saheeh</i>  upon the conditions of Bukhari, and he narrated it in his book ‘as-Saheeh’ in a summarized form, and he said: Mussadad narrated to us that he said AbdulAziz bin al-Mukhtar narrated to us with the wording:</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">‘The sun and the moon will both spin in the Hell-Fire on the Day of Judgement.’</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"><b>The Meaning of the Hadeeth</b></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">The intent of the Hadeeth is not what al-Hasan al-Basri presumed, that the sun and the moon will be in the Hell-Fire punished as a punishment for them, never, indeed Allaah –Azza wa Jal – does not punish he who obeys him from His creation, and from that creation is the Sun and the moon, as to what Allaah&#8217;s -Tabarak wa Ta’ala- saying indicates to:</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:center;" align="center"><span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA">أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ اللَّهَ يَسْجُدُ لَهُ مَنْ فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَنْ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَالشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ وَالنُّجُومُ وَالْجِبَالُ وَالشَّجَرُ وَالدَّوَابُّ وَكَثِيرٌ مِنَ النَّاسِ وَكَثِيرٌ حَقَّ عَلَيْهِ الْعَذَابُ</span></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:center;" align="center">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"> See you not that to Allaah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the mountains, and the trees, and <i>Ad-Dawaab</i> (moving living creatures, beasts, etc.), and many of mankind? But there are many (men) on whom the punishment is justified.</span> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- mentions that His punishment is deserving for those who prostrate for other than Allaah -Ta’ala- in this <i>Dunyaa</i>. Like Tahawi mentions, therefore, when Allaah throws them into the Hell-Fire, then this can have two meanings:</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"><i>The First:</i> that they are the fuel for the Fire.</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Al-Isma’aili said:</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">‘It does not necessitate that being placed in the Hell-Fire that they will be punished, since indeed Allaah has Angels and stones and other things in the Hell-Fire, so that they will be a punishment for the people of the Hell-Fire and a tool from the tools of punishment, and Allaah does what He wills of that punishment, but the Angels and stones will not be punished.’</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"><i>The second is:</i></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">They will both be thrown into the Hell-Fire as remorse for those who worshipped them.</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">al-Khattabi said:</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">‘The intent of them being in the Hell-Fire is not that they will be punished there, but they will be a remorse for those who worshipped them in the <i>Dunyaa</i>, so that those people know that their worship of them was false.’</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">I say: this is the closest to the wording of the hadeeth and what supports this is that in the hadeeth of Anas collected by Abu Ya’ala as is mentioned in ‘al-Fath’ (6/214) it says:</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"> ‘so that those who used to worship them could see them.’</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">But I did not see it in his ‘Musnad’ and Allaah Ta’ala knows best.</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">[Taken from &#8216;Silsilah Ahadeeth as-Saheehah&#8217; vol. 1 No. 124]</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://wp.me/p2sNCV-hO" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1106" src="https://salafiaudio.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/why-are-women-the-majority-of-the-hellfire-by-shaykh-adil-as-sayyid.jpg?w=595" alt="Why are Women The Majority of The Hellfire by Shaykh 'Adil as-Sayyid" width="417" height="515" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For <em>Masjid ul Khaleefah</em> Sister&#8217;s Camp 2012, &#8220;The Journey of The Muslimah: Her Life, Her Death and Hereafter,&#8221; <em>Muwahhideen</em> Publications has organized a LIVE telelink lecture with the noble <em>Shaykh &#8216;Adil as-Sayyid</em> (May Allaah Preserve Him), from the <em>mashayikh</em> of Egypt. The <em>Shaykh</em> is very highly recommended by <em>Shaykh Hasan ibn Abdul-Wahhab al-Banna</em> (May Allaah preserve him) and was referred by him as a <em>mufassir</em> (explainer of The Quraan using the science of <em>tafseer</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Listen to <em>Shaykh Hasan ibn Abdul-Wahhab al-Banna</em> (May Allaah preserve him) on <em>Shaykh &#8216;Adil as-Sayyid </em>(May <strong>Allaah </strong>preserve him) here: <a href="http://youtu.be/5EwxTdJAQUE">http://youtu.be/5EwxTdJAQUE</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of <strong>Allaah</strong> <em>(sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam)</em> said, <strong>&#8220;I looked at paradise and found poor people forming the majority of its inhabitants; and I looked at Hell and saw that the majority of its inhabitants were women.</strong>&#8221; <em>(Bukhari)</em>. This is further explained in another <em>hadeeth</em> in<em> saheeh al-Bukhari</em>where he <em>(sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam)</em> said, <strong>&#8220;They are ungrateful to their companions (husbands) and ungrateful for good treatment. If you are kind to one of them for a lifetime then she sees one (undesirable) thing in you, she will say, &#8216;I have never had anything good from you.'&#8221;</strong> This <em>hadeeth</em> is very often misunderstood by the <em>muslimeen</em> with weak eeman and no firmly grounded fundamentals. Many times it is misquoted by the enemies of <em>Islaam</em> in their feeble attempts to attack and degrade the social and moral fiber of this beautiful, complete and perfect religion. It is also very unfortunate that even so-called muslim contemporary scholars, modernists and orientalists have wrongly interpreted and explained this narration, in such a way as to add fuel to the enemies of <em>Islaam</em>. Our <em>Shaykh</em> , the <em>mufassir</em> (explainer of the Quraan) will expound on this narration, bringing forth the correct explainations within the framework of the<em>Quraan</em> and <em>Sunnah</em> upon the understanding of the <em>salaf us saalih</em> (righteous predecessors).<em> inshaaAllaah ta&#8217;alaa.</em></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I advise you to fear Allâh and obey Him (<em>taqwâ</em>) and I advise you to adhere to the Quran, for it is a light in the datk night and a guidance during the day, so implement it no matter how much struggle and poverty you have to face. If a calamity befalls you, put your wealth forward to protect your religion, and if the calamity continues, put forward your wealth and your life to save your religion [but never risk your religion], for the ruined is he whose religion is ruined, and the looted is he whose religion is taken. And know that there is no poverty after Paradise, and no riches after the Fire.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="post_message_252895">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who will have a worse punishment (in the Hereafter): The sinners or the innovators?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The innovators will have a worse punishment, since innovations are worse than sins. Innovations are more beloved to the Devil than sins because (it is likely that) the sinner may repent &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyaan Ath-Thawree, may Allaah have mercy on him, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Innovation is more beloved to Iblees (the Devil) than sins. This is because sins are repented from whereas innovations are not repented from.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Majmoo’-ul-Fataawaa (11/472))</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily Allaah has prevented repentance from every person of innovation.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Silsilat-ul-Ahaadeeth as-Saheehah (1620))</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; but as for the innovator, then very rarely does he repent because he thinks that he is upon the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is contrary to the sinner for he knows that he is disobeying Allaah and that he is committing a sinful deed. As for the innovator, he considers himself to be obeying Allaah and to be upon obedience. This is why innovation – and Allaah’s refuge is sought – is worse than sin. And this is why the Salaf warned the people from sitting and gathering with the innovators –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Al-Hasan Al-Basree, may Allaah have mercy upon him, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Do not sit with a person of innovation, for indeed he will put a disease in your heart.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Al-I’tisaam of Ash-Shaatibee (1/72) verified by Saleem Al-Hilaalee and Al-Bid’a wan-Nahee ‘anhaa of Ibn Waddaah (pg. 54))</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ash-Shaatibee (158) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Indeed the saved sect – and they are Ahl-us-Sunnah – are commanded to disassociate themselves from the people of innovations, to expel them, and to punish severely anyone that follows in their direction, whether by killing them or less than that. And the scholars have warned us against accompanying and gathering with them.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (the compiler) say : may Allaah have mercy on the Salaf (predecessors). They did not leave behind any person of innovation except that they subdued him and warned against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; for they would influence those whom they sat with, and their danger is great. There is no doubt that innovation is worse than sin and that the danger of the innovator is worse to the people than the danger of the sinner. &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the danger of the people of innovation, Shaykh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah, may Allaah have mercy on him, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“If it were not for those whom Allaah placed to repel the danger of them [meaning the innovators], the Religion would have been corrupted. Their corruption is worse than the corruption caused by the conquering of the enemies at times of war. For indeed, when they conquer, they do not corrupt hearts or the Religion found in them, except for a while. But as for these people [i.e. the innovators], then they corrupt the hearts from the very beginning.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Majmoo’-ul-Fataawaa: (28/232)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Ibn Taimiyyah) also said (20/103):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The people of innovation are worse than the people of lustful sins, according to the Sunnah and the Ijmaa’ (consensus).”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#8211; This is why the Salaf would say:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“Being moderate while upon the Sunnah is better than exerting oneself while upon Innovation.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[This statement is reported from Ibn Mas’ood, may Allaah be pleased with him. Refer to Al-Laalikaa’ee (1/188, no. 114), Al-Ibaanah (1/320, no. 161) and As-Sunnah of Ibn Nasr (30).]</p>
