<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 79 : Point 135-136</strong><br />
<strong> Shaykh Ahmad Najmee | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong>135</strong>]<span style="color:#993300;"><strong> If you hear a man attacking the narrations (<em>athaar</em>) or rejecting the narrations or desiring some thing other than the narrations then have doubt about his Islam. And do not doubt that he is the person of Desires and Innovator.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong>136</strong>] <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that Ruler&#8217;s oppression does not reduce or remove anything that Allaah has made obligatory upon the tongue of his prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). His oppression will be upon himself and your acts of obedience along with him will be complete if Allaah,the Most High,wills. Meaning, the congregational prayer and the <em>jumu&#8217;ah</em> prayer along with them and fighting <em>jihaad</em> along with them. And all acts of obedience accompany them in that , for you will have your intention.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 79 : Points 137</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">If you see a man making supplication against the ruler, then know that he is a person of desires. If you see a man a making supplication in favor of the ruler for him to be sound and righteous, the know that he is a person of the Sunnah, if Allah wills.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Fudayl ibn ‘Iyaad </span></strong>[1]<strong><span style="color:#993300;"> said, “If I had a supplication that was going to be answered, I would make it for the ruler.” It was said to him, “O Abu ‘Alee, explain this to us.” He said, “If I were to make it for myself, then it will not extend beyond me. But, if I made it for the ruler, then he will be corrected and, through that, the servants and the land will be set in order” </span></strong>[2].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">So we are commanded to make supplication for them (the rulers) to be sound and righteous. And we have not been commanded to make supplication against them, even if they commit tyranny and oppression, since their tyranny and oppression will be only upon themselves, but their rectitude will be good for themselves and for the Muslims.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Al-Fudayl ibn ‘Iyaad ibn Mas’ood, Shaikhul-Islam, Abu ‘Alee, alYarboo’ee, al-Khurasaanee. He was born in Samarqand and grew up to be a highway robber. However, his heart was moved upon hearing the Qur’an recited and he repented and then travelled in search of knowledge to Koofah, eventually settling in Makkah. Some of his students were Ibn al-Mubaarak, Yahyaa al-Qattaan, ‘Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Mahdee, ‘Abdur-Razzaaq, ash-Shaafi’ee and Qutaibah ibn Sa’eed. Ibn al-Mubaarak said, “No one better than Fudayl ibn ‘Iyaad remains upon the face of the earth.” Haaroon ar-Rasheed said, “I have not seen any scholar with greater dignity than Maalik, nor anyone more pious than al-Fudayl.” As-Siyaar (8/421-441) and Tadhkiratul-Huffaadh (1/245-246) of adh-Dhahabee.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 47: Point 76</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And it is not permissible to withhold <em>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah </em>(sincere advice) from anyone from the Muslims, whether righteous or sinful in matters of the religion.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> So, whoever withholds it then he has acted deceitfully towards the Muslims and whoever acts deceitfully towards the Muslims then he has acted deceitfully towards the religion, and whoever acts deceitfully towards the religion then he has shown treachery towards Allaah, His Messenger and the believers.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F382959317&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/ad-deenu-an-naseehah-the-religion-is-sincerity" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying,<span style="color:#993300;"> “<strong>And it is not permissible for you to withhold <em>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincere advice) from anyone from the Muslims whether they be righteous or sinful,” </strong></span><em>An-<strong>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</strong></em> (sincerity) is to be pure and free of <strong><em>ghish</em> </strong>(deceit) and a thing that is <em>naa<u>s</u>i<u>h</u></em>; a thing that has its quality of <em>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em>, it is a thing that is <em>khaali<u>s</u></em> (pure). So, the believer, it is obligatory that he should be <em>naa<u>s</u>i<u>h</u></em> (sincere); meaning that he should be pure and free of hypocrisy; <em>nifaaq</em> and he should be pure and free of <em>ghish</em> (deceptiveness) and he should be pure and free of <em>khadee`ah</em> (cheating). His outward aspect and his inward aspect should be just the same with regard to truthfulness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity) is the religion just as the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The religion is an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</strong> <strong>(sincerity), the religion is sincerity, the religion is sincerity; an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah. We said, ‘Towards whom O Messenger of Allaah?’ So he said, ‘Towards Allaah and towards His Book and towards His Messenger and towards the rulers of the Muslims and their common folk.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what is meant by it (<em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em>) here is that a person is free of every blameworthy characteristic and that he adorns himself with all the noble and virtuous manners and characteristics. So, the man who is <em>naa<u>s</u>i<u>h</u></em> (has this quality of sincerity) is the one who is not deceptive, does not have any <em>ghish</em> (deceptive) towards anyone. He <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever deceives us is not from us.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the opposite of <em>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity) is <strong><em>al-ghish</em></strong> (deceptiveness). And the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> repeated his saying <em>ad-deenun</em> <em>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (the religion is sincerity) three times for emphasis and to stress its importance and he limited the religion; all of it to being <em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>An-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity) towards Allaah</strong> and His Messenger; this is with regard to <em>`aqeedah</em> (creed and belief). So, a person will not be a Muslim unless his `<em>aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) is sound and is free of <em>shirk</em> and his actions are free of innovations (<em>bid`ah)</em> and he is one who is following the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So, this person, he is the one who is <strong><em>an-naa<u>s</u>i<u>h</u></em></strong> (one who is sincere) towards Allaah and His Messenger, i.e the one whose deeds are free of <em>shirk</em> and free of innovations.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sincerity towards the Messenger</strong> <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is to truly believe; to have <em>eemaan</em> in his Messengership, and to love him, and to respect, and honour him <em>`alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam,</em> and to take him as an example to follow, and to give precedence to his saying over the saying of everyone, and to leave off innovations and new introductions, which are something that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> warned against, and to believe him regarding whatever he informed about regarding things of the unseen of the past and the future, and to avoid whatever he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> forbade. This is sincerity towards the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His (<em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saying, <strong><em>“…and towards His Book…”</em></strong> the Book of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, it is the Qur&#8217;aan such that you have <em>eemaan</em> that it is the speech of Allaah sent down; not created, it is not the speech of anyone else as is said by the people of misguidance; and that you learn it, and teach it, and that you act upon it, and that you acquire understanding of its meanings, and that you reflect upon it. This is sincerity towards the Book of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High; learning, and teaching, and understanding, and acquiring knowledge of it, and acting upon it. And likewise, from sincerity towards the Book of Allaah is to be plentiful in its recitation and not to be neglectful with regard to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity)<strong><em> “…towards the rulers of the Muslims…”</em></strong> they are those who are in charge of the affairs, those in authority, that you obey them in that which is not disobedience to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. And that you do not remove your hand from obedience, and that you do not rebel against them, and that you do not seek out their mistakes and their hidden faults and expose them to the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from sincerity (<em>na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah)</em> towards them is that if you have knowledge (`<em>ilm)</em> and you have the ability to sincerely advise them that you do so personally between yourself and them; you cause the advice to reach them and inform them about mistakes, which occur from them or from their subjects, you let them know about that but you do not speak about them in gatherings, for this will be a case of <em>ghish</em> (treachery). So, <em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity) is that you convey sincere advice from yourself to them. This is from sincerity towards the person in authority.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, from sincerity towards the person in authority is to carry out the duty that he puts you in charge of carrying out, whether it is a <em>wa<u>z</u>eefah</em> (duty or a post) or being placed in charge of something or other than that from the affairs of the religion and the worldly life, that you carry the duty out which the one in authority has entrusted you with in the best manner and that you do not miss anything of it out and if you see any deficiencies then you inform the one in authority between yourself and him. You inform him of the deficiencies so that he can remedy it. This is sincerity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from sincerity towards those in authority is to make <em>du`a</em> (supplication) for them that they be rectified since if they are sound and rectified, the subjects will be sound and rectified and that you make <em>du`a</em> (supplication) for them. So, if you see a man who is a student of knowledge who does not make supplication for them or who criticises making supplication for them then you should know that he is treacherous (<em>ghaash)</em> and he is not one who is sincere towards the person in authority.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And sincerity<strong><em> “…towards the common Muslims,” </em></strong>is that you direct them to what is correct; and you warn them against errors, and that you command the good and forbid the evil, and that you teach the one who is ignorant, and that you remind the person who is heedless, and that you love for him the good that you love for yourself, and to have compassion for the poor person, and you give charity (<em><u>s</u>adaqah)</em> for the needy. This is <em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, that he gives good advice to the person who consults him and he guards secrets for one who trusts him regarding something and to safeguard things which are entrusted with you. He should be sincere from all aspects. And sincerity is with regard to buying and selling such that he does not deceive and does not trick.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is <em>an-na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> (sincerity) in brief. So, whoever is not like that then he is treacherous and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever deceives us then he is not from us.”</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by al-Bukhaariyy in disconnected form; meaning in a chapter heading, you’ll find it there in the <em>Book of Eemaan</em>; the 2<sup>nd</sup> book, chapter 42.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it’s reported in connected form by Imaam Muslim (55) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Tameem ad-Daari <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and Imaam Muslim does not have the repetition of his saying (<em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>): <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Ad-deenun na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</strong> (the religion is sincerity)…</span><strong>”. </strong>Meaning; there in <u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> Muslim, it only occurs once that he said: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Ad-deenun na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</strong> (the religion is sincerity)</span>.<strong>”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, that occurs being reported by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad and Aboo Daawood and at-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee and others and at-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee said it is <em><u>h</u>a<u>s</u>an, <u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (good, authentic).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s side point: Shaykh al-Albaaniyy, likewise, declared it with the addition there as being <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (authentic).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Reported by Muslim (101) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and also reported by Muslim (102 ) with the wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever deceives then he is not from me.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The 1<sup>st</sup> wording in Muslim is:<br />
<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever deceives us then he is not from us.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The 2<sup>nd</sup> wording reported by Muslim is:<br />
<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Whoever deceives is not from me.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> <strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong> <em><u>h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said with regard to this first part of the <u>h</u>adeeth:<strong> </strong>“Ad-deenun na<u>s</u>ee<u>h</u>ah (the religion is sincerity) and then when they asked, “To whom, oh Messenger of Allaah?” He said, “firstly, lillaah (towards Allaah).”<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, “By obedience to Him and not disobeying Him and by implementing `<em>Uboodiyyalahum</em> (servitude towards Him) and by establishing His Tawheed with regard to His <em>Ruboobiyyah</em> (Lordship) and with regard to His `<em>Uloohiyyah</em> (His sole right to all worship) and with regard to His names and attributes and that you seek by performance of your deeds His face &amp; that you are sincere in your deeds, which you carry out. So, you are sincere in them and true in them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> <strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong> <em><u>h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> mentioned more or less the same point. He added a point also, he had a no. of points, from them was,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Having love for the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and also making supplication for; <em><u>s</u>alaat</em> and <em>salaam</em> upon Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. </em>And not writing just it&#8217;s abbreviated forms like  SAW, SAAW, or SAAS. We seeks Allaah’s refuge from this abridging  of <em><u>s</u>alaat</em> and <em>salaam</em> upon Allaah’s Messenger,  as this is from the <em>Raafi<u>d</u>ah Shi`a</em>.</p>

You hope for Allaah’s Mercy for him and you fear for him (because of his sins). You do not know what is destined for him at the point of death with regard to his repenting to Allaah and what Allaah may bring about for him at that time if he dies upon Islaam. You hope for (Allaah’s) Mercy for him and you fear for him because of his sins. And there is no sin except that the servant may repent from it.</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/bearing-witness-of-paradise-or-of-the-fire-for-a-specific-individual-without-a-proof" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And witness (meaning regarding Paradise or the Fire) may not be given against anyone nor for him based upon his having done a good or bad deed.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This matter of bearing witness of Paradise or of the Fire for a specific individual, this is that matter. So witness is not given for a specific individual that he will be in Paradise nor is witness given that he will be in the Fire, except with a proof from the Book and the Sunnah. As for one who there is no proof to state that he is from the people of Paradise, even if he is a righteous person, a believer, we do not do so because we do not know what his concluding action will be. And likewise, a sinful person or a disbeliever, we do not state for certain that the individual that he is from the people of the Fire because he might repent and we do not know. He <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“One of you may perform the actions of the people of Paradise until there is not between him and it except a cubit (forearm); but then what was written overtakes him and he acts with the action of the people of the Fire and therefore he enters it. And one of you may act with the actions of the people of the Fire until there is not between him and it except a forearm (a cubit) and then what was written overtakes him and he acts with the action of the people of Paradise and therefore he enters it.”</span></strong> [05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Actions are in accordance with their conclusions.”</span> </strong>[06 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the concluding actions are not known except to Allaah, the Knower of all hidden things, He, the Perfect and Most High. But as for us, then we have fear for the people of sins and we have hope for the people of acts of obedience but we do not state with certainty. Rather, we have hope for those who are obedient but we do not state with certainty, and we have fear for the sinful ones but we do not state with certainty. This is with regard to specific individuals. As for in general, then we state with certainty that the people of eemaan (true belief) are the people of Paradise and we state with certainty that the disbelievers are the people of the Fire. Allaah, the Most High, said with regard to the Fire:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">It has already been prepared for the disbelievers.</span></strong><br />
(Soorah-Aali `Imraan (3), aayah 131)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said with regard to Paradise:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">It has already been prepared for those who have taqwaa (those who are fearful of Allaah and dutiful to Him).</span> </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), aayah 133)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is with regard to in general. As for specific individuals and specific people, then this is entrusted to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. However, we behave and deal with them on the basis of what is apparent. We deal with the people of obedience in accordance with what appears from them and we deal with the people of sins in accordance to what is apparent from them. We pass judgement in accordance with what is apparent only, not stating the final destination and the final outcome, for that lies in the Hand of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. [07]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[05] Reported by al-Bukhaariyy in his Saheeh (no. 6594) and Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 2643) from the hadeeth of `Abdullaah ibn Mas`ood <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> the famous hadeeth of as-Saadiq al-Masdooq, the fourth hadeeth in an-Nawawiyy’s Forty Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[06] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> the wording of a hadeeth</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[07] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmiyy <em>rahimahullaah</em> dealt with a point, which wasn’t dealt with here directly: <strong><span style="color:#808000;">“And there is no sin except that the servant can repent from it.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmiyy <em>rahimahullaah</em> said in his explanation, “At-Towbah (repentance) is acceptable from every sin with regard to the rulings relating to the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong>Translator’s note:</strong> meaning, in the Hereafter that would be wiped away from him. When `Amr ibn al-`Aas came to accept Islaam and the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> told him to put out his hand to give his pledge &#8211; that’s when he withheld it for a moment. He said, “Because I want to make a condition.” So the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> asked him what condition he wanted to make. He said, “What I did before should be forgiven.” So therefore the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said the hadeeth the shaykh quotes here.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And the Prophet s<em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said to `Amr ibn al-`Aas radiyAllaahu `anhu,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">‘Do you not know that Islaam demolishes what came before it and that performing Hijrah demolishes what came before it and that the Hajj demolishes what came before it.’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Reported by Muslim (121) in the Book of Eemaan)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“And his saying with regard to the man who killed ninety-nine men, ‘And who can come between him and between repentance?’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The hadeeth reported by Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And the ahaadeeth in this regard are very clear. And the disagreement is with regard to a person who spoke with words of abuse against the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> or against the Qur·aan &#8211; is his repentance accepted with regard to this world or is judgement passed that he is to be executed, even if he makes clear his repentance? Then this has been clarified by Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah in his book As-Saarimul-Maslool `alaa Shaatimir-Rasool <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And Allaah is the One who grants success.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 27 : Point 32 (Part A)</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know, that there is to be no obedience to any human in disobedience to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. </strong>And whoever is from the people of Islaam then do not bear witness (of Paradise or the Fire) for him on account of his having done a deed, whether good or bad, since you do not know what his deeds will be concluded with at the point of death. You hope for Allaah’s Mercy for him and you fear for him (because of his sins). You do not know what is destined for him at the point of death with regard to his repenting to Allaah and what Allaah may bring about for him at that time if he dies upon Islaam. You hope for (Allaah’s) Mercy for him and you fear for him because of his sins. And there is no sin except that the servant may repent from it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;">[only highlighted portion of the above point is covered in this post]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F369857102&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/there-is-no-obedience-to-a-created-being-in-disobedience-to-the-creator" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And know that there is to be no obedience to any human in disobedience to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.”</strong> This is an exception to what has preceded, referring to what he mentioned with regard to it being obligatory to obey the ruler, that it is not obligatory in everything. Rather, they are only to be obeyed in that which is not <em>ma`siyah</em> (a sin). As for if they command a sin, then they are not obeyed upon sin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;">And there occurs in the hadeeth: that the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> appointed a leader over an army detachment of the Companions. So when they proceeded upon the way, he (this leader) said to them, “Gather some firewood.” So, when they had gathered it, he said, “Set it on fire.” So, when they had set is blazing, he said, “Enter into the fire. Did not the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> say, ‘Hear and obey’?” So some of them said, “We did not obey the Messenger except in order to flee away from the Fire so how can we then enter into it?!” So therefore they refused to enter into it. So when that (news) reached Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> he said, “If they had entered it then they would not have come out from it. Obedience is only in that which is good.” </span>[03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“There is to be no obedience to a created being in disobedience to the Creator.”</strong></span> [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said with regard to the parents:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And be thankful to Me and to your parents; the return will be to Me. And if those two strive&#8230;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning the parents,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8230; to make you associate along with Me that which you have no knowledge of then do not obey them; but live with them in this world in a good manner; and follow the way of those who turn to Me.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Soorah-Luqmaan (31), aayahs 14 and 15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">However that does not mean that obedience to the ruler ceases if he commands something sinful, but rather it means that he is not obeyed in that sin, whereas obedience to him remains in that which is not a sin.</span> This is the meaning of “There is no obedience to a created being in disobedience to the Creator.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not to be said that Allaah has commanded obedience to the ruler and He has commanded fine treatment and obedience to the parents in everything. We say, yes Allaah commanded obedience to those in authority (but), upon what is good; and He commanded obedience to the parents, however in what is good, not in disobedience to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 27 : Point 31</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And it is permissible to fight the Khawaarij if they attack the property, persons or families of the Muslims; but if they desist and depart then it is not his right to chase them nor are their wounded to be killed nor may he seize their property as booty nor may he kill those of them taken captive nor may he chase those of them who flee.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F369450953&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/it-is-permissible-to-fight-thekhawaarij-ifthey-attack-the-propertypersons-or-families-of-themuslims" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have come to know that the Khawaarij are those who hold breaking away from obedience and they hold that there is no pledge of allegiance to the person in authority (the ruler) or that no bay`ah (pledge) remains if he commits sin; and they declare the Muslims to be disbelievers on account of major sins. So those people who accept this position but they do not have strength and they do not fight then they are left, along with their being advised and having the affair made clear to them so that perhaps they may return.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for if they come to have strength and they manifest their force, then it becomes obligatory upon the Muslims to fight against them to repel their evil. And they are not fought against upon the basis that they are disbelievers; rather they are fought against upon the basis that they are Muslims who have transgressed against the Muslims and attacked them. And for this reason when the Chief of the Believers (ameerulmu·mineen), `Aliyy <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> was questioned about the Khawaarij, “Are they disbelievers?” So he said, “No, they fled away from disbelief; but rather they are a people who transgressed against us.” [01],[02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they (the Khawaarij) are not fought against upon the basis that they are disbelievers, and therefore their women and their children are not taken as slaves and their property is not seized and those of them who are injured are not killed because the fighting against them is just to repel their evil, not because of their being disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And it is permissible to fight against the Khawaarij if they attack the Muslims with regard to their property, their persons and their families,”</strong> because the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> commanded that they be fought against and because `Aliyy <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> fought against them when they attacked `Abdullaah ibn Khabbaab ibn al-Aratt <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>. And they killed him and they split open the abdomen of his slave girl who was pregnant. So then when they did that the Chief of the Believers (meaning `Aliyy <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>) resolved to fight them because the first signs of their evil had now appeared from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“But it is not for him (the Muslim ruler), if they desist and leave them alone, to chase them.”</strong> If they desist from fighting then it is not for the ruler to chase them and to wage war against them as long as they do not commit transgression. So they are astray without any doubt and it is obligatory to give them advice so that perhaps they will return; however they are not to be fought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And he may not kill their injured,”</strong> because the wounded person, his evil has been curbed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and he may not take their property as booty,”</strong> meaning their property is not taken as ghaneemah (booty/spoils of war) because it is the property of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and he may not kill those of them taken prisoner,”</strong> because they are Muslims and their evil has been prevented by their having been taken captive and by their being wounded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and those of them who flee away are not to be chased.”</strong> If they are defeated, then the ruler leaves them alone and he does not chase after them because their evil has been repelled.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] Reported by `Abdur-Razzaaq in al-Musannaf and al-Bayhaqiyy in as-Sunanul-Kubraa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> You’ll find some narrations reported by Ibn Abee Shaybah also in his Musannaf, as indicated here also by al-Bayhaqiyy. And some of the reports contain the wording that `Aliyy radiyAllaahu `anh said something similar to this with regard to the People of the Camel, meaning the Companions who fought against him in the Battle of the Camel, and in some of the reports it mentions that he said something like this with regard to the Khawaarij at Nahrawaan. And as for this wording that Shaykh al-Fowzaan mentioned here, then it is indeed as Shaykh al-Fowzaan mentioned it, he said it was with regard to the Khawaarij and it is an important difference with regard to the wording.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] <strong>Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymiyya</strong>h <em>rahimahullaah</em> said in Risaalatu Fadli Ahlil-Bayt wa Huqooqihim (a treatise with regard to the virtue of the Ahlul-Bayt, the family of the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, and their rights) “It is established from ameerul-mu·mineen `Aliyy <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> through different chains that when he fought against the People of the Camel, he did not take their children as slaves and he did not take their wealth as booty and he did not kill their wounded ones and he did not chase after those who fled and he did not kill any captive and he prayed (the funeral prayer) over those who had been killed from both sides, at both the Battle of the Camel and the Battle of Siffeen. And he said “Ikhwaanunaa baghow `alaynaa.”, “They are our brothers; they transgressed against us.” And he informed that they are not disbelievers nor are they hypocrites. And in what he said he was following the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, since he called them brothers and he declared them to be believers in the fighting and in the transgression just as is mentioned in His saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:right;">وَإِن طَائِفَتَانِ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ اقْتَتَلُوا فَأَصْلِحُوا بَيْنَهُمَا ۖ فَإِن بَغَتْ إِحْدَاهُمَا عَلَى الْأُخْرَىٰ فَقَاتِلُوا الَّتِي تَبْغِي حَتَّىٰ تَفِيءَ إِلَىٰ أَمْرِ اللَّهِ ۚ فَإِن فَاءَتْ فَأَصْلِحُوا بَيْنَهُمَا بِالْعَدْلِ وَأَقْسِطُوا ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ الْمُقْسِطِينَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if two parties or groups among the believers fall to fighting, then make peace between them both, but if one of them rebels against the other, then fight you (all) against the one that which rebels till it complies with the Command of Allah; then if it complies, then make reconciliation between them justly, and be equitable. Verily! Allah loves those who are equitable.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Sooratul-Hujuraat (49), aayah 9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said (two pages later),<span style="color:#993300;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"> “They are not equal those who were killed, who he prayed over and he called them ikhwaanunaa (our brothers), they are not equal along with those whom he did not pray over (the Khawaarij at the Battle of Nahrawaan).</span> </span>Rather, when it was said to him (quoting the aayah from Sooratul-Kahf (18), towards the end of the soorah), “Who are,</p>
<p>الَّذِينَ ضَلَّ سَعْيُهُمْ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا وَهُمْ يَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُمْ يُحْسِنُونَ صُنْعًا &#8211;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Those whose efforts have been wasted in this life while they thought that they were acquiring good by their deeds! </span></strong>(18:104)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That he replied, “They are the people of Harooraa· (meaning the Khawaarij).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, <strong>Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah</strong> rahimahullaah mentioned, “And likewise, the people of Siffeen, he prayed the funeral prayer over those who were killed from them and he said, ‘They are our brothers, they transgressed against us but the sword purified them.’ And if in his view they had been disbelievers, he would not have prayed funeral prayer over them and he would not have declared them to be brothers and he would not have stated that the sword purified anything from them.” (Minhaajus-Sunnah)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to the Khawaarij the wording is as Shaykh al-Fowzaan put it here. What is authentic with regard to the Khawaarij that he said when they asked, “Are they disbelievers?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, “No they fled from disbelief; they are a people who transgressed against us.” He didn’t call them his brothers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then he quoted the same quotes from Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 26 : Point 30</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And it is not permissible to fight the ruler, nor to rebel against him even if he oppresses. And that is because of the saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> to Aboo Tharr al-Ghifaariyy, </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em><strong>“Have patience, even if he is an Abyssinian slave.”</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And his saying to the Ansaar,</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em><strong>“Have patience until you meet me at the Reservoir (the Howd).”</strong></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">It is not from the Sunnah to fight against the ruler for it brings about corruption of the worldly life and of the Religion.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F368954357&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/it-is-not-permissible-to-fight-the-rulernor-to-rebel-against-him-even-if-he-oppresses" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible for anyone to fight against the sultaan (ruler) by rebelling against him by using weaponry because this results in major evils.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And it is not permissible to fight against the ruler, nor to rebel against him even if he is oppressive.”</strong> Meaning it is forbidden – haraam &#8211; to fight against the ruler, meaning to fight against the ruler as is done by the Khawaarij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Even if he commits oppression.”</strong> Meaning (even if) some tyranny or oppression occurs from him then the person should have sabr, patience, upon that. Because having patience upon that, even though it has harm within it, then this is lighter (less serious) than the harm which results from rebelling against him. So the harm which comes about along with having patience upon obedience to the oppressive ruler, this is less serious than the harm which comes about through rebelling against him. And there is no doubt that from the principles that are confirmed in Islaam is: ‘taking on board the lesser of two harms to repel the greater one’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said to the Ansaar,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“You will indeed see after me atharah (undue preference), so have patience until you meet me at the Howd (Great Reservoir).”</span></strong> [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He enjoined them with sabr (having patience) even though they were going to experience atharah (undue preference) against them &#8211; and it is preferring other people with wealth and excluding them. So he enjoined them with having patience because of what lies in this from repelling the greater of two evils.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And that is because of the saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> to Aboo Tharr al-Ghifaariyy, </strong><strong>“Have patience even if he be an Abyssinian slave.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning do not hold the ruler in contempt even if his appearance is not beautiful, even if he is black in colour, even if he does not have Arabian lineage, because what is counted is his position, which is the khilaafah (Caliphate) or al-imaarah (the major leadership) and what is counted is not his own person. So he is to be obeyed as long as he is a Muslim; and his bodily appearance is not to be looked to, which perhaps does not please the one who looks because of his deformity or ugliness or because of his shabby appearance or because of a defect in his body.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Even if he is a slave with severed limbs.”</strong></span> [05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this does not justify rebelling against him even if he is a sick person or he has weak health. As long as the pledge of obedience was established for him then he should have patience with him and he is to be heard and obeyed, even if he has these characteristics.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Fighting against the sultaan (ruler) is not from the Sunnah.”</strong> It is not from the Sunnah established from the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> to fight against the ruler &#8211; not in a single hadeeth, neither a weak one, nor a hasan one, nor an authentic one. There is not in the Sunnah any hadeeth which proves fighting against the Muslim ruler, even if he is sinful, even if he is an oppressor, even if he is a tyrant, even if he shows undue preference with wealth, then it is still not permissible to rebel against him. Rather the ahaadeeth, all of them, prove having patience with that and the forbiddance of rebelling against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this does not mean that the ruler shouldn’t receive naseehah, sincere advice. Rather he should be advised, in secret, privately between him and the one who is advising. So it is obligatory upon the person who has some sincere advice to take it to the ruler, just as he <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,<br />
<strong><span style="color:#808000;">“The religion is sincerity.”</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color:#808000;"> So we said, “To whom?”</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color:#808000;"> So he said,</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color:#808000;"> “To Allaah and to His Book and to His Messenger and to the rulers of the Muslims and to their common folk.”</span></strong> [06]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So that does not mean that he is not to be advised and that he is to be left alone; rather things must be made clear to him and he should be advised. And this is his right upon the scholars and upon his subjects and upon those whom he consults and upon people of sound opinion &#8211; that they give him sincere advice. [07]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And it is not from the Sunnah to fight against the sultaan (the ruler),”</strong> meaning, there is no proof for it; nothing saheeh (authentic) and nothing da`eef (weak) to show that it is legislated to fight against the Muslim ruler. Rather there is in it (the Sunnah) and in the Qur·aan also, the command to obey him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you who believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger and those in authority from amongst you.</strong></span> (Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), aayah 59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So look at his saying lÐm ‘minkum’ with the meaning, ‘from amongst you’, meaning as long as he is a Muslim, then it is obligatory to obey him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“For indeed (in rebelling against the ruler) in it lies corruption of the worldly life and of the Religion.”</strong> Fighting against the ruler brings about corruption of the worldly life such that authority is lost, fowdaa (anarchy/chaos) becomes widespread and the enemies overcome and the Religion becomes lost; since there is noone to establish the prescribed punishments and no-one who can carry out the qisaas, (retaliatory punishments) and there is no-one who can enforce the legislated rulings and give back the rights to those who deserve them and who can enforce the judicial rulings; and thus the Religion is corrupted and there is chaos and corruption. And the hand of the thief cannot be chopped, so therefore people’s wealth is lost. And the highway robbers do not have their limbs amputated and therefore the roads become disused &#8211; because who can establish all of this? He is the person in authority. This is from the function of the one in authority and no-one will be able, even if all the people gather, no one will be able to establish these affairs. Rather, chaos and anarchy will result. [08]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] Reported by al-Bukhaariyy in his Saheeh (no. 3792) and reported by Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 1845), hadeeth of Usayd Ibnul-Hudayr <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[05] Part of the same hadeeth brought by the author in the main text, hadeeth of Aboo Tharr <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>, reported by al-Bukhaariyy (no. 3792) and Muslim (no. 1845) and this being one particular wording of that, the wording reported by Muslim (no. 648)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[06] Reported by Muslim (no. 55) from hadeeth of Tameem ad-Daariyy <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[07] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymiyy <em>hafizahullaah</em> in his explanation said with regard to the word sultaan (the sultan, the one in authority), “His saying, ‘sultaan’. He used this word here to make it general, whether the person is a khaleefah (Caliph) or a malik (king), or a sultaan or a ra·ees (head or president), whatever he is, as long as he establishes the legislation of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. Whatever his title is, whether he is called a king or a sultaan (sultan) or an ameer (chief/head) or an imaam, whatever, then the witness here is that it is forbidden to rebel against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[08]<strong> Translators side point:</strong> Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmiyy <em>rahimahullaah</em> said, “I say the `aqeedah (creed and belief) of the Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah is that fighting against the ruler is not permissible, and likewise rebelling against him. It is not permissible because of the prohibition of the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and his warning against rebelling against him and the prohibition of challenging him (the ruler) which occurs in the hadeeth of `Ubaadah ibnus-Saamit (with the wording):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘And that we will not challenge those in authority with regard to the affair.’”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Footnote: Hadeeth already preceded. Translator’s note: Meaning it was part of the pledge which the Companions gave to the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> that they would not challenge those in authority of the affair.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ahmad continued,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So challenging those in authority of the affair is not permissible, and that comes about by provoking and rabble rousing the common masses to rebel against them, all of this is not permissible. And from that is criticising the rulers from the minbars, for this will only enrage the hearts of those in authority and cause estrangement between those in authority and the common masses and cause them to have no trust in each other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">‘The best of your rulers are those whom you love and who love you and who you supplicate for them and they supplicate for you. And the worst of your rulers are those who you hate and who hate you and you abuse them and they abuse you.’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they said, “We said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, shall we not challenge/go against them with regard to that?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘No, not as long as they establish the Prayer amongst you. No not as long as they establish the Prayer. Indeed, whoever has someone in authority over him and he sees him committing something from disobedience to Allaah then let him hate that which he commits from disobedience to Allaah, but let him not remove his hand from obedience.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Translator’s side point: Reported by Muslim as a hadeeth of `Owf ibn Maalik <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proofs concerning this topic and the writings, and the statements of the Salaf which cover this are plentiful. And Allaah is the One Who grants success.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And whoever rebels against one of the Muslim rulers, then he is one of the Khawaarij. He has caused dissent within the Muslims and he has contradicted the narrations and he dies a death like that of the Days of Ignorance.</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/whoever-rebels-against-one-of-the-muslim-rulers-then-he-is-one-of-the-khawaarij" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And whoever revolts against a ruler from the Muslim rulers, then he is a Khaarijiyy (one of the Khawaarij).”</strong> Whoever departs from obedience to the one in authority and rebels against his authority, using the excuse that the person in authority has sins and has acts contrary to the legislation, as is done by the Khawaarij; then he has the ruling of the Khawaarij. And the Khawaarij are a deviant group which first sprouted in the time of the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> when Thul-Khuwaysirah came and said to the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, when he saw him dividing the booty, he said to him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Do justice O Muhammad, for you have not been just!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,<br />
“Woe to you! Then who will do justice if I do not do justice?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when that man departed he <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“There will emerge from the progeny of this one&#8230;”</strong></span> Meaning from his type <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“&#8230;a people; you will belittle your Prayers in comparison to their Prayers, and your worship in comparison to their worship. They will recite the Qur·aan but it will not pass beyond their throats. They will shoot out from the Religion just as an arrow shoots straight through the game. So wherever you find them then fight them, for in fighting them there is reward for those who fight them.”</strong></span> [01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory to fight against them and that is in order to stop their evil from the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the case if they come out with weapons and they bear arms, but as for their merely manifesting the view of the Khawaarij and speaking with it but not fighting and not bearing arms, then in that case we rebuke them and we make clear to them their misguidance but we do not fight against them. However, if they gain strength and they start to fight against the Muslims then it is not permissible then for the Muslims to leave them. Rather it is obligatory upon the person in authority to fight against them, and it is obligatory upon the Muslims that they should be along with the person in authority against them, just as occurred in the khilaafah (Caliphate) of `Aliyy <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> when he fought against the Khawaarij at Nahrawaan. And the Companions joined him and they fought against the Khawaarij along with him until they killed them in the worst manner; and through that he attained the reward which Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> promised in his saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Indeed there is reward in fighting against them for those who fight against them.”</span></strong> [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is from the virtues of `Aliyy <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>, and his virtues are many. And from them is that he fought against the Khawaarij and he implemented the statement of the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> regarding them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And he has caused dissent within the Muslims and he has contradicted the narrations and his death will be the death like that of the Days of Ignorance.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Khawaarij, they are the people who broke the unity of obedience and they revolted against the person in authority. And likewise they are the ones who declare the Muslims to be disbelievers on account of major sins, kabaa·ir, which are less than shirk. So therefore they have two signs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first sign</strong> is their khurooj (rebelling) against the person in authority over the Muslims and their attempting to remove the one in authority.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second sign</strong> is that they declare the Muslims to be disbelievers on account of kabaa·ir (major sins), which are less than shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what led them to this is ghuluww (extremism), and Allaah’s refuge is sought. And therefore, the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> warned against ghuluww (extremism) saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Beware of ghuluww (extremism) for those who came before you were only destroyed on account of ghuluww (extremism/going beyond the limits.)”</span></strong> [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is adding to the Religion and adding to that which is legislated with regard to criticising an evil. This is ghuluww (extremism) which led the Khawaarij to what occurred from them. They had ghuluww, went overboard, in criticising an evil to such an extent that they split apart from unity of obedience and they went beyond the limit, to extremes in worship to the extent that they declared those people who commit major sins from the Muslims to be disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“&#8230;he has contradicted the narrations&#8230;”</strong> Meaning the ahaadeeth which occur from the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> with regard to adhering to obedience to the one in authority over the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“&#8230;and his death will be a death like that of the Days of Ignorance.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning because he has a characteristic from the characteristic of the Times of Ignorance (times of jaahiliyyah) because the Arabs in the times of jaahiliyyah (the Times of Ignorance) used to be dispersed within different tribes; they had no single ruler who would unite them, rather, each tribe would be independent on its own and they would make surprise attacks upon other tribes. And they did not unite except after Allaah sent Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. He called them to Islaam so they accepted Islaam and they came to be beneath a single banner. And therefore He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And remember the favour of Allaah upon you that you were previously enemies, so He joined between your hearts and through His favour you became brothers.</strong></span> (Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), aayah 103)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And remember when you were few and you were weak upon the earth, fearing that the people would snatch you away, and Allaah gave you shelter and He strengthened you with His aid and He provided provision for you from the good and pure things so that you may give thanks.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Anfaal (8), aayah 26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the fruits of obedience to the one in authority over the Muslims, all these good things come about through that: establishment of security, the ability to seek provisions and the people being able to travel far and wide to seek provisions on account of the roads being safe. But when there is a state of fear, then in that case the people do not travel, they do not buy and sell out of fear for themselves. So these are from the virtues of the Jamaa`ah (the United Body) and of obedience to the one in authority. As for revolting against the one in authority and splitting away from obedience then that brings about the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly:</strong> It causes the splitting of the United Body of the Muslims</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly:</strong> The shedding of blood without right</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly:</strong> The enemy overcoming; because the enemy are happy at this. And therefore you will find the disbelievers being joyful at the splitting of the Muslims, and they bring about splits between the Muslims and they aid the deviant groups. They provide them with weapons and they aid them with planning so that they rebel against the United Body of the Muslims, and splitting occurs among the Muslims, so that they can seize them as plunder, as happens. So all of this is a result of disunity and of disobeying the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and of rebelling against the ones in authority over the affairs of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In summary, one who has no ruler, then he is like a person who lives in jaahiliyyah (Times of Ignorance) and if he dies then his death is like that of the Times of Ignorance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It does not mean that he becomes a disbeliever, but rather it means that he has a characteristic from the characteristics of the Days of Ignorance in that he does not enter under obedience to a ruler; instead he lives in chaos, <em>fowdaa</em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 25 : Point 28</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Al-khilaafah (the Caliphate) remains within the Quraysh until `Eesaa ibn Maryam <em>`alayhis-salaatu was-salaam</em> (may Allaah extol him and grant him peace and security) descends.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F368935454&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/al-khilaafah-the-caliphate-remains-within-the-quraysh" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If more than person contends about who is going to take over the rulership and each one of them is fitting for rulership then precedence is given to the Qurashiyy (the person who is from the tribe of Quraysh) because of his special quality over others; because of his <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The rulers are from the Quraysh.”</strong></span> [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Give precedence to the Quraysh and do not give precedence to yourselves over them.”</strong></span> [05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if the man of Quraysh is righteous and contention occurs with regard to who will take charge, then the man of Quraysh is given precedence because of the fact that the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> gave that instruction and because the Companions when Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> passed away and when the Ansaar (the Muslims of Madeenah) said, “There should be a leader from us and a leader from you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Aboo Bakr <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> responded <strong>“The Arabs (in general) they will not submit regarding this affair except to this group of Quraysh.”</strong> [06] So therefore they gave the <em>bay`ah</em> (pledge of allegiance) to Aboo Bakr as-Siddeeq <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> and then after him to `Umar and after him to `Uthmaan and after him to `Aliyy and after him to Mu`aawiyah and after him to Banoo Umayyah and after them to Banoo `Abbaas and all of them were from Quraysh. However, if the matter is completed and concluded, then obedience becomes binding even if he is not a man of Quraysh. Or if the man of Quraysh is not suitable for rulership, for the mere fact that he is from Quraysh does not automatically give him the right to rulership unless along with being from the Quraysh, he is a righteous man and there is not already an established ruler.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“&#8230;until `Eesaa ibn Maryam <em>‘alayhis-salaatu was-salaam</em> descends.”</strong> This is an indication of the fact that `Eesaa <em>`alayhis-salaam</em> when he descends, he will descend and the ruler of the Muslims will be Muhammad ibn `Abdillaah al-Mahdee, who will be from the family of al-Hasan ibn `Aliyy ibn Abee Taalib. So this shows that the last of the rulers will indeed be from Quraysh and the first of them was from Quraysh, and he was Aboo Bakr <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> and this is what is implemented as far as possible as we have mentioned. And if no-one is found from Quraysh, this does not mean that leadership passes away. Or if someone who is not from the Quraysh establishes the affair and he becomes the leader, and the person is suitable, it doesn’t mean that we remove him and we say you are not suitable for it. So it is obligatory to have awareness of these matters. [07]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] This hadeeth is reported by at-Tayaalisiyy in his Musnad and Imaam Ahmad in his Musnad and anNasaa·ee in as-Sunanul-Kubraa and by Ibn Abee `Aasim in (his book) as-Sunnah and Aboo Ya`laa in his Musnad and al-Bayhaqiyy in as-Sunanul-Kubraa. It was declared authentic by ad-Diyaa· in his book alMukhtaarah (which included just those hadeeth that according to him were authentic).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh al-Albaaniyy mentioned this hadeeth is a hadeeth of Anas ibn Maalik <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> and the narration of Ibn Abee `Aasim mentions from Anas ibn Maalik, he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam came to us whilst we were in the house of a man from the Ansaar so he took hold of the two doorposts and he said, “The rulers are from Quraysh.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaaniyy said with regard to this narration, “It is a hadeeth that is saheeh (authentic). “</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[05] This is also reported by Ibn Abee `Aasim in his book as-Sunnah and at-Tabaraaniyy in al-Mu`jamulKabeer as occurs in the book Majma` uz-Zawaa·id.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Majma` uz-Zawaa·id: a book that includes the extra narrations outside the six books, extra narrations of the books of at-Tabaraaniyy, Aboo Ya`laa and Musnad of Imaam Ahmad and other books, hadeeth that are additional to the hadeeth in these six books; al-Haythamee’s Majma` uzZawaa·id. So this hadeeth is included there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this hadeeth is a hadeeth of `Abdullaah ibn as-Saa·ib <em>radiyAllaahu`anhumaa</em> and declared saheeh (authentic) by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy in Saheehul-Jaami`.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[06] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> This occurs in the Saheeh of al-Bukhaariyy as part of a long hadeeth of Ibn `Abbaas <em>radiyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>, (no. 6830) with the wording, <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“They won’t accept and recognise this affair except for these people of Quraysh.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[07] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmiyy <em>rahimahullaah</em> said on this point, “Al-khilaafah is within the Quraysh until `Eesaa ibn Maryam <em>`alayhis-salaam</em> descends. And there occurs in that regard the hadeeth reported by Ahmad, <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The khilaafah is to be in the Quraysh.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“However, this is to be taken to refer to khilaafah where there is a choice. But as for where there is a man who fights the people with those who are along with him and he gains authority and the people submit to him after he has overcome them, then it is obligatory to obey him whether he is from Quraysh or whether he is other than from the Quraysh, whether he is righteous or whether he is sinful.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“This is the `aqeedah (creed and belief) of the Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah who hold the obligation of that, and that it is not permissible for anyone to rebel against him after the affair is settled for him and it is settled and secured for him, even if he is sinful or wicked (then it is still obligatory to obey him).&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And the proofs for that have already preceded. From them is the hadeeth of Aboo Sa`eed al-Khudriyy and from them the hadeeth of `Urfuja (with the wording),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Whoever comes to you when your affair is united intending to split your unity and to separate your united body then kill him whoever it may be.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“So it is obligatory to hold this as creed and belief and to act upon it and Allaah is the one who grants success.”</strong></span></p>

<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And hearing and obeying the rulers in that which Allaah loves and is pleased with. So whoever becomes the <em>khaleefah</em> through the consensus of the people for him and their being pleased with him, then he is the <em>ameerul-mu&#8217;mineen </em></strong>(Chief of the Believers)<strong>. It is not permissible for anyone to spend a night thinking that he has no ruler over him whether he </strong>(the ruler) <strong>be righteous or sinful.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/hearing-and-obeying-the-rulers-in-that-which-allaah-loves-and-is-pleased-with" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the <em>u<span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>ool</em> (fundamental principles) of the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah</em> that are established in the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is <strong>hearing </strong>and<strong> obeying</strong> those in authority of the affairs of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you who Believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger and those in authority amongst you</strong></span>. (Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), aayah 59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From amongst you &#8211; Meaning from the Muslims. And the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#003300;"><strong>“I council you with <em>taqwaa</em> (dutifulness to Allaah), and with hearing and obeying; even if a slave takes charge of you.”</strong></span> [01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in a narration,<br />
<strong><span style="color:#003300;">“Even if an Abyssinian slave takes charge of you.”</span></strong> [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in a narration,<br />
<span style="color:#003300;"><strong>“Even if it be a slave whose limbs are cut off.”</strong></span> [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning with his feet and hands cut off. As long as he is<em> waleeul-amr</em> (the one in authority) it is obligatory to obey him upon good. So this is from the <em>usool</em> (fundamentals) of <em>`aqeedah</em>. And the one who revolts against the Muslim rulers, he is from the <em>daalleen</em>, those people who are astray. Either he will be a <em>khaarijiyy</em> (one of the Khawaarij) or he will be a <em>mu`taziliyy</em> (one of the Mu`tazilah) or a person of some false and futile sectarian way contrary to the Sunnah of the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And hearing and obeying the rulers with regard to that which Allaah loves and is pleased with.”</strong> With this restriction: with regard to that which Allaah loves and is pleased with. As for <em>ma`siyah</em> (sin) then they are not obeyed in that. He <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“There is to be no obedience to the creation in disobedience to the Creator.”</strong> </span>[04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he<em> `alayhis-salaatu was-salaam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">“Obedience is only in what is good.”</span></strong> [05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this does not mean that if the one in authority orders a sin to be committed that he is to be stripped of his rulership; rather, just that he is not obeyed upon this sin, but he is still to be obeyed in whatever is not a sin and his rulership remains, and he is obeyed in that which is not a sin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And whoever becomes their <em>khaleefah</em> by consensus of the people upon him and their being pleased with him then he is <em>ameerul-mu·mineen</em> (Chief of the Believers.).”</strong> This is an explanation of how rulership comes about because <em>imaamah</em> (rulership) it comes about in one of a number of ways:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong>The first matter:</strong> </span>is that which the author mentioned, and it is one whom the Muslims choose. And what is meant by those who choose the ruler is <em>ahlul-halli wal `aqd</em>, the people of authority and influence, with regard to the Scholars (the `<em>ulamaa</em>·) and the `<em>umaraa</em>· (the governors) and the people in charge of political affairs of the state and the army chiefs.<span style="color:#ff0000;"> And it does not mean that choosing the ruler is for everyone with regard to the children and the women and the town dwellers and the bedouins</span>, because the people follow on from the people of authority and influence. So if the people of authority and influence choose a ruler, it becomes obligatory upon the rest of the people to obey him. And this is just as occurred with the <em>khilaafah</em> of Aboo Bakr as-Siddeeq; because the Companions, after the passing away of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, they were agreed upon giving the pledge (<em>bay`ah</em>) to as-Siddeeq. So the rest of the nation, they followed on from those who chose as-Siddeeq, and the affair was not opened up to everyone to have a share in choosing, because this is from the role specific to the people of authority and influence. So the Muslims chose Aboo Bakr <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>, who was the best of them, and this choice they made has evidences in the Sunnah of the Messenger<em> sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>, that Aboo Bakr was the most excellent one of the Companions unrestrictedly; no-one disagreed about this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <strong>secondly</strong>, that the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> gave indications that he would succeed him. From them is that when he fell sick with his final illness he put him forward for the Prayer to lead the Muslims in the place of Prayer of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>; [06] and he stood in the standing place of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. This is an indication that he would be their imaam in the khilaafah also, just as he was their imaam in the Prayer. So therefore, they chose Aboo Bakr <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>; and they said, “<em>Should it be the case that Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam was pleased with you for our Religion and that we are not pleased with you for our worldly affairs?</em>” And the pledge to him, the <em>bay`ah</em>, was carried out and the Companions were agreed upon that, those who were involved in directly choosing; and those who were not directly involved then he is a follower. And the Muslims are a single united body and a single hand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong>The second matter:</strong></span> is that when Aboo Bakr was at the point of death he chose `Umar ibnul-Khattaab and specified him to take his place; so the Muslims heard him and obeyed him. And this is the second way from the ways of establishing rulership, and it is that the person in authority chooses the one who will take charge after his death, just as Aboo Bakr did when he chose `Umar <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong>The third matter:</strong> </span>If one of the Muslims overcomes and gains authority and causes the people to submit to his rulership then he will be their chief and ruler as occurred regarding `<strong>Abdul-Malik ibn Marwaan</strong>. Because when there was disagreement after the death of Yazeed ibn Mu`aawiyah, then `Abdul Malik ibn Marwaan ibn al-Hakam took control of the affair [07]. And he was a man bold/astute, determined, strong and Allaah brought about benefit through him. And the pledge to him (the bay`ah) was established and the Muslims heard him and obeyed so in that lay good for the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are the ways in which rulership of the ruler can be established; either by the people of authority and influence choosing, or by the previous ruler specifying the one who will take charge after him or by someone from the Muslims taking control such that he becomes their ruler and the people submit to him and obey and comply with him, then in that case it is not permissible for anyone to split and break the unity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, <strong>“by consensus of the Muslims,”</strong> <span style="color:#ff0000;">it should not be understood from this that it is essential for all of the Muslims to make the choice</span>. However, that will be attained by the consensus of the people of authority and influence as happened in the time of Aboo Bakr <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> and as happened with regard to the khilaafah of `Uthmaan <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>; for the ones who chose him were the <em>ahlush-shooraa</em> (People of the Council) and they were the remainder of the ten promised Paradise. They chose him, so his rulership was established and no-one raised any objection to that. Rather, they all agreed in consensus to the rulership of `Uthmaan <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“It is not permissible for anyone to spend a night thinking that there is no ruler over him whether he be a righteous person or a wicked/sinful person.”</strong> This is a very important matter, and it is that it is not permissible for a person to rebel against the United Body of the Muslims and to separate away from obedience. For if he does that <strong>“and he spends a single night and he has no ruler”</strong> whose rulership he believes (meaning, not believing he has rulership over him), then this person <strong>“has thrown off the rope of Islaam from his neck.”</strong> [08]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning that he was along with the Muslims and connected to the Muslims but when he rebelled/went out of obedience to the ruler, then he cut his link with the Muslims; just like the small lambs which used to have a long rope which would have loops coming off it, and the heads of the lambs would be put in these loops to safeguard them from being lost; and they were called <em>ar-ribq</em> (nooses). So the Muslims being united upon a ruler is likened to that. So whoever departs from obedience to the ruler, then he has thrown off this noose from his neck and exposed himself to becoming lost and to the wolves and to the winds. It does not mean that he becomes a disbeliever, its meaning is that he has split away from the united body (the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>) and he has exited from obedience, so he has become like an animal that has left his connecting rope and has exposed itself to wild animals and to being snatched away or stolen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it should not be said, <span style="color:#ff0000;">“I haven’t given any pledge of allegiance and I have no ruler,”</span> for you are just one of the Muslims, so when the people of influence and authority give the pledge then you follow on from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] This is part of the hadeeth of al-`Irbaad ibn Saariyah <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> and its checking has already preceded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> This hadeeth is a hadeeth reported by Aboo Daawood and at-Tirmithiyy and Ibn Maajah and others and declared saheeh (authentic) by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] Reported by al-Bukhaariyy (no. 693) from Anas <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> and reported by Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 1837) from a hadeeth of Ummul-Husayn <em>radiyAllaahu `anhaa</em> (it says Umm Mihsan and it should say Ummul-Husayn <em>radiyAllaahu `anhaa</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the wordings of the hadeeth reported by Muslim,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“Even if it be an Abyssinian slave with his limbs cut off.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] Reported by Muslim (no. 1837) from a hadeeth of Ummul-Husayn <em>radiyAllaahu `anhaa</em> and also reported by Muslim (no. 648) from Aboo Tharr <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] This hadeeth is reported by Imaam Ahmad in the Musnad and at-Tabaraaniyy in al-Mu`jamul-Kabeer and al-Qudaa`ee in the Musnad of Shihaab and others. And the wording here is that of at-Tabaraaniyy and of al-Qudaa`ee. And the wording of Ahmad is,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“There is to be no obedience to a created being in disobedience to Allaah.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Translator’s side point: And this is from the hadeeth of `Imraan Ibn Husayn <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>. It was declared saheeh, authentic, by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy in As-Saheehah (no. 179)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The basis of this occurs in the two Saheehs as a hadeeth of `Aliyy <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> and it will follow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[05] Reported by al-Bukhaariyy in his Saheeh (no. 7145) and Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 1840) as a hadeeth of `Aliyy <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em> and the wording of Muslim is, <strong>“There is no obedience in disobedience to Allaah. Obedience is only in what is good.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[06] Reported by al-Bukhaariyy and Muslim (no.418) from a hadeeth of `Aa·ishah<em> radiyAllaahu `anhaa</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[07] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> He took charge in the year 65 and his khilaafah lasted until year 86 or 87; Allaahu A`lam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[08] Muslim reports in his Saheeh from a hadeeth of `Abdullaah ibn `Umar with the wording, <strong>“And whoever dies and he does not have pledge to the ruler upon his neck, he will die a death of the days of ignorance.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in a narration from Ibn `Umar reported by al-Haakim in (his book) al-Mustadrak upon the Two Saheehs (that Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">“Whoever departs from the United Body of the Muslims </span></strong><span style="color:#333300;">(the Jamaa`ah)</span><strong><span style="color:#333300;"> by a hand span then he has thrown off the rope of Islaam from his neck until he returns.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">“And whoever dies and does not have a ruler of the Jamaa’ah </span></strong><span style="color:#333300;">(the United Body of Muslims)</span><strong><span style="color:#333300;"> upon him then his death will be a death of the days of ignorance.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> This hadeeth was mentioned by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy in As-Saheehah affirming it under hadeeth no. 984 and it was declared by Shaykh Muqbil <em>rahimahullaah</em> in his checking of al-Mustadrak that he said this hadeeth is to the standard of Muslim.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The definition of the people who adhere and ascribe to this methodology:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Suroorees are a group of people or a sect that ascribe themselves to <strong>Muhammad Suroor Zayn-ul-‘Aabideen</strong>. They have some aspects of the Sunnah and some aspects of Bid’ah (innovation) in them. The most important characteristics that can be noted from them are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <strong>They attack the rulers and speak about them in a manner that results in evil, corruption and danger</strong>. It appears that they declare the leaders to be disbelievers, but this can only be understood by way of their circumstances and actions and cannot be picked up from their words. This is since the path they take is the path of the Khawaarij or close to it, knowing that the religious texts state the obligation of hearing and obeying the rulers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And our rulers in this land (of Saudi Arabia) are Muslims – all praise be to Allaah. They use Allaah’s Legislation for judging in their court systems and they establish the prescribed punishments (hudood). So declaring them to be disbelievers or talking about them in a manner that leads to revolting and rebelling against them is considered a great form of causing corruption. Due to this, we must warn against those who adhere to this methodology or rid ourselves from them, especially since they have attacked the scholars of this land by reviling them, making slanderous remarks against them and accusing them of betraying the Deen. This matter indicates what they are behind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. <strong>They call to Jihaad, but they do not intend by it the Jihaad against the disbelievers.</strong> Rather it seems like they intend by it to change the leaders, knowing that we cannot rid the leaders of their errors. And we do not claim that they are infallible however we say: It is obligatory to obey them and to advise them in a private manner because they are Muslims. And the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) forbade us from rebelling against the leader unless the one rebelling sees clear disbelief upon him by which he will have a proof from Allaah in the matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. <strong>They claim that the scholars in this land do not understand the current affairs</strong>. And they can be refuted by the fact that the Muftees and the judges do not issue a fatwa in a single issue nor do they judge in a single matter except after coming to know its state of affairs, which encompasses it, such as the cause, the conditions for the ruling and its effects. So whoever claims that these scholars and judges do not understand the current affairs then he has wronged himself and spoken what is not permissible for him to say. As for knowing the plans and schemes of the enemies and so on, then this falls under the jurisdiction of each country’s army.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="dropcap">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>From his book Al-Amr Bi-Luzoom Al-Jamaa&#8217;ah wa Imaamihim (pg. 114-117)</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"><em>Translator : isma&#8217;eel alarcon</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="bodytext"><span class="bodytext">Allaah says: <b>&#8220;O you who believe! Avoid much suspicion. Verily, some (forms of) suspicion is sinful.&#8221; </b>[Surah Al-Hujuraat: 12]</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the two Saheeh collections (of Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim), Abu Hurairah (radhi Allaahu anhu) reported that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: <b>&#8220;Beware of suspicion, for indeed suspicion is the most false type of speech.&#8221; </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, holding bad thoughts for the Muslim leaders in their administrative actions and the decisions that they make is truly a door to evil, which leads the one who engages in it to fall into matters forbidden in the Religion. And it&#8217;s harm can spread to the general masses of people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when the door to holding bad thoughts about the actions enforced by the Muslim leaders is opened and each person begins to express his thoughts about these actions, the people fall into the suspicion that is condemned in the Religion. And each person is brought into the talk of that which doesn&#8217;t concern him and liking the he said/she said (gossip) which is forbidden in the Religion. And those who have no say in matters or bear any position of responsibility (with respect to leadership) will begin to voice themselves. All of this has a harmful effect upon the people collectively, for it is one of the ways of the Devil in causing catastrophes and warranting rebellion against the leaders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whatever leads to an evil consequence must be prevented even if it is something that is allowed (<i>mubaah</i>). So how much more so when the thing that leads to it is forbidden (in itself) and when the thing being led to is the source of evil?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaikh Muhammad Ibn &#8216;Abdil-Lateef</strong> and <strong>Shaikh &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn &#8216;Abdil-&#8216;Azeez Al-&#8216;Anqaree</strong> said in a letter written [1] by them to the people during the time of the fitnah of the Ikhwaan against the king &#8216;Abdul &#8216;Azeez, may Allaah have mercy on him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;From the things that the Devil causes to enter into some of the practicing Muslims is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Accusing the Muslim scholars of flattering and kissing up (to the leaders), suspicious thoughts (about them), and not taking (knowledge) from them. This is all a cause for one&#8217;s being prevented from beneficial knowledge.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another thing that the Devil puts into them is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Holding bad thoughts for the leader and failing to obey him. Indeed, this is from the greatest types of sins and it is from the ways of the people of Jaahiliyyah, those who did not hold hearing and obeying (the leader) as being part of the Religion. Rather, each of one of them followed his own opinion.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The evidences from the Book and the Sunnah clearly demonstrate the obligation of hearing and obeying the (Muslim) leader in times of hardship and times of ease and in things that one likes and things that one hates. This is such that he (saws) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8216;Hear and obey (the leader), even if he takes your money and whips your back.&#8217;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is forbidden to disobey him and oppose him in his authority, in his relations, in his agreements and in his treaties, for he is a representative of the Muslims and looking out for what is in their best interests. And his looking out for them is better than their looking out for their own selves. This is since through his leadership, the order of the Religion remains established and the unity of the Muslims remains in tact.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is especially the case since Allaah has blessed you with a leader whose authority is that of religious authority. [2] And he has guided the masses of his subjects from the Muslims, especially the practicing ones amongst them, by being kind to them and building masaajid for them and sending out callers (du&#8217;aat) to them and overlooking their errors and acts of ignorance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this existing in the last portion of these times is from the greatest bounties that Allaah has bestowed to the people of this (Arab) peninsula.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is an obligation upon them to be thankful for this bounty and to consider it. And they should support him and be loyal to him inwardly and outwardly. So it is not permissible for anyone to betray him, nor to carry out some matter except with his permission.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whoever betrays him with treason then he has strove to sow the seeds of dissension amongst the Muslims against him, and he has split away from the Jamaa&#8217;ah (main body of Muslims). The Prophet (saws) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8216;Whoever disobeys the Ameer (leader) has disobeyed me. And whoever disobeys me has disobeyed Allaah.&#8217;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is intended by the word Ameer in this hadeeth is the person whom Allaah has given authority over the affairs of the Muslims, and he is the greater Imaam.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân:</strong> We love Jihâd and wish for it, but this is not Jihâd! We have said that this is not Jihâd. This is destruction! Is it Jihâd to kill people without due right? He even kills himself without due right. Is this Jihâd? This is not Jihâd. Jihâd has rulings, conditions and rules. It is the Muslim ruler who leads and calls to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even the israelites said to their prophet:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Send to us a king, and we will fight in the way of Allah&#8221;</span> (2:246)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They didn&#8217;t go armed to fight on their own:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Send to us a king, and we will fight in the way of Allah&#8221;</span> (2:246)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I.e. a leader. Who did they ask it from? One of their prophets, the ruler.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jihâd, which is one of the disposals of the ruler, is referred to the ruler. He is the one who orders it and takes on it. He is the one who recruits armies and prepares weapons. Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;&#8230; by which you may terrify the enemy of Allah and your enemy&#8230;&#8221;</span> (8:60)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He did not say you should terrify the Muslims and those one has a treaty with. He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;&#8230; by which you may terrify the enemy of Allah and your enemy&#8230;&#8221;</span> (8:60)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: There are those who incite the youths and say that our brothers are dying everywhere. They call in the name of Jihâd and that one shouldn&#8217;t obey the ruler in this (I.e. in Jihâd). Can you say something regarding this matter?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân</strong>: Shall we then also kill our own children, tear our homes apart and kill the Muslims if our brothers die everywhere? They rejoice in this. They rejoice in getting our brothers into these countries. They rejoice over these homicide-attacks in our countries. Is this Jihâd? Does this affect our enemies? It only affects us. It only affects the Muslims.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen about the Arab rulers (exclusive, detailed Fatwâ)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Scholar</strong>: Imâm Muhammad bin Sâlih bin ´Uthaymîn<br />
<strong>Source:</strong> Liqâ’ al-Bâb al-Maftûh (51 B)<br />
<strong>Reference</strong>: Darulhadith.com<br />
Translation and Video by aFatwa.com (site is down)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">There is a matter it is written much about and it goes by the name “Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamâ’ah” while in fact it is the methodology of Khawârij. We would like to confirm this matter with you. It is namely about the general legislation the rulers are judged by. They argue with your Fatwas in “al-Majmû’ ath-Thamîn” and that this deed is clear disbelief since it is about Tabdîl, replacement. This opinion is also attributed to Shaykh Muhammad bin Ibrâhîm [Âl ash-Shaykh] (rahimahullâh). In order for the answer to be explicit and clear, the question goes as follows; does one take into consideration the factors that hinder from Takfîr or the Iqâmat-ul-Hujjah which Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamâ’ah put as a condition for the one who rules by a general legislation rather than the law of Allâh?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymîn:</strong> A factor that hinders from Takfîr shouldn’t exist when a person performs a disbelieving deed [I.e. if we are to do Takfîr]. It is therefore mentioned in the authentic Hadîth when the prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) was asked if they should fight against the rulers that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Except if you see clear and explicit disbelief of which you have proof from Allâh.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The disbelief has to be clear and known and it shouldn’t be possible to misunderstand it. If one can misunderstand it, then one doesn’t do Takfîr on the person who falls into it (this deed) EVEN IF THE DEED IS DISBELIEF. There is a difference between the speech and the speaker and (between) the deed and the doer. The deed can be a defiant sin without the person (whom performs it) being a defiant sinner because there is an obstacle that hinders him from being it. It can also be disbelief without the person being a disbeliever because there is an obstacle that hinders him from being is (I.e. a disbeliever).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was nothing other than this unsound misinterpretation that made the rebellion of the Khawârij harm the Islâmic Ummah. Khawârij get the idea that the deed is disbelief and (thusly) they revolt, which they said to ‘Alî bin Abî Tâlib. They were together with ‘Alî bin Abî Tâlib against the army of Shâm. After the peace treaty between ‘Alî bin Abî Tâlib and Shâm, Khawârij revolted against him after having been with him. He fought against them and killed them and all praise is due to Allâh. The point lies in the fact that they revolted against him and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“You have judged by something other than the law of Allâh. You have let the human judge.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a result thereof, they revolted against him. Thus, the catastrophe of the Ummah is because of this misinterpretation. A person can mistakenly get the idea that something is clear and explicit disbelief and revolt (due to it). It is possible that the deed really is disbelief without its doer being a disbeliever because of an obstacle (I.e. ignorance, compulsion etc). The rebel believes that this person is free from excuses and (thus) does the likes of these revolts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, a person has to make sure not to be in a hurry with making Takfîr or Tafsîq upon the humans. There is a risk that a person falls into a clear, defiant sin without knowing about it. When he finds out that it is forbidden, he thanks you (Jazâk Allâhu khayr) and leaves it. Does this exist? Yes, beyond the shadow of a doubt [it does]. How can I then judge a person to be a defiant sinner while he hasn’t received the truth?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those you accuse among the Arab and Muslim rulers can be excused. They have perhaps not received the truth. They maybe have received it while at the same time somebody made them misunderstand the matter. Thus, one has to be sensible when it comes to this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let us say that all of the conditions have been met for us to be allowed to revolt in the way that we have seen clear and explicit disbelief of which we have proof from Allâh. It is a condition to have seen it. The disbelief is a condition. That it is clear and explicit is a condition. That we have proof of it from Allâh is a condition. These are four conditions. His (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) words “except if you see…” are there so that one doesn’t fall victim to baseless rumours. It means that one should be convinced. The word “disbelief” (Kufr) is there so that one doesn’t get hung up on a defiant sin. If the ruler is a sinning alcoholic without having fallen into disbelief, then it is not allowed to revolt against him. The words “clear and explicit” mean that it is definite and that it (the Kufr) can’t be misinterpreted. The fourth is “of which you have proof from Allâh”. It should thusly not only be definite according to us. Rather, we should base ourselves on clear and definite evidence. These four conditions are the conditions for it to be allowed to revolt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, there is a fifth condition for the revolt to be obligatory. Is it obligatory for us to revolt against the ruler just because it is allowed? One has to consider the advantage. Are we able to overthrow him? [If yes] then in this case we revolt. If we are unable, then we do not revolt. All religious duties are only [duties] if they are doable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, if we are able to revolt, then there is a risk that the disadvantage is greater and worse than if this leader were to keep his (position as a) leader. If we revolt against him and he wins, we become more humiliated while he becomes even worse in his transgression and disbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These matters require common sense and that it is tethered with the Sharî’ah and that it isn’t led by emotions. We are in need of emotions in order to have enthusiasm and we are in need of the Sharî’ah to curb us. We have to have brakes. A car without brakes will crash and a car without power doesn’t drive.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Does it belong to the methodology of the Salaf to condemn the leaders, mention their errors and backbite them from the pulpits? How does one advise the rulers according to the methodology of the Salaf? How should it occur?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn Bâz</strong>: This question has been posed several times. It does not belong to the methodology of the Salaf to mention the shortcomings of the rulers from the pulpits. It leads to revolts and that people refrain from hearing and obeying in that which is allowed. It leads to something that only harms and benefits nothing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Salaf&#8217;s followed methodology is to advise him in seclusion, write to him and let the scholars contact him so that they can lead him to that which is good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sins should be mentioned without the mentioning of the sinner. Fornication, spirits and interest [all of these] should be condemned without condemning the one who falls into them. It is enough that one condemns the sins and warns against them without mentioning the sinner, regardless if he is the ruler or anybody else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the tribulation of &#8216;Uthmân&#8217;s (radhiya Allâhu &#8216;anh) time broke out, some people said to Usâmah bin Zayd (radhiya Allâhu &#8216;anh):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Will you not condemn &#8216;Uthmân?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Should I condemn him amongst the people? I will condemn him in seclusion without opening the gate of evil to the people.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When they initiated the evilness in the time of &#8216;Uthmân (radhiya Allâhu &#8216;anh) and condemned him publicly, the tribulation, battles and corruption became a fact. To this day one finds traces of all that. It led to the Fitnah between &#8216;Alî and Mu&#8217;âwiyah. &#8216;Uthmân and &#8216;Alî were killed because of it. Many companions and others were killed because of the public condemnation. As a result, the people started hating their ruler and killed him.</p>

<p><strong>Shaykh Ibn &#8216;Uthaymîn:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for this government, you know that the country rules by Islâmic Sharî&#8217;ah. The judges only judge by Islâmic Sharî&#8217;ah. The fast is maintained. The pilgrimage is maintained. The lectures in the mosques are maintained. As for the one who errs or is liable to fall into a tribulation (fitnah), then both the evil and that which leads to the evil has to be prevented.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we (take a) look at our country, we neither see buildings upon the graves, Tawâf around the graves or Sûfiyyah&#8217;s and others innovations publicly. However, it is possible that some [people] possess the innovations of Sûfiyyah and the like that they keep for themselves. On the other hand, all societies have some form of corruption.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">If we consider this and compare it with other adjacent countries outside of Saudi Arabia, we see a very big difference. Alcoholic drinks (Khamr) are sold openly in the stores in some adjacent countries. The restaurants are open in daytime during Ramadhân so that one can eat and drink as much as one wants. There are prostitutes in public. Some who travel to these countries as tourists told me that one is asked as soon as one arrives at the airport:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">&#8220;There are boys and girls. What do you want?&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">This is taking place publicly.</span> One has to face the facts concerning one&#8217;s government and one&#8217;s country. He should not disseminate the bad sides that the ruler might be excused for and completely ignore the good sides. It is as if there is nothing good at all in the government. It is not fair. Allâh (ta&#8217;âlâ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ كُونُواْ قَوَّامِينَ لِلّهِ شُهَدَاء بِالْقِسْطِ وَلاَ يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شَنَآنُ قَوْمٍ عَلَى أَلاَّ تَعْدِلُواْ اعْدِلُواْ هُوَ أَقْرَبُ لِلتَّقْوَى</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; O you who believe! Stand out firmly for Allâh and be just witnesses and let not the enmity and hatred of others make you avoid justice. Be just: that is nearer to piety, and fear Allâh.&#8221; (5:8, interpretation of the meanings)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If someone were to ask why something like this happens, then the answer is primarily an unrestrained vigilance. It is neither curbed by the Sharî&#8217;ah nor the common sense, which is due to ignorance. Secondly, it is due to the desire. Thus, all of it is due to two things: Ignorance about the Sharî&#8217;ah or the wisdom or also the desire. Although he knows that it is wrong he (still) disseminates these things that entice the people away from the rulers and fills them with hate towards them. He does it only because he has something against the rulers and wants to vent his anger on them.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">In the Name of Allaah, the Most Beneficent the Most Merciful</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Verily! Allaah will not change the good (or bad condition) of a people as long as they don’t change their state of goodness (or sins and wrong doings etc) themselves.&#8221;</strong></span> [13:11].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Ibnul Qayyim</strong>, rahimahullahs, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">&#8220;Ponder upon the Hikmah (Wisdom) of Allaah, the most High, where He has made people&#8217;s kings, leaders, and those of authority over them, of the same kind as their own deeds. It is as if the people&#8217;s deeds appeared in the forms of their kings and leaders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">If the people are upright, then their kings and rulers will be upright, and if they turn away (from uprightness), then their leaders will turn against them. And if they oppress and tyrannize, then their kings and rulers will tyrannize and oppress. And if deception and treachery becomes manifest amongst them, then the same will appear in their rulers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">If the people refrain from fulfilling the rights of Allaah upon them and become niggardly (regarding their execution), then their kings and rulers will refuse to give them their rights and will become niggardly (withhold their rights from them). And if they take away from those whom they oppress that which they deserve not to take, then the kings will take away from the people that which they deserve not to take and will levy taxes and impose tasks upon them. And whatever the people unjustly take from the oppressed, their kings take the same by force from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">So those in charge of the people appear in the forms of their (the ruled) deeds. And it befits not the Divine Wisdom that the evil and wicked be ruled except by those of the same kind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">And since the early [Muslims] were the best and most righteous of generations, their rulers were of the same standing. But when the people turned weak, their rulers turned to be of their own rank.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">So it befits not the Hikmah (Wisdom) of Allaah in these times (Ibnul Qayyim times [1] ) that rulers the like of Mu&#8217;aawiyah and &#8216;Umar bin &#8216;Addil &#8216;Azeez, be in charge over us, and even less the like of Abee Bakr and &#8216;Umar. Rather, our rulers are in accordance with our own rank and standing, and the ones who ruled those before us were (also) in accordance with these people own rank and standing. And both matters (the status of the former rulers and those of this time) are as necessitated and entailed by [Allaah&#8217;s] Hikmah.&#8221; [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is very evident that from the legal perspective and by the consensus of the early Muslims, as well as by way of intellect and experience, that the true change of the status of the Ummah occurs when it turns to Allaah and follows the ways that made the early generations successful. Imaam Maalik, rahimahullah, summed it in words few in number, profound in meaning:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Nothing will benefit the Ummah to come except that which benefited the early Ummah.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who adopt the path of confrontation with the rulers, thinking that the change comes through this way, are trailing the path of misguidance and a path whose consequences proved it wrong by all perspectives. This is the same path taken by the early dissidents (khawaarij) who followed the mutashaabih (not entirely clear) texts instead of following the muhkam (clear) texts and referring whatever may be not entirely clear to that which is mukham. The following of the mutashaabih is a path of fitan (afflictions) that led to the rebellion against the leaders of the sahaabah, and in our times has caused bloodshed and suffering and retardation of da&#8217;wah. Allaahul Must&#8217;aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This matter is a matter of Deen and not a matter of emotions. And since the textual proofs are replete commanding the believers that they must obey those in authority, even if they oppress and take ones wealth, etc As long as they do not command the believer to do sin, then we have no choice but to comply and obey. Otherwise, we will be inventing a new Deen. Allaah, the One Free of all imperfection, the most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Let those beware who withstand the Rasool&#8217;s (صلى الله عليه و سلم) orders, unless some fitnah befalls them or a grievous penalty be inflicted on them&#8221;</strong></span> [24:63]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Whatever was not Deen at the time of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) cannot be considered to be a part of the Deen today.&#8221;</strong> </span>[Imaam Maalik].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if the person choses to contend the way of the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم), then let him remember the following aayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">If anyone contends with and opposes the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) after the right path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers way, We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and burn him in Hell- what an evil destination!</span></strong> [4:115]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah, the most Merciful, guide us all to the truth and make us hold to it and may He, the most High and Majestic, save us all from fitan and guide us (ruled and rulers) to His Path. Aameen.</p>

[audio https://salafiaudio.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/contemporary-issues-demonstrations-and-other-corrupts-practices-saleh-as-saleh.mp3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, and the noble companions and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Previously, we discussed the legal and illegal pledges, known as al-bay’ah, as well as partisanship (hizbiyyah). In continuity with that, it is appropriate to discuss certain practices that are taking place in the Muslim world in the form of so-called protests, namely demonstrations, sitins, and strikes. In our time, some people embrace everything that comes to us from the east or west. These practices are not an exception. This has reached the extent that some consider these practices as a means for da’wah (calling others to Allah). Given this, it is appropriate to determine whether this is the reality.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Types of Protests and Their Intentions</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are three specific types of protests that are used. They are demonstrations, sit-ins, and strikes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A <strong>demonstration</strong> is when a group of people will meet along a street or a main road carrying banners, shouting, yelling, and demanding certain things be done or to show strength. This is known in Arabic as mudhaharah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A <strong>sit-in</strong> is known as ‘itisam in Arabic. In our times, it involves sitting in one place (e.g., headquarters of a party, parliament, a factory, a campus, etc.) for a certain time, without leaving, in objection to some grievance, demanding that grievance be addressed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third type of protest is a <strong>strike</strong>. This is known as idrabat, with the origin of this word meaning refraining. As such, you refuse or hold back from doing a certain practice in order to request something. Examples of this include workers in a factory refusing to go to work, demanding higher wages or students not going to school, protesting a certain matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Given the definition of the different matters, the question arises how these things crept into the Islamic society. Mostly, they came from the West where they appeared originally; it was transferred to the Muslim world by primarily political and secular parties. These practices were later embraced by some Islamic groups who imitated such a methodology while trying to find some evidence in shariah to support these practices.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Evidences Cited to Justify Protests</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is important to note that those who cite evidences justifying these practices are not scholars. They are primarily thinkers and writers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First, they cite the narration that when Umar ibn al-Khattab (radi Allahu ‘anhu) accepted Islam, the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) came out resting on the shoulders of two companions, namely Umar and Hamza. This was done to show the strength of the Muslims to the pagan Arabs of Quraysh. This hadith was reported by Abu Nu’aim in his book, al-Hillayyah. al-Haafidh ibn Hajar also reported it in his book al-Issaba relating it to Muhammad ibn Uthman’s book of history and as well as in al-Fath where he related it to al-Bazaar. The narrations of this incident revolve around a person named Ishaaq ibn ‘Abdullah ibn Abi Farwa. However, his hadith is rejected. Therefore, this incident can not be cited as a proof.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second, these thinkers also take as proof the gathering of the Muslims on ‘Eid and Fridays. They twist the nature of these events to make them evidence for the permissibility of demonstrating, sit-ins, and showing strength. In response, it is necessary to note that there is no evidence in this. The gatherings on ‘Eid and Fridays are acts of worship and can not be linked to these protests. These gatherings are to make manifest the symbols of Allah in worship, in accordance with the way Allah chose and commanded. We can not stretch these acts of worship the way we want as this would entail abuse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, there is no legally justifiable stance for these protests.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Effects of Protests</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The effects of these protests, demonstrations and strikes are numerous and very serious.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>, they bring forth chaotic behavior to the streets due to crowding and the like, negatively influencing the affairs of people. They can easily endanger the lives of many, while also providing an environment for theft and robbery. Many businesses could also be affected; for example, if a business does not close on the day of a demonstration, the protesters may vandalize or damage the building or even label the owners as traitors. And all of this occurred in many Islamic and Non-Islamic Capitals in the World.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>, even when people try to go along with these protests to protect their benefits, they are forced to close their shops, negatively impacting their affairs as well as the economy in general. If they do not close their shops they are called &#8220;traitors&#8221;, &#8220;un-patriotic,&#8221; and so forth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly</strong>, these protests provide a golden opportunity for those with hidden agendas or the people of fitnah to infiltrate the ranks of these demonstrations, to the degree where some of them may use firearms to create a fitnah or escalate the confrontation between the demonstrators and the security forces. This will lead the security forces to return fire on the crowd, potentially wounding many people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourthly</strong>, these acts instigate animosity and hatred between the members of society, specifically the citizens and the security forces. Since the security forces usually try to prevent these demonstrations, there will be bloodshed and injury, which may lead to revenge attacks.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifthly</strong>, these practices lead to the halting of economic production in many sectors of the economy, especially during strikes. Most of the time when these groups intend to demonstrate, they ask the factory workers to join them, causing work to cease at times when the country is in dear need of collaboration between its ranks.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sixthly</strong>, these protests disturb the overall security in the land due to the confrontations associated with them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Seventhly</strong>, those who took these practices as a means of worship are worshiping Allah through a methodology that is not legislated and baseless. Therefore, they end up worshipping Allah through a way that is not acceptable to Him (: subhannahu wa ta’ala). For any act to be accepted, it must be done with the correct intentions and condoned by shariah. The actions of these people remind us of the statement of ibn Masoud (radi Allahu ‘anhu) when he said, “Many are those who intended good but could not achieve it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In order to attain the good, you must work according to the sunnah and the legal methods.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Eightly</strong>, these demonstrations hasten confrontations between the groups that utilize them and the government, since these practices appear as threats to the survival and security of the government itself. Therefore, the plotting begins against these groups, often resulting in unpleasant consequences and continuous animosity and mistrust.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The claim that these protests are permissible has led to their acceptance by the rejectionist Shia’ (Raafidah), who made such demonstrations against what they classified as imperialism during Hajj. Many innocent people were killed because of this, as is well known.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Misconceptions</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are numerous misconceptions regarding the value and permissibility of these practices. For example, some note that other countries regulate demonstrations and permit them according to their laws. As such, they fail to recognize the harm in doing the same. The response to this is that even if the government was to allow such practices, then we should not resort to them because there is no legal evidence justifying them, and we have to follow shariah above all other matters. We do not follow the general motto that says, “Objectives justify the means.” In Islam, the objectives must be legal, and the means that attain these objectives must be legal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, others engage in these practices saying, “So-and-so considered these practices to be permissible.” However, it is necessary to note that these acts were not practised by the salaf, and had these demonstrations been something beneficial, they would have resorted to it, and we have no reports to indicate such. Moreover, when someone gives a fatwa, what really matters is the daleel (evidences) as any opinion without a proof can not be considered, even if it is made by the most knowledgeable of people as we are obligated to follow the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and his companions who informed us all that is good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If someone asserts that these practices had some benefits during certain times or in some countries, bringing useful results, then the response is that such results is not a proof for their permissibility since the criteria is the affirmation of the daleel and the acting of the salaf. Furthermore, we assert that if these demonstrations were successful during certain times, then most often, they failed and only lead to casualties, hastening confrontations with these groups, leading to their disintegration.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Conclusion</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are some points concerning these contemporary matters, which are counter productive and have depleted the energy of Muslim groups and youths in many parts of the Muslim world. We ask Allah to save us and to save our societies from all forms of corrupt and deviant practices, and to show us the truth and make us follow it while showing us the falsehood and safeguarding us from that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, and the noble companions and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Refuting the Misconception that Obedience is Valid Only to the Greater Imaam.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allaah, the Beneficent, the Most Merciful, I begin (to write): The following Question was received from a brother in USA:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Assalaamu &#8216;alaykum wa rahmatullaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As you know, there are a number of ahaadeeth concerning how Muslims are to deal with the Muslim rulers, including the sinful and oppressive rulers. How would you respond to the one who claims that these ahaadeeth are concerning the khaleefah of the Muslims, not the various leaders, kings, or prime ministers of today?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Baarakallaahu-feek.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Wa&#8217;alaykum as-Salaam wa Rahmatullaahi wa Barakaatuh</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Shubuha (misconception) that the Ahaadeeth of obedience to the Rulers are restricted to the general Khaleefah (greater Imaam) is, al-hamdulillah, already answered by the scholars of Islaam. Here are some of their statements:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- <strong>Sh. Al-Islam Ibn Taymeyah</strong> (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The sunnah is that the Muslims have one Imaam and the rest are his deputies. Suppose, however, the Ummah abandoned this due to a sin from some part of it and incapacity from the rest or for a reason other than that and which led to having number of Imaams, then it is binding upon each Imaam to establish the Hudood (prescribed punishments) and fulfill the rights (of people).&#8221; [Majmoo&#8217; al- Fataawaa, 35/175-176].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- <strong>Imaam Ash-Shawkaani</strong> (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;In Principle, all Muslims should have one Imaam. However, after the spread of Islam and the expansion of its territories and their remoteness, it is known that in each region there became a ruler or Imaam and so with the rest of the regions, none of them having authority to command and forbid in the other regions&#8230; So the presence of various (multiple) Imaams and Rulers is of no harm, and it is binding to obey each one of them after giving him the bay&#8217;ah (pledge of allegiance) in the region in which his commands and prohibitions are executed therein. And similarly in the case of the one in charge of another region. And it is not obligatory upon the people of the other regions to obey him, nor to be under his governorship due to the remoteness of the regions&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said: &#8220;You should know this, since it is fitting to the Sharee&#8217;ah Foundations, and in full agreement to what is indicated by the evidences. And turn down what is being said in opposition to this, since the difference between the condition of the early Islamic wilaayah (administrative governship) and its state nowadays is clearer than the sun during the day.&#8221; [Imaam Ash-Shawkaani in As- Sayelul Jarraar, 4/512].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- <strong>Sh. Imaam Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdil Wahaab</strong> (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Imaams from each Madh-hab are unanimous that whoever overtakes a country or countries (seizes power) is entitled to assume the same rulership as the Imaam in ALL affairs. Were it not so, the affairs of this worldly life would not be upright. And for a long time, since before the time of Imaam Ahmad (rahimahullaah) and until our time, people were not in agreement upon one Imaam, and they have no account of a scholar stating that the validity of (the applicability) of any of the rulings (of sharee&#8217;ah) is conditional upon the presence of the Greater Imaam.&#8221; [In Ad-Durar As-Saniyyah, 7/239].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- Al-&#8216;Allaamah (esteemed scholar) <strong>As-San&#8217;aani</strong> (rahimahullaah) said in his explanation of the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah (radiya Allaahu &#8216;anhu), raised to the Prophet ( salllaallaahu &#8216;aleihi was-sallam):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;One who defected from obedience (to the Amir) and separated from the main body of the Muslims &#8211; if he died in that state &#8211; would die the death of one belonging to the days of Jahiliyya (i. e. would not die as a Muslim).</span> [Saheeh Muslim, Book 20, # 4555, English Translation]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that the &#8220;obedience&#8221; is the obedience to the Khaleefah upon whom there is agreement, and it seems that what is intended is the khaleefah on any region from the regions, since people were not on agreement on a single khaleefah over the entire Islamic lands since the Abbasid Rule. Rather each region became independent under a ruler running its affairs. And if we carry the hadeeth to apply only to one khaleefah upon whom the Muslims are unanimous then its (the hadeeth) benefit would be diminished.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that the saying (in the hadeeth) &#8220;and separated from the main body of the Muslims,&#8221; means: separated from the Jamaa&#8217;ah who agreed upon an Imaam under whom their body and affairs are organized, their world is united, and their protection from their enemy is achieved.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it becomes clear that negating the validity of governership on separate Muslim states leads to evil in the sense that its sets the stage for rebellion against the rulers, and this is forbidden in Islaam even if the ruler is an oppressor as this constitutes the creed of ahl-us-Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah Knows Best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah, the Most High, guide me, you, and all Muslims to abide by the way of the Salaf and make us from those who relate the unclear matters to the clear so that they reach that which is clear and pleasing to Allaah.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the Allaah&#8217;s salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, and the noble companions and those who follow their path until the Day of Resurrection. The title <em>fitnah of Takfeer</em>: The Trials and Tribulations associated with imputing kufr (disbelief) on Muslims (rulers or ruled), is one of the most dangerous fitan in our times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This misleading thought has spread amongst many of the youth in the Muslim world, east and west, north and south. Many of these youths are greatly motivated by their emotions and their vigilant care concerning the deen. As such, they took many of that which they received from the followers of desires. These followers of desires have renewed the principles and thoughts of the early <strong>Khawaarij (dissidents)</strong> and have become an extension of them. This has led to declare takfeer on the Islamic societies at large and on all Muslim leaders, without exception. The consequences of this have been very terrible. Blood is being shed.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Definition of Kufr:</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To better understand takfeer, it is necessary to first define kufr. Linguistically, the term kufr means, “<strong>covering and shielding</strong>.” If an object covers something, then that object kafarahu (covered and shielded it). Similarly, it is said that the farmer when he puts the seed in the ground and covers it with soil is a kafir from the linguistic aspect, since he covered the seed with dirt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Islamic meaning, sometimes the word kufr means the major kufr, which takes a person out of the fold of Islaam. Kufr could also refer to the lesser type, which does not take a person from the fold of Islaam, known as al-kufr al-asghar. <span style="color:#993300;">Islamically, the kafir is called a kafir because he covered and shielded the favor of Allaah (subhannahu wa ta’ala).</span> Therefore, the kafir did not recognize the favor of Allaah upon him and did not give thanks to Allaah. Rather, he denied the favor of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahlus-Sunnah (adherents to the Sunnah) is on the medium course, with respect to all fundamental matters in Islaam. They are between the two extremes, the excessive ones who exceeded the limits and the negligent ones. Allaah described this in Noble Qur’an (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;">Thus, we have made you a just nation</span>» Surah al-Baqarah (2:143)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, regarding the matter of takfeer, Ahlus-Sunnah is on a medium course between extremism and negligence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The kafir is of two types. The first type is <strong>al-kafir al-aslee</strong> (the orginal kafir). This includes all of those who are not Muslims including the Christians and the Jews. <span style="color:#ff0000;">Anyone who doubts the kufr of al-kafir al-aslee is himself a kafir</span>. The second type is the <strong>apostate</strong> who was born to two Muslim parents, who in the stage of adulthood rejected Islaam, either by speech or by action.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Views of Ahlus-Sunnah and the Different Sects Regarding Takfeer:</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people are divided into three categories regarding takfeer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first category is <strong>al- Khawaarij</strong>. They impute kufr on the Muslim due to major sins; with some have gone to the extent to impute kufr on the Muslim due to minor sins. Similarly, they impute kufr on any Muslim who does not believe the same as them. As such, they have made the blood and wealth of most Muslims permissible. This group has an extension in our time and exists in many parts of the Muslim world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second group is <strong>al-Murji’ah</strong>. They claim that eeman (faith) is not affected by any sinful act, even if the Muslim commits a major sin. They say all Muslims are believers, and nothing affects faith. Although the beliefs of al-Murji’ah comprise different positions, this is an overall summary of their views.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ahlus-Sunnah</strong> are on a medium course between the two extremes. They don’t rush to impute kufr on the Muslim while not refraining from imputing kufr on him if the person commits that which Allaah and/or His Messenger declared to be kufr. However, they note, “<span style="color:#993300;"><em>The Muslim who may say or do that which is considered kufr should not have kufr imputed on him specifically until the evidence is established on him, with all the conditions of imputing kufr fulfilled and all the impediments removed.”</em></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Important Matters Regarding Takfeer</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>, before takfeer can be established, <span style="color:#993300;">all conditions must be fulfilled and all impediments removed.</span> From the conditions of making takfeer are: knowledge, choice, intent, deliberate action or saying of kufr, and its acceptance. This implies determining whether the person knows his action is kufr, and he has chosen it, without being compelled. Moreover, it must be shown that the person was deliberate in his action and is content with it. From the impediments of takfeer are: affirmation of an error, ignorance, compulsion, and misinterpretation. Ahlus-Sunnah checks into both the impediments and conditions before imputing kufr on a specific person.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <strong>second</strong> important matter is that imputing kufr on someone is an extremely dangerous matter. <span style="color:#993300;">No one should indulge in takfeer, except those who are firmly established in knowledge and fulfill certain criterion</span>. This arises from the fact that takfeer is the right of Allaah and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم:sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam). Therefore, it can only be established by those who are the inheritors of the Prophets, the ulama (scholars) who make clear the ruling of Allaah and His Messenger; they are the only ones qualified. Anyone else who involves himself in takfeer is on a dark path of transgression and claims for himself a special right with Allaah. Hence, it is not permissible to make takfeer on anyone expect the one whom Allaah and His Messenger declared to be as such. Due to the seriousness of takfeer and its limits as established by Allaah and His Messenger, Shaykhul Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah, rahimahullah, stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;That is why the people of knowledge and Sunnah did not resort to making takfeer on those who opposed them, even if the opponent makes takfeer on them. This is because the matter of kufr is a legal right established by shariah, and therefore, the person can not punish by the like, just like if someone who belies you and makes lies against you, you can not spread lies about him, or if someone fornicates with members of your family, you can not fornicate with members of his family. This is because fornication and lying are haraam (unlawful) being <strong>Allaah&#8217;s right</strong>. Similarly, takfeer is a right that belongs to Allaah. Hence we do not impute kufr except on whom Allaah and His Messenger declared as such.&#8221;</span> [Ar-Rad &#8216;Alal Bakari, v. 3, p. 381].</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The danger involved with takfeer is not limited to the transgression against the right of Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’ala). The person who imputes kufr on the others also risks falling into that which he accused his brother with. This is in line with the hadith of the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallaam),</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Any person who calls his brother, ‘Ya Kafir (Oh Unbeliever), has in fact done an act through which this unbelief would return to one of them. If it were so as he asserted, then the kufr of the man was confirmed, but if it was untrue, it returns to him (the one who labeled it on his Muslim brother).&#8221;</span> [Reported by Muslim and At- Tirmithi.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, in another narration, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;If somebody accuses another of Fusuq (by calling him &#8216;Fasiq&#8217; i.e. a wicked person) or accuses him of Kufr, such an accusation will revert to him (i.e. the accuser) if his companion (the accused) is innocent.&#8221;</span> [Bukhari].</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <strong>third</strong> important matter is that <span style="color:#993300;">takfeer causes hate amongst people</span>, especially amongst those who are referred to as kafir since no one likes to be labeled as a kafir. In fact, this can lead to fights and bloodshed, which will inflict evil on the individuals involved and the society at large.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah, rahimahullah, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;And it is not the right of anyone to impute kufr on anyone of the Muslims even if he errs and does wrong until evidence is established upon him and the matter is made clear to him. And the one whose Islaam is affirmed with certainty then it ceases not to exist with him due to doubt. Rather his (state) of Islaam comes to an end only after the establishment of the proof and the elimination of the unclarity.&#8221;</span> [Majmoo&#8217; al-Fataawa, v. 12, p. 501]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Takfeer Practiced in Our Times:</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>, a type of takfeer practiced in our time is the <span style="color:#ff0000;">unrestricted takfeer on the Muslim rulers</span> who do not rule by the rule of Allaah. This generalization, without details, has led many of the young Muslims to conclude that it is permissible to rebel against these rulers by force. Consequently confrontations, bloodshed and other problems arising from this are still growing. Moreover, it is bringing chaos and instability to the Muslim world as it is evident to everyone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, this thought did not stop at the rulers but has been extended to the government employees, security forces, and others. It has also reached many imams of masajid (mosques), muadhineen (those who give adhan), and scholars. This arises from the pretext that these are all collaborators with the government.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This pretext has even been extended to the Muslim society at large. Those who do not hold to the belief of these groups are considered kafir. This is not an issue in a vacuum; this is real. As such, one is not surprised as to why they kill Muslims or bomb places where there are many Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has reached the extent that these groups have called for the complete disassociation from their societies, thinking that all of the society is kafir so they can not stay with them. They even abandon their wives if they do not adhere to the same belief as the person holding the takfeer principle; similarly, if a wife holds this takfeer principle, they say it is incumbent upon her to leave her husband if he does not agree with that. Furthermore, they tell their followers not to make the congregation prayers in the mosques claiming these are not real mosques, and that the imams of these mosques are not Muslims since they were assigned by the government. This is happening in some Muslim countries.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Solution:</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The solution to this problem is to <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>spread the knowledge of the righteous predecessors, alilm ash-shari’ saheeh (the correct knowledge of Islaam)</strong></span>. This comes from the knowledge taught by the reliable scholars and the books of the salaf. The young should return to the ulama to seek their advice instead of following these so-called thinkers and their takfeeri books. All of those who write advocating this methodology are not even known for being from the true ulama holding to the path of the salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, Muslim societies and governments should take the <strong>corrective approach</strong> of adhering to the shar&#8217;eeah. Once this is done for the sake of Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’ala), then the promise of Allaah to bestow strength and steadfastness upon the ummah will surely be manifested.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, there should always be a <strong>hand extended to our youth who may have influenced by takfeer</strong>. There should be useful discussions in this matter and a refuting of the views held by them based on evidences and proofs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If there is anything we need to emphasize every now and then, whether regarding this matter or the understanding of Islaam as a whole, it is that people should be very serious about knowing Islaam from its two sources, the Qur’an and the way of the Rasool Allaah (Messenger of Allaah) in accordance with the understanding of the companions. This is the criteria of safety; this is the path that every Muslim should give his utmost effort to learn; this is the true safeguard mechanism for the individual and thus for the family and the society at large.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">And Advice to the Youth:</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally, we all know that emotions are real, and care for Islaam is a strong motivation to its adherents. The motivation by care, sincerity, and emotion if not guided by the following of the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) in accordance with the way of the salaf, then it can turn into a blazing fire of destruction. Hence, a sincere advice is stressed again for all of our youth: seek knowledge from its reliable sources and from the ulama who are on the path of the companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah the most High guide us and our Muslim youth to be on the path of righteousness and wisdom, and may Allaah, the Most High, safe guide this ummah from the fitnah of takfeer.</p>

</strong>[audio https://salafiaudio.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/blame-on-us-or-blame-on-rulers-imaam-ibnul-qayyim-saleh-as-saleh.mp3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Imaam Ibnul Qayyim</b> (rahimahullaah) talked about what people think is the fitnah of &#8220;our times&#8221;, i.e. meaning his own times, but this applies just as well to the contemporary fitnah of our own times. About the ways of Allaah (Azza wa Jal) in this creation vis-a-vis the rulers and the ruled, he said :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And contemplate Allaah&#8217;s (Azza wa Jal) Wisdom when He made people of authority, making them a reflection of the ruled. It is as if the deeds of the ruled appear in the form and deeds of their rulers :</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">if the <b>ruled</b> are upright, then their <b>rulers</b> will be upright</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">if the <b>ruled</b> incline away from uprightness, then their<b> rulers</b> will do the same to them</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">if the <b>ruled</b> transgress and oppress, then their <b>rulers</b> will do the same to them</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">if there appears deception and plotting from the <b>ruled</b>, then it will be the same from their <b>rulers</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">if the <b>ruled </b>take away the rights of the people and become miser as to the rights of others, then their <b>rulers</b> will do the same to them and deprive them of their rights</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">if the<b> ruled </b>take away from the oppressed /weak among them that which they deserve not to take in their transactions with them, then their <b>rulers</b> will do that towards the ruled&#8217;s wealth and take what they deserve not, and impose on the<b> ruled </b>taxes and assignments</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and whenever the <b>ruled</b> take from the oppressed and weak unjustly, then their <b>rulers</b> will do the same to them and take it by force</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">so the actions of the <b>ruled </b>appear in the actions of the <b>rulers</b> and <b>it is not in the Divine Wisdom that Allaah (Azza wa Jal) assigns authority over the wicked and evils ones, EXCEPT to the ones who are of their own kind<br />
</b><br />
Since the first generation was of the best generation and of the most righteous, &#8230; so were their leaders righteous</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>It is not befitting Allaah&#8217;s Wisdom that in &#8220;our times&#8221; (Ibnul Qayyim&#8217;s times) that those assigned to authority over us be the like of Muawwiya and &#8216;Umar bin &#8216;Abdul &#8216;Aziz, not to mention Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar. The leaders of those before us were in accordance with their own conditions and ranks. Our leaders are in accordance with our own condition and rank. In both cases, this is entailed by the Wisdom of Allaah (Azza wa Jal).&#8221;</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such is the conclusion of Imaam Ibnul Qayyim (rahimahullah) concerning his times, i.e. the 8th century A.H., so what do you think about our own times?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Wisdom of Allaah (Azza wa Jal) pertains to His Attributes. He puts things in accordance with His Hikmah and puts them in their proper places with what fits. The Wisdom of Allaah (Azza wa Jal) has a noble and most perfect objective.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who hasten in making these roads for &#8220;deliverance&#8221; and see getting rid of the rulers as the solution to their problems, they confuse symptoms and disease.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The rulers are seen as being the causes when in reality they are only the symptoms. The true illness is within the ruled. Therefore, all endeavors towards finding a solution should focus on the ruled themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The deeds of the ruled are reflected in the deeds of the people having authority over them. When the people are not ready and are away from the deen of Allaah, who would you expect them to deserve as rulers?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Contemplate this very carefully!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dr Saleh As-Saleh(rahimahullaah)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 50:</strong> What is the meaning of at-Taaghut and its derivations?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer</strong> by Shaykh ibn Uthaymeen رحمه الله:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">at-Taaghut is derived from <span style="color:#993300;"><em><strong>at-Tughyaan</strong></em></span> and at- Tughyaan means to go beyond the bounds, as occurs in the Saying of Allaah, The Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;When the water of the flood (taghaa) We carried you in the Ark.&#8221;</span></em><br />
[Qur’aan, sooarat al-Haaqah (69): 11],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">meaning that when the water of the flood rose beyond the normal bounds (taghaa), “We carried you in the Ark.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The best explanation of the term is what Ibnul Qayyim, rahimahullah, mentioned, that at-Taaghut is</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Anyone, regarding whom the servant goes beyond the due bounds, whether it is someone worshipped, obeyed, or followed.” </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the <strong>idols</strong> that are worshipped besides Allaah are Taaghoots; and the <strong>evil scholars</strong> who call to misguidance and to innovations and to making lawful that which Allaah has forbidden, or forbidding that which Allaah has made lawful, or those who present to the people in authority that it is acceptable to abandon the Sharee’ah of Islaam in favour of legislative systems introduced from outside that are contrary to the legislative system of Islaam, then they are Taaghoots also, since they have gone beyond their bounds. This is because the limit of the scholar is that he should be one who adheres to that which the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) came with, since the scholars are truly the inheritors of the Prophets. They inherit from them in knowledge, action, manners, the call to Allaah, and teaching, presenting this inheritance in their nations. If they go beyond this limit and begin to present it as acceptable to the rulers that they can abandon the Sharee’ah of Islaam in favour of such systems [introduced from the outside], then they are Taaghuts, since they have gone beyond that which was binding upon them, that they should adhere to the Sharee’ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his (ibnul Qayyim رحمه الله) saying [regarding the definition of Taaghut]: “<strong>or one obeyed</strong>,” then what he meant by that is those rulers who are obeyed due to that being required by Sharee’ah or because it is necessitated by way of this case they are to be obeyed due to that being required by Sharee’ah and necessitated Pre-decree (al-Qadar). <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So the rulers are to be obeyed as required by the Sharee’ah if they command that which is not contrary to the Command of Allaah and His Messenger</strong></span>. This is because the duty upon the people is to hear and obey when the ruler commands that which is not contrary to the Command of Allaah and His Messenger. In this situation and with this condition, their obedience to those in authority is obedience to Allaah (عز و جل). For this reason, we should bear in mind that when we carry out what the state authority has ordered from matters in which it must be obeyed, we are, in this respect, worshipping Allaah, The Most High, and drawing closer to Him through this obedience. So, bearing this in mind, our execution of the ruled matter will be something that draws us closer to Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic. It is something that we should be conscious of; because Allaah, The Most High, Says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O you who believe, obey Allaah, and obey his Messenger, and those of you in authority.&#8221;</span></em>[Qur’aan, soorat an-Nisaa’ (4): 59].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the obedience to those in authority because it is necessitated by way of Pre-decree (Qadaran), then if the rulers are strong in their authority then people will obey them because of the authoritative strength they possess, even if they are not motivated to do so by Eemaan. Since the matter of obedience to the ruler could be motivated by Eemaan, and in this case it is beneficial obedience to the rulers as well as the people. And it may come about because of the ruler&#8217;s authority and strength such that the people fear him and are intimidated by him due to the severe punishment he inflicts upon those who oppose him. For this reason we say that with regard to this matter the peoples situation regarding their rulers varies as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) Sometimes the motivation of Eemaan is strong, and the ruler&#8217;s authority is strong. This constitutes the most complete and highest situation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) Other times the motivation of Eemaan is weak, and the ruler’s authority is weak; and this is lowest state and the one most dangerous for the society–rulers and the ruled. Since in this state anarchy in thoughts, manners, and actions will take place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(iii) Sometimes the motivation of Eemaan is strong, and the ruler’s authority is weak. This represents a middle state whereupon if the ruler’s authority is strong then its manifestation will be better for the nation. But if the ruler’s authority in this case is absent, then do not ask about its state of corruption and evil actions! Because the motivation of Eemaan is weak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(iv) If the situation is such that the motivation of Eemaan is weak (strong), and the ruler’s authority is strong (weak), then the apparent situation will be weaker than the former state (iii). However, in terms of people’s relation with their Rabb (Allaah) it will be more beneficial to them than in the former case where the ruler’s authority is lacking.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are four states: Strong Eemaan and strong ruler, weak Eemaan and weak ruler, strong Eemaan and weak ruler, and strong ruler and weak Eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the important thing is that we say that when we carry out the commands of the ruler, we should believe that through this act we draw closer to Allaah, The Most Magnificent, Most High. And the reason why Ibnul Qayyim said that “<span style="color:#993300;"><em>at-Taaghut is anyone, regarding whom the servant goes beyond the due bounds, whether it is someone worshipped, obeyed, or followed</em></span>,” is because the ruler who is obeyed may command that which is contrary to the Command of Allaah and His Messenger. In this case there is neither hearing nor obeying, and it is not permissible for us to obey him in that which is disobedience to Allah (عز و جل). Since Allaah, The Most High, has deemed that their obedience be dependent upon the obedience of Allaah and His Messenger, as it is understood from the context of the aayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O you who believe, obey Allaah, and obey his Messenger, and those of you in authority.</span></em> &#8220;[Qur’aan, soorat an-Nisaa’ (4): 59].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He did not say (what signifies): “and obey those in authority.” So this indicates that obeying them is not something independent. Rather it is related to the obedience of Allaah and His Messenger. And it has been affirmed in the transmission from the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) that “<em><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, obedience (to somebody) is required when he enjoins what is Ma’roof</span></em>,” [71]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">meaning all that which is established by Sharee’ah. But as regard to that which is denied by the Sharee’ah, then it is forbidden to obey any created being even the father or the mother. If they command that which is disobedience to Allaah, then it is unlawful for you to obey them, since the obedience of Allaah takes precedence over any kind of obedience. <span style="color:#808000;">So, if a man obeys his ruler in that which is disobedience to Allaah, then he has gone beyond his bounds</span>.</p>

Translated by: Abu az-Zubayr Harrison – <a href="http://www.authentic-translations.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">authentic-translations.com</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: What is the Islamic position of political strikes, demonstrations, and protests in mosques because some people claim to base these actions of theirs upon a religious verdict that has supposedly come from you, as they claim. They allege that during  some past circumstances in Algeria, you allowed these actions with the conditions that no rioting would result and no armed resistance or similar evils. So what is the ruling of this in your opinion and what is your advice for us?</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: There are some people who are confused with regards to obeying the authorities. Some say that (1) giving the pledge of allegiance is only to be done to the main leader of all the Muslims in the world. Others say that (2) nothing is binding of obedience upon them because they did not personally go and pledge allegiance before the ruler, while others claim that (3) such obedience is only to the king and not to  others of (lesser) authority. What do you say about this?</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: What do you say, may Allah preserve you, about a person who states that the issue of rebelling and opposing the ruler (king, president, government, etc.) is only a matter of Ijtihād (independent, personal interpretation) and says that there is a  difference of opinion regarding the issue among the Salaf. Therefore, it is not permissible  to accuse those who differ in this regard (those who allow political revolution and opposition) of being innovators or sinners.</p>

اإلرهاب أسبابه وعالجه وموقف املسلم من الفنت :Original Title<br />
Author: Dr. Ṣāliḥ Ibn Sa’d al-Ṣuḥaymī <em>hafidhahullaah</em><br />
Translated by: Abu az-Zubayr Harrison <em>rahimahullaah</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of all mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise and thanks are due to Allah alone and may He send prayers and peace upon him (Muhammad) after whom there will never be another prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (عزّ وجل) has honored us with the greatest blessing by sending His prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم).By him, Allah brought us out of darkness and into light, honoring us by him after our humiliation, and uniting us by him after our division. He made us brothers for the sake of Allah, loving and supporting one another, none having preference over another except by Taqwá as Allah (عزّ وجل) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ أَكْرَمَكُمْ عِندَ اللَّهِ أَتْقَاكُمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed, the most noble among you with Allah is the one with the most Taqwá (constant fearful consciousness of Allah).</span> [Sūrah al-Ḥujurāt, 49:13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says, favoring us with this blessing and reminding us of our previous condition before Islam:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْتَصِمُواْ بِحَبْلِ اللّهِ جَمِيعًا وَلاَ تَفَرَّقُواْ وَاذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَتَ اللّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">كُنتُمْ أَعْدَاء فَأَلَّفَ بَيْنَ قُلُوبِكُمْ فَأَصْبَحْتُم بِنِعْمَتِهِ إِخْوَانًا وَكُنتُمْ عَلَىَ شَفَا حُفْرَةٍ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">مِّنَ النَّارِ فَأَنقَذَكُم مِّنْهَا كَذَلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ اللّهُ لَكُمْ آيَاتِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And hold fast, all of you together, to the rope of Allah (the Quran), and be not divided among yourselves, and remember Allah&#8217;s favor on you, for you were enemies one to another but He joined your hearts together, so that, by His grace, you became brothers. And you were on the brink of a pit of fire, and He saved you from it. Thus Allah makes His signs clear to you, that you may be guided.</span> [Sūrah Āli-‘Imrān, 3:103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslims were living under this great blessing and rejoicing in it during the time of the prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) until the seed of division was first sown when ‘Abd Allah Ibn Saba and his followers rallied people together against ‘Uthmān (رضي الله عنه). However, the very core of the Khawārij first appeared with Dhū al-Khuwaysarah al-Tamīmī when he objected to the way in which the prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) distributed the war gains after the battle of Ḥunayn. He (Dhū al-Khuwaysarah) said to him, “Be fair, Muhammad, for you have not been fair!” He also said, “This is, for sure, a distribution by which Allah’s face was not sought!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Beware. Who would be fair if I would not? Do you not trust me when I am trusted by the One in the heavens?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When ‘Umar (رضي الله عنه) wanted to kill him, he (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Leave him. There will come from his progeny a people whom you will consider your prayer compared to their prayer as insignificant and your fasting compared to theirs as insignificant. They will recite the Quran, yet it will not go beyond their throats. They will go out of the religion just as an arrow passes through its target.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tribulations were then kindled against ‘Uthmān (رضي الله عنه) as the causes of biased factionalism (Ḥizbiyyah) and opposition emerged, casting tribulations and division among the people, striking the very heart of Islam. Its heat was only further increased with the killing of Dhū al-Nūrayn (‘Uthmān)[<span style="color:#ff0000;">01</span>]. The matter dangerously worsened and the trials and tribulations increased. Division and discord broke out – at the head of this was the Khawārij sect. They killed ‘Alī and considered the blood of Muslims lawful to spill and their wealth lawful to steal. They caused terror and fear among people, thereby waging war against Allah and His messenger. ‘Alī fought against their evil and, afterwards, found this same Dhū al-Khuwaysarah among those killed from them. They then plotted to kill many of the companions of the prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and were successful in murdering ‘Alī (رضي الله عنه).</p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;"><em>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">01</span>] Dhū al-Nūrayn literally means “The Possessor of the Two Lights.” He was given this nickname because he married two of the prophet’s daughters, each at different times. – T.N.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since then, their evil and tribulations have continued up until this day, sometimes apparent, and other times discreet. They will continue in this way right up to the appearance of the Anti-Christ (towards the end of time) just as the prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) informed of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In recent times, Allah had placed in authority of our land, the peninsula, King ‘Abd al-‘Azīz – may Allah grant him prosperity. With him, Allah united the various factions of this nation together after long generations overshadowed with wars and enmity. In those times, ignorance prevailed and tribalism cropped up amongst the people. Many people returned back to Shirk and to the law of the jungle, by which the strong eats the weak. So Allah destined for this leader (King ‘Abd al-‘Azīz) to unite the people under the banner of Tawhīd. Safety and comfort spread. Religious knowledge thrived and the darkness of ignorance dispersed. The brotherhood of Islam prevailed, established upon the actualization of Tawhīd and upon the guidance of the prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The peninsular was again secured by the supporters of the land. Its children followed in the same footsteps, adhering to this methodology, seeking Allah’s help and applying the rule of Allah in all matters. So safety, security, and well-being prevailed under the rule of Islam. The people of this land were as the heart of a single person – the ruler and the ruled. The young people were firmly connected to their scholars and leaders. They exemplified one united group, not diverse sects; upon one united methodology, and not diverse methodologies. Their unity was strong, far removed from the methodology of extremism. This was manifested by curricula and studies which firmly instill the moderate fundamentals which the Quran and Sunnah call to, as Allah (عزّ وجل) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَكَذَلِكَ جَعَلْنَاكُمْ أُمَّةً وَسَطًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And thus, We have made you a middle nation.</span> [Sūrah al-Baqarah, 2:143]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: a just nation, chosen among other nations. So these lands became a prime example of adhering to the middle path, the path between extremism and negligence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, there has appeared during these latter times voices, writings, and cries from some insignificant, minor people calling to the shamefulness of biased factionalism. They began to decay the bones of this (Muslim) nation with their invitations away from the unity of a single, interdependent group to the strictness of several diverse sects. They call to the radically choosing of sides and extremism by such ornamented, yet obviously deceptive, means, leading to nothing but division among the ranks of this nation. They try by various ways to persuade some of our young people to their rebellious, revolutionary ideologies which make it possible for the enemies of Islam to take commodities such as oil under the slogan of human rights sometimes, or the call to update and change the school curriculum other times, claiming they are the causes for this very extremism found among such groups and individuals.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The propagation by those with these ideologies to spread their falsehood is done in numerous ways. From these ways are the following:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Belittling the affair of calling to Tawhīd, claiming that the ‘Aqīdah is generally known to most people. Some of them say that it is possible to understand ‘Aqīdah in as little as ten minutes. Rather, some have even stooped so low as to say that this (the persistence in the call to Tawhīd and the correction of ‘Aqīdah) actually causes division amongst the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Turning away from the scholars, abandoning taking knowledge from them, and distorting their statements, claiming they do not fully comprehend the current affairs. They claim the scholars are not qualified to solve the problems facing the Islamic nation today and that they refuse to stand up to face its true issues.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The distancing of the young people far away from the religious knowledge based on the Quran and Sunnah. They preoccupy them with such things as enthusiastic, fiery Nashīds (so-called “Islamic” songs) or whatever other issues are spread here and there of the various attractive ways, whether written, seen, or by audio.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The belittlement of the leaders and those in authority and the public exposing of their faults or what some people assume to be their faults. They do this publicly on their pulpits (while delivering lectures in the mosques) and on the questionable satellite channels. They distort the texts commanding the obedience to the leaders to mean that such obedience referred to in these texts is only given to the main leader who has authority over all the Muslims in the world (and not the various individual leaders of each country). They forget, or pretend to forget, that all of the scholars and Imams unanimously agreed that this obedience is also incumbent during times of the existence of various separate Islamic countries. Even though each country may possess its own wealth, with its own rights and obligations dependent upon its respective leader; obedience to such a leader is still an obligation and revolting and rebelling against him is forbidden as long as he establishes the rights of Allah. This is an agreement that all of the scholars of Islam were united upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Rallying together those with these theoretical thoughts who call to revolutionary and rebellious ideas. They assemble the young people, brainwashing them in private gatherings set up in places of rest and recreation. They focus on separating the young people from their scholars and leaders, instead connecting them with personalities that follow methodologies of rebellion and Takfīr (declaring Muslims to be disbelievers).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. They call to their imaginary “Jihad” which is actually the declaring of a Muslim’s blood and wealth to be lawful for the taking. They encourage devastation and bombings and the blowing up of structures property, all the while claiming that the land of the Muslims is now a land of war, fighting being justified therein. This ideology is spread by means such as the inspirational Nashīds. The danger has even reached the level of some youths being trained to use all sorts of weapons in far secluded places within the country, and in other questionable foreign countries.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. The circulation of books, fliers, pamphlets, and cassettes that call to this defiant, radical ideology. They promote making Takfīr, especially against the scholars and leaders. We will mention some of the books that call to this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a. The writings of Sayyid Qutb. The most dangerous of these are those books that make the blanket Takfīr against most of the Muslim nations in this time, those that defame the Companions of the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم), and even books that defame the Prophets. Examples of these are “Fī Ẓilāl al-Qurān” (In the Shade of the Quran), “Kutub wa Shakhṣiyyāt” (Books and Personalities), “al-‘Adālah al-Ijtimā’iyyah” (Social Justice), and “Ma’ālim fī al-Ṭarīq” (Milestones).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b. The books of Sayyid Abul A&#8217;la Maududi.<br />
c. The books of Hassan al-Banna.<br />
d. The books of Sa’īd Hawá.<br />
e. The books of ‘Isām al-‘Iṭār.<br />
f. The books of Abū al-Fatḥ al-Bayānūnī.<br />
g. The books of Muḥammad Ibn ‘Alī al-Ṣābūnī.<br />
h. The books of Muḥammad Ḥasan Hanbakah al-Maydānī.<br />
i. The books of of al-Turābī.<br />
j. The books of al-Ḥuḍaybī.<br />
k. The books of al-Tilmisānī.<br />
l. The books of Aḥmad Muḥammad al-Rāshid (a pen name). The most dangerous of his books are “al-Maṣār” (The Path), al-‘Awā`iq (The Obstacles), “al-Munṭaliq” (The Starting Point, or Liberated), and “al-Raqā`iq”.<br />
m. The books of ‘Iṣām al-Bashīr.<br />
n. The books, pamphlets, and tapes of Muḥammad Surūr Zayn al-‘Ābidīn, the head of the Muntaḍá organization in London.<br />
o. Other books than these mentioned that are widespread in our bookstores that are filled with this ideology.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is incumbent for us to dry up this fountain (of deviation) by warning against these books, preventing their circulation, and by supervising those publishing companies and bookstores who are lenient in distributing these books or selling them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When these books are read by young people whose own ideas have not yet matured and who have no knowledge-based protection against the effects of such books, they (such books) corrupt their intellect, and ideas, causing them to follow fantasies. This way, the youth are prepared to carry out whatever is requested of them – even something like suicide or the killing of others from among Muslims or non-Muslims that should be guaranteed safety. They do such things to achieve a certain objective – “martyrdom for the sake of Allah and the triumph of entering paradise.” These theorists have made the youth imagine that this is the correct way leading to this destination and to the victory of gaining Allah’s pleasure. So Takfīr, bombings, mass destruction in the lands of Muslims, and abandoning the methodology of the righteous predecessors (al-Salaf al-Ṣāliḥ) have all now become “the path of guidance” as perceived by such people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. Another way that such deviant ideologies have spread is by the emergence of inspirational activists from these groups of Takfīr such as the sect “al-Ikhwān alMuslimūn,” or the “Muslim Brotherhood” and other groups that originated from them that are found in our schools, institutes, and universities. They have distorted and transformed many of our children by planting and cultivating among them the methodology of Takfīr by student get-togethers and recreational trips as well as with exaggerated religious narrations and those containing blatant lies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are some of the means by which these people were successful in corrupting many of our youth, making them unaware of the correct methodology, their scholars, and their leaders. They made the truth appear to them to be only what they themselves were upon and everyone else was upon nothing (of guidance). The negligence of realizing these means by which they use has allowed this alien ideology to spread in our religion and nation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now comes the question: “How do we protect our youth from this?”</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">To safeguard from such innovated ideologies of Takfīr, we must individually and collectively take the following steps:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Call the youth back to adherence to the Quran and Sunnah and to refer back to them both under all circumstances. Allah (عزّ وجل) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْتَصِمُواْ بِحَبْلِ اللّهِ جَمِيعًا وَلاَ تَفَرَّقُواْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And hold fast, all of you together, to the rope of Allah (the Quran), and be not divided among yourselves.</span> [Sūrah Āli-‘Imrān, 3:103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا اخْتَلَفْتُمْ فِيهِ مِن شَيْءٍ فَحُكْمُهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And if you differ in anything, its decision is for Allah.</span>[Sūrah al-Shūrá, 42:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So referring back to the Book of Allah and adhering to it is the protection and the foundation by which Allah preserves one from falling into destruction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. We must make sure to understand the Quran and Sunnah according to the methodology of the righteous predecessors (al-Salaf al-Ṣāliḥ). This will not be achieved unless the Muslims seek such understanding from the sincere and knowledgeable scholars who, by the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم), they refute the distortion of the extremists, the false assumptions of the deniers, and the misinterpretations of the ignorant ones. Allah (عزّ وجل) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَاسْأَلُواْ أَهْلَ الذِّكْرِ إِن كُنتُمْ لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">So ask the people of the scripture if you don’t know.</span>[Sūrah al-Anbiyā’, 21:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِذَا جَاءهُمْ أَمْرٌ مِّنَ الأَمْنِ أَوِ الْخَوْفِ أَذَاعُواْ بِهِ وَلَوْ رَدُّوهُ إِلَى الرَّسُولِ وَإِلَى</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">أُوْلِي الأَمْرِ مِنْهُمْ لَعَلِمَهُ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَنبِطُونَهُ مِنْهُمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">If there comes to them a matter of safety or fear, they (immediately) publicize it. If only they had referred it to the messenger and to those charged with authority among them, the proper investigators would have understood it from them (directly).</span> [Sūrah al-Nisā’, 4:83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The terrorists are those who spread corruption on earth, following religious verdicts given without knowledge. They are those who shun the listening to the main scholars of the nation, describing them with evil characteristics that are more rightly attributed to these terrorists themselves. So if the youth turn instead to the inheritors of prophethood (the major scholars), those who are firmly-grounded in knowledge, then this will be their defense, if Allah wills, against these terrorists who rant and rave about things they know nothing about, spreading false rumors. They claim there is no other place for the youth to turn to and connect themselves with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. We must also remain far away from the places of such Fitnah (trials, afflictions, and tribulations) to avoid their evil effects. Allah (عزّ وجل) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَاتَّقُواْ فِتْنَةً لاَّ تُصِيبَنَّ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مِنكُمْ خَآصَّةً</span></h2>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">And fear the Fitnah which not only afflicts those among you who do wrong particularly (but may rather afflict everyone)</span>. [Sūrah al-Anfāl, 8:25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is done by taking the initiative to do righteous deeds by which Allah’s servants protect themselves against the Fitnah. The messenger of Allah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Take the initiative to do righteous deeds before a Fitnah comes like patches of a dark night. Due to it, a man will be a believer at night and disbelieve by morning, or be a believer in the morning and disbelieve by nightfall. He will sell his religion for a mere portion of this worldly life.”</span> [Imam Aḥmad]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Abū Hurayrah (رضي الله عنه) said that Allah’s messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“There will come a Fitnah during which the one who sits will be better than the one who stands, and the one who stands will be better than the one who walks, the one who walks will be better than one who runs. Whoever exposes himself to it will be overcome by it. Whoever finds a refuge or resort (from it) then let him seek it for protection.”</span> [al-Bukhārī &amp; Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. We must strive in worshipping Allah and try to remain constantly and fearfully conscious of Him (عزّ وجل) – having Taqwá. This is done by carrying out what He has commanded and remaining away from what He has forbidden. This is the way of success from every hardship as Allah (عزّ وجل) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِ يُسْرًا</span></h2>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever has Taqwá of Allah, He will make his affairs easy for him</span>.[Sūrah al-Ṭalāq, 65:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (عزّ وجل) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">َمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever has Taqwá of Allah, He will make for him a way to get out (of every difficulty).</span> [Sūrah al-Ṭalāq, 65:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So having this Taqwá of Allah, remaining firm on His legislation, and performing deeds that please Him is the way to achieve every success and victory in both lives (this life and the Hereafter).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. We must stop the widespread open sinning amongst ourselves, because whatever of Fitnah, evils, or disagreements that afflict the Muslims, it only stems from sins becoming prevalent among the people and disobedience to Allah. Whatever calamities afflict them is only due to what they themselves have earned as Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَوَلَمَّا أَصَابَتْكُم مُّصِيبَةٌ قَدْ أَصَبْتُم مِّثْلَيْهَا قُلْتُمْ أَنَّى هَـذَا قُلْ هُوَ مِنْ عِندِ أَنْفُسِكُمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">When a disaster afflicts you, although you struck (your enemies) with one twice as great, you say: “From where does this come to us?” Say, “It is from your own selves (because of your evil deeds).”</span> [Sūrah Āli-‘Imrān, 3:165]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ظَهَرَ الْفَسَادُ فِي الْبَرِّ وَالْبَحْرِ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ أَيْدِي النَّاسِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Corruption has appeared on land and sea because of what the hands of men have earned (by sins, evil deeds, etc.).</span> [Sūrah al-Rūm, 30:41]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. We must stick to the main body of Muslims and their leader and we must reinforce the understanding that it is obligatory to obey those in authority in goodness. Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ أَطِيعُواْ اللّهَ وَأَطِيعُواْ الرَّسُولَ وَأُوْلِي الأَمْرِ مِنكُمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Oh you who believe, obey Allah and obey the messenger, and those who are in authority among you.</span> [Sūrah al-Nisā’, 4:59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The messenger of Allah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Indeed, Allah is pleased for you three things and is displeased with three things. He is pleased for you that you worship Him without associating anything as partners with Him, that you hold all together to the rope of Allah and not split into groups, and that you give sincere advice to whomever Allah puts in charge of your affairs.”</span> [Muslim &amp; Aḥmad]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صلى الله عليه وسلم) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“There are three things which the heart of a Muslim should never object to: sincerity in doing deeds solely for the sake of Allah, giving sincere advice to those in authority of affairs, and sticking to the main body of Muslims.”</span> [Ibn Mājah &amp; Aḥmad]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Whoever sees something from his leader which he hates, then let him be patient with it, for indeed the one who splits away from the group by even a hand-span and then dies, he does not die except the death of Jāhiliyyah (the pre-Islamic period of ignorance).”</span> [al-Bukhārī]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Bukhārī also records in his authentic collection a long Ḥadīth from Ḥudhayfah (رضي الله عنه) in which he asks the prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم):</p>
<p>“What do you instruct me to do if that (Fitnah) reaches me?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صلى الله عليه وسلم) replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Stick to the main group of Muslims and their leader.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Ḥudhayfah) further asked, “What if there is neither a main group nor a leader?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Then stay away from all of those sects even if you have to bite onto the trunk of a tree until death comes to you while you are in that state.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Bukhārī]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. Seeking help by remaining patient during times of hardship. Patience extinguishes much Fitnah as Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ اسْتَعِينُواْ بِالصَّبْرِ وَالصَّلاَةِ إِنَّ اللّهَ مَعَ الصَّابِرِينَ</span></h2>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">Oh you who believe, seek help through patience and prayer. Indeed, Allah is with the patient ones.</span> [Sūrah al-Baqarah, 2:153]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (عزّ وجل) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَاصْبِرْ عَلَى مَا أَصَابَكَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And bear with patience whatever may befall you</span>.[Sūrah Luqmān, 31:17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The messenger of Allah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“The affair of a believer is amazing – all of his affairs are good for him. If he experiences good, he is thankful and that is good for him. And when hardship befalls him, he is patient and that is good for him. This is not the case of anyone except a believer.”</span> [Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. We have to resolve our issues with tolerance and forbearance and not be so hasty in judging and passing religious verdicts. We must refrain from becoming excited and angry – all of these traits are the characteristics of the Prophets and Messengers and their followers. Allah (عزّ وجل) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ إِبْرَاهِيمَ لَحَلِيمٌ أَوَّاهٌ مُّنِيبٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed, Ibraaheem (Prophet Abraham) was certainly forbearing, humbly invoking (Allah), and repentant.</span>[Sūrah Hūd, 11:75]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah’s messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said to Ashajj Banī ‘Abd al-Qays:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“There are two qualities within you that Allah and His messenger love: tolerance and forbearance.”</span> [Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. We must adorn ourselves with gentleness, good behavior among ourselves, and kindness when resolving our problems. The messenger of Allah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Gentleness is not in anything except that it beautifies it and it is not removed from anything except that it renders it defective.”</span> [Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he (صلى الله عليه وسلم) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Indeed, Allah loves kindness and gentleness in all matters.”</span> [al-Bukhārī]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. We must fully comprehend whatever issues face us as they actually are, understanding and perceiving them and delve deep into their root causes. We must give this great significance because any ruling passed on a matter is greatly dependant upon how that matter is first understood. So a Muslim should not be misled by only the outward appearance of any issue. Rather, it is incumbent upon a believer to be careful of everything happening around him and not be deceived by first impressions. This must be done, however, by confirming the evidences and without leaving the true methodology. Passing rulings and judgments must not be rushed into and religious issues must not be delved into with no basis of knowledge as Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلاَ تَقْفُ مَا لَيْسَ لَكَ بِهِ عِلْمٌ إِنَّ السَّمْعَ وَالْبَصَرَ وَالْفُؤَادَ كُلُّ أُولـئِكَ كَانَ عَنْهُ مَسْؤُولاً</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And do not follow that of which you have no knowledge. Certainly, the hearing, sight, and heart – of each of those you will be questioned.</span> [Sūrah al-Isrā’, 17:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. We must confirm and verify anything we hear and not simply give an ear to rumors, especially what is broadcast on the various media means and the questionable satellite channels. Often such announcements result in commotion among the Muslims, causing them to differ in their goals and weaken their unity. Allah (عزّ وجل) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِن جَاءكُمْ فَاسِقٌ بِنَبَأٍ فَتَبَيَّنُوا أَن تُصِيبُوا قَوْمًا بِجَهَالَةٍ </span><span style="color:#000000;">فَتُصْبِحُوا عَلَى مَا فَعَلْتُمْ نَادِمِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Oh you who believe, if a wicked evil person comes to you with news, verify it, lest you harm people in ignorance, and afterwards you become regretful for what you have done.</span> [Sūrah al-Ḥujurāt, 49:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Beware of suspicion, for suspicion if the most deceitful of speech.”</span> [al-Bukhārī &amp; Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. We have to return back to the fundamentals of our faith and our religion when passing any judgments of others as being disbelievers, sinners, or innovators. We only make such rulings based on the criteria found in the Quran and Sunnah. We do not pass a blanket ruling of disbelief on Muslims without deliberation and confirmed evidence due to the seriousness of this matter. It is forbidden for a Muslim to accuse his brother, a specific individual Muslim, of being a disbeliever even if he does an action of disbelief, unless and until all of the applicable conditions have been met and all excuses and explanations have been removed. Allah (عزّ وجل) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ إِذَا ضَرَبْتُمْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللّهِ فَتَبَيَّنُواْ وَلاَ تَقُولُواْ لِمَنْ أَلْقَى </span><span style="color:#000000;">إِلَيْكُمُ السَّلاَمَ لَسْتَ مُؤْمِنًا تَبْتَغُونَ عَرَضَ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا فَعِندَ اللّهِ مَغَانِمُ كَثِيرَةٌ </span><span style="color:#000000;">كَذَلِكَ كُنتُم مِّن قَبْلُ فَمَنَّ اللّهُ عَلَيْكُمْ فَتَبَيَّنُواْ إِنَّ اللّهَ كَانَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Oh you who believe, when you go in the cause of Allah, verify (the truth), and say not to anyone who greets you with peace: “You are not a believer,” thereby seeking the perishable goods of the worldly life. There are much more profits and goods with Allah. Even as he is now, so were you yourselves before Allah conferred on you His favors (guided you to Islam). therefore, be cautious in discrimination. Allah is ever well aware of what you do.</span> [Sūrah al-Nisā’, 4:94]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) also warned against this saying in the Ḥadīth of Abū Dharr (رضي الله عنه):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“No man accuses another of being a sinner or accuses him of disbelief except that it is applied back to himself if his companion is actually not like that.”</span> [al-Bukhārī &amp; Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abd Allah Ibn ‘Umar ( رضي الله عنه) narrated that Allah’s messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Any man that says to his brother, ‘Oh disbeliever!’ then it falls back to one of them.”</span> [al-Bukhārī &amp; Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Daqīq al-‘Īd says regarding the meaning of this Ḥadīth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is a sever threat to the one who accuses anyone of the Muslims as being a disbeliever while he is really not. It is a very serious matter in which many of the speakers have fallen into and others who falsely ascribe themselves to the Sunnah and the people of Ḥadīth. This is because of their differing in the correct ‘Aqīdah beliefs so they are harsh with those who oppose them, judging them as disbelievers.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The famous scholar of Islam, Ibn Taymiyyah, endorsed this saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I’m one of the harshest persons in forbidding one from accusing a specific individual of disbelief, wickedness, or sin unless he knows for certain that all the religious proofs and evidences have been established upon him – those proofs indicating that whoever opposes them is in fact a disbeliever, defiantly disobedient one, or a sinner. And I also affirm that Allah may choose to forgive the sins of this entire (Muslim) nation, the spoken sins and mistakes and the actions.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are some of the issues that every Muslim must pay close attention to during such depressing times of trials and tribulations. And it is incumbent upon all Muslims, individually and collectively, the rulers and the ruled, the scholars and students, to consolidate their efforts in order to eradicate these tribulations, uprooting them from their very origins especially today’s problems of Takfīr which have led some people to the extent of accepting that other Muslims’ blood and wealth are lawful to take. Such people corrupt others to the point that they are willing to carry out such measures as of destruction, and bombings. They do this by means of questionable organizations, paid publications, and misguiding verdicts which lead to such terrifying incidents carried out by people with stupid misconceptions. Thereby, they convert themselves into corruptors, murderers of Muslims and non-Muslims who have been promised safety. They violate the sanctity of others’ wealth and structures, calling this “Jihad.” This is the age-old crime of naming something with other than its true name…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So every single Muslim is required, as much as he can, to expose their (the terrorists’) lies and to make known their deviation to prevent their evil and corruption from spreading and calamity from dangerously worsening. It is forbidden to hide or conceal anyone of them because this would be cooperating with them in sin and transgression and Allah (عزّ وجل) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَتَعَاوَنُواْ عَلَى الْبرِّ وَالتَّقْوَى وَلاَ تَعَاوَنُواْ عَلَى الإِثْمِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And cooperate together in righteous and Taqwá, and do not cooperate in sin and transgression.</span> [Sūrah al-Māi’dah, 5:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever supports and accommodates them, defends them, or accepts there actions, then he shares in the sin of killing innocent souls who have committed no crime deserving of this from among the Muslims and those who are under the trust of safety from among the non-Muslims living in the Muslim lands. The Ḥadīth of the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) is applied to such supporters of them when he (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“The curse of Allah is upon anyone who supports an innovator.”</span> [al-Bukhārī]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah, the Generous, the Lord of the great throne, by His perfect names and by His magnificent attributes to preserve and protect all the Muslims in general, and these (Muslim) lands in particular – their religion, safety, and security. And we ask Him to guide the misguided ones from the Muslims and return them back to their religion with a goodly return. We ask Him to unite them all in their goals upon the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The last of our call is that all praise and thanks are due to Allah, the Lord of all creations and may He send prayers and peace upon our prophet, Muhammad, his family, and his companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>An extract from my letter I sent to His Excellency Shaykh</b><b> Abu Al-A`la Al-Mawdudy </b><b>concerning</b><b> the difference between `Ibadah and obedience</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On 2/4//1392 A.H.,<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Abu Al-A`la Al-Mawdudy </span>sent me a letter no. 1526, dated 2 Safar, 1392 A.H. explaining his case and<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Tufayl&#8217;s, </span>his successor in the leadership of Islamic Group. I replied in the same year when I was the President of the Islamic University in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah </span>and the following is some of my reply:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some brothers from<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Milbar </span>living in the country told me that Your Eminence opine that <em>`Ibadah is clarified by obedience and that when someone obeys another, he worships him. `Ibadah is also interpreted as enslavement and idolization. </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, Shaykh<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Umar ibn Ahmad Al-Millibary, </span>owner of Al-Salsabil Magazine, wrote to me concerning this issue asserting what is mentioned about you and the Group. He sent me a copy of a survey pertaining to this question. You will find an enclosed copy of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This question appears strange for me so I determined to write to you before I receive your letter to know whether these statements which are attributed to you are true. So, please let me know your opinion. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>I see that obedience has a wider scope than `Ibadah. Every act of `Ibadah a person does in compliance with Allah&#8217;s Shari`ah is seen as obedience, but not every act of obedience to anything other than Allah (Exalted be He) is seen as `Ibadah</strong></span>. This matter needs more elaboration. <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Obedience to Allah (Exalted be He) is seen as `Ibadah when a person seeks to please Him. However, it may be valid or corrupt depending on whether the requirements of `Ibadah are met.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Please tell me in details your view on this question. It adds further explanation that `Ibadah may be denied when tainted with Shirkas Allah says concerning Mushrik (one who associates others with Allah in His Divinity or worship), &#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Kafirun, 109: 3" target="_blank" name="NorwillyouworshipthatwhichIworship"></a>&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Nor will you worship that which I worship</span></strong>.&#8221; <span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Kafirun, 109: 3</span> . Ibadah is negated because of their acts of Shirk. It is known that they worship Allah (Exalted be He) during times of hardships through showing Tawhid, performing Hajj and `Umrah, offering Sadaqah and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since these acts of `Ibadah are spoiled by Shirk, disbelief in the Hereafter and other kinds of disbelief during times of prosperity, it is permissible to negate the `Ibadah of people who show it. Furthermore, I would like to explain another point.<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> The person who obeys the authorities or rulers in something forbidden by Allah (Exalted be He) is not seen worshipping them when he does not believe in the permissibility of obedience to anyone in something opposing Allah&#8217;s Shari`ah. They rather obey these rules out of fear of their evils or vain desires while they know that they are sinful. Due to their act of obedience, such persons are sinners, not Mushriks, unless they obey such rulers in matters which do not involve Shirk. Examples of these matters include striking, killing, and taking someone&#8217;s money unjustly.</strong></span> There are many other examples that come under this heading. I think this view is known by the people of knowledge whose status is below yours. I find it imperative to ask you about this and know your detailed opinion so that I can refute any claim against you and support you with sure knowledge and show the truth concerning the Islamic Group to any one who seeks it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If what is attributed to you is true, we can discuss it thoroughly and examine the problematic issues using the evidence. The truth is the long-sought aim of everyone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah (Exalted be He) to grant us success to do what pleases Him and to comprehend His Religion and to adhere to it. May Allah purify our hearts and deeds and make the truth our long-sought aim wherever we are, for He is the Most Generous. As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!)</p>

Chapter 78<br />
Obligation of Rulers to show Kindness to their Subjects</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And be kind and humble to the believers who follow you.&#8221; (26:215)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Verily, Allah enjoins Al-`Adl (justice) and Al-Ihsan (performing duties in a perfect manner), and giving (help) to kith and kin, and forbids Al-Fahsha&#8217; evil deeds and Al-Munkar (all that is prohibited) and Al-Baghy (oppression). He admonishes you, that you may take heed.&#8221;</b></span><b> (16:90)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>653.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: I heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;All of you are guardians and are responsible for your wards. The ruler is a guardian and responsible for his subjects; the man is a guardian and responsible for his family; the woman is a guardian and is responsible for her husbands house and his offspring; and so all of you are guardians and are responsible for your wards.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>654.</b> Abu Ya`la Ma`qil bin Yasar (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Any slave whom Allah makes him in charge of subjects and he dies while he is not sincere to them, Allah will make Jannah unlawful for him.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is: Allah&#8217;s Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He who does not look after his subjects with goodwill and sincerity, will be deprived of the fragrance of Jannah.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A narration in Muslim is: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;A ruler who, having control over the affairs of the Muslims, does not strive diligently for their betterment and does not serve them sincerely, will not enter Jannah with them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>655.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: I heard the the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) supplicating in my house:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O Allah! Treat harshly those who rule over my Ummah with harshness, and treat gently those who rule over my Ummah with gentleness.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>656.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The Banu Isra&#8217;il were ruled by the Prophets. When one Prophet died, another succeeded him. There will be no Prophet after me. Caliphs will come after me, and they will be many.</span>&#8221; The Companions said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, what do you command us to do?&#8221; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Fulfill the pledge of allegiance to which is sworn first (then swear allegiance to the others). Concede to them their due rights and ask Allah that which is due to you. Allah will call them to account in respect of the subjects whom He had entrusted to them.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>657.</b> `Aidh bin `Amr (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I visited `Ubaidullah bin Ziyad and said to him: &#8220;Dear son, I heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `The worst of rulers are those who treat their subjects harshly. Beware, lest you should be one of them.&#8221;&#8217;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>658.</b> Abu Maryam Al-Azdi (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I said to Mu`awiyah (bin Abu Sufyan) (May Allah be pleased with them): I heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;If Allah invests to someone the affairs of the Muslims and he (i.e., the ruler) ignores their rights, denies their access to him and neglects their needs, Allah will not answer his prayer or realize his hopes and will act towards him with indifference on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221; So Mu`awiyah appointed a person to keep a vigil on the necessities of the people and to fulfill them.</span><br />
[Abu Dawud and  At-Tirmidhi].</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>659.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Seven are (the persons) whom Allah will give protection with His Shade* on the Day when there will be no shade except His Shade (i.e., on the Day of Resurrection), and they are: A just ruler; a youth who grew up with the worship of Allah; a person whose heart is attached to the mosque; two persons who love and meet each other and depart from each other for the sake of Allah; a man whom a beautiful and high ranking woman seduces (for illicit relation), but he (rejects this offer by saying): `I fear Allah&#8217;; a person who gives a charity and conceals it (to such an extent) that the left hand might not know what the right has given; and a person who remembers Allah in solitude and his eyes well up.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* The Shade of Allah to which this Hadith refers to is the shade of His Throne.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>660.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`as (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The just will be seated upon pulpits of light.&#8221; Those who are fair with regards to their judgement and their family and those who are under them.&#8221;</span><br />

Chapter 80<br />
Obligation of Obedience to the Ruler in what is Lawful and Prohibition of<br />
Obeying them in what is Unlawful</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger (Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority.&#8221;</b></span><b> (4:59)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>663.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;It is obligatory upon a Muslim to listen (to the ruler) and obey whether he likes it or not, except when he is ordered to do a sinful thing; in such case, there is no obligation to listen or to obey.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>664.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> Whenever we took a pledge of allegiance to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) to hear and obey, he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) would say to us, &#8220;As far as you are capable of.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>665.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;One who withdraws his hand from obedience (to the Amir) will find no argument (in his defense) when he stands before Allah on the Day of Resurrection; and one who dies without having sworn allegiance will die the death of one belonging to the Days of Ignorance.&#8217;</span>&#8216;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He who dies having defected from obedience (to the Amir) and discards his association with the main body of the (Muslim) community, dies the death of one belonging to the Days of Jahiliyyah.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>666.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Hear and obey even if an Abyssinian slave whose head is like a raisin is placed in authority over you.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>667.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;It is obligatory upon you to listen and obey the orders of the ruler in prosperity and adversity, whether you are willing or unwilling, or when someone is given undue preference to you.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>668.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: We accompanied Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) on a journey. We halted at a place to take a rest. Some of us began to set right their tents, others began to graze their animals while others were engaged in competing with one another in archery when an announcer of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) announced that people should gather for Salat. We gathered around the Messenger of Allah and he ((sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) addressed us, saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Every Prophet before me was under obligation to guide his followers to what he knew was good for them and to warn the evil thing which he knew. As for this Ummah, it will have sound state and in its early stage of existence; but the last phase of its existence, will be faced with trials and with things you do not recognize. There will be tremendous trials, one after the other, and to each the believer will say, `That is it&#8217;. Whenever a trial arrives the believer will say: `This is going to bring about my destruction.&#8217; When this passes, another calamity will approach and he will say: `This surely is going to be my end.&#8217; Whosoever wishes to be removed from the Fire (Hell) and admitted to Jannah should die with faith in Allah and the Last Day; and he should treat others as he wishes to be treated. He who swears allegiance to an Imam, he should give him the pledge in ratification and the sincerity of his heart. He should obey him to the best of his capacity. If another man comes forward as a claimant (when one has already been installed), behead the second.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>669.</b> Wa&#8217;il bin Hujr (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Salamah bin Yazid Al-Ju`f (May Allah be pleased with him) asked Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam): &#8220;O Prophet of Allah! Tell us, what you command us to do if there arises over us rulers who demand of us what is due to them and refuse us what is due to us.&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) turned away from him, but he repeated the same question. Thereupon Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Listen to them and obey them. They are responsible for their obligations and you are accountable for yours.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>670.</b> `Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;There will be discrimination after my death and there will be other matters that you will disapprove.</span>&#8221; He was asked: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! What do you command us to do when we are encountered with such happenings?&#8221; He answered,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Give what is due from you and supplicate to Allah for your rights.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>671.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Whosoever obeys me, obeys Allah; and he who disobeys me, disobeys Allah; and whosoever obeys the Amir (leader), in fact, obeys me; and he who disobeys the Amir, in fact, disobeys me.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>672.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;If a person notices in his ruler what he dislikes, he should show patience because he who departs from the (Muslim) community a cubit, dies like those who died in the Days of Ignorance.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>673.</b> Abu Bakrah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He who insults the rulers Allah will insult him.&#8221;</span><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;">Al-Istiqaamah Magazine &#8211; Issue No.7</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> Rabee&#8217; ul-Awwal 1418H / July 1997</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;">By Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Jameel Zaynoo</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Understand that judging by what Allaah revealed in His Book is incumbent upon the Muslim, and not doing so results an many calamities befalling the Ummah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That there would always continue to be a group from this Ummah clinging to the truth and to the pure Tawheed of Allaah until the day of Judgment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Say: Allaah has power to send punishment upon you from above you, or from under your feet; or to cover you in confusion with party strife; and make you taste the inter-fighting and violence of one another. See how We variously explain the Aayaat (proofs and signs), so that they may understand.” [Sooratul-An’aam 6:65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, when this verse was revealed: “Say: Allaah has power to send punishment upon you from above you.” So he said: “I seek refuge in Your Face.” “Or from under your feet.” He said: “I seek refuge in Your Face.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Or to cover you in confusion with party strife, and make you taste the inter-fighting and violence of one another.” So Allaah’s Messenger (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said: “This is lighter or easier.” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said: “Indeed Allaah gathered up the earth for me so that I saw its eastern and western parts, and indeed the dominion of my Ummah will reach what was gathered up for me from it. And I have been granted the two treasures of gold and silver. And indeed I asked my Lord for my Ummah that it should not be totally destroyed by a prevailing famine, nor to allow on enemy to totally conquer it, except from amongst themselves. So my Lord said: O Muhammad! When I decree a matter, then it is not reversed. I grant to you for your Ummah that it would not be totally destroyed by a prevailing famine, nor will it be totally conquered by on external enemy, even if all the notions were to rally against it However, a group from your Ummah will destroy one another and imprison one another.” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) also said: “I asked my Lord for three things, I was granted two; but prevented from one: I asked my Lord that He should not destroy my Ummah with drought and famine, so He granted it to me. I asked my Lord that He should not destroy my Ummah with drowning, so he granted it to me. And I asked Him not to cause my Ummah to fight amongst themselves, but he refused that to me.” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this inter-fighting that has befallen the Muslims has been further emphasized in his (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) saying: “And when your leaders do not judge by the Book of Allaah, not seeking the good and welfare with Allaah has revealed, then Allaah would cause them to fight one another.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, in an addition to the second narration: “Indeed, what I fear for my Ummah are misguided leaders, and that when the sword is drown out against them, it will not be lifted from them until the Day of Judgement. And the Hour will not come, until sections of my Ummah will follow the mushrikeen (those who worship others along with Allaah), and until many sections of my Ummah will worship idols. And there will be in my Ummah thirty liars; all of whom will claim that he is a Prophet. But I am the last and the seal of the Prophets; there is no Prophet after me. And there will not cease to be a group from my Ummah being helped upon the truth, not being harmed by those who oppose them; until the commend of Allaah comes.” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">SOME BENEFITS FROM THE ABOVE AAYAH AND HADEETH:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]: It shows the great power of Allaah &#8211; the Most High – in sending punishment to the previous nations, from above them, and from beneath their feet, causing them to be annihilated and destroyed. Due to this, Allaah’s Messenger (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) sought refuge and protection in the Face of his Lord against his Ummah being punished in a similar manner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]: The first hadeeth (narration) affirms that Allaah – the Most High – has a wajh (Face), but in a manner that befits His Greatness and Majesty, there being any tashbeeh (resemblance) between Allaah and between that of His creation; as Allaah said: “There is none like Him; and He is the all-Hearing, the all-Seeing.” [Sooratush-Shooraa 42:11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]: It shows the great power of Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; in that whenever the Muslims abandon judging by the Sharee’ah (Divinely Prescribed Law) of Allaah; but rather take to manmade laws that oppose the Law of Allaah &#8211; which, with deep regret, is happening now &#8211; then Allaah causes the Ummah to split-up into sects and parties, and makes them fight one another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]: It Shows the might of Allaah in that He gathered-up the earth for His Messenger (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam), so that he saw its eastern and western parts; and that the dominion of his Ummah would extend over all that which was gathered-up for him, from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]: It shows the mercy of Allaah to the Muslim Ummah, in His not sending against them a punishment that would totally destroy the entire Ummah; but it would only cause destruction to parts of the Ummah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]: An-Nawawee (d.676H) &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said: “In this hadeeth is a clear and apparent miracle, all of which has come to pass &#8211; so all praise be to Allaah.” [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]: It also shows the mercy of Allaah to the Muslim Ummah in that He has not allowed an external enemy to overpower them, such that they have complete control over them. Rather, Allaah has caused some parts of the Ummah to fight against others; and this is far easier than the former case.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]: It Shows the fear that Allaah’s Messenger (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) had for his Ummah with regards to the misguided leaders who would not take hold of the Book and the Sunnah; and how he warned against them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]: That when the sword has been drawn out against this Ummah, then it would not be lifted from it until the Day of Judgement &#8211; as is happening at this very time now.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]: It proves that shirk would be present in the Ummah. And shirk is: Directing worship, or forms of worship, to other than Allaah, such as making du’aa (supplication) to other that Allaah, or judging by other than what Allaah has legislated and revealed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]: We are informed about the existence of those who would claim that they are Prophets and that they are all liars in this claim; such as Musaylimah al-Kadhdhaab in earlier times, and in more recent times Ghulaam Ahmad Mirza, the Qaadiyaanee (whose followers are called Qaadiyaanees).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12]: That there would always continue to be a group from this Ummah clinging to the truth and to the pure Tawheed of Allaah until the day of Judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam an-Nawawee &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“As for this group, then Imaam al-Bukhaaree (d.256H) said: “They are the people of knowledge.” And Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal (d.241H) said: “If they are not Ahlul-Hadeeth (the Scholars of Hadeeth), then I do not know who they can be.” Qaadee ’Iyaad said: “What Imaam Ahmad meant by that was Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah and whosoever holds the ’aqeedah (belief) of Ahlul-Hadeeth.” I say: It is possible that this group could be scattered amongst the various categories of Believers, from them:- the brave warriors, the Scholars of Hadeeth, the zuhhaad (those who abstain from the world in a praiseworthy manner), those that enjoin the good and forbid the evil, and other categories of people who do good.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibnul-Mubaarak (d.181H) &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said: “In my view they are Ashaabul-Hadeeth (the companions of Hadeeth).” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the preferred saying is that this Aided and Victorious Group are those that act in accordance with the authentic hadeeth, not giving precedence to the saying of anyone over and above the saying of Allaah and His Messenger (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam).</p>

Source: Istiqaamah Magazine, Issue No.6 &#8211; Dhul-Qa&#8217;dah 1417H / March 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: What is the obligation upon the Muslim Scholars with regard to facing the trials and calamities that have befallen the Islaamic world?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: From that which there is no doubt about is that sins, and being far removed from the correct Islaamic <i>&#8216;aqeedah</i> (beliefs) &#8211; in both sayings and actions &#8211; are from the greatest reasons of bringing about the various crisis and calamities that have befallen the Muslims. Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Whatever of good reaches you, it is from Allaah; and whatever of evil befalls you, it is from yourself.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:79]. Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect, the Most High &#8211; also said: <b>&#8220;And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of what your hands have earned. Yet He pardons much.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ash-Shooraa 42:30]. So Allaah is Most Forgiving and the Most Merciful to His servants, sending to them clear signs and warnings, in order that they may run back to Him in <i>tawbah</i> (sincere repentance) and that He may forgive them. So when a person runs to Allaah and draws closer to Him by an arm&#8217;s length, then Allaah draws closer to him by two arm&#8217;s length. For indeed Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; loves those of His servants that turn to Him in <i>tawbah</i> and is happy with that, whilst He &#8211; the Majestic, the Most High &#8211; remains absolutely self-sufficient from His servants. The obedience of the obedient ones does not benefit Him, nor do the sins of the sinful ones harm Him. But He is Most Kind, Ever Merciful to His servants. And He grants them the ability to do acts of obedience and to leave acts of disobedience. So these crisis and calamities are none other than a warning to His servants, in that they should turn back to Allaah in repentance and obedience, and He informs them of this by way of testing them. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And certainly We shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruit. But give glad tidings to those who have <i>sabr</i> (patience); those who, when afflicted with a calamity, say: Indeed to Allaah we belong, and to Him shall we return. They are those for whom are the <i>salawaat</i> (blessings and forgiveness) from their Lord, and His Mercy, and it is they who are the guided-ones.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:155] Allaah &#8211; the One free From all defects &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Evil has appeared on the land and the sea, because of what the hands of men have earned. That Allaah may make them taste a part of that which they have done, in order that they may return to Allaah in repentance.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Room 30:41]. And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And We shall test you by way of evil and good, and to Us will you return.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Anbiyaa 21:35]. And Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And We tested them with good blessings and evil calamities, in order that they may return to the obedience of Allaah.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-A&#8217;raaf 7:168]. And there are many other Verses with a similar meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the obligation upon the leaders of the Muslims &#8211; the Scholars, rulers, and other than them &#8211; is to have concern for the various afflictions and calamities that occurs, and to remind and admonish the people, and explain to them what they have fallen into. Also. those in authority &#8211; from the Scholars and the rulers &#8211; should set a good example of righteous conduct and should discuss the reasons as to why Allaah is angered and gives retribution; and they should seek to cure this with <i>tawbah</i> (repentance), <i>istighfaar</i> (seeking Allaah&#8217;s Forgiveness) and correcting their affairs. The rest of the Ummah will then follow them in this, since the guidance of the Scholars, and the wisdom of the rulers &#8211; and both being correct and upright &#8211; has one of the greatest effects with regards to the fulfillment of responsibilities. The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Each of you is a guardian, and is responsible for those whom he is in charge of. So the ruler is a guardian and is responsible for his subjects; a man is the guardian of his family and is responsible for those under his care; a woman is a guardian of her husband&#8217;s home and is responsible for those under her care; a servant is the guardian of his master&#8217;s wealth and is responsible for that which he is entrusted with; and a man is the guardian of his father&#8217;s wealth and is responsible for that which is under his care. So each one of you is a guardian and is responsible for what he is entrusted with.&#8221;</i>2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, when the Muslims become accustomed to sinning and with being contented with it, and those who wield authority and power do not try to prevent them, then Allaah&#8217;s anger will quickly descend upon the Ummah. And when His anger occurs, and His punishment takes place, then it covers both the sinful and obedient, and Allaah&#8217;s protection is sought from this. About this Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:<b> &#8220;And beware of the <i>fitnah</i> (trial and discord) that does not affect in particular only those amongst you who are wrong-doers.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Afaal 8:25]. Likewise. the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said:<i> &#8220;When the people see an evil, and they do not try to change it, then Allaah will cover them all with punishment from Himself.</i>&#8220;3 Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said:<b> &#8220;Indeed Allaah will not change the condition of a people until they change themselves.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ar-Ra&#8217;d 13:11]. So the Scholars will be thorougly questioned in front of Allaah with regards to them giving knowledge and guidance to the people, and explaining to them what is correct and what is wrong, and also clarifying the beneficial from the harmful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we ask Allaah that He favours all the Muslims and grants them the ability to be obedient to their Lord, and to cling to the guidance of their Prophet Muhammad <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, and that He grants their leaders the ability to fulfill their duties, and that He teaches their Scholars the ways of guidance, so that they may all traverse its path and direct the Ummah to it, and that He guides the misguided Muslims and corrects their affairs. Indeed He is the Guardian over this, and the One having power to do this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: The enemies of Allaah are very eager to enter into the Muslim lands by various methods. So what efforts do you believe should be exerted in order to put a stop to this surge that has threatened the Islaamic societies?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: This is not something strange coming from the callers to Christianity, Judaism, or the other religions of <i>kufr</i> (disbelief). Since Allaah, the Most Perfect &#8211; and to Him belongs all praise &#8211; has informed us about this in His clear Revelation, when He said: <b>&#8220;Never will the Jews and the Christians be pleased with you until you follow their ways of life. Say: Indeed the Guidance of Allaah, that is the only true Guidance. And if you were to follow their false desires after what you have received of the knowledge of Revelation, then you would have neither a guardian, nor any helper against Allaah.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:120]. Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; also said: <b>&#8220;And they will never stop fighting you, until they turn you away from your Religion, if they can.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:217]. This is why they utilize every possible means to penetrate into the Muslim lands, and use various methods and tactics to acheive this. One of their methods is to plant the seeds of doubt and uncertainty into the minds and thoughts &#8211; and they continue to do so without easing-up or become weary &#8211; utilising the church to spread their hatred and enmity, and directing their efforts through it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore it is obligatory upon the leaders and Scholars to exert every possible effort in cautioning and directing the Muslim children, and to oppose the efforts of the enemies of Islaam with countermeasures. For indeed the Ummah of Islaam is an Ummah that has been entrusted  with a responsibility of carrying this Religion and conveying it to others. So when we &#8211; in the Islaamic societies &#8211; are determined to arm our sons and daughters with correct knowledge, and true understanding of the Religion; beginning this process at an early age, then we will never fear the enemy &#8211; by the permission of Allaah. Thus, as long as we continue to cling to the Religion of Allaah, glorifying and venerating Him, following His <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i> (Prescribed Laws), and fighting those who oppose Him, then the opposite will happen; it will be the enemies of Allaah who will fear the Muslims. Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect, the One to Whom belongs all praise &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;O you who believe. If you help Allaah by acting upon what you have been commanded with, then Allaah will plant your feet firmly by giving you victory over your enemies.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Muhammad 47:7]. Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; also said: <b>&#8220;But if you have <i>sabr</i> (remain patient) and have <i>taqwaa</i> (piety) by doing what Allaah orders and refraining from what He has prohibited, then no harm will their cunning plots be to you at all. Indeed Allaah encompasses everything by His Knowledge.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-lmraan 3:120]. And there are plenty of other Verses with similar meaning. So the most important factor in stopping this attack is to prepare a generation that truly know and understands the realities of Islaam. This can be achieved by giving them the correct guidance and cultivation at home, and by utilising the various means of education in order to develop the society. Add to this the role of guiding, which is the duty of those in authority, and their duty of being constant in doing beneficial acts, being constant in reminding the people with what is of benefit to them, and doing that which cultivates the correct Islaamic <i>&#8216;aqeedah </i>(belief) in the people: <b>&#8220;Indeed in the remembrance of Allaah do hearts truly find tranquility.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ar-Ra&#8217;d 13:28].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is no doubt that negligence is one of the causes that lets the enemies of Islaam into the Muslim lands &#8211; along with their ideological attack &#8211; which gradually distances the Muslims from their Religion, step by step. So with this, evil will increase amongst them and they will be affected by the false ideologies of their enemies. And Allaah &#8211; One free from all defects, the Most High &#8211; ordered the Believers to have <i>sabr</i> (patience), to call to patience, and to strive in His Path using every method at their disposal; as He &#8211; the Most Majestic, Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;O you who Believe. Persevere and be more patient, and guard your territory by stationing army units permanently at the places from where the enemy can attack you, and have <i>taqwaa</i> of Allaah (by doing what He orders and keeping away from what He prohibits) in order that you may be successful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan 3:200]. And Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said:<b> &#8220;And those who strive hard in Our cause, We shall surely guide them to Our Avenues. Indeed Allaah is with the doers of good.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-&#8216;Ankaboot 29:69]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah by His beautiful Names and lofty Attributes that He improves and corrects the affairs of the Muslims, and that He grants to them the understanding of the Religion, gathers the word of their leaders upon the truth, and improves and corrects their close advisors. Indeed He is the Most Kind, Most Generous. And may Allaah extol and send abundant blessings of peace upon our Leader and our Prophet, Muhammad, and upon his Family, his Companions, and his true followers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Translated by Dawud Burbank rahimahullaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Muhammad Naasiruddeen al-Albaanee was asked, &#8220;Our Shaikh, may Allaah bless you, the scholars of the Salaf, may Allaah have mercy upon them, mention that Tawheed is of three types: &#8216;ar-Ruboobiyyah,&#8217; &#8216;al-Uloohiyyah&#8217; and &#8216;al-Asmaa was-Sifaat,&#8217; so is it correct for us to say that there is a fourth Tawheed that is &#8216;Tawheedul-Haakimiyyah&#8217; or &#8216;Tawheed of Judgement?&#8217; So he replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8216;Al-Haakimiyyah&#8217; is a branch of the branches of Tawheedul-Uloohiyyah, and those who focus their attention upon this newly invented saying in the present age use it as a weapon not to teach the Muslims the Tawheed that all of the Prophets and Messengers came with, but rather as apolitical weapon. So if you wish I will establish for you what I have just said, even though this question has repeatedly been answered by me, many times &#8211; or if you wish we will continue upon our topic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have said in similar circumstances, as support for what I have just said, that usage of the word &#8216;al-Haakimyyah&#8217; is part of the political da&#8217;wah that is particular to some of the parties present today; and I will mention here something that occurred between myself and someone who gave the khutbah in one of the mosques of Damascus. So on the day of Jumu&#8217;ah he gave a khutbah which was all about judgement/decree being for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. But this person made an error with regard to a matter of fiqh. So after he had finished the prayer I went forward to him and gave him &#8216;salaam,&#8217; and said to him, &#8216;O my brother, you did so and so, and that is contrary to the Sunnah.&#8217; So he said to me, &#8216;I am a Hanafee, and the Hanafee madhhab says what I have done.&#8217; So I said, &#8216;Subhaanallaah! You have given khutbah that judgement/decree is just for Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, but you only use this word to attack those rulers whom you think are Unbelievers because they do not rule according to the Islamic Sharee&#8217;ah. But you have forgotten about yourselves &#8211; that Allaah&#8217;s decree/judgement covers every Muslim. So why, when I say to you that the Messenger did so and so, why do you say, &#8216;But my madhhab is such and such.&#8217; Then you have contradicted that which you call the people to.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if it were not for the fact that they use this saying as a tool for political propaganda of theirs, then we would say, &#8216;This is our merchandise that has been returned to us.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the da&#8217;wah that we call the people to contains &#8216;al-Haakimiyyah&#8217; and other than &#8216;al-Haakimiyyah&#8217;: Tawheedul-Uloohiyyah and Tawheed of worship &#8211; that which you concentrate upon enters within it. We are the ones who propagated what you mention whilst you are focusing upon &#8216;al-Haakimiyyah,&#8217; the hadeeth of Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamaan, that when the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa-sallam) recited this ayah to his noble Companions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They (the Jews and the Christians) took the Rabbis and learned men as lords besides Allaah. Soorah at-Tawbah (9):31</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">then &#8216;Adiyy ibn Haatim at-Taa&#8217;ee said, &#8216;By Allaah, O Messenger of Allaah, we did not take them as lords besides Allaah.&#8217; So he said, &#8216;When they made something lawful forbidden for you, had you not used to declare it forbidden; and when they made lawful something forbidden, had you not used to take it as being lawful?&#8217; He said, &#8216;As for that, then it did used to happen.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Then that is your taking them as lords besides Allaah.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we are the ones who propagated this hadeeth, and then it reached the others. Then they advanced one part of Tawheedul-Uloohiyyah or worship, with this innovated title for political aims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I do not see anything (wrong) in a terminology such as this if only they had not left it as mere propaganda without their acting as it requires. So it is, as I have just mentioned, a part of Tawheed of worship &#8211; but you will see them worshipping Allaah in whatever manner each of them feels like, and if it is said, as we have just mentioned in the incident of the man who gave the khutbah, &#8216;that someone is acting contrary to the Sunnah,&#8217; or &#8216;this is something contrary to the saying of the Messenger (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa-sallam),&#8217; then he says, &#8216;My madhhab is such and such.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That judgement/decree is for Allaah alone is not just a proof against the Unbelievers and the mushriks, but also against anyone who transgresses against Allaah by contradicting what came from Allaah in His Book, and from His Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa-sallam) in his Sunnah. This is what I have as a reply to the likes of this question.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Taken from &#8216;al-Muslimoon,&#8217; no. 639, 25th of Dhul-Hijjah 1417H which corresponds to Friday the 2nd of May 1997.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah, his family, his Companions, and those who follow his guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>There is, in the present time, a tradition in many Islamic countries that when a king or a leader dies, people must mourn for three days or more or less. Flags are lowered at half-mast and the State departments stop working. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Undoubtedly, these acts go against Shari`ah (Islamic law) and entail <strong>imitation of the enemies of Islam</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Authentic Hadiths related from the Prophet (peace be upon him) prohibit and warn people, except a <strong>wife</strong>, against mourning. The maximum period of mourning for a woman is four months and ten days, if the deceased is her husband, and three days or less for relatives. The other practices done during mourning a deceased person, whether a king or a leader, are prohibited in Shari`ah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the lifetime of the Prophet (peace be upon him), his son Ibrahim, his three daughters and others died, but he (peace be upon him) did not mourn them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The leaders who joined the Battle of Mu&#8217;tah, including Zayd ibn Harithah, Ja`far ibn Abu Talib and `Abdullah ibn Rawahah (may Allah be pleased with them) were killed during the Prophet&#8217;s era but he (peace be upon him) did not mourn them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) did not mourn the death of the Prophet (peace be upon him), the best of creation and prophets, nor did they mourn Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him), the best of Sahabah and creation after the prophets. When `Umar, `Uthman and `Aly (may Allah be pleased with them), the best creation after the prophets and Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq, were killed, no one mourned them. The same was true with all the Sahabah and the Imams of Islam and guidance of Tabi`un (Followers, the generation after the Companions of the Prophet) and the next generation including Sa`id ibn Al-Musayyib, `Aly ibn Al-Husayn Zayn Al-`Abidin, his son Muhammad ibn `Aly, `Umar ibn `Abdul-`Aziz,Al-Zuhry, Imam Abu Hanifah, his two companions, Imam Malik ibn Anas, Al-Awza`y, Al-Thawry, Imam Al-Shafi`y, Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal, and Is-haq ibn Rahawayh and many others. No Muslim mourned those people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If this (mourning) were good, the Salaf (righteous predecessors) would have done it. All goodness lies in following them and evil lies in opposing them. Therefore, the Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet) affirmed that what the Salaf did concerning avoiding mourning any person except for a dead husband, is the right action.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The mourning practiced nowadays for the death of kings and leaders is unacceptable in Islam. These practices entail <strong>imitating the enemies of Islam and result in much harm, such as suspension of public services</strong>. Consequently, the Muslim authorities and rulers must abandon these acts of mourning and follow the conduct of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the people of knowledge have to warn and inform Muslims about the ruling on these acts as they are obliged to advise people and cooperate in righteousness and piety.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I, therefore, for the sake of Allah, the Prophet (peace be upon him) and all Muslims, Imams and ordinary people, find it necessary to write this brief statement. I ask Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) to grant Muslim rulers and subjects success to do what pleases Him and to follow Shari`ah and warn against opposing it. May Allah purify our hearts and deeds for He is the All-Hearer of supplication, the Ever-Near. May Allah&#8217;s Peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Bismillaah wa -Alhamdulillaah wa Salaatu wa Salaam &#8216;alaa Rasulillaah &#8216;amma ba&#8217;d</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Noble <em>Shaykh &#8216;AbdulQaadir Ibn Muhammad al-Junaid</em> (May <em>Allaah </em>Preserve Him), from the scholars of <em>Ad-Dammam</em>, K.S.A., delivered a LIVE tele-lecture with <em>Muwahhideen </em>Publications on Thursday 21<sup>st</sup>February 2013. The <em>Shaykh </em>is recognized and recommended by the major scholars of our time, the likes of <em>Shaykh &#8216;Ubayd al-Jaabiree</em>, <em>Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Haadee al-Madkhalee</em>, and many others (May <strong>Allaah </strong>preserve them)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh ‘Abdul Qaadir al-Junaid (hafidhahullaah)</em> commenced this comprehensively beneficial lecture by asking <strong>Allaah</strong> to benefit us with this sitting and to make us from those who love the truth, follow what <strong>Allaah</strong>and His Messenger says and that He makes us from those who put His Speech and that of His Messenger<em>(sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em> before everything else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our <em>Shaykh</em> affirmed the fact that many <em>Muslims</em> are engaged in protests and demonstrations throughout the world and some of them desire by this the <em>dunya</em> while some seek to topple the ruler due to injustice that he might have committed, and will not stop until he is removed. However, this does not change their situation and ends up resulting in millions of deaths, loss of wealth and property. This might last for years if the ruler is not removed and as a result, the ruler may execute an armed counter-reaction, which would lead to even more deaths and losses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Shaykh</em> then proceeded to say that if we use our intellects, we would see that this blessed <em>Sharee’ah</em>explained even the intricate matters of using the toilet. So would it make sense that a great affair such as governance, which affects all Muslims, that <strong>Allaah</strong> would leave us without guidance, leaving each man to himself to act as he sees fit or to follow his desires?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then said that if we were to return to the books of the <em>Sunnah</em> we would see that this matter of governorship and how the <em>Muslim</em> should deal with the rulers has been thoroughly addressed. He further mentioned that this issue has also been explained in the books of <em>‘Aqeedah</em>. However, the fault lies with us, as many do not inquire about what is requested of them in light of the <em>Sharee’ah</em> before engaging in such matters and secondly, they do not study the ahkaam related to these affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our <em>Shaykh</em> then went on to extract some benefits and rulings regarding the manhaj in dealing with the rulers from three ahadeeth of the Prophet <em>(sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em> where he advised us on what to do if we were to encounter unjust rulers. The remedies include having patience with them until we meet him<em>(sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em>  at the <em>hawdh</em>, carrying out their rights while seeking our rights from <strong>Allaah</strong> and listening and obeying even if they were to beat our backs and take our wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Next, <em>Shaykh al-Junaid (hafidhahullaah)</em> commented on some reasons why protests are prohibited in <em>Islaam</em>. From them are:</p>
<ul>
<li>1.      They contradict the <em>Sharee’ah</em></li>
<li>2.      They resemble the way of the<em> kuffaar</em></li>
<li>3.      They encourage injustice and sin</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This sitting was indeed filled with immense benefit and serves as a beautiful clarification concerning this pertinent and crucial issue as our <em>Shaykh ‘Abdul Qaadir</em> clearly explains each point bringing the necessary evidences from the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>. A must listen for the one seeking clarity!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask <strong>Allaah</strong> to guide us to the truth and make it easy for us to follow and that He saves us all from falling into sin and transgression.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Wa Billaahi Tawfeeq</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Wa SallAllaahu wa Sallaama wa Barak &#8216;alaa Nabiyanna Muhammad wa &#8216;alaa &#8216;Alyhi wa Sahbyhi wa Sallam</em></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillaah wa -Alhumdulillaah wa Salaatu wa Salaam &#8216;alaa Rasulullaah &#8216;amma ba&#8217;d</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Noble <strong>Shaykh &#8216;Adil as-Sayyid</strong> (May Allaah Preserve Him), from the mashayikh of Egypt, delivered a beautiful LIVE Telelink Lecture with Muwahhideen Publications. The Shaykh brought some of the reasons for oppressive rulers over the muslimeen as a punishment or test from Allaah, then he expounds on the method of change that begins with the society first in order to deserve better rulers and/or Governments.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Beginning with Tunisia then Libya, Egypt, Yemen and now Syria, the Muslim lands have become riddled with the fitnah of revolution &#8211; an adopted method of change that has never been part of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This disease has entered the hearts and minds of Muslims who have resorted to demonstrations, protests and revolting against the Muslim ruler &#8211; all of which are haram (impermissible), according to the pristine sharee&#8217;ah (the final and preserved Islaamic legislation revealed from above the heavens by One Who is All-Wise and All-Knowing). Many have been deceived into change through these hectic and democratic methods.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This sickness of revolution, which was innovated by the early deviant groups such as the Khawaarij, has now sadly become the accepted way amongst ignorant Muslims &#8211; and undoubtedly this benefits none but the enemies of Islaam. May Allaah rectify the Muslim lands from this disease, and return us all back to the Qur`aan and Sunnah upon the understanding of the righteous predecessors (the Prophet, salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, and his companions, radiallaahu &#8216;anhum).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh &#8216;Adil Sayyid (hafidhahullaah), who is in the middle of this calamity in Egypt and who has defended the position of Ahlus-Sunnah, clarified this very important issue on the 20th of Jamada ath-Thaani, 1433, corresponding to 5-9-12.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Scholar</strong>: Imâm Muhammad Nâsir-ud-Dîn al-Albânî<br />
<strong>Source</strong>: Silsilat-ul-Hudâ wan-Nûr (320)<br />
<strong>Reference</strong>: Darulhadith.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">They say that the call of Salafiyyah is based upon speech about the creed and Tawhîd and (it) forgets, or ignores, theoretically or practically, governance (Hâkimiyyah) and human Tawâghît who constitute their own laws next to Allâh. What do you say about this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Albânî</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We agree with this to some extent. However, we do not agree with them on removing the Tawâghît, as they call them, without first having removed the Tawâghît of their souls.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This type of speech springs from the methodology of this group. They accuse us with this accusation. We deem that it is not time for this action (I.e. to overthrow rulers). We do not deny that it is obligatory to condemn each and every one who rules by something other than that which Allâh revealed. Is there some Islâmic group today that is ready to confront the rulers who do not rule by that which Allâh revealed without having prepared with the preparation we always speak about, namely spiritual and material preparation? They are in a hurry. They think that raising the voice against these rulers is enough in order to support Islâm. However, true victory is to make them understand true Islâm and practice it as good as they can.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I consider that history repeats itself. The first Muslims only cared about understanding the call of Islâm from its source, namely Allah’s messenger (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam). They didn’t care about confronting the disbelievers and polytheists. The only exception is perhaps occasional, individual cases. But collectively, it first took place after the emigration of the prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) from Makah to al-Madînah. This type of speech is thusly known to us from far back. We have experienced this in several Islâmic countries when they declared war against the disbelieving leader who does not rule by that which Allâh revealed. This was done without the spiritual and material preparation. It only ended with setbacks in the Islâmic call in several Islâmic countries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillaah Al-Hamdulillaah wa salatu wa salamu &#8216;ala Rasool Allaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following is from Shaikh Jamaal Al-Haarithee from his comments on Shaikh Saalih al-Fawzaan&#8217;s <strong>Beneficial Answers to Questions on Innovated Methodologies</strong> (hafidhahumullaah):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported in the book<strong> as-Sunnah</strong> of Ibn Abee &#8216;Aasim (2/351), <strong>al-Mustadrak</strong> of Al-Haakim (3/290) and the <strong>Musnad</strong> of Imaam Ahmad (3/404) from the narration of &#8216;Iyyaad bin Ghanam that the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alaihiwasallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"> &#8220;Whoever has some advice for the leader should not speak it out in public. Rather, he should take his hand and sit with him in privacy. So if he [the ruler] accepts it, then he accepts it, and if he doesn&#8217;t, then he [the advisor] has performed what is required of him and what is for him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The wording of this hadeeth is from Al-Haakim, and it is a sound hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><span style="color:#993300;">Look at the example of the Imaam of Ahlus Sunnah, Ahmad ibn Hanbal (rahimahullaah). He was beaten with a whip, dragged on the floor, and imprisoned due to the [the deviants&#8217; claim] of the Qur`an being created. But in spite of this, he would refer to him [the ruler] as the &#8220;Commander of the Believers&#8221; and tell the people:</span> <span style="color:#ff6600;">&#8220;Do not rebel (against the leader); be patient.&#8221;</span> <span style="color:#993300;">Don&#8217;t we have a good example in our righteous predecessors? Or is it that we are more knowledgeable and braver than them?!</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imam Ibn Rajab al-Hanbalee</strong> (rahimahullaah) said in his book <strong>Jaami&#8217;ul-&#8216;Uloom wal Hikam</strong> (pg. 113):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;Sincere Advice to the Muslim leaders means cooperating with them upon the truth, obeying them, reminding them, cautioning them with gentleness and ease, preventing an uprise against them, and supplicating for them to be guided.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Ash-Shawkaanee</strong> said in his book Raf&#8217;-ul-Asaateen fee Hukm-il-Ittisaal bis-Salaateen (pg. 81-82):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"> &#8220;It is well established in the Mighty Book (Qur`an) that we are commanded to obey the ruler. Allaah put obeying the rulers after obeying Him and obeying the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alaihiwasallam). There are many ahaadeeth in the purified Sunnah, i.e. the main collections, and other books that state that it is obligatory to obey them [the rulers] and to be patient with their oppression. One of the ahaadeeth in which the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alaihiwasallam) commanded us to obey them [the rulers] consists of the words: &#8216;&#8230;even if he beats your back and takes your money.&#8217; It is also authentically reported on him (salallaahu &#8216;alaihiwasallam) that he said: </span> &#8216;<span style="color:#ff0000;">Give them what they are entitled to (of rights), and ask Allaah for what you are entitled to (of rights).</span>&#8216;&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Impressions of Shaykh Safiur Rahman Mubarakpooree about Maududi.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A view of Maududi upon which he stood with firmness and the truth is that he laid the foundation for his Jamaat (group, i.e Jamat e islami) upon this view. And presented this view with such strength that even great scholars were influenced by him and they even accepted it, even though they did not enter him Jamaat, but they were influenced by his thoughts and accepted them. When these views came before me, even I was confused for a few days. But after that Allaah Ta&#8217;la opened this matter (mas&#8217;ala) in such a clear way that no type of doubt or confusion remained . Now I will present it before you, then there will be no doubt or confusion for you too Insha&#8217;Allaah. So clearly Allaah Ta&#8217;ala has opened it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The view of Maulana (Maududi) was that if there is continuous following (Ita&#8217;ah) of someone, then this is the worship (Ibadah) of that person .the Muslim is in continuous following (Ita&#8217;ah) of Allaah Ta&#8217;ala and he follow (Ita&#8217;ah) the Prophet SalAllaahu alaihiwasallam because Allaah Ta&#8217;ala ordered to follow him. Thus the following (Ita&#8217;ah) of the Prophet salAllaahu alaihiwasallam is in accordance to the following (Ita&#8217;ah) of Allaah Ta&#8217;ala, therefore when he SalAllaahu alaihiwasallam is followed it is the following of Allaah Ta&#8217;ala and this worship (Ibaadah) becomes the  worship (Ibaadah) of Allaah. Now from here he (Maududi) has raised another problem that if a government does not govern according to the law laid by Allaah Ta&#8217;ala then following that government will be worshipping  that government and this is Shirk. And this is where he (Maududi) took his view of Shirk in Haakimiyyah and presented it strongly, and many a people are busy in it till date. Now I will present its truth before you, I mean t say that books of about a hundered, two hundred, three hundred, four hundred, six hundred and in some cases eight hundred pages have been written by many people on this topic. The matter has been confused in such a way and with such long debates that it becomes difficult to imagine. That is why I present this matter before you in a few clear and firm way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span id="more-2315"></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is Ita&#8217;ah (following) the same as Ibaadah(worship). Or is Ibaadah something else and Ita&#8217;ah something else? Understand this well! To explain it I will present one or two examples before you. A youth of Jamaat-e-Islami came to me and started talking, I was also talking to him. Now he came to his Da&#8217;awah (Call) that Sir(Saheb), this is our Da&#8217;awah. I said: Yes, I know that. He wanted me to accept it so I said Look this Da&#8217;awah (Call) of yours is not Saheeh (right). He asked How is it not right? I said: If this quote of yours is right that if someone follows (Ita&#8217;ah) a government and that government does not govern according to the law laid down by Allaah then this following (Ita&#8217;ah) becomes worship (Ibaadah). If this is right then please do me a favour, go out and watch any muslim on the road, that if he is riding a bicycle on the left hand side of the road (in India vehicles need to keep left- keep left rule&#8217;) then tell him O Brother! do not ride your bicycle this way, it is shirk to ride your bicycle by left side of the road.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now he got violently irritated and asked Maulana (Shaikh) what are you saying ?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: I am saying the same thing you said , I am just showing you the consequences of your da&#8217;awah. He asked How? I said: this government of India.., ..is it&#8217;s governance in accordance to the laws laid down by Allaah or not? He said Its is not, it is being governed without accepting the law of Allaah. Then I said then this following its laws (of the Indian Governement) is Shirk, is&#8217;nt it? He said It will be (Shirk) then I said, The riding of bicycle on the left side is the part of the same law, therefore if someone rides a bicycle on the left side then he is following the government, and you call its following (Ita&#8217;ah) to be worship(Ibaadah). And Ibaadah (worship) of Ghayr Allaah (other than Allaah) is supposed to be shirk, therefore it (this following) becomes Shirk. Now he got extremely worried. He then said Sir (Saheb) now you show me what is right then and what is&#8217;nt right.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said &#8211; Now see Itaa&#8217;ah (following) is something else and Ibaadah(worship) is something else. <span style="color:#0000ff;">It is possible that sometimes a  deed (amal) is Ita&#8217;ah (following) and also Ibadah (worship) but it is also possible that a deed is Ita&#8217;ah but not ibaadah, and it is also possible that a deed is Ibaadah but not Ita&#8217;ah, all of this is possible.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He asked How come?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said You listen I will show you, Ibraheem alaihisalaam came to his people and asked what do you worship? the people said we worship idls and to them we are ever devoted. Now tell me that the idols the people were worshipping were they also following these idols? These idols were unable from the beginning  that they could order to do or not to do something, then these people who were worshipping it does mean worship but does no mean following over here. It must be agreed that these pople were not following but were worshipping.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He agreed to this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now a little more ahead, Allaah ta&#8217;ala has mentioned regarding Christians at many places ( meaning verses) in Al Qura&#8217;an Al Majid. Allah Ta&#8217;ala will ask Eesa alaihisalaam on the day of resurrection  Did you say to men: Worship me and my mother as two gods (Ilaah) besides Alaah so Eesa alaihisalaam will immediately deny this and will say I was a witness over them while I dwelt  amongst them, but when You took me up You were the watcher  over them and You are a Witness to all things:. This way he will deny all knowledge about their actions and will declare himself free from what they used to do. Well, and in the same Al Qura&#8217;an, it is shown regarding the Christians and those who used to worship Eesa alaihisalaam, that these people used to worship such a person who canot give them any gain nor any loss. So it is known that they used to worship Eesa alaihisalaam and Eesa alaihisalaam cannot givem them gain or loss. Now the matter is that, is their worship of Eesa alaihisalaam to be considered his following also? I asked him Their worship is proved, Al Qura&#8217;an also calls this action of theirs as worship. So  the Christians who worship Eesa alaihisalaam  were they also following him?  They were not following Eesa alaihisalam , as Eesa alaihisalaam never ordered them to worship him on the contrary he has ordered them not to worship him. So they were exaggerating in this matter, and instead of following him they were rebelling against him and it was worship. So for worship it is not necessary that the one being worshipped is being followed worship can be done without following and even on the condition of rebellion, will it not be worship?.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the matter which becomes thoroughly clear. Now that it is clear. What must you know? To accept someone&#8217;s orders and put them in action, this is  Ita&#8217;ah(following). And to seek nearness to someone I mean by pleasing him. And his pleasure is  not conditional upon reasons. Then to do something for his pleasure is Iba&#8217;dah (worship). So those people (Christians) used to work for the pleasure of Eesa alaihisalam , therefore this is worship (as they thought this would please him). Yet they were not obedient to him, so this is not Ita&#8217;ah (following). When we pray (offer salaah), we seek Allaah ta&#8217;ala&#8217;s pleasure and nearness in that sense this (Salaah) is worship. And we are acting upon the orders of Allaah in that sense this (salaah) is following. Ita&#8217;ah(following) is in a different meaning and ibaadah (worship) is in a different meaning. Salaah is a single act but it is a combination of both Ibaadah and Ita&#8217;ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now as Maulana Maududi has raised this point that continuous Ita&#8217;ah o f someone is Ibadah. Therefore he says that if a slave lives his life in following Allaah Ta&#8217;ala then the whole life becomes Ibadah. But it is apparent by relying on the view of Al Qura&#8217;an this whole life will not be Ibaadah whatsoever, but will be Ita&#8217;ah of the slave acts upon the orders of Allaah ta&#8217;ala, then he has followed for his whole life and this is worthy of being rewarded for which he will be rewarded (Insha&#8217;Allaah). But it will not be called Ibaadah, This is the right conclusion of meaning.</p>

Urdu post made by brother Tariq Ali in noortv mailing list (which is transcript of speech made by Shaykh SafiurRahman Mubarakpuri rahimahullah).</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>An extract from letter of Shaykh Ibn Baz to Al-Mawdudy rahimahumullah concerning the difference between &#8216;Ibadah (worship) and obedience</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the name of Allah, the most Gracious, the most Merciful</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An extract from my letter I sent to His Excellency Shaykh Abu Al-A`la Al-Mawdudy concerning the difference between `Ibadah (worship) and obedience</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On 2/4//1392 AH, Abu Al-A`la Al-Mawdudy sent me a letter no. 1526, dated 2 Safar, 1392 A.H. explaining his case and Tufayl&#8217;s, his successor in the leadership of Islamic Group. I replied in the same year when I was the president of the Islamic university in Medinah and the following is some of my reply:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some brothers from Milbar living in the country told me that Your Eminence see that `Ibadah is clarified by obedience and that when someone obeys another, he worships him. `Ibadah is also interpreted as enslavement and idolization. Furthermore, Sheikh `Umar ibn Ahmad Al-Millibary, owner of Al-Salsabil Magazine, wrote to me concerning this issue asserting what is mentioned about you and the Group. He sent me a copy of a survey pertaining to this question. You will find an enclosed copy of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This question appears strange for me so I determined to write to you before I receive your letter to know whether these statements which are attributed to you are true. So, please let me know your opinion. I see that obedience has a wider scope than `Ibadah. Every act of `Ibadah a person does in compliance with Allah&#8217;s Shari`ah is seen as obedience, but not every act of obedience to anything other than Allah (may He be Exalted) is seen as `Ibadah. This matter needs more elaboration. Obedience to Allah (may He be Exalted) is seen as `Ibadah when a person seeks to please Him. However, it may be valid or corrupt depending on whether the requirements of `Ibadah are met.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Please tell me in details your view on this question. It adds further explanation that `Ibadah may be denied by when tainted with Shirk as Allah says concerning Mushrik (one who associates others with Allah in His Divinity or worship),(Surah Al-Kafirun, 109: 3) Nor will you worship that which I worship. `Ibadah is negated because of their acts of Shirk. It is known that they worship Allah (may He be Exalted) during times of hardships through showing Tawhid, performing Hajj and `Umrah, offering Sadaqah and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since these acts of `Ibadah are spoiled by Shirk, disbelief in the Hereafter and other kinds of disbelief during times of prosperity, it is permissible to negate the `Ibadah of people who show it. Furthermore, I would like to explain another point. The person who obeys the authorities or rulers in something forbidden by Allah (may He be Exalted) is not seen worshipping them when he does not believe in the permissibility of obedience to anyone in something opposing Allah&#8217;s Shari`ah. They rather obey these rules out of fear of their evils or vain desires while they know that they are sinful. Due to their act of obedience, such persons are sinners, not Mushriks, unless they obey such rulers in matters which involve Shirk. Examples of these matters include striking, killing, and taking someone&#8217;s money unjustly. There are many other examples that come under this heading. I think this view is known by the people of knowledge whose status is below yours. I find it imperative to ask you about this and know your detailed opinion so that I can refute any claim against you and support you with sure knowledge and show the truth concerning the Islamic Group to any one who seeks it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If what is attributed to you is true, we can discuss it thoroughly and examine the problematic issues using the evidence. The truth is the long-sought aim of everyone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah (may He be Exalted) to grant us success to do what pleases Him and to comprehend His Religion and to adhere to it. May Allah purify our hearts and deeds and make the truth our long-sought aim wherever we are, for He is the Most Generous! As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What is the correct methodology for advising, particularly with regard to advising the rulers? Is it by publicising their evil actions from their evil actions from the mimbars or by advising them in private? I would like to know what the correct methodology is concerning this matter?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Infallibility is not for anyone except Allaah’s Messenger . Rulers are humans and they make errors. So no doubt they have errors and mistakes, as they are not infallible. But do not make their errors a reason for you to publicise them and remove yourself from obeying them, even if they may be oppressive and unjust  ,and even if they may be sinful, so long as they do not commit clear disbelief. This is that the Prophet commanded us.</p>

<td>This is the Creed of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah with respect to the Muslim ruler. The author of Al-‘Aqeedah at-Tahaawiyyah said:“And we do not hold it permissible to rebel against our Imaams and our leaders, even if they may be oppressive. Nor do we supplicate against them or remove ourselves from obedience to them. And we hold that obeying them is part of obeying Allaah and hence an obligation so long as they do not order (us) commit sins. We supplicate to Allaah for them that He grant them rectification and pardon.”This is the same belief that the callers to truth are upon to this very day. These same words and those that bear a similar meaning to it were constantly repeated by our teacher, Shaykh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin ‘Abdillaah bin Baaz, may Allaah have mercy on him, in his classes and lectures.</td>

<td>He is referring to the hadeeth of ‘Ubaadah bin as-Saamit (radhiyAllaahu anh) in which he said:“The Prophet summoned us and so we gave him the oath of allegiance that we would hear and obey (the leader) in matters that we liked and matters that we disliked and in things that were hard upon us and things that were easy upon us, and (that we would give him) preference over ourselves. And that we would not oppose the authority of the leader unless we notice him having open disbelief, for which you would have a clear proof from Allaah against him.”(Fath-ul-Baaree: 13/5)</td>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad added to this in his narration:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And if you believe that you have some justification in the matter (i.e. of rebelling), do no act upon this suspicion. Rather, just hear and obey until it reaches you, without removing yourself from the obedience.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is further addition in the report of Ibn Hibbaan and Ahmad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“&#8230;even if they take your wealth and beat your back.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Fath-ul-Baaree: 13/8)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if they have sins and commit oppression and injustice, then indeed having patience while obeying them  keeps the unity, maintains unification of the Muslims, and protects the lands of the Muslims. Furthermore, there are great evils that result from in opposing them and seceding from them, which are greater than the evils that (may) come from them. So there will occur greater evil –</p>

<td>The Shaykh, may Allaah preserve him, is referring to the hadeeth of the Ibn ‘Abbaas (radhiyAllaahu anh) in which he narrated that the Prophet said:“Whoever sees in his leader something that he dislikes, then let him be patient with it, for indeed, whoever splits away from the Jamaa’ah (unified group) even an inch, and then dies, he does not die except the death of some in the Days of Ignorance.”(Reported by Al-Bukhaaree (7054); See Fath-ul-Baaree (13/5))And he is also referring to the hadeeth of Anas bin Maalik (radhiyAllaahu anh) in which the Prophet said:“You will indeed see things after me that you will disapprove of.”</p>
<p>So they said:“What do you order us to do with them, O Messenger of Allaah?”</p>
<p>He replied:“Give them (i.e. the leaders) their rights and ask Allaah for your rights.”</p>

<td>Such as the rallies and demonstrations that have appeared in some of the neighbouring countries. These demonstrations are from the practices of the disbelievers , and not from the Muslims.

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; than that which comes from them in the first place, so long as this evil (on their part) is less than disbelief (Kufr) and polytheism (Shirk). We are not saying that one should remain silent at the errors that come out from the rulers. No, rather they should be corrected. But they must be corrected in a pure way, by advising them privately, and writing to them in private. By writing to them, we don’t mean that which is written down, passed through the hands of a group of individuals and then spread amongst the people. This is not permissible. Rather, a confidential letter, should be written, in which there is advice –</p>

<td>(This is the methodology of the Salaf with regard to advising the rulers – that it be private and concealed so that there is no room for self-amazement (riyaa) to enter. And in these circumstances, it is much more likely that they (i.e. the leaders) will accept the advice and that Allaah will accept the (good) deed. We will mention some of the texts and narrations regarding this later.)</td>

</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">,and handed over to the ruler or read to him orally. As for a letter that is written, then photocopied, then distributed to the people, then this act is not permissible because it is publicising (his errors), and it is just like speaking against him from the mimbar. In fact, it is worse because it is possible for a person to forget a speech, but as for a written letter, it remains and passes through hands. So this is not from the truth. The Prophet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Religion is sincerity (advice). The Religion is sincerity (advice). The Religion is sincerity (advice).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“To who, O Messenger of Allah?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“To Allaah, His Book, His Messenger, the leaders of the Muslims and their common folk.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Reported by Muslim (55))</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the hadeeth, it states:<br />
“Verily Allaah is pleased with three things for you and He is displeased with three things for you. He is pleased that you (1) worship Him and not associate anything (in worship) with Him; and that (2) you hold tight onto the Rope of Allaah, all of you together, and not be divided, and that (3) you mutually advise he whom Allaah gives authority of your affairs.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Saheeh: An authentic hadeeth reported by Ahmad (2/367) and Maalik in Al-Muwatta (2/756) with the verification of ‘Abdul-Baaqee.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people most fitting and qualified to advise the rulers are the scholars, the members of legal and consultative decisions, and those responsible for making decisions and problem-solving. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When there comes to them some matter touching (public) safety or fear, they make it known (among the people). But if Only they had referred it to the Messenger or to those charged with authority amongst them, the proper investigators would have understood it from them (directly).And had it not been for the Grace and Mercy of Allaâh upon you, You would have followed Shaitân (Satan), except for a few (from you).<br />
(Surah an-Nisaa: 83)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So not everybody is fit to do this. And disseminating and publicising their errors is not from advising at all. Rather, it is from spreading evil and wickedness amongst those who believe. And it is not from the methodology of the Salaf As-Saalih, even if the intention of the one who does it may be good and pure, such as for the sake of forbidding an evil, according to his view. However, what he did is a greater evil than that which he is forbidding. Therefore, forbidding an evil may be evil in itself if it is done in a way other than what Allaah and His Messenger have legislated.</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<div>Quote:</div>
<table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6">

<tr>
<td>Shaykh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah) said:“Gentleness is a way towards commanding good and forbidding evil. This is why it is said: “Let your commanding of good be good, and your forbidding of evil not evil.”And since commanding good and forbidding evil are from the greatest of obligatory and recommended acts, the benefit derived from it must always outweigh the evil&#8230; Rather, everything that Allaah commanded us with is in fact good. Allaah has praised good and the doers of good, and He has condemned evil and the doers of evil in many places (of the Qur’aan). So in the case where commanding good and forbidding evil will only bring about greater corruption, it is something that Allaah has not commanded, even if it results in a person abandoning an obligation and committing a prohibition, since the believer is only required to fear Allaah with regard to Allaah’s servants, and it is not upon him to guide.”(Al-Amr bil-Ma’roof wan-Nahee ‘anil-Munkar (pg. 19)This is since this person has not followed the legislated way of the Prophet, which he described when he said:“Whoever amongst you sees an evil, then let him change it with his hand. But if he is not able to, then with his tongue. And if he is not able to, then with his heart, and this is the weakest of Faith.”</p>
<p>(Reported by Muslim (49))</td>

</div>
<p id="post_message_257561" style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah’s Messenger divided people into three categories: Amongst them is he who able is able to terminate the evil with his hand, and he is the one in authority, such as the ruler and those entrusted with authority, such as committees, governors and leaders. The second type is the scholar who because he has no authority, forbids (evil) by explaining and advising with wisdom and fair admonition, and by advising those in authority in a wise manner. The third category consists of those who have no knowledge or authority. They should forbid the evil with their hearts, by hating it and by hating and withdrawing away from those who do it.</p>
