<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Shaytaan</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is held to be a strong external reason, which causes eemaan to decrease. Shaytaan is a vehement enemy to the believers. He awaits calamities to afflict them. He has no desire or goal other than to jolt the eemaan in the hearts of the believers and to weaken and corrupt it. Whoever submits to the whisperings of Shaytaan, complies with his notions and does not retreat to Allaah for refuge from him, his eemaan weakens and decreases. Indeed, it may disappear in its entirety depending on the Muslim’s response to such whisperings and notions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is for this reason that Allaah has warned us of Shaytaan in the sternest sense and He has clarified his dangers, the detrimental consequences of following him as well as the fact that he is an enemy to the believers. Allaah ordered the believers to take him as an enemy and therefore deliver themselves from him and his whisperings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8230;يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تَتَّبِعُوا خُطُوَاتِ الشَّيْطَانِ ۚ وَمَن يَتَّبِعْ خُطُوَاتِ الشَّيْطَانِ فَإِنَّهُ يَأْمُرُ بِالْفَحْشَاءِ وَالْمُنكَرِ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“O you who believe! Do not follow the footsteps of Shaytaan, and whosoever follows the footsteps of Shaytaan, then, verily he</b> (i.e., Shaytaan)<b> commands Fahshaa’ </b>(i.e., to commit indecency and lewdness, etc.)<b> and al-Munkar</b> (i.e., disbelief, shirk, to do evil and wicked deeds, to speak or to do what is forbidden in Islaam, etc.)<b>…”</b></span> [Soorah an-Noor (24):21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِنَّ الشَّيْطَانَ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ فَاتَّخِذُوهُ عَدُوًّا ۚ إِنَّمَا يَدْعُو حِزْبَهُ لِيَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ السَّعِيرِ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“Surely, Shaytaan is an enemy to you, so treat him as an enemy. He only invites his hizb </b>(followers)<b> that they may become the dwellers of the blazing Fire.”</b></span> [Soorah Faatir (35):6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِنَّ الشَّيْطَانَ لِلْإِنسَانِ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌ&#8230;</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#008000;">“Verily! Shaytaan is to man an open enemy!”</span> </b>[Soorah Yoosuf (12):5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>اسْتَحْوَذَ عَلَيْهِمُ الشَّيْطَانُ فَأَنسَاهُمْ ذِكْرَ اللَّهِ ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ حِزْبُ الشَّيْطَانِ ۚ أَلَا إِنَّ حِزْبَ الشَّيْطَانِ هُمُ الْخَاسِرُونَ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“Shaytaan has taken hold of them. So he has made them forget the remembrance of Allaah. They are the party of Shaytaan. Verily, it is the party of Shaytaan that will be the losers!”</b></span> [Soorah al-Mujaadilah (58): 19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Jawzee says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Hence it is an obligation upon the sane person to be on his guard against this enemy, who has manifested his enmity since the time of Aadam. He has sacrificed his life and self in corrupting the circumstances of the children of Aadam and Allaah has ordered one to be cautious of him…” He then mentioned a number of such texts and then said: “The like of this in the Qur’aan is abundant.” [Talbees Iblees, pg. 23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Muhammad al-Maqdasee says in the introduction of his book Dhamm al-Waswaas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“To proceed, Allaah has indeed made Shaytaan an enemy to man. He sits in wait against him along the straight path and comes to him from every direction and way, as Allaah has related from him that he said:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>قَالَ فَبِمَا أَغْوَيْتَنِي لَأَقْعُدَنَّ لَهُمْ صِرَاطَكَ الْمُسْتَقِيمَ ثُمَّ لَآتِيَنَّهُم مِّن بَيْنِ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمِنْ خَلْفِهِمْ وَعَنْ أَيْمَانِهِمْ وَعَن شَمَائِلِهِمْ ۖ وَلَا تَجِدُ أَكْثَرَهُمْ شَاكِرِينَ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“Surely I will sit in wait against them on Your Straight Path. Then I will come to them from before them and behind them, from their right and from their left, and You will not find most of them as being grateful ones (i.e., they will not be dutiful to You).”</b></span> [Soorah al-A’raaf (7):16-17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further, Allaah has warned us against following him and commanded us to possess animosity towards him and to oppose him, He said:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِنَّ الشَّيْطَانَ لِلْإِنسَانِ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌ&#8230;</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“Verily! Shaytaan is to man an open enemy!”</b></span> [Soorah Yoosuf (12):5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8230;يَا بَنِي آدَمَ لَا يَفْتِنَنَّكُمُ الشَّيْطَانُ كَمَا أَخْرَجَ أَبَوَيْكُم مِّنَ الْجَنَّةِ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“O Children of Aadam! Do not let Shaytaan deceive you, as when he brought your parents </b>(i.e., Aadam and Hawwaa’)<b> out of Paradise…”</b></span> [Soorah al-A’raaf (7):27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah informed us of what he did with our parents as a way of cautioning us from obeying him and also to cut short any excuse for having followed him and Allaah commanded us to follow the straight path …” [Dhamm al-Waswaas, pg.46. Also refer to Ibn al-Qayyim’s introduction of his own book Ighaathah al-Lahfaan, 1/10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, Shaytaan is an enemy to man. His desire is to corrupt the beliefs and to wreak havoc on one’s eemaan. Whoever does not fortify himself from him through remembrance of Allaah, resorting back to Allaah and seeking refuge with Him, will become a breeding ground for Shaytaan, who will lure him to actions of disobedience, entice him to perpetrate prohibited matters and push him to embark upon lewd sins. What a perish of his religion and what a corruption of his eemaan will it be if man submits to him!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy upon him, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Beware of enabling Shaytaan to establish himself in the very home of your thoughts and intentions, as he will corrupt them in such a manner that will make difficult its correction thereafter. He will cast all sort of whisperings and harmful thoughts at you and he will prevent you from thinking about what may benefit you and it is you who have aided him against yourself by empowering him over your heart and thoughts and he then placed you in the possession of such thoughts.”</strong></span> [Al-Fawaa’id, pg. 309]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, may Allaah have mercy upon him, put forward an excellent similitude in this regard, which lies in total agreement. He says in another excerpt from his book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“If you would like a consistent example for this, then his parable is that of a dog that is extremely famished; between you and the dog is a piece of meat or bread. He looks attentively at you and sees you not opposing him and he is so close to you. You drive him away and yell out at him and yet the dog refuses but to hover round you in circles and to try to deceive you with regard to what you possess in your hand.”</span></strong> [At-Tibyaan fee Aqsaam al-Qur’aan, pg. 419]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His intention, may Allaah have mercy upon him, behind this parable is to demonstrate the scope of Shaytaan’s danger to man if he does not seek refuge with Allaah from him and fails to retreat back to Allaah for refuge from his evil, through beneficial words of supplication and blessed forms of remembrance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, whoever turns away and is instead averse to that, Shaytaan will cling to him in this way in which he will tempt and dictate to him until he eradicates his eemaan. Allaah says:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يَعْشُ عَن ذِكْرِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ نُقَيِّضْ لَهُ شَيْطَانًا فَهُوَ لَهُ قَرِينٌ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَيَصُدُّونَهُمْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُم مُّهْتَدُونَ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا جَاءَنَا قَالَ يَا لَيْتَ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكَ بُعْدَ الْمَشْرِقَيْنِ فَبِئْسَ الْقَرِينُ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#008000;">“And whosoever turns away </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(blinds himself)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;"> from the remembrance of the Most Beneficent </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(i.e., this Qur’aan and worship of Allaah)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;">, We appoint for him a shaytaan to be a Qareen </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(i.e., an intimate companion)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;"> to him. And verily, they </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(i.e., shaytaans)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;"> hinder them from the Path </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(of Allaah)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;">, whilst they think that they are guided aright! Till, when </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(such a)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;"> one comes to Us, he says </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(to his qareen)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;">, ‘Would that between me and you were the distance of the two Easts </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(or the East and West)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;">, a worst </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(type of)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;"> companion </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(you are indeed)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;">!”</span></b>[Soorah az-Zukhruf (43):36-38]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Explanation of the Creed of the Salaf</strong>,  by Imaam Abee Uthmaan Ismaa’eel bin Abdir-Rahmaan As-Saaboonee,<em>rahimahullaah</em>, as explained by our noble sheikh al-Allaamah Rabee’ bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee, <em>hafidhahullaah</em>.</p>
<p>Audio Lecture by: <strong>Abu Muhammad al Maghribee</strong> (<em>hafidhahullaah)</em></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Chapter 28: The Whisperings of the Devils (Shayaateen)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>[The below is the text from the Book]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[134] The People of Hadeeth believe that Allah, The One free from all deficiencies, Created the devils with the characteristic of whispering to mankind and they intend their downfall, so they lie in wait for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَإِنَّ الشَّيَاطِينَ لَيُوحُونَ إِلَىٰ أَوْلِيَائِهِمْ لِيُجَادِلُوكُمْ ۖ وَإِنْ أَطَعْتُمُوهُمْ إِنَّكُمْ لَمُشْرِكُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Indeed the devils do inspire their friends to dispute with you and if you obey them, then indeed you will become an polytheist.&#8221;</span> (Sooratul-An&#8217;aam 6:121)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[135] Allaah empowers them (the devils ) over whomsoever He wishes and He protects whomsoever He wishes from their plots and deceptions. Allaah The Most Mighty and Majestic says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَاسْتَفْزِزْ مَنِ اسْتَطَعْتَ مِنْهُم بِصَوْتِكَ وَأَجْلِبْ عَلَيْهِم بِخَيْلِكَ وَرَجِلِكَ وَشَارِكْهُمْ فِي الْأَمْوَالِ وَالْأَوْلَادِ وَعِدْهُمْ ۚ وَمَا يَعِدُهُمُ الشَّيْطَانُ إِلَّا غُرُورًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إِنَّ عِبَادِي لَيْسَ لَكَ عَلَيْهِمْ سُلْطَانٌ ۚ وَكَفَىٰ بِرَبِّكَ وَكِيلًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And Istafziz [literally means: befool them gradually] those whom you can among them with your voice (i.e. songs, music, and any other call for Allah&#8217;s disobedience), make assaults on them with your cavalry and your infantry, mutually share with them wealth and children (by tempting them to earn money by illegal ways usury, etc., or by committing illegal sexual intercourse, etc.), and make promises to them.&#8221; But Satan promises them nothing but deceit.Verily! My slaves (i.e the true believers of Islamic Monotheism), you have no authority over them. And All-Sufficient is your Lord as a Guardian.</span>(Sooratul-Israa 17:64-65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إِنَّهُ لَيْسَ لَهُ سُلْطَانٌ عَلَى الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ<br />
إِنَّمَا سُلْطَانُهُ عَلَى الَّذِينَ يَتَوَلَّوْنَهُ وَالَّذِينَ هُم بِهِ مُشْرِكُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Verily! He has no power over those who believe and put their trust only in their Lord (Allah).His power is only over those who obey and follow him (Satan), and those who join partners with Him (Allah)</span>  (Sooratul-Nahl 16:99-100)</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Note: at 5:14 it should say &#8220;..and then Allaah cured him through this way.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Translated by Yasin Abu Ibrahim.<br />
Translation checked by Raha ibn Donald Batts</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">A man has been afflicted by Waswaas Qahree (compulsive whisperings). So what is your advice? May Allaah preserve you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Sulaymaan bin Saleemullaah ar-Ruhaylee:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a way from the ways of Iblees (Shaytaan). And the principle regarding Waswaas is that it is a proof for the righteousness of the servant and the soundness of the heart. For verily, when Shaytaan sees that the servant is righteous and that he (Shaytaan) is not able to defeat him by way of actions, he starts whispering to him. This is why when this (affair of Waswaas) was mentioned to the Prophet -sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam– he said: “All praise is due to Allaah Who has reduced the plot of Shaytaan to al-Waswasah (whispering).” He (Shaytaan) wasn&#8217;t able to overcome us, so he came to us with Waswaas. And he (the Prophet) said: “That is a clear sign of faith.” This is the essence of Waswaas. Meaning: if Waswaas takes place, then that is a proof for this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But this doesn&#8217;t mean that we praise those who are afflicted by Waswaas. For verily, answering to Waswaas is evil. It is obligatory to avoid and stay away from it. And those who are afflicted by Waswaas are of two categories.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The first category:</strong></span> that the Waswaas does not overpower him. Rather it comes to him and goes away. This is cured through making a lot of isti&#8217;aadhah (seeking refuge with Allaah). He seeks refuge with Allaah from it and he spits to his left side. And he recites the Qur&#8217;aan and the Ahaadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">The second category:</span></strong> that the Waswaas is so much that it overpowers him. And this cannot be cured by any action, because the more actions he does, the more his Waswaas increases. Even if he recites Qur&#8217;aan, his Waswaas increases! So how is it cured? The Fuqahaa&#8217; say that it is cured by completely turning away from it. What does this mean? It means that you do not perform anything because of it or leave off anything because of it. Even if it comes to you, consider it a crazy person speaking from behind you, while you are certain that he does not harm you. And do not perform anything because of it or leave off anything because of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people, when Waswaas comes to them, they open the Qur&#8217;aan to recite it. Then Iblees becomes (even more) eager in (overpowering) him, so he starts whispering to him with regards to the Qur&#8217;aan. He gets up and prays, so he (Shaytaan) whispers to him in his prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And do not leave off anything because of it! If you are reading the Qur&#8217;aan and Shaytaan comes to you whispering, then do NOT leave off reciting the Qur&#8217;aan, rather continue! Leave it whenever YOU want to leave it. As for leaving it because of the Waswaas, then don&#8217;t. If you do this and you are patient&#8230; KNOW that this issue requires patience, because Iblees comes to the person who is afflicted with Waswaas in the form of an advisor, someone who has pity. In the prayer (Shaytaan says): “This is the prayer! And the prayer is the connection between the servant and his Lord! And if your prayer is nullified, then what remains for you? Beware! Leave (the prayer) and go perform Wudoo!” (He does this) in order to corrupt his prayer. And he is not an advisor, rather he is Iblees! So this requires patience. Be patient!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If Waswaas comes to you in Wudoo, then perform your Wudoo and leave. If Iblees then comes to you and says: “There remains something!” Then say: “There remains nothing.” Do not pay attention to him! And go pray! By Allaah, it will not harm you! By Allaah, it will not harm you. You are reciting the Qur&#8217;aan and Iblees comes to you whispering? Continue! And leave him (Iblees)! Continue reciting! By Allaah, it will not harm you! In fact, you will be rewarded! Because you are performing Jihaad against Iblees. Then Iblees will becomes hopeless of you and leave this door (of Waswaas), and he will start looking for another door.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, O brothers, the likes of this brother about whom it is said that he has Waswaas Qahree, meaning: the Waswaas overpowers him, the ONLY cure for him is completely turning away. And the meaning of completely turning away, is that he has CERTAINTY that it does not harm him, and that Allaah is Ever-Merciful, and that it is not possible that Allaah punishes his servants because of this, and that this isn&#8217;t from the religion! Allaah says: <strong>“And He has not laid upon you in religion any hardship&#8230;”</strong> (22:78) How can it be from the religion that a person has to perform Wudoo seventy times?! [unclear] So you should know this and be certain of it, and that’s it! You do what the people do, and you turn away. And you continue in your act and you don&#8217;t leave it because of Waswaas. And do not perform anything because of Waswaas. By Allaah, with the permission of Allaah he will be cured. And we know this by experience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By Allaah, O brothers. A man came to me and Shaytaan used to always whisper to him with regards to his wife, that he is divorcing her. And if he goes with her to her family, and he says to her: “Go to your family,” then Iblees comes to him and says: “You just divorced her.” Sometimes he used to call me at two o&#8217;clock at night and three o&#8217;clock at night and say: “O Shaykh, right now she is next to me in bed, is she my wife or have I divorced her?” In the beginning we said to him: “Keep yourself busy with the remembrance of Allaah, until you leave this affair.” So he started keeping himself busy with the remembrance of Allaah, and then Iblees started coming to him; whenever he said “Subhaanallaah”, then Iblees said: “No! You are indirectly saying you have divorced her.” And whenever he said “Allaahu akbar”, then Iblees said: “You are indirectly saying you have divorced her! And this is a matter of honor!” When we saw that the affair became severe, we advised him to turn away (from this Waswaas). Then he used to turn away for a while and then return (to his state of Waswaas). He sometimes came to my house, and I used to throw him out of my house. Because as long as he knows that there is someone who can give him comfort, then he will continue with his Waswaas. But we gave him the principle. After a while, and to Allaah belongs all praise and blessing, his life became stable and this Waswaas was completely gone from him, because he was firm upon this principle. And I know many people, one of them had Waswaas for more than twenty years! And he came to us, so we advised him and we were patient with him for a while, and then Allaah cured through this way. So my advice to the brother is that he acts upon what I have mentioned, and Allaah knows best.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Did you break wind or was it Shaytân pulling a hair?<br />
Also, how to prevent any waswasah in regards to urine-drops</span></strong></span></p>
</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Gasses during prayer or Shaytan pulling a hair from your back?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sa&#8217;id al-Khudri (radhiya Allahu &#8216;anh) reported that the prophet (salla Allahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8220;The devil may approach one of you during Salah, and pull a hair from your back. <strong>If the man were to imagine that his ablution had been broken</strong>, <span style="color:#ff6600;"><strong>he should not leave his prayer</strong></span>, unless he should hear a sound or perceive a smell.&#8221; (Recorded by Abu Dawud)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Waswasah: The whispering of the Shaitan, p. 44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>What to do in order to prevent any Waswasah in regards to urine drops after answering the call of nature?:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Abu Muhammad bin Qudamah al-Maqdisi said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It is recommended to sprinkle one&#8217;s private part and trousers with water after urinating (in the toilet), in order to prevent any waswasah. And so, if one finds any wetness in his clothing, he would say: &#8220;This is the water that I sprinkled there.&#8221; al-Hakam bin Sufyan at-Thaqafi (radhiya Allahu &#8216;anh) reported that when the prophet (salla Allahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) urinated, he performed ablution and sprinkled water on his private parts.&#8221; (Recorded by Abu Dawud)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Ibid, p. 44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These two gems are great reliefs for those who are affected by the whispers of Shaytân. You will see them remaking Wudhu&#8217; and prayers for several hours and in the end they even imagine that they have the disease of a 60 year old man, while just a month or two ago before they started to pray, they were totally healthy.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The believer is put to trial by the whisperings of the Devil and disbelieving thoughts that makes him feel bad/distress. The companions used to say: &#8220;Oh Messenger of Allâh! o­ne of us feels something of such a nature that he would rather fall down from the heaven than to utter it.&#8221; He (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam): &#8220;That is true faith&#8221; (Ahmad 2/397 and Muslim 1/83)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that these whispers and thoughts one feels, while one hates them and repels them from the heart, is part of true faith. This can be likened to the warrior who fights his enemy until he overpowers him. <strong>This is the greatest type of Jihâd and a faith that is as pure as pure milk</strong>. And the reason as to why it is pure, is that one hates and fights the devilish thoughts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All creatures are subjected to these thoughts and whisperings. There are those humans that answer them and they then become disbelievers or hypocrites. And there are those whom have fallen so deeply into sins and desires, that they are first affected by these thoughts when they start to seek the religion. So the person either becomes a believer or a hypocrite. Thus, the humans often tend to get these whispers when they perform the prayer. The Devil will most often come when the servant wants to turn to his Lord and come closer to Him and have contact with Him. That is why the praying ones get thoughts that the non-praying ones do not.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Purity and Ostentation</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Many times a person thinks about doing a good deed and then Satan comes to him and whispers to him, saying, &#8220;You are doing that ostentatiously, to be seen of men and for a good reputation.&#8221; Therefore, he makes us go away from the good deed. How can one remain free of such occurrences?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Response: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One can remain free of such occurrences by seeking refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan, as well as by continually performing good deeds. He should not pay attention to such whisperings that make him stop doing good deeds. If he turns away from such whisperings and seeks refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan, such whisperings will stop by the permission of Allah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: The questioner says that she has a sister who complains about obsessive insinuations, especially while performing ablution. She requests His Eminence Shaikh to guide her to the best way which, by Allah&#8217;s Permission, will relieve her from this anxiety. </span> (Question no. 1, tape no. 247)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Many people, men and women, complain about the obsessive misgivings. The treatment of this disease is to <strong>seek refuge with Allah</strong> (Most Exalted be He) from Satan, because it is one of his manifold wicked insinuations and one of his plots.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is well-known that Satan is the open enemy of Allah, about whom He (Most Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Surely, Shaitân </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Satan)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> is an enemy to you, so take </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(treat)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> him as an enemy. He only invites his Hizb </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(followers)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> that they may become the dwellers of the blazing Fire</span></strong>&#8220;. (Surah Fatir, 35: 6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Most Exalted and Sublime be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;And if an evil whisper from Shaitân (Satan) tries to turn you away (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) (from doing good), then seek refuge in Allâh. Verily, He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower&#8221;. </strong></span>(Surah Fussilat, 41: 36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the treatment of this disease is to seek refuge with Allah from Satan, the outcast, while performing ablution, during prayer and in all other situations. Whenever one feels the evil misgivings, he should seek refuge with Allah from Satan by saying: I seek refuge with Allah from Satan, the outcast, and one should have strong will and sincerity to get rid of these misgivings and should have hope in Allah (Most Exalted and Sublime be He).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In order to fight against this enemy, one need <strong>strong will </strong>and <strong>sincerity</strong>, and be sure that no one saves man from Satan except Allah, Who is All-Omnipotent to do all things (Most Exalted be He). Therefore, it is the duty of all Muslims, men and women, to resort to Allah (Most Exalted be He) with sincerity and seek His Help to save them from this enemy whenever they feel these evil misgivings and in all other situations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The believer should seek help and support from Allah (Most Exalted be He) by saying: <em>O Lord, protect me from Satan and from his insinuations! O Lord, keep me away from his evil! O Allah, save me from his evil temptations and wicked thoughts.</em> One should ask his Lord and seek help from Allah, and Allah (Most Exalted be He) will protect him so long as the servant is sincere in his supplication. Allah (Most Exalted be He) says: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Call upon Me; I will respond to you</strong></span>. Allah does not break His Promise (Most Exalted and Sublime be He). However, man might not be serious in seeking help from Allah, and thus become heedless and call upon Allah without sincerity. Thus, there has to be sincerity and true desire in seeking the protection of Allah (Most Exalted be He). The person should resort to Allah and wholly submit himself to Him with complete faithfulness and hope in order to gain protection from this open enemy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If someone performs ablution he <strong>should not repeat</strong> his ablution due to devilish insinuations. Likewise, he should not repeat his prayer because of such insinuations. He should full trust that his ablution and prayer are valid and should not repeat any part of them due to Satan&#8217;s insinuations. For, if he inclines to obey Satan and repeats ablution or the prayer, then the enemy of Allah will prompt him with more evil temptations. Thus, whenever you perform ablution and you are confident that you have fulfilled all its requirements, then do not let doubt creep into your heart. Fear Allah and do not repeat some or all of its acts. Do not respond to the misgivings of Satan. The same should be done with regard to prayer which you should complete with no insinuations as having made mistakes therein. Do the same thing in every similar situation in which you withstand the misgivings of the enemy of Allah and beat him.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Question</strong> : A Muslim sister asks about the ruling on turning one&#8217;s head during Salah to seek refuge in Allah from the devil called Khanzab (a devil that distracts a servant at the time of prayer)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: There is no harm in turning the head during Salah seeking refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan when casting his insinuations. Rather, it is desirable when there is a dire need for it on condition that it is done by moving one&#8217;s head only, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) ordered ‘Uthman ibn Abul-‘As Ath-Thaqafi (may Allah be pleased with him) to do so when he complained to the Prophet about the insinuating thoughts that Satan casts during prayers, so he ordered him <strong>to spit (dryly) to his left side three times and seek refuge in Allah from Satan</strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">.</span>[1] He did so and Allah granted him recovery.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for turning one&#8217;s head during performing Salah without a due reason, this is undesirable. When the Prophet (peace be upon him) was asked about this, he said: It is a quick stealing by which Satan takes away (a portion) from the prayer of a person (By making him glance left and right). May Allah guide us all to what pleases Him! He is All-Hearing and Responsive.</p>
