<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q3: What is the ruling on amulets consisting of the Qur’an and other things? </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullah):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Amulets that consist of other than the Qur’an such as bones, talismans, cowrie shells, wolf’s hair and the like are all evil and Haram (prohibited) by the Nas (Islamic text from the Qur’an or the Sunnah)</strong></span>. It is not permissible to hang them on anybody or anything, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “Anyone who wears an amulet, may Allah not fulfill it (i.e., their purpose) for them, and whoever wears a cowrie shell, may Allah not give them peace.” And in another narration, he (peace be upon him) said, “Anyone who wears an amulet has committed Shirk (associated others with Allah in His Divinity or worship).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, if amulets consist of the Qur’an or well­known good supplications, this is a controversial matter among the scholars. Some say that such amulets are permissible. This opinion was reported from a group of the Salaf (righteous predecessors) who likened it to recitation (of some Qur’anic Ayahs and supplications) over sick people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Others say that it is not permissible. This opinion is supported by ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud and Hudhaifah (may Allah be pleased with them both). A group of the Salaf and the righteous successors said it is not permissible to tie amulets even if they are from the Qur’an in accordance with the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>principle of Sadd­ul­Dhara’i (blocking the means leading to sins)</strong> </span>and to forestall acts of Shirk and to act upon the general meaning of the Hadiths. This is because the Hadiths that prohibit amulets are general and make no exception. Muslims should abide by the general ruling. Therefore, it is basically not permissible to use any kind of amulets in order not to permit people to use some other types of amulets, thus leading to confusing matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory to prohibit all types of amulets and this is the soundest opinion for the obvious evidence supporting it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If we permit the use of amulets made from the Qur’an and good supplications, it will open the door for people to wear any form of amulets they like</strong></span>. Then, if they are reproved for what they do, they will say that they are amulets consisting of the Qur’an or good supplications. Consequently, the door will be opened, the hole will expand and all types of amulets (whether from the Qur’an or anything else) will be worn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There is another reason for their prohibition, which is the fact that people may enter the bathroom and other unclean places while wearing them</strong></span>. It is well­known that the Words of Allah (the Qur’an) are too sacred to be in such places and it is not appropriate to take them into bathrooms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Ibn Baz Fatwas &#8211; (Part No. 1; Page No. 206,207)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Copper bracelets [1]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[1]This is another answer to a question about copper bracelets made to cure rheumatism</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Abdul-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz to my honorable brother, may Allah safeguard you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have received your noble letter, may Allah be pleased with you. I have also reviewed the enclosed documents on the properties of the copper bracelet recently made to cure rheumatism. I have considered the whole matter more than once and discussed it with a number of university lecturers. We exchanged opinions on the juristic ruling on the copper bracelet in question, but there were different opinions on the matter; some regard it permissible as it has properties of curing rheumatism, whereas others see that it is better not to wear it, on the ground that wearing it is like the practice of the people of Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic time of ignorance), who used to wear copper amulets and bracelets, thinking that they were a cure for many diseases and a reason for the safety of the person wearing them against envy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Uqbah ibn `Amir (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Anyone who wears an amulet, Allah will not fulfill their need, and anyone who wears a seashell, Allah will not give them peace</span>. [1]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to another narration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Anyone who hangs an amulet has committed Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). </span>[2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imran ibn Al-Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) also narrated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) saw a man with a brass bracelet on his hand. He (peace be upon him) asked him, &#8216;What is this?&#8217; The man replied, &#8216;A protection from weakness.&#8217; He (peace be upon him) said, &#8216;Cast it off, for verily it will only increase your weakness; and if you die wearing it, you will never succeed.&#8217; </span>[3]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to another Hadith:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) in one of his journeys sent a messenger to check the camels of the caravan, and ordered the cutting of all string necklaces hung around the necks of the camels which were thought by the people of Jahiliyyah to benefit and protect their camels. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These Hadiths and others show that a Muslim must not wear amulets, bracelets, strings, bones, beads or other things that are used by some people to prevent or remove evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In my opinion, it is better not to wear or use this copper bracelet to block any means to Shirk, and to not let the heart be attached to such things, and to direct Muslims with their hearts toward Allah Alone trustingly and confidently, and to restrict oneself to lawful means that are indisputably permissible. Surely, what Allah has made lawful and accessible is sufficient and dispenses with any need for what is forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) is authentically reported to have said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Anyone who guards themselves against doubtful matters keeps their religion and honor blameless, and anyone who indulges in doubtful matters indulges in unlawful matters, just as a shepherd who pastures his animals around a sanctuary will soon (transgress upon it and) pasture them in it. </span>[4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (peace be upon him) also said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Leave what causes you doubt and turn to what does not cause you doubt. </span>[5]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Undoubtedly, wearing a copper bracelet is similar to what was practiced by the people of Jahiliyyah. Wearing it constitutes either a prohibited matter of Shirk or a means leading to Shirk or at least a doubtful matter.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is better for a Muslim not to wear it and resort to lawful medical treatment. This is the opinion that seems correct to a group of scholars, shaykhs, and myself as well with regard to this issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah (Exalted be He) to guide you and us to what pleases Him, grant us good understanding of His Religion, and protect us against all that opposes His Laws. Indeed, He is Able to do all things. May Allah safeguard you. As-salamu `alaykum.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1 &#8211; Reading Star Signs</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Salih Alaa ash &#8211; Shaykh -hafidhullaah- said :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Whoever reads the page which contains star signs and he knows the star sign of when he was born, or he knows that star sign which is significant for him, and he reads the comments mentioned in that star sign then it is as if he has asked a soothsayer/fortune teller. So his prayer would not be accepted for forty days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he attests to it and believes in that star sign then he has disbelieved in that which was revealed to Muhammad &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- . . .&#8217; (the Shaykh continues saying: ) &#8216;and if he brings home newspapers which contain these type of things then it is as if he brought a soothsayer / fortune teller into his house.&#8217;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzaan -hafidhullaah- said :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;It is not permissible to use magic in the form of acrobatic stunts or circus antics or anything similar to that. Like the one who pulls a car with his hair, or a car is driven over him and does not harm him. . . . . all of this is magical imagery, so it is not allowed to perform it or to be happy with it, nor to attract your friends to do this in front of Muslims. Because it is clear evil, it is obligatory to reject and terminate it and to cleanse the Muslim lands of it . . . if those who go to see magic in the form of acrobatic stunts even though they are not pleased with going to see them, they have carried out something which is prohibited and they are sinful for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If they are pleased with this and they know that this is done by magic then they have fallen into disbelief because of it.&#8217;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3 &#8211; Wearing an Engagement Ring</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This enters under the saying of the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8216;Indeed incantations, amulets and Tiwalah [1] (a form of magic) are Shirk.&#8217;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Ahmad and Abu Dawood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Uthaymeen -rahimullaah &#8211; gave the example that an engagement ring is a Tiwalah and he explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;If the people believe that it can benefit or harm, then with this intention it is from the minor Shirk, and even if this intention is not there &#8211; and this is highly unlikely that he does not have this intention &#8211; it is resemblance of the Christians since it is taken from them.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4 &#8211; Wearing Brass Bracelets to Battle Against Rheumatism</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh AbdulAziz Ibn Baz &#8211; rahimullaah &#8211; said regarding these type of bracelets after having exhausted all the evidences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;The opinion which I hold in this issue is leaving these previously mentioned bracelets and not to use them; this is to block the path leading to Shirk, to terminate the aspect of any Fitnah with these bracelets and to incline to them, also that souls become attached to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, in having the incentive in turning the Muslim with his heart to Allaah -Subhanahu- and to have trust in Him, and reliance on Him sufficing with the means which are in accordance with the Sharia&#8217; and their allowance is well known with committing Shirk.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>

<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5;"><strong>Question</strong>:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ud, may Allaah be pleased with him, said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) say: <em>Verily, incantations, amulets and Tiwalah are Shirk</em>. [1] Jabir, may Allaah be pleased with him, said:I had an uncle who used to treat people with incantations for the scorpion&#8217;s sting. When the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) forbade incantations, he came to him and asked him: O Messenger of Allaah, You have forbidden incantations, and I treat those who are stung by scorpions with incantations. He (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: He who can help his brother, let him do so. [2] How do we compromise between the Hadith which forbids, and that which permits? And what is the ruling on wearing an amulet containing Qur&#8217;anic words on the chest of the affected person?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The forbidden formulas for incantations are those containing Shirk, beseeching other than Allaah, or meaningless words. But incantations that are free from such things, are legitimate, and are among the great means of healing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: <span style="color:#008000;">There is no harm in incantations as long as they do not include Shirk.</span> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: <span style="color:#008000;">He who can help his brother, let him do so.</span>[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said: <span style="color:#008000;">No incantation for other than the envious eye or venomous sting.</span> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means the most affective and beneficial incantation is that which is used in these two cases. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) was himself treated with incantation, and he treated others with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for wearing <strong>amulets</strong> by children and patients, it is not permissible. Such are called <strong>trinkets</strong>. But the most valid opinion is that they are a form of Shirk, and unlawful, because the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: <span style="color:#008000;">He who wears an amulet; may Allaah not help him, and he who wears a shell; may Allaah not protect him.</span> [6] <span style="color:#008000;">He who wears an amulet commits Shirk</span>.[7] And he (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: <span style="color:#008000;">Verily, incantations, amulets and Tiwalah are Shirk.</span> [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars are at variance regarding the legality of wearing <strong>amulets containing Qur&#8217;anic Verses</strong>. The correct verdict is that they are unlawful, for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The general prohibition of wearing any kind of amulets according to the Prophetic traditions whether they contain Qur&#8217;anic Verses or not.</li>
<li>Leaving no room for formulas of Shirk, for if the amulets containing Qur&#8217;anic verses were allowed then they may be confused with the other amulets, and that will keep the door open to Shirk, and all kinds of amulets would be worn on that ground. It is known that closing the door to things that lead to Shirk and evil deeds is one of the greatest judicial objectives. It is Allaah who grants success.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">145- Ruling on hanging supplications on the body</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: Is it permissible to hang some of the Du`a&#8217;s (supplications) which are mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet) on the chest of a man or woman as protection for them from the Jinn (creatures created from fire) and devils? [1]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This is not permissible whether it be from the Qur&#8217;an, Sunnah or anything else. This is called <strong>&#8220;Tama&#8217;im (amulets)&#8221;</strong>, &#8220;<strong>Jami`at</strong>&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>Hujub</strong>&#8221; and it is not permitted to wear or hang them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said about this matter: <span style="color:#000000;">&lt;&lt;</span><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Anyone who ties an amulet, may Allah not fulfill his aim; and anyone who ties a seashell, may Allah not give him peace</span></strong><span style="color:#000000;">&gt;&gt;<b> </b>[2]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (peace be upon him) also said:<span style="color:#000000;"> &lt;&lt;<strong>Ruqyahs (recitations for healing or protection), amulets and love-charms are Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship)</strong>&gt;&gt; [3].</span> Ruqyah here is referring to any words recited that are unknown or involve Shirk or Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect), they are absolutely prohibited! All amulets are prohibited, that is, what is written on a paper or parchment and placed in a piece of cloth or a bag and tied to a child or a sick person, these are all forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This prohibition applies even if the amulets are made of Words of the Qur&#8217;an or lawful Du`a&#8217;s, they are still forbidden, because the correct scholarly opinion is that all amulets are absolutely prohibited. However, there is greater prohibition regarding the amulets which are not made using Words of the Qur&#8217;an. The prohibition of the amulets made using the Qur&#8217;an is to close any of the doors which may lead to sin or Shirk, as a Muslim is obliged to stay away from these acts, so that they do not fall into what Allah (Exalted be He) has made Haram (prohibited). Allah has made lawful for His Servants the things which lead to happiness, well-being and protection. He did not make lawful that which will harm them; rather, He made lawful that which will bring well-being and happiness in this life and the Hereafter. Humans are not permitted to introduce a Bid`ah (innovation in religion); hanging these things constitutes a Bid`ah, even if they contain Qur&#8217;an or Hadiths. The Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade the use of amulets and warned those who wear or hang them that Allah will not fulfill their aim; anyone who ties an amulet or a seashell, Allah will not fulfill their aim of wearing them. It is obligatory on every believing man and woman to protect themselves by reciting the Islamic supplications not by hanging them; supplications for recovery and well-being should be made for the sick and the children. Du`a&#8217; for protection should also be made on their behalf before sleeping by saying: <span style="color:#000000;">&lt;&lt;<strong>I seek refuge for you in the Perfect Words of Allah from the evil of what He has created</strong>&gt;&gt; [4]</span>. This is following the example of the Prophet (peace be upon him) because it is reported that: <span style="color:#000000;">&lt;&lt;<strong>The Prophet (peace be upon him) used to seek refuge with Allah for Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn, by saying, &#8216;I seek refuge for you both in the Perfect Words of Allah, from every devil and every poisonous vermin, and from every evil (envious) eye.&#8217;</strong>&gt;&gt; [5]</span> Muslims must accustom themselves to reciting Adhkar (invocations and Remembrances said at certain times on a regular basis) and supplications for refuge and protection, and should seek refuge with Allah, as long as they are a sane adult, before sleeping, when entering and leaving their house etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point is that there is no need to wear amulets. Some scholars have permitted wearing amulets which contain Qur&#8217;an or lawful invocations, and they said: It is a form of Ruqyah (recitation for healing or protection), and since Ruqyah is lawful if it is using the Qur&#8217;an and lawful supplications, an amulet made using the Qur&#8217;an and supplications is also lawful. The answer is that there is a difference between the two; we have evidence that the prophet (peace be upon him) performed Ruqyah and Ruqyah was performed for him. He (peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#000000;">&lt;&lt;<strong>There is nothing wrong with Ruqyah as long as it does not involve any Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship)</strong>.&gt;&gt; [6]</span> This is evidence of the exception of Islamically lawful Ruqyah (i.e., reciting Qur&#8217;an and saying supplications over the sick seeking healing), which is excluded from his saying: <span style="color:#000000;">&lt;&lt;<strong>Ruqyahs (recitations for healing or protection), amulets and love-charms are Shirk</strong>.&gt;&gt;[7]</span> This is based on the fact that the Prophet (peace be upon him) performed Ruqyah and Ruqyah was performed for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No exceptions were made for amulets and there is no evidence that the Prophet (peace be upon him) hung an amulet on anyone; therefore, it is not permissible to regard amulets the same as Ruqyahs; rather, all amulets are absolutely prohibited. Wearing amulets of the Qur&#8217;an and lawful supplications could lead to wearing all other amulets, while being unaware of which is right and which is wrong, and thus opens the door to Shirk and wearing charms. The Shari`ah (Islamic law) has closed all of the doors which may lead to Shirk, and the Hadiths stated regarding amulets are general and the prohibition applies to all. Closing the doors which may lead to Shirk is an obligation, consequently, this entails prohibiting all amulets, even if they contain Qur&#8217;an or lawful invocations. This is to block the means leading to Shirk and act upon the general meaning of the Hadiths, so that the believer grows accustomed to putting their trust in Allah, relying on Him, supplicating to Him, and asking Him to protect them from all evil and relieve them from any distress, and not to rely on an object which they wear around their neck or anywhere else.</p>
<p>The teachings of the Shari`ah sufficiently contain all goodness and well-being, for the young and old, sick and healthy. May Allah grant everyone success and guidance!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">There are some people who write amulets for sick, insane, and psychiatric patients including in them parts of the Qurýan and Sunnah we never vouch for the sound creed of such people. We advised them against doing so, but they refused to listen, saying: We write only what is in the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam), which is not prohibited. Some of these amulets are worn by the patients themselves, or by an impure woman such as a menstruating woman, or a woman in her postnatal, or an insane, an under age child who does not know how to clean himself. Is this permissible?</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) permitted incantations with Qur&#8217;anic recitation, and supplications, as long as they do not include Shirk, or meaningless words. Muslim narrated in his Sahih that Auf bin Malik said: We used to use incantations in the pre-Islamic era, so we asked the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam): What formula should we recite for that purpose? He said: <span style="color:#008000;">Let me hear what you say. There is no harm in incantations as long as they do not include Shirk in them</span>. [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Scholars have unanimously agreed on the permissibility of incantations provided they meet the above condition, and believing that it has no effect without the Will of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is rather, Shirk according to the Hadith which is narrated by Imam Ahmad in which Imran bin Husain, may Allaah be pleased with him, reported that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) <span style="color:#008000;">saw a man wearing a copper bangle on his arm, and he asked him: What is this? He said: I am wearing it for cephalic weakness. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: Remove it, for it will not increase you in anything except weakness, and if you should die while you are wearing it, you would never be successful. </span>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another version narrated by Ahmad, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: <span style="color:#008000;">He who wears an amulet commits Shirk</span>. [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also narrated by Ahmad and others that Ibn Mas&#8217;ud, may Allaah be pleased with him, said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah saying: <span style="color:#008000;">Verily, incantations amulets and Tiwalah [5] are Shirk</span>. [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If the worn amulet contains Qur&#8217;anic words, then it is, prohibited according to the preponderant opinion for three reasons:</strong> </span></p>
<ol>
<li>The general prohibition of wearing any kind of amulets according to the Prophetic traditions with no exception.</li>
<li>Leaving no excuse for wearing amulets that contain other than Qur&#8217;anic formulas.</li>
<li>Amulets that are worn are usually subject to disrespect by taking them into washrooms, or wearing them during intercourse or the like.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">As for writing a Surah or a Verse on a slate or on a sheet, and washing the writing with water and saffron, to drink that water for the hope of gaining blessings, knowledge, wealth, good health, or the like, we have never heard that such was done by the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) for himself or for someone else.</span> He neither permitted any of his Companions to do so, nor did he give the permission to his Ummah to do so, even though the needs for doing so are existent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Based on the above, it is better to avoid doing so, and be content with what is authentically approved of incantations of Qur&#8217;anic recitation, the beautiful Names of Allaah, the authentic supplications, or the like, whose meaning are clear and they are free from the blemishes of Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should seek nearness to Allaah by doing only the permissible things for the hope of gaining reward, relief, and gaining beneficial knowledge. This should be sufficient, and he who is content with what Allaah has legitimized, Allaah renders him free from the need of someone else. It is only Allaah Who grants success.</p>
