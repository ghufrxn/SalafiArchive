										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 21 : Point 23</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> in the descent of `Eesaa ibn Maryam <em>`alayhis-salaam</em>. He will descend and he will kill the Dajjaal. He will marry and he will pray behind the one who will be in authority from the family of Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And he will die and the Muslims will bury him.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/eemaan-in-the-descent-of-eesaa-ibn-maryam-alayhis-salaam" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And to have <em>eemaan</em> in the descent of `Eesaa ibn Maryam <em>`alayhissalaatu was-salaam</em> (may Allaah extol him and grant him peace and security).”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he will be from the major signs of the hour.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His ‘<strong>descent</strong>’, meaning from heaven, because Allaah raised him up when the Jews wanted to kill him. And they came to him to kill him and to crucify him, and they entered upon him. Allaah raised him up from amongst them, whilst they were not aware, and he caused another man to look like him. So they killed that man thinking that it was the Messiah, and it was not him. He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they did not kill him and they did not crucify him but it was made to appear so to them</strong></span> (Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), aayah 157)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah caused this man to resemble him. It is said that this man was the one who guided them to him, so therefore Allaah punished him. Or it is said that he was from the followers of `Eesaa from the disciples, that `Eesaa <em>`alayhis-salaam</em> said to him, “You shall be given my appearance and Paradise shall be for you.” So the man had patience and he accepted this resemblance and being killed and being crucified, because he wanted Paradise through that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying that, <strong>“He will descend and he will kill the Dajjaal.”</strong> He will kill the Dajjaal at the gate of Ludd. And it, Ludd, is a well-known place. `Eesaa ibn Maryam <em>`alayhissalaam</em> will chase the Dajjaal. When he (the Dajjaal) sees him, he will dissolve away, just as salt dissolves in water. Then he will draw close to him and strike him with his spear and kill him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And he will marry and he will pray behind the one in authority from the family of Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>”</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And he will marry,”</strong> this occurs in some reports, however it is not established. [01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the fact that he will pray behind the Mahdee then this is established. The Mahdee will ask him to lead the Muslims in Prayer because he will descend at the time of the Fajr prayer. And the Muslims will be gathered for the prayer. So the Mahdee will request from him that he should lead the Muslims in prayer. So the Messiah will say, <strong><span style="color:#808000;">“No some of you are Imaams for the rest.”</span></strong> [02] So he will pray behind the Mahdee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the one in charge he is the Mahdee. (His name will be) Muhammad ibn ` Abdillaah (Muhammad the son of `Abdullaah). His name will be the same as the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and the name of his father will be the like the name of the father of the Messenger. And he will be of the family (descendants) of al-Hassan ibn `Alee <em>radiyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>. They (the People of Knowledge) said, the wisdom, and Allaah knows best, is that al-Hasan <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>, when he stepped down from the Khilaafah in favour of Mu`aawiyah in order to preserve the blood of the Muslims, then because of this, Allaah honoured him and made the Mahdee from his descendants.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying,<strong> “And he will die and the Muslims will bury him.”</strong> This is in the Qur&#8217;aan. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There is not anyone from the people of the Book except that he will believe in him before his </strong>(`Eesaa’s [03] )<strong> death</strong></span>. (Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), aayah 159)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he will die, just as the rest of mankind die.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We did not grant everlasting life to any human before you. So if you die, will they then live forever?</span></strong> (Sooratul-Anbiyaa· (21), aayah 34)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he will die <em>`alayhis-salaatu was-salaam</em> at the end of the life which Allaah has written for him. And the Muslims will bury him, just as they bury their dead. [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] This is related from Ibn `Abbaas. Refer to Fat.hul-Baari and `Umdatul-Qaari (Translator’s Note: two of the explanations of al-Bukhaaree).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Ibnul-Jowzee mentions such a report in al-`Ilal al-Mutanaahiyah, he mentions as a narration of `Abdullaah ibn `Amr as a hadeeth with regard to `Eesaa coming down and getting married. And Ibnul-Jowzee said, “This hadeeth is not authentic.” And Shaykh al-Albaanee said the same about this report in ad-Da`eefah (no. 6562) that this report is munkar, meaning weak/contradictory to what is authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The wording of that report is, that “Eesaa ibn Maryam will descend to the earth and he will marry and he will have offspring and he will remain for forty-five years. Then he will die and he will be buried along with me in my grave. So I and `Eesaa ibn Maryam will get up from one grave in between Aboo Bakr and `Umar.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] Reported by Muslim in his Saheeh from the hadeeth of Jaabir with the wording: So `Eesaa will descend and their leader will say, “Come and lead us in prayer.” So he will say, “<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>No, some of you (or one of you) will lead the others in Prayer as an honour from Allaah upon this nation</strong></span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> As is authentic from Ibn `Abbaas radiyAllaahu `anhumaa, meaning before the death of `Eesaa ibn Maryam `alayhis-salaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> A hadeeth which mentions that is reported by Aboo Daawood (no. 4324), a hadeeth of Aboo Hurayrah radiyAllaahu `anhu that the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said, “There is not between me and him (`Eesaa ibn Maryam) a Prophet; and he will descend&#8230;” the hadeeth. At the end of the hadeeth there occurs: <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“And he will destroy the Maseehud-Dajjaal. And he will remain upon the earth for forty years. Then he will die and the Muslims will pray over him</strong></span>.” (pray funeral prayer over him)” Shaykh al-Albaanee said about this hadeeth, “Saheeh.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Below are some examples taken from your Gospels [11] that confirm and support what Muhammad came with from the Qur’aan and his teachings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the seventh verse of Chapter 4 of the Gospel of Mathew, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Jesus said to him: ‘Again it is written, You shall not tempt the Lord your God.’”</strong></span> [Matthew 4:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. In this same chapter, there occurs a story about Jesus and the Devil, in which the Devil ordered Jesus to prostrate to him. So the Messiah Jesus responded to him, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Be gone Satan, for it is written: &#8216;You shall worship (prostrate only to) the Lord your God and Him only shall you serve (i.e. worship).’”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what all the messengers came with and it is the argument that Jesus used against the Devil. So this clearly proves that all of the prophets including Jesus and Muhammad came to establish that God was One and that He was the Lord and only One deserving of being worshipped.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jesus relied on the previously revealed books (from God) as proof, which state that God is the only Lord and that He is the only One who has the right to be worshipped and prostrated to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, Allaah revealed to (Prophet) Muhammad: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And We indeed sent to every nation a messenger (saying to his people): ‘Worship Allaah alone and avoid the false deities.’ So amongst them were those whom Allaah guided and amongst them were those whose misguidance was justified.”</strong></span> [Qur’aan 16:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also revealed to him: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And We did not send any messenger before you except that We revealed to him: ‘There is no deity that has the right to be worshipped in truth, except Me, so worship Me alone.’”</strong></span> [Qur’aan 23:25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these statements that were revealed to Muhammad are in complete conformity with what Jesus stated in his reply to the Devil. It is also in conformity with what Jesus said when calling the Tribe of Israel:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Verily, Allaah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. This is the Straight Path.”</strong></span> [Qur’aan 19:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it agrees with what he will say on the Day of Judgement when his Lord will ask him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“O Jesus, son of Mary, did you tell the people: ‘Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allaah?’ He will reply: ‘Glory be to You! It was not for me to say what I had no right to say. If I had said such a thing, You would have surely known about it. You know what is in my inner self though I do not know what is in Your Self. Truly, only You are the All-Knowing of all that is hidden. I did not tell them anything except for what You commanded me to tell them, (which was): Worship Allaah, my Lord and your Lord. And I served as a witness for them for as long as I was with them. But when You took me up, You were the Watcher over them, and You are a Witness to all things.’”</span></strong> [Qur’aan 5:116-117]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. In Chapter 11 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 25, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“At that time Jesus declared: ‘I thank thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that Thou hast hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to babes (infants).’”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Jesus was one of God’s servants and messengers. He acknowledged the right of his Lord who created him and bestowed His blessings on him, and therefore turned to Him, in thanks and affirmation that He alone was the Lord of the heaven and earth. This is since He is the One who created these two creations (the heaven and the earth), as well as everything inside them, in between them and whatever lies below the ground. No one else had any part in this – neither Jesus or anyone else – nor can anyone rival Him in that matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. In Chapter 14 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 23, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And after he had dismissed the crowds, he (Jesus) went up on the mountain by himself to pray.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Prayer is one of the greatest acts of worship that can be performed to God, and no one engages in it except for a lowly servant who stands in need of the mercy of his Lord and Creator. This is as Allaah says in the Qur’aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“O mankind! It is you who stand in need of Allaah, whereas Allaah is Rich (free of all needs), Most Praiseworthy.”</span> </strong>[Qur’aan 35:15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The Messiah (Jesus) will never be too proud to reject being a servant of God, nor the angels who are the ones close (to Him). And whoever is too proud and rejects worshipping Him, then He will gather them all together unto Himself.”</strong> </span>[Qur’aan 4:172]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Jesus was a servant of God, and he was not nor will he ever be too proud to worship Him. This is his condition and the condition of all of the prophets and angels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. In Chapter 26 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 39, it states that the Messiah (Jesus):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“fell on his face and prayed, ‘My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as Thou wilt.’”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in this text, there is proof that Jesus was a servant (worshipper) of God who had no control over repelling harm from himself or bringing benefit to himself. And there is evidence in this text that he sought refuge in God during times of hardship, seeking His assistance and humbling himself before Him, in order to remove the harm and danger that was approaching him. So he fell prostrate with his face on the ground, seeking nearness to Him, lowering himself before Him, showing his need for Him and expressing the belief that no one has the ability to repel harm except Him. This is the state of all of the messengers, not to mention all of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. In Chapter 21 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 46, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“But when they tried to arrest him, they feared the multitudes, since they held him to be a prophet.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is proof in this verse that the masses of people who believed in God and in Jesus were monotheists with pure and sincere faith, and that they believed that Jesus was a messenger and a prophet. This proves that their prophet, Jesus, had taught them this and cultivated them to believe in that. So they did not used to believe that he was God or the son of God, since he would not teach the people these things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. In Chapter 23 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 10, it states that Jesus said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“Neither be called masters, for you, even the Messiah, has One master.”</span> </strong>[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This text resembles the Qur’anic text in which Allaah informs us that His messenger Jesus told the Tribe of Israel: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“And verily, Allaah is my Lord and your Lord.”</span></strong> [Qur’aan 3:51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah is the Lord of Jesus, as well as his Master, Nurturer and Owner. He is the Lord, Master and Owner of all mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslim scholar, Taqee-ud-Deen al-Hilaalee, pointed out in his treatise “Clear Evidences” that: Some translators have distorted this text, but that the English translation was saved from this corruption.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. In Chapter 17 of the Gospel of John, verse 3, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And this is the eternal life – that they know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This text confirms that which all of the messengers came with, which was that there is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and it confirms that Jesus was a messenger of God. This was during his time, and every nation had its own time and messenger, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“And We did not send any messenger before you except that We revealed to him: ‘There is no deity that has the right to be worshipped in truth, except Me, so worship Me alone.’”</span> </strong>[Qur’aan 21:25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“And We indeed sent to every nation a messenger (saying to his people): ‘Worship Allaah alone and avoid the false deities.’”</span></strong> [Qur’aan 16:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. In Chapter 12 of the Gospel of Mark, verses 28-30, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he (Jesus) answered them well, asked him, ‘Which commandment is the first of all?’ Jesus answered, ‘The first is: Hear, O Israel! The Lord our God, the Lord is One. And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.&#8217;”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the first commandment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in verse 32 of the same chapter, it states that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“The scribe said to him, ‘You are right, teacher. You have truly said that He is One, and there is no other but He.’”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then in verse 34 of the same chapter, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And when Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, ‘You are not far from the kingdom of God.’”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This first commandment mentioned by Jesus is the same commandment that Allaah prescribed to all of His messengers, including Jesus – and this was the commandment that the messengers passed on to their nations:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“He has ordained for you the same religion that He ordained for Noah and which We revealed to you (O Muhammad) and ordained for Abraham, Moses and Jesus – that you should establish the Religion and make no divisions in it. Intolerable for the polytheists is that which you call them to.”</span></strong> [Qur’aan 42:13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The religion that God ordained for them was the pure monotheistic Faith, which is represented in the statement: “There is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah.” He ordered all of his messengers to call to this, and it is that which the polytheists found difficult to accept and for which reason they fought against God’s messengers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the same thing that Abraham and Jacob, also known as Israel, commanded the people with, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“And remember when Abraham and (his son) Ishmael were raising the foundations of the House (Ka’bah at Makkah), saying: ‘Our Lord! Accept this from us. Verily, You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knower. Our Lord! Make us submissive unto You, and of our offspring, a nation submissive unto You. And show us how to perform the ceremonies required during the pilgrimage (to the Ka’bah), and accept our repentance. Truly, You are the One who accepts repentance, the Most Merciful. Our Lord! Send amongst them a messenger of their own (i.e. Muhammad), who shall recite unto them Your verses and teach them the Book and the Wisdom (Prophetic Teachings), and purify them. Verily, You are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.’ And who turns away from the religion of Abraham except for he who fools himself? Truly, We chose him in this world and in the Hereafter, he will be among the righteous. When his Lord said to him: ‘Submit yourself’, he said: ‘I have submitted myself (as a Muslim) to the Lord of all that exists.’ And this (submission to Allaah) was enjoined by Abraham upon his sons, and also by Jacob, saying: ‘O my sons! Allaah has chosen for you the (true) religion, so do not die except while you are Muslims (i.e. submitting to the Will of your Creator).’ Or were you witnesses when death approached Jacob? – When he said to his sons: ‘What will you worship after me?’ They said: ‘We shall worship your God, the God of your forefathers – Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac – One God and to Him we submit (as Muslims).’”</span></strong> [Qur’aan 2:127-133]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is truly a tremendous religion, in which they submitted their will to the Lord of all that exists, turned to Him in repentance and sought refuge in Him to make their offspring an offspring that submit themselves to God. And they invoked Him to send a messenger from amongst them to them who would recite His verses unto them, teach them the Book and the Wisdom and purify them – the purification and wisdom that would keep them far away from polytheism, foolishness and misguidance. And Allaah rules here that whoever turns away from this religion, which is pure monotheism, only fools himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point derived from this is that the call of all of the prophets was in harmony in that they were calls to Monotheism and to Submission (to God) and that there was no deity that had the right to be worshipped except Allaah. They called their nations to this and counseled those who came after them from their offspring to abide by this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second point we want to focus on here, was the counsel of Israel, who was also known as Jacob. The text of the Bible in this regard is in conformity with the text from the Qur’aan in that the Biblical text indicates we should have love for God. This is also part of Islaam. In fact, the Religion of Islaam also consists of many aspects and great deeds apart from love (for the Creator).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look at how Jesus responded and what his tremendous counsel was. And look at the faith of the scribe who had asked the question looking for an answer to benefit from, and his statement: “<strong>You are right Teacher. You have truly said that He is One, and there is no other but He.</strong>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And look at how the Messiah responded to him, saying <strong>“You are not far from the kingdom of God.”</strong> This, and Allaah knows best, is a promise from him that he will be in Paradise, and it indicates that anyone who doesn’t believe in the Oneness of God and that He alone should be worshipped will not be allowed entry into Paradise. This is similar to what Allaah says in the Qur’aan, relaying to us what Jesus said to the Tribe of Israel:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Worship Allaah, who is my Lord and your Lord. Verily, whoever ascribes partners to Allaah in worship, Allaah will surely make Paradise forbidden for him and his final abode will be the Hellfire. And the wrongdoers will not have any supporters (in Hell).”</span></strong> [Qur’aan 5:72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Note: According to the language of the Torah and the Gospels, every righteous and dutiful follower of God is called a son of God, so Jesus was not particularized with this expression of “son of God.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. In Chapter 5 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 9, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. And in verse 45 of Chapter 5 of the Gospel of Matthew, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“So that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. In verse 4 of the Gospel of Matthew, Chapter 5, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“You, therefore, must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. In Chapter 6 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 1, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“Beware of practicing your piety before men in order to be seen by them, for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. In Chapter 23 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 9, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven.”</strong></span> [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These verses show that use of the terms “father” and “son” to refer to the connection between the Lord and His servant was a practice established in the Bible for all people, so the Messiah, Jesus, was not specifically characterized with this apart from others. [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps all of this was from the behavior of some of the Jews and Christians, but God knows best. This is since Allaah says in the Qur’aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“The Jews and the Christians say: ‘We are the children of God and His beloved ones.’ Say: ‘Why then does He punish you for your sins?’ Nay, you are but human beings from those He has created. He forgives whom He wills and He punishes whom He wills. And to Allaah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them. And to Him is the final return.”</span></strong> [Qur’aan 5:18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Any fair and balanced person with sound intellect will realize that the Qur’anic texts we mentioned contain in them a tribute, honor, warm reception and high praise for Jesus. And they confirm that he was a prophet and a messenger, and that he was one of the greatest messengers who carried the banner of Monotheism, called mankind to this Monotheistic Faith, which means making all worship purely for God alone, fought against polytheism, and warned those who adhere to it (polytheism) that they would reside eternally in the Hellfire – what an evil destination!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These verses from the Qur’aan also show how God absolved Jesus and his mother from the slander that the Jews accused them of, how He raised the status of Jesus and his mother and made the statements of the Jews against him and his mother to be considered as disbelief and immense slander.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the texts of the Qur’aan and the Bible are in conformity with the fact that Jesus was a servant and messenger of God. This is a perfect state that no one can attain except for the great messengers amongst whom was Jesus. The teachings of Prophet Muhammad also professed the same beliefs and the Muslims believed in all of this. So what then is wrong with Islaam and the Muslims? There is nothing wrong with it at all, in the eyes of those with sound intellects and impartiality. Rather, the wrong is against God Himself, since the terrible statement (that Jesus is the son of God), due to which the heavens are ready to tear apart, the earth split asunder, and the mountains fall in ruins is the opposite of what is indicated in the Qur’aan, the teachings of Prophet Muhammad and what the Muslims adhere to, not to mention what the monotheistic texts still preserved in the Bible indicate.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] Translator’s Note: The use of the relationship of Father and Son to refer to the connection between God and His righteous servants is not just limited to the New testament of the Bible, rather, there can be found proof for it in the Old Testament as well:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s Note:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further evidence from the New Testament that confirms this point that the use of the relationship between Father and Son as a substitute for the relationship between God and His servant is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“For they cannot die any more, because they are equal to angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.”</span> [Luke 20:36]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“But to all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God.”</span> [John 1:12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“And not for the nation only, but to gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.”</span> [John 11:52]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“It is the Spirit himself bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of God.”</span> [Romans 8:16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“…because the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain the glorious liberty of the children of God.”</span> [Romans 8:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“That you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world.”</span> [Philippians 2:15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“See what love the Father has given us – that we should be called children of God; and so we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him.”</span> [1 John 3:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"> “By this it may be seen who are the children of God, and who are the children of the Devil, Whoever does not do right is not of God, nor he who does not love his brother.”</span> [1 John 3:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandment.”</span> [1 John 5:2]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily, the example of Jesus in the sight of Allaah is like the example of Adam – He created him from dust and then said to him ‘Be’ and he was. This is the truth from your Lord, so do not be from those who doubt. So whoever disputes with you concerning him (i.e. Jesus) after all this knowledge (about him) has come to you, say: ‘Come, let us summon our children and your children, our women and your women and ourselves and yourselves and then invoke God to send His curses on those of us who is lying.’ Verily, this is the true story (about Jesus). And there is no God that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah. And indeed Allaah is the All-Mighty, All-Wise.”</strong> [Qur’aan 3:59-62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This great example is a decisive proof that cancels out all the claims of the Christians. This is because if it is not possible or correct according to sound minds, religious doctrines, and innate natures to claim that Adam, whom God created from dust with His Hands and breathed into him his soul, is God or the son of God or part of a divine trinity, then it is for all the more reason that such cannot be claimed for Jesus. This is since the creation of Adam was more remarkable and amazing than that of Jesus, as he was created from dust and dust is not part of the human race.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, Jesus was created from a woman, who is part of the human race, and she carried him in her womb in the same manner that woman carry children, and gave birth to him in the same manner that women give birth to children. So this is from the greatest of proofs that invalidate the false claims and absurd misconceptions of the Christians.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a matter of fact, the angels were created from light without any fathers or mothers, and the Devil was created from fire without any parents. So this is something more remarkable and indicative of the great Ability of God, the Creator, Molder and Originator of the heavens and earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, the creation of Eve from the rib of Adam, without any mother, was more miraculous than the creation of Jesus, who was conceived, carried in the womb of a woman and given birth to just as normal women give birth to children. So there does not remain any connection for the Christians according to every person possessing intellect, religion and fairness. But in spite of all this, Jesus, in the eyes of Islaam and the Muslims is far more superior than Adam and many of the other prophets and messengers, according to the Qur’aan and the teachings of Prophet Muhammad. This is since Jesus is one of the five messengers possessing strong will and determination, according to Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So after all this has been said, what is it that will change between the Christians and Islaam, which is the true religion of God and the religion of Jesus and all of the prophets? Won’t they realize that the greatest form of misguidance and disbelief is to claim that God has a wife and a child, since this is the biggest insult and debasement that can be leveled against God, Lord of all that exists? And the greatest denial of Jesus is to disbelieve in the true message that he brought, such as by saying that he is the son of God, etc., even though he clearly stated from the very first day that he was a slave of God who gave him Revelation, made him a prophet, blessed him wherever he was and entrusted him with prayer and charity. These are characteristics that apply to a created being that is raised and nurtured and in need of his Lord, submitting himself to His Majesty and obedient to His commands.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Al-Jawab As-Sahih Li-man Baddala Dina Al-Masih</em><br />
Answering Those Who Altered The Religion Of Jesus Christ (peace be upon him)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Explanation of the classic book of Ibn Taymiyyah <em>rahimahullaah. This book is one of the most important Islamic books which gives right answers about Christianity.</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Jawab As-Sahih Li-man Baddala Dina Al-Masih</em> (Answering Those Who Altered the Religion of Jesus Christ) is a comprehensive study in which the author not only refutes the Christians&#8217; allegations about Islam but also raises the contradictions of some Christian beliefs and even refutes their creedal principles. The book gains its originality from the fact that it is one of the strongest compilations ever laid down on its topic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Through this Shaikhul-Islam Ibn Taimiyah responds to a letter from Cyprus from &#8216;Paul, The Monk; the Bishop of Sayda&#8217;, The letter was entitles &#8216;The Logically proven statement that expresses the right conviction and sound opinion&#8217;. The letter is comprised of all the excuses and pleas that Christian scholars and pious Christians use to defend their religion, in the past as well as in recent times, which are based on many rational and logical arguments. Upon that, Ibn Taimiyah stood up to confront and expose the falseness and corruption of such allegations, thereby, clarifying right from wrong in order that those with sound judgment can make use of it. He also aimed at outlining and clarifying the Books, Justice and Wisdom with which Allah sent His Messengers.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>CHAPTER ONE:</strong></span></p>
<p>Their claim that Muhammad (peace be upon him) was not sent to them but to the Arabs of the Pre-Islamic era. It will also contain their claim that the verses of the Qur’an support this very idea as does logical contemplation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Section One: The First Claim Of The Christians</strong>
<ol>
<li>The Claim of the Christians that Muhammad was not sent to them but he was only sent to the Arabs of the Pre-Islamic era.</li>
<li>Their plea that the Book with which Muhammad was sent is not written in their language.</li>
<li>Their saying, &#8220;We do not need to follow this Messenger because we were sent other Messengers before him.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Section Two: The Refuting The Claims Of The Christians</strong>
<ol>
<li>&#8211; Proofs that the Messenger Of Allah was sent to all Mankind</li>
<li>&#8211; Some Qur&#8217;anic verses that prove the prophethood Of Muhammad</li>
<li>&#8211; Refuting the Claim that the Qur&#8217;anic verses Contradict Each Other</li>
<li>&#8211; Glad tidings about the Coming of Prophets</li>
<li>&#8211; The Qur&#8217;an was Revealed in Arabic</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>CHAPTER TWO:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their claim that Muhammad (peace be upon him) praised their religion (in the Qur’an) to the extent that their religion and practices should motivate them to adhere more to it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Section One: The First Claim Of The Christians</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Christian Claim: Muhammad praised their religion, which they practice, in the Qur&#8217;an from the following aspects: (1). Glorifying Christ and his mother. (2). Glorifying the Bible. (3). Praising Synagogues. (4). Glorifying the Disciples, as they are messengers from Allah. (5). All that makes us hold fast to our religion and not follow any other man except Jesus Christ.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Section Two: The Refuting The Claims Of The Christians</strong>
<ol>
<li>&#8211; Divine and Human Entities United</li>
<li>&#8211; The Holy Spirit</li>
<li>&#8211; Invented Monasticism</li>
<li>&#8211; Misplaced Inference</li>
<li>&#8211; Remembering Allah in Monasteries, Synagogues and Mosques</li>
<li>&#8211; Praising Jesus Christ and His Followers</li>
<li>&#8211; Reasons Why the Christians Deviated</li>
<li>&#8211; The Book of Enlightenment</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>CHAPTER THREE:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their claim that the prophethood of the early Prophets and their Books, like the Torah, Psalms and the Gospel assert the truth of their beliefs, namely: the Hypostases, trinity, unification and so on. Thus, they should adhere to them, as it is not acceptable for them to desert their beliefs as long as they are not abrogated by a text or annulled by rational deduction.</p>
<ul>
<li>Section One: The Third Claim Of The Christians</li>
<li>Section Two: The Refuting The Claims Of The Christians
<ol>
<li>Distortion of the Torah and The Gospel</li>
<li>Invalidity Of the Comparison of their Books to the Qur&#8217;an</li>
<li>Who Speaks Seventy-Two Languages</li>
<li>Changes made in Torah and Gospel</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Section Three: The Claim Of The Christians Regarding The Prophets Books Supporting Them And Attributing Injustice To The Jews</li>
<li>Section Four: Refuting The Christians Claim</li>
<li>Sections Five: The Christians Claim That The Qur&#8217;an Regards All Religions On An Equal Footing</li>
<li>Section Six: Reputing The Christians Claim</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>CHAPTER FOUR:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It includes their claim that the Trinity is proven according to logic and according to the revealed laws (i.e. the Prophetic traditions and their revealed Books) and that it agrees with the laws of Divinely revealed Books and Prophetic traditions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Section One: The Claim Of The Christians</li>
<li>Section Two: The Refuting The Claims Of The Christians
<ol>
<li>Invalidity of the Three Entities Being One God</li>
<li>Baptizing in the Name of the Father and the Son</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>CHAPTER FIVE:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their claim that they are monotheists, justifying their words that imply polytheism, such as the hypostases, through claiming that they resemble the words in the Book of the Muslims which imply personification and incarnation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Section One: The Claim Of The Christians</li>
<li>Section Two: The Refuting The Claims Of The Christians
<ol>
<li>The Christians Claim that the Attributes Serve as Names</li>
<li>Their Claim Regarding Incarnation and Immanentism</li>
<li>Their Claim Regarding God&#8217;s Appearance in Jesus</li>
<li>The Difference Between Similarity and being Identical</li>
<li>Christians Claim regarding the Three Hypostases</li>
<li>The Invalidity of their Claim that they are Monotheists</li>
<li>Among Their Scholars: Al-Hasan bin Ayyub</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>CHAPTER SIX:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their claim that ‘Isa (Jesus, peace be upon him) was sent after Musa (Moses, peace be upon him) with a perfect religion (i.e. Christianity) and thus, there is no need for another religion (i.e. Islam) which aims at the same purposes and goals which have already been achieved. Thus, any religion after that of &#8216;Isa is invalid and therefore not acceptable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Section One: The Claim Of The Christians</li>
<li>Section Two: The Refuting The Claims Of The Christians</li>
<li>Section Three: The Prophets Prophesied The Advent Of Muhammad</li>
<li>The Scriptures&#8217; Witness For Muhammad (peace be upon him)
<ul>
<li>Sixteen Prophecies</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 51</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What is the creed of the Muslims with regard to ‘Eesaa, son of Maryam? Also what is the ruling as to the saying that he was killed and crucified.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer by Shaykh ibn Uthaymeen</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The belief of the Muslims regarding ‘Eesaa, son of Maryam, may Allaah’s Salaah and Salaam be upon him, is that <strong><span style="color:#000000;">he is one of the noble Messengers</span></strong>. In fact he is one of the five Messengers foremost in their resolve. They are Muhammad (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam), Ibraaheem, Moosaa, Noah and ‘Eesaa (may Allaah’s Salaah and Salaam be upon them all). Allaah, The Most High, mentioned them in three places in His Noble Book. So, He Said in soorat al-Ahzaab :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And (remember) when We took from the Prophets their covenant, and from you (O Muhammad (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam), and from Noah, Ibraaheem (Abraham), Moosaa (Moses), and ‘Eesaa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary); We took from them a strong covenant.</span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-Ahzaab (33): 7].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in sooart ash-Shoora, Allaah Said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Your Rabb (Allaah) prescribed for Noah (Nooh), and that which We revealed to you (O Muhammad: Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam), and that which He prescribed for Ibraaheem, Moosaa, ‘Eesaa–that you should establish the Religion, acting upon what is prescribed, and not split into sects with regard to it</span>. [Qur’aan, soorat ash-Shooraa (42): 13].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We belieive that ‘Eesaa (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>is a human from the children of Adam created from a mother without a father, and that he is a slave-worshipper of Allaah</strong></span> and His Messenger. So he is a slave, one who is not to be worshipped, and a Messenger, not to be denied. And that he does not possess any of the qualities of Rubbobiyyah. Rather he is as Allaah has Said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>‘Eesaa is not but a slave of Ours whom We Granted Our Favour to him (blessed with guidance and Eemaan,) and We made him a sign to the children of Israel.</strong></span> [Qur’aan, soorat azZukhruf (43): 59].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that he (may Allaah’s Salaah and Salaam be upon him) did not command his people to appoint him and his mother as gods besides Allaah. In fact, he told that which Allaah has Commanded him with:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Worship Allaah, my Rabb and your Rabb.</span></strong> [Qur’aan, soorat alMaa’idah (5): 117].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that he, ‘Eesaa (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>was Created by the Word of Allaah (Be!)</strong> </span>as Allaah, The Most High, Says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Verily, the likeness of ‘Eesaa before Allaah, (in Allaah’s Sight,) is the likeness of Adam. He Created him from dust, then (He) Said to him: “Be”- and he was. </strong></span>[Qur’aan, soorat aal- ‘Imraan (3): 59].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that <strong><span style="color:#000000;">there is no Prophet between him (‘Eesaa) and Muhammad (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam)</span></strong>, as Allaah, The Most High, Says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And (remember) when ‘Eesaa, son of Maryam, said: ‘O Children of Israel! I am the Messenger of Allaah unto you, confirming the Torah (which came) before me, and giving glad tiding of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad.’ But when he (Ahmed, i.e. Muhammad Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) came to them with clear proofs, they said: “This is plain magic”. [Qur’aan, soorat as-Saf (61): 6].</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And no one’s faith will be complete until he believes that ‘Eesaa is Allaah’s slave and Messenger, and that he is free from and high above what the Jews described him with, – they said he was son of a prostitute conceived by way of fornication. We seek refuge in Allaah from this. Allaah, The Most High, cleared him of all of that. Also the Muslims disassociate themselves from the way of the Christians who went astray in their understanding of the reality with regard to ‘Eesaa, son of Maryam, since they have appointed him and his mother as gods besides Allaah. And some of them said: “He is the son of Allaah,” and others said: “Allaah is the third of three (Trinity).”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">As far as him (‘Eesaa) being killed and “crucified,”</span></strong> then Allaah, The One free from all imperfection and The Most High, categorically and decisively denied that he was killed or crucified. So He, The Most Mighty and Most Magnificent, Said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">But they (the Jews) they killed him not, nor crucified him, but the resemblance of Jesus was put over another man (and they killed that man), and those who differ therein are full of doubts, they have no certain knowledge, they follow nothing but conjecture. For surely they killed him not. But Allaah raised him up (with his body and soul) unto Himself (and he is in the heavens). And Allaah is All-Powerful, AllWise. And there is none from the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), but must believe in him (i.e. ‘Eesaa, as a Messenger of Allaah and a human being) before his (‘Eesaa’s, or a Jew’s or a Christian’s) death. And on the Day of Resurrection, he (‘Eesaa) will be a witness against them.”</span></strong> [Qur’aan, soorat an-Nisaa’ (4): 157-159].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore anyone who believes that ‘Eessa, son of Maryam, may Allaah’s Salaah and Salaam be upon him, was killed and crucifixion then he has denied the Qur’aan. And anyone who denies the Qur’aan is an unbeliever. So we believe that ‘Eessa (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) was neither killed nor crucified. But we say that the Jews drew on themselves the sin of killing and crucifixion, since they claimed that they killed ‘Eesaa, son of Mary, the Messenger of Allaah, while in reality they killed him not. Rather they killed someone who was put there to resemble him, because Allaah put the resemblance of ‘Eesaa over a man from amongst them, and they killed and crucified that man. And then they said that they killed ‘Eesaa, son of Mary, the Messenger of Allaah. Thus the Jews drew upon themselves the sin of killing and that of crucifixion in their testimony concerning themselves. And as to ‘Eessa, son of Maryam, Allaah, The Most High, cleared him of that, and protected him and raised him up unto Himself in the heavens.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And he shall descend to earth at the end of time</strong></span> (before the establishment of the Hour), and he will judge by the Sharee’ah of Muhammad (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam), then he will die on earth and will be buried in it; then he will be raised (ascend) just like the rest of the children of Aadam, since Allaah, The Most High, Says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Thereof (the earth) We Created you, and into it We shall return you, and from it We shall bring you out once again.</span></strong> [Qur’aan, soorat Taahaa (20): 55].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Allaah) Said: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">Therein (the earth) you will live, and therein you shall die, and from it you shall be brought out (i.e. resurrected).</span> </strong>[Qur’aan, soorat al-A’raaf (7): 25].</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">The Status of Jesus in Islam  &#8211; by Shaykh Rabee bin Hadee Al-Madkhalee</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a short essay <b>“Makaanatu ‘Eesaa fil-Islaam”</b> (The Status of Jesus in Islaam) written by Dr. Rabee’ bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee, a Muslim religious scholar from Saudi Arabia. The source used for this translation was the on-line version of the book, which can be found on <a href="http://www.rabee.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.rabee.net</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since the book, for the most part, is geared towards non-Muslim readers, particularly Christians, names of prophets and other righteous believers of the past are presented here in their standard English version, even though, they are pronounced differently in Arabic by Muslims. This was done to make it easier for the non-Muslim audience, who are not accustomed to the Arabic versions of these names, to read the treatise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, in many instances, the word “Allaah” was translated as God, in order to assist non-Muslim readers understand the subject at hand more clearly. However, the proper name of God, Allaah, was left as is in other parts where deemed appropriate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is hoped that this treatise may serve as a means to invite and call the Christian community to develop an understanding of how Jesus is viewed in the eyes of the Muslims and what we believe concerning him, as revealed to us by Allaah in the Qur’aan and the teachings of Prophet Muhammad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The story of Mary begins with this great connection of mentioning those whom God chose over mankind, which included the family of ‘Imraan, who were the parents of Mary. This is done in order to make it clear that Mary came from a righteous and noble family, and that she was part of the offspring of chosen prophets, and that her mother was a pious woman. An example of her piety and righteousness was that she vowed to offer what was in her womb to the services of God. She was hoping that it would be a boy, but instead she gave birth to a girl. So she returned this matter back to God, seeking His pardon and asking Him to protect her daughter and her offspring from the outcast Devil. So her Lord answered her supplication and warmly accepted Mary, causing her to be raised in a good manner and placing a righteous and merciful prophet, Zachariah, in charge of caring for her. This shows that the mother of Jesus had a tremendous upbringing.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“God is not in need of begetting a son. Attributing a child to Him is from the greatest forms of disbelief and misguidance, since it constitutes the highest level of insult and deficiency being ascribed to His Honor, Greatness and Lordship. This is since everything apart from God (the Creator) can only be one of His creations, and all of His creations submit themselves to His Honor and Grandness and are mandated to worship Him, whereas God is divine and free of begetting a child. This is why Allaah says to those who ascribe a child to Him, and His speech is the truth: <b>‘You have indeed brought forth something very terrible (i.e. an evil statement) – due to which the heavens are ready to tear apart, the earth split asunder, and the mountains fall in ruins. It is that they ascribe a child to the Most Merciful (i.e. God). However, it is not befitting for the (Majesty of the) Most Merciful that he should beget a child. There is none in the heavens and the earth except that he comes unto the Most Merciful as a servant. Verily, He knows each one of them, and has counted them a full counting. And each one of them will come to Him on the Day of Resurrection alone (and without any helpers).’</b>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<b>6.</b> In Chapter 21 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 46, it states: <b>‘But when they tried to arrest him, they feared the multitudes, since they held him to be a prophet.’</b>There is proof in this verse that the masses of people who believed in God and in Jesus were monotheists with pure and sincere faith, and that they believed that Jesus was a messenger and a prophet. This proves that their prophet, Jesus, had taught them this and cultivated them to believe in that. So they did not used to believe that he was God or the son of God, since he would not teach the people these things.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Has not the time come for the Christians, after hearing all of this, to hasten and rush to Islaam, especially the intellectual, educated and free thinking ones amongst them? We call them again to stand up before God in pairs and individually, then to reflect on this tremendous matter – of which there is no matter greater than it – with firm determination and impartiality and earnestly seeking to attain the truth and the reality, for it is indeed a crucial matter, which can either lead one to Paradise, the size of which spans the heavens and the earth, or to the Hellfire, whose fuel will be men and stones and which is prepared for those who disbelieve to reside therein forever. This is a matter that all of the messengers agreed on and which is contained in their revealed books, including Jesus, the servant and messenger of God. At this point, it is appropriate for us to honestly tell you: <b>‘O People of the Scripture! Come to a word that is just between us and you – that we worship none but God alone and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take others as lords besides God.’ Then if they turn away, say: ‘Bear witness that we are Muslims.’</b>”</p>

<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to the One to Whom all Dignity, Honour and Glory are due; the Unique with perfect attributes, Who begets not, nor is He begotten. He has no equal but He is the Almighty, Omnipotent. He sent His Messengers and Prophets to guide humanity towards monotheism; to worship Him Alone, the only One Worthy of worship, and to warn them of the eternal dire consequences of polytheism; associating partners with One Allah and the worship of creatures.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon all the Prophets and Messengers, especially on Muhammad, the last of the Prophets, and on all who follow him in righteousness until the Day of Recompense.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTIANITY: MEN WITHOUT RELIGION </strong></p>
<p><strong>ISLAM: RELIGION WITHOUT MEN</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Muslim never lacks proofs about the purity and truthfulness of his religion, but what he lacks are those truthful brothers who stand for Allah and His Prophet <tt>SAW</tt> testifying to the truth. Indeed, in this age, Islam is a religion without men (custodians and propagators) whereas Christianity is men without a religion; yet, by their endeavour, adventurous spirit, patience and monetary contributions they are able to falsify truth and make falsehood appear true. In this materialistic age most of humanity have become slaves to wealth, fashions, and mansions.</p>
<p>There is none worthy of worship but Allah and in Him (Alone) do I put my trust, and towards Him am I destined.</p>
<p><strong>JESUS AND THE DEVIL IN THE BIBLE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the New Testament of the Bible, in the fourth chapter of the Gospel according to Matthew, the sixth and seventh verses clearly indicate that Jesus is an obedient mortal and God is the Master and Lord according to his saying in the seventh verse:</p>
<p>&#8220;It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord, thy God.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this chapter we read that the Devil actually carried the Messiah, and took him from place to place. How can the Devil carry God? Glory be to Allah; He is above such blasphemy!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Devil orders him to prostrate before him and worship him, even tempting him with worldly possessions. How can the Devil even dare such an audacity with God? When the Devil wanted Jesus to comply with his orders, he (Jesus) replied by saying that it was written (in the previous Books):</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou shalt worship the Lord, thy God; And Him only shalt thou serve.&#8221; Matthew 4:10.</p>
<p><strong>CHILDREN OF GOD</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jesus never called himself <em>Son of God</em> as far as I know but he used to call himself the &#8216;Son of Man&#8217; (ref. Mark 2:10) although he heard himself being called by that name he did not object as assumed in the Bible and did not consider the title exclusively for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to the Biblical term in the Old and New Testaments, every God- fearing righteous person is called &#8216;Son of God&#8217;. In Matthew 5:9 we read:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Blessed are the peace-makers, for they shall be called the children of God.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Matthew 5:45 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;That ye may be children of your Father which is in heaven&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>GOD THE FATHER</strong></p>
<p>In Matthew 5:48 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Matthew 6:1 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.&#8221;</p>
<p>Matthew 7:21 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not every one that sayeth unto me (Jesus), Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven: but he that doeth the will of my Father, which is in heaven.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>N.B. </strong>The word &#8216;Lord&#8217; here was translated as <em>Rabb</em> in the Arabic version of the Bible so that people may be convinced that Jesus is God! But if one studies the rest of the verse, one will note that the verse bears testimony to the subservience (to God&#8217;s Will) of the Messiah (Jesus). Therefore the correct translation should be:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Not every one that sayeth to me, O my Master, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obvious from the above readings from the Bible that the term &#8216;Father&#8217; is used for God in numerous places in the Bible. It is never used exclusively for the Messiah (Jesus).</p>
<p>Matthew 11:25 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;At that time Jesus answered and said, &#8216;I thank Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes.'&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>JESUS THE WORSHIPPER </strong></p>
<p>Matthew 14:23 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray&#8230;..&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: If he (Jesus) is God or a part of God then why did he pray? In fact, prayer is always from a submitting, needy and dependent one for the Mercy of Almighty Allah as mentioned in the Qur&#8217;ân. (V. 35:15):-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O mankind! it is you who stand in need of Allah but Allah is Rich (Free of all wants and needs), Worthy of all praise&#8221; (35:15).</p>
<p>And in (V. 19:93) of Qur&#8217;ân:-</p>
<p>&#8220;There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto the Most Beneficent (Allah) as a slave.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>A BIBLICAL STORY </strong></p>
<p>Matthew 15:22-28 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts and cried unto him, saying, &#8216;Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David: my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.&#8217; But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying; &#8216;Send her away, for she crieth after us.&#8217; But he answered and said, &#8216;I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then came she and worshipped him, saying, &#8216;Lord, help me.&#8217; But he answered and said, &#8216;It is not meet to take the children&#8217;s bread and to cast it to dogs.&#8217;</p>
<p>And she said, &#8216;Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters&#8217; table.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Jesus answered and said unto her, &#8216;O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<p>In this story about a woman from Canaan there are noteworthy points:</p>
<p>(1) Lack of mercy and love charged against Jesus (if the incident is reported correctly).</p>
<p>(2) Degraded discrimination in regard to the uplifting of his tribe and not for the others.</p>
<p>(3) Tribal pride of descendance and prejudice against others and calling them dogs.</p>
<p>(4) An ignorant polytheist woman debated with him and won him over.</p>
<p><strong>JESUS: A PROPHET OF ALLAH.</strong></p>
<p>Matthew 19:16-17 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And behold, one came and said unto him, &#8216;Good master, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?&#8217; And he said unto him, &#8216;Why callest thou me good? (There is) none good but one, (i.e.) God, but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<p>In the above verses we note this acknowledgment of his submissiveness (to Allah&#8217;s Will).</p>
<p>Matthew 21:45-46 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And when the chief priests and pharisees had heard his parable, they perceived that he spoke of them. But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude because they took him for a Prophet.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here it is proved that all those who believed in Jesus during his life-time did not believe in him being God or the Son of God or one in the doctrine of Trinity; but they believed in him as being a Prophet only. This is indeed one of the strongest points of evidence against those who believe in the Divinity of Jesus (Incarnation of God) if only they pondered.</p>
<p><strong>JESUS: A SERVANT OF ALLAH.</strong></p>
<p>Matthew 23:8 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8216;But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your master, even Jesus, and all ye are brethern.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here it is clearly proved that Jesus was servant of Allah, and that there is only One Master and He is Allah. In the Arabic version of the Bible this verse has been translated so that Jesus is meant to be the master whereas the English rendering is nearer the original sense.</p>
<p>Matthew 23:9 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father which is in heaven.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this you will note that fatherhood and sonship is meant to be the relationship between the Lord and His servants: it is meant in a general sense and not specifically for Jesus.</p>
<p>Matthew 24:36 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a definite proof that the Final Hour is unknown to any but Allah, thus Jesus&#8217; knowledge is imperfect like all other men; Allah Alone is All-Knowing, Omniscient.</p>
<p>Matthew 26:39 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And he (Jesus) went a little farther, and fell on his face and prayed, saying, &#8216;O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We note here that the person speaking is unaware of Allah&#8217;s Will and realizes the fact that he is a servant of Allah. He (Allah) Alone can cause the change.</p>
<p><strong>THE COMPILATION OF THE BIBLE</strong></p>
<p>Matthew 27:7-8 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And they took counsel and bought with them the potter&#8217;s field to bury strangers in. Wherefore that field was called the Field of Blood, unto this day.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From these verses we understand that the Bible (the New Testament) was not written during Jesus&#8217; life-time but long after the occurrence of the events described, having been retained in the memory of the people.</p>
<p>Matthew 27:46 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, &#8216;Eli,Eli, lama sabachthani? (My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me?&#8217;)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is according to their (Christians&#8217;) assumption that Jesus cried in a loud voice saying the above words while he was being crucified. This is a great insult as such words could only come from unbelievers in Allah. Further, it is incredible that such words should come out from a Prophet of Allah because Allah never breaks His Promise and His Prophets never complained against His Promise.</p>
<p><strong>JESUS: PREACHER OF MONOTHEISM (<em><strong>TAUHID</strong></em></strong><strong>)</strong></p>
<p>In John 17:3 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And this is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Mark 12:28-30 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, &#8216;Which is the first commandment of all?&#8217; And Jesus answered him: &#8216;The first of all the commandments is; hear O Israel, the Lord thy God is One Lord: and thou shalt love the Lord, thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<p>In Mark 12:32 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And the scribe said unto him, &#8216;Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is One God; and there is none other but He.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<p>In Mark 12:34 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;he (Jesus) said unto him, &#8216;Thou art not far from the kingdom of God&#8230;&#8217; &#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In these verses, Jesus (peace be upon him) himself had testified that Allah is the One God, there is none other than Him, and that whoever believes in His Oneness, he is near the Kingdom of Allah. Therefore whoever associates partners with Allah or believes in the Trinity is far away from the Kingdom of Allah, and whoever is far away from the Kingdom of Allah he is the enemy of Allah.</p>
<p>In Matthew 24:36 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of the heaven, but my Father only.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: A similar text was quoted from S.Matthew which is exactly as proclaimed by the Qur&#8217;ân in that none knows when the Hour will come except Allah. This establishes the fact that Jesus was subservient to Allah and that he had no share in Divinity: that he was an incarnation of God, was an innovation by the people of Canaan.</p>
<p>In John 20:16 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Jesus said unto her, &#8216;Mary&#8217;. She turned herself, and sayeth unto him, &#8216;Rabboni&#8217;, which is to say, Master, Jesus saith unto her, &#8216;Touch me not: For I am not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father; and to my God and your God.&#8217; Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she has seen the Lord, and that He had spoken these things unto her.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the above narrative Jesus clearly testified that Allah is his God and their God, making no difference between him and them in the worship of the One Allah. Whoever believes that Jesus is God has indeed blasphemed against Allah and betrayed the Messiah (Jesus) and all the Prophets and Messengers of Allah.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>BIBLICAL PROPHECY ON THE ADVENT OF MUHAMMAD (peace be upon him)</strong>John 14:15-16 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If you love me, keep my commandments. And I will pray the Father and He shall give you another Comforter that he may abide with you forever.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim theologians have said that &#8220;another Comforter&#8221; is Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah; and him to &#8220;abide forever&#8221; means the perpetuity of his laws and way of life (<em>Sharia&#8217;</em>) and the Book (Qur&#8217;ân) which was revaled to him.</p>
<p>John 15:26-27 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me: And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.&#8221;</p>
<p>John 16:5-8 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;But now I go my way to Him that sent me and none of you asketh me &#8216;Whither goest thou?&#8217; But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart. Nevertheless I tell you the truth; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and approve righteousness and judgment.&#8221;</p>
<p>John 16:12-14 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I have yet many things to say unto you, but you cannot bear them now. How be it when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak; and he will shew you things to come. He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and he shall shew it unto you.&#8221;</p>
<p>John 16:16 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;A little while and ye shall not see me: and again a little while, ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim theologians have stated that the person who is described by Jesus to come after him in the above verses does not comply with any other person but Muhammad (peace be upon him) the Messenger of Allah. This &#8216;person&#8217; whom Jesus prophesied will come after him is called in the Bible &#8216;Parqaleeta&#8217; This word was deleted by later interpreters and translators and changed at times to &#8216;Spirit of Truth&#8217;, and at other times, to &#8216;Comforter&#8217; and sometimes to &#8216;Holy Spirit&#8217;. The original word is Greek and its meaning is &#8216;one whom people praise exceedingly.&#8217; The sense of the word is applicable to the word &#8216;Muhammad&#8217; (in Arabic).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>FINALITY ON PROOFS ON THE FABRICATION </strong><strong>OF THE STORY OF THE CROSS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) The Bible testifies to the fact that Jesus was known among the Jews; he used to preach and deliver sermons in the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem. It was therefore, unnecessary to hire a Jew for thirty pieces of silver to direct them to him as related in S. Matthew.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) It is related that one of the twelve disciples named Judas Iscariot was hired to direct the Jews to Jesus. They then sentenced him after which Judas was greatly ashamed and dissociated himself from their act and then committed suicide. All this took place within twenty four hours. The contradictions are obvious.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) The clearest proof which alone is sufficient to discredit this story is when the Jews passed the sentence of death against Jesus and intended to get the approval of the governor, Pontious Pilate.</p>
<p>Matthew 27:11-14 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And Jesus stood before the governor: The governor asked him, saying, &#8216;Art thou the king of the Jews!&#8217; And Jesus said unto him, &#8216;Thou sayeth (sayest)&#8217;: And when he was accused of (by) the chief priests and elders. He answered nothing. Then said Pilate unto him, &#8216;Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?&#8217; And he answered him never (to) a word&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Christians will interpret the above verse to mean that Jesus wanted to die on the Cross for the redemption of mankind and for the forgiveness of their sins: if so, then why did he ask to turn away that cup from him (i.e. death)? Why did he cry out while on the Cross (as they assume): &#8220;O Lord, why hast thou forsaken me?&#8221; How could he have remained silent when the truth was being challenged? He was known for his soul-inspiring sermons challenging the learned Jewish <em>Rabbis.</em> No sane person can believe in this. If the story of the Cross is disproved then the very foundation on which Christianity is based, will be demolished.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslims believe that Jesus was not crucified by the Jews as revealed in the Holy Qur&#8217;ân by Allah in a crystal clear manner: V. 4:157,158.-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And because of their saying (in boast): &#8216;We killed Messiah Jesus, son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah&#8217;; &#8211; but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but the resemblance of Jesus was put over another man (and they killed that man), and those who differ therein are full of doubts. They have no (certain) knowledge, they follow nothing but conjecture. For surely, they killed him not (i.e., Jesus, son of Mary). But Allah raised him (Jesus) up (with his body and soul) unto Himself (and he <tt>alai-hiss-salaam</tt> is in the heavens).. And Allah is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jews themselves, together with the entire Christian world, believe that he was crucified. As proofs against their views and to prove the truth of the Muslim verdict through the Bible, I prepared the following set of questions based on the Book of S. Matthew in the New Testament of Bible. (Chapters 26 and 27):</p>
<p>(1) Did those who captured Jesus (according to their assumption) know him in person? or did they not know him?</p>
<p>S. Matthew testifies that they did not know him.</p>
<p>(2) Was it during the day or night that he was captured?</p>
<p>S.Matthew says it was during the night.</p>
<p>(3) Who was the one that directed them to him?</p>
<p>S. Matthew says: He was one of his twelve disciples called Judas lscariot.</p>
<p>(4) Did he direct them free of charge or for a fixed reward which they specified, for him?</p>
<p>S. Matthew says: He directed them to him for a fixed reward of thirty pieces of silver.</p>
<p>(5) What was the condition of Jesus during that night?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">S. Matthew says: He was fearful and prostrated in prayer saying: &#8220;O God, if it is possible for You to let this cup pass from me, then let it pass.&#8221; It is incredible that such words could come from a believer in God, let alone a Prophet of God, because all believers believe that God has power over all things.</p>
<p>(6) What was the condition of his eleven disciples?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">S. Matthew says: Sleep overcame them that night together with their teacher (according to their assumption) out of fear.</p>
<p>(7) Was Jesus contented with their condition?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">S. Matthew says (verses 40-46): He was not satisfied. He used to come to them to wake them up saying: &#8220;Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak.&#8221; Then he would come again to find them asleep and he would again wake them up and say the same thing. This weakness could not have been spoken of righteous pupils even if they were pupils of an ordinary pious teacher, let alone the disciples of Jesus, son of Mary.</p>
<p>(8) Did they help him when those ruffians captured him?</p>
<p>S. Matthew says: They forsook him and fled.</p>
<p>(9) Did Jesus have confidence in his disciples that night?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">S. Matthew says: Jesus informed them that they will all forsake him. Then Jesus said unto them: &#8220;Verily I say unto thee that this night before the cock crows, thou shall deny me thrice.&#8221; Peter said unto him, &#8220;Although I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee.&#8221; Likewise also said all the disciples. And so it happened.</p>
<p>(10) How did those ruffians capture him?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">S. Matthew says: They came to him with swords and staves after they were directed to him by a Jew, then they captured him as described in verse 57:</p>
<p>&#8220;And they that had laid hold on Jesus, led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the elders were assembled.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There they passed the sentence of death on him. The ruffians then took him away, spat on his face and struck him with their hands after which they stripped him of his clothes and clad him in scarlet robes, then placed a crown of thorns on his head and took him about, teasing and mocking him. They said to him: &#8216;You are the king of Israel according to your claim.&#8217; They severely degraded him.</p>
<p>(11) Who finally decided to pass the death sentence against him?</p>
<p>S. Matthew says: He was Pontious Pilate, a Greek Roman, who was at that time the governor of Palestine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(12) When the ruffians brought that man before the governor and informed him that the priest of the Jews passed the sentence of death by crucifixion according to their law (Torah), did he believe in them without investigation?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">S. Matthew says: He did not believe them but asked that man: &#8220;Is it true what they have said?&#8221; He remained silent. The question was repeated and he continued to remain silent. He remained silent in view of the truth; it was essential for him even if he was not a Prophet to clarify the truth and deny the false accusation of the Jews. The governor&#8217;s wife went to the governor and she said to him: &#8220;Have thou nothing to do with that just man? for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Bible states that Jesus delivered lengthy speeches to the Jews rebuking and warning them which amounted to defaming them. Then why was he silent that day? The governor&#8217;s intention for asking him was to stand for the truth.</p>
<p>(13) How was he crucified according to their assumption?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">S. Matthew says: They crucified him between two thieves both of whom abused him by saying to him, &#8220;If you are truthful then save yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>(14) This was a great calamity. What did he say while on the cross (according to their assumption)?</p>
<p>S. Matthew says (27:46):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, &#8220;Eli, Eli, Iama sabachthani? (that is to say,) my God, my God, why has Thou forsaken me?&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a blatant declaration of disbelief according to all theological authorities. Whoever relates it to a Prophet is a disbeliever according to the revealed religions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Almighty Allah, in the Qur&#8217;ân warns, the Jews and the Christians against their blasphemy; that Jesus is an incarnation of God (Allah) or the son of God (Allah) or in rejecting him totally; and that they must believe in him as a Messenger of Allah only:</p>
<p>&#8220;And there is none of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), but must believe in him (Jesus, son of Mary, as only a Messenger of Allah and a human being), before his (Jesus <tt>alai-hiss-salaam </tt> or a Jew&#8217;s or a Christian&#8217;s) death (at the time of the appearance of the angel of death). And on the Day of Resurrection, he (Jesus) will be a witness against them.&#8221; (V.4:159).</p>
