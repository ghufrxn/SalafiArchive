<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>1- Definition of Islam</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Please, illustrate to me the meaning of Islam.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <strong>Islam</strong> means <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>total submission to Allah (Exalted be He) through belief in His Oneness, and showing subservient and servile obedience to Him</strong></span>. This is the meaning of Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabic root word ‘<strong>Aslama</strong>&#8216; means to show submission and surrender to someone and obey his commands. Accordingly, Islam means surrender and submission to Allah&#8217;s Will by means of believing in His Oneness, being devoted to Him, obeying His commandments and abandoning what He has prohibited. Such is Islam, about which Allah (Exalted be He) says: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Truly, the religion with Allah is Islam</strong></span>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Besides, a Muslims are thus called as they show complete submission to Allah and obey Him, abiding by His Commandments and refraining from what He has prohibited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam is also a name for <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>all the Commandments of Allah (Exalted be He) and His Messenger (peace be upon him)</strong></span>, including Salah (Prayer), Sawm (fast), Zakah (obligatory charity), Hajj (pilgrimage), faith and so on. Such categories fall under Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this regard, Allah (Exalted be He) says: (<span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favor upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion</b></span></span>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) also says: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers</strong></span>, )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, a Muslim is a person who submits himself to Allah (Exalted be He) as far as words, practical behavior and belief are concerned. In other words, Islam stands for total submission to and abidance by His Commandments in all aspects of life.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second Fundamental Principle: Knowledge of the Religion of Islaam</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Definition of the Religion (Ad-Deen)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الأصلُ الثَّاني: معرفةُ دينِ الإسلامِ بالأدلةِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The second fundamental principle: knowledge of the religion of Islaam with its proofs.</strong></span><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><sup>27</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">27</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh, having finished explaining knowledge of the first fundamental principle, which was knowledge of Allaah the Perfect and Most High, with the evidences, he now moves on to explaining the second fundamental principle, and it is knowledge of the religion of Islaam with the proofs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore he said, “<strong>The second fundamental principle: knowledge and awareness of the religion of Islaam with the proofs</strong>.” Then he mentioned its definition and he explained its meaning and then he mentioned its levels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, “<strong><span style="color:#000000;">knowledge of the <em>Deen</em> of Islaam</span></strong>”. <em>Ad-Deen</em> – it means obedience, for it is said about a person, <em>daana lahu</em>, when he obeys him with regard to what he commanded, and he abandons what he forbade.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the word <em>Ad-Deen</em> is used to mean <em>al-<u>H</u>isaab </em>(bringing to account or reckoning), just as occurs in His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The Sovereign Owner of the Day of Reckoning </strong></span>[1:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is said, “daanahu”, meaning he brought him to account, just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الدِّينِ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ مَا أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الدِّينِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And what will cause you to understand what is the Day of the Reckoning? Then what will cause you to understand what is the Day of the Reckoning? </strong></span>[82:17-18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: the Day of the Reckoning.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَوْمَ لَا تَمْلِكُ نَفْسٌ لِّنَفْسٍ شَيْئًا ۖ وَالْأَمْرُ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">On the Day when no soul will possess any benefit for any other soul, and the whole affair on that Day will be for Allaah.</span> </strong>[82:19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>with the proofs</strong></span>”, meaning: knowledge of the religion of Islaam cannot be by way of blind following, or by way of conjecture from the person. The religion must be based upon proofs from the Book and the Sunnah. As for the person who does not know his religion, rather he just blindly follows the rest of the people and he is just a follower of whatever the rest of the people do, then this person does not know his religion as he should, and it is quite appropriate that when he is asked in the grave, that he should say:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">هاه ، هاه ، لا أدري ، سمعت الناس يقولون شي ئا فقلته</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Haa, Haa, I do not know. I heard the people saying something, so I said it.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[Reported by al-Bukhaaree (1338) and by Muslim (2870) in abridged form from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Anas <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaah ‘anhu</em>. The full version of the <u>h</u>adeeth is reported by Aboo Daawood (4753) from a <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/10/17/punishment-of-the-grave-the-hadeeth-of-al-baraa-bin-aazib/"><u>h</u>adeeth of al-Baraa’ ibn ‘Aazib </a><em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaah‘ anhu.</em>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory on a person that he should gain knowledge and awareness of his religion with the proofs from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>, and he will not know this except through learning.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وهو الاستسلامُ له بالتوحيدِ، والانقيادِ له بالطاعةِ، والبراءةُُ مِنَ الشِّركِ وأهلِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And it is to submit to Him with <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and to yield to Him with obedience and to free oneself from <em>shirk</em> and its people</strong></span>.<span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>28</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">28</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Islaam is derived from, “<strong><em>aslama lish-shay</em></strong>”, meaning he submitted to it. As it is said in the language, “<em>aslama nafsahu lilqatl</em>”, (he submitted himself to being killed)”, meaning that he submitted to being killed. So a person did <em>islaam</em> of himself, means that he submitted to that thing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore Islaam is submitting one&#8217;s face and one&#8217;s purpose and resolve and one&#8217;s intention to Him, he the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ دِينًا مِّمَّنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ لِلَّهِ وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌ وَاتَّبَعَ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And who is better in religion than one who submits his face to Allaah and he is the doer of the good which Allaah legislated and he follows the religious way of Ibraaheem, upright and upon his way, turning away from shirk </strong></span>[4:125]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">بَلَىٰ مَنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ لِلَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Rather whoever submits his face to Allaah </strong></span>[2:112]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: he makes his deeds purely and sincerely for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and he yields to Allaah obediently and by choice and with desire and out of love.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Submitting to Allaah with <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em></strong></span>”: and it is to single out Allaah the majestic and most high with worship, and this is the meaning of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>. So whoever worships Allaah alone without attributing a partner to Him, then he has indeed submitted to Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong><span style="color:#000000;">And yielding to Him, He the Perfect with obedience</span></strong>&#8220;: regarding whatever He has commanded you with and whatever He has forbidden you from. So whatever He commanded you with then you do it and whatever He forbids you from then you avoid it, in obedience to Allaah the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>and freeing oneself from <em>shirk</em> and its people</strong></span>&#8220;: freeing oneself means cutting off from and separating from and being far removed from <em>shirk</em> and from the people of <em>shirk</em>, such that you believe the falsity of <em>shirk</em> and keep away from it. And you believe in the obligation of having enmity towards the people of <em>shirk</em> because they are enemies to Allaah, the mighty and majestic, so therefore you do not take them as beloved friends and allies, rather you take them as enemies because they are enemies to Allaah and to his Messenger and to His religion so therefore you do not have love for them and you do not have love and alliance with them rather you cut off from them with regard to the religion and you distance yourself from them and you believe in the falseness of what they are upon so therefore you do not love then with your heart and you do not aid them with your sayings and your actions, because they are enemies to your Lord, and enemies to your religion so how can you have love and alliance with them when they are enemies of Islaam?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not sufficient that you submit to Allaah and yield to him with obedience but do not free yourself from <em>shirk</em> and nor from the people of <em>shirk</em>, this will not suffice, you will not be counted as being a Muslim until you have these characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Firstly:</strong> submitting to Allaah with <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>.</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Secondly:</strong> yielding to him with obedience</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Thirdly:</strong> freeing oneself from that which opposes <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and that which opposes obedience and it is <em>shirk</em>.</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Fourthly:</strong> freeing oneself from the people of <em>shirk</em>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By actualizing these characteristics you will be a Muslim, as for if you miss out on a single characteristic from them then you will not be a Muslim. So in these three words the Shaikh summarized the definition of Islaam and how many a person does not know the meaning of Islaam because he has not learned this thing, and if it were said to him, &#8220;<strong>What is Islaam?</strong>&#8220;, he will not give you a correct response.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وهو ثلاثُ مراتبَ: الإسلامُ، والإيمانُ، والإحسانُ<strong> </strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And it is of three levels: <em>Al-Islaam</em></strong>,</span><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>29</sup> </span><span style="color:#993300;"><em>Al-Eemaan</em> and </span></strong><em><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Al-I<u>h</u>saan</strong></span> </em><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><sup>30</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">29</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of levels is ascending levels because we have said Islaam is of three levels, some of them being higher than others. The first level from the levels of the religion is Islaam, then after it comes <em>eemaan</em>, then after it comes <em>i<u>h</u>saan. </em>So therefore Islaam is broader, and <em>eemaan</em> is something more restricted than Islaam, and <em>i<u>h</u>saan</em> is more restricted than <em>eemaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the sphere of Islaam is wide, the hypocrites, they enter within it if they outwardly comply with Islaam and they outwardly display it and they outwardly adhere to it. If they pray along with the Muslims and they give the <em>zakaat </em>and they do the outward actions, then they are called Muslims and the rulings of the Muslims apply upon them in this world, so they have whatever the Muslims have and upon them will be whatever is upon the Muslims. However in the Hereafter they will be in the lowest depths of the fire because they do not have <em>eemaan</em> rather they just have outward apparent Islaam only.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">30</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, &#8220;<em>Al-Eemaan</em>&#8220;: this is the second level, and the people who have <em>eemaan</em> they vary in their levels so from them are <strong><em>Al-Muqarraboon</em></strong> (those who draw especially close through good deeds), and from them are <strong><em>Al-Abraar</em> </strong>(the righteous ones). <em>Al-Muqarraboon</em> &#8211; they are the people of the highest of the levels, and <em>Al-Abraar</em> are lesser than them, and from them there are those who are the person who is one who wronged himself, and he is the one who commits major sins which are less than <em>shirk</em>. Then he is a sinful believer or he is a believer who is deficient in <em>eemaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ أَوْرَثْنَا الْكِتَابَ الَّذِينَ اصْطَفَيْنَا مِنْ عِبَادِنَا ۖ فَمِنْهُمْ ظَالِمٌ لِّنَفْسِهِ وَمِنْهُم مُّقْتَصِدٌ وَمِنْهُمْ سَابِقٌ بِالْخَيْرَاتِ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ هُوَ الْفَضْلُ الْكَبِيرُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then we gave the Scripture as inheritance to those whom we chose from our servants. So from them are those who wrong themselves and from them are those who take a middle course and from them are those who are foremost upon good deeds by the permission of Allaah, and that is the great bounty </strong></span>[35:32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong><em>Al-I<u>h</u>saan</em></strong>”: this is the third level and it is <em>Al-I<u>h</u>saan, </em>and it is that the servant does well with regards to what is between him and Allaah, he does well in the worship of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. And the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam</em> mentioned <em>Al-I<u>h</u>saan</em>:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;">الإحسان أن تعبد الله كأنك تراه ، فإن لم تكن تراه فإنه يراك</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>“Al-I<u>h</u>saan </em></strong><strong>is that you worship Allaah as if you are seeing him and even though you do not see him then he certainly sees you&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[A part of the long hadeeth reported by al-Bukhaaree (50) and by Muslim (9 and 10) from a hadeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhu</em>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: you have certain knowledge that Allaah sees you wherever you may be.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وكلُّ مرتبةٍ لها أركانٌ</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And every level has pillars.</span><span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>31</sup></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">31</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#000000;">and every level has pillar</span>s</strong>&#8220;: pillars is the plural of a pillar, and it is that which something stands upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the pillars of something are its aspects which it stands upon, and it cannot stand without them, and they are within the thing itself, contrary to conditions, for they are outside the thing. For example the conditions of the prayer then they are outside the prayer and come before it. And as for the pillars of the prayer, then they are inside it such as the initial <em>takbeer </em>of the prayer and the recitation of al-Faati<u>h</u>ah, so if anything from them is missing, then the prayer will not be correct, just as if there was something missing from the pillars which hold up a building then it will not stand and will not be supported.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The pillars of Islaam</strong></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فأركانُ الإسلامِ خمسةٌ: شهادةُ أنْ لا إله إلاّ اللهُ، وأنَّ محمدًا رسولُ اللهِ، وإقامُ الصلاةِ، وإيتاءُ الزكاةِ، وصومُ رمضانَ، وحجُّ بيتِ اللهِ الحرامِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">So the pillars of Islaam are five, the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah, and establishing the prayer, and giving the zakaat and fasting Rama<u>d</u>aan and performing <u>H</u>ajj to Allaah’s sacred house</span></strong> <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><sup>32</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">32</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islaam will not stand except with these pillars, if they are missing than Islaam will not be upright and the rest of the acts of obedience are matters of completion for these pillars. All the actions of obedience and all good deeds are all actions of completion of these pillars and therefore when Jibreel <em>‘alaihissalaam</em> asked Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam </em>in the presence of the Companions saying:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أخبرني عن الإسلام ، قال : الإسلام أن تشهد أن لا إله إلا الله وأن محمدا رسول الله ، وتقيم الصلاة ، وتؤتي الزكاة ، وتصوم رمضان ، وتحج البيت إن استطعت إليه سبيلا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Inform me about Islaam. He replied: Islaam is that you bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah, and that you establish the prayer and that you give the <em>zakaat</em> and that you fast Rama<u>d</u>aan and that you perform <u>H</u>ajj to the house if you are able to make your way to it&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he explained Islaam to be these five pillars, however the <u>h</u>adeeth of Ibn ‘Umar makes it clear that these five are the foundations of Islaam so he <em><u>s</u>allaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam </em>said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">بني الإسلام على خمس</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Islaam is built upon five&#8221; <a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3"></a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3"></a></strong><span style="color:#999999;">[Reported by al-Bukhaaree (8) and by Muslim (16) from a hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhu</em> ]</span><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: that these five are not the whole of Islaam rather they are its pillars and its foundations which it rests upon and the rest of the legislated matters are things which perfect and complete these pillars.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> <em>Al-Walaa’ wal-Baraa’ (</em>Alliance and Dissociation)</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> </strong>الثَّالِثَةُ: أَنَّ مَنْ أَطَاعَ الرَّسُوْلَ وَوَحَّدَ اللهَ لاَ يَجُوزُ لَهُ مُوَالاَةُ مَنْ حَادَّ اللهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَلَوْ كَانَ أَقْرَبَ قَرِيبٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The third: that whoever obeys the Messenger and singles out Allaah, then it is not permissible for him to love and ally himself with those who oppose Allaah and His Messenger, even if they be those most closely related to him</strong></span>.<sup>10</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan’s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible for those who do that to have love and alliance to those who oppose Allaah and his Messenger, even if they be those most closely related to him. This is the matter of <strong><em>Al-Walaa’ wal-Baraa’ </em></strong>(Alliance and Dissociation), and it follows on from <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, from the rights of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> is to have love and alliance for the beloved servants of Allaah and to have dissociation from the enemies of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the words, “<strong><em>Al-Muwaalaat</em></strong>”, and, “<strong><em>Al-Walaa’</em></strong>”, have one and the same meaning, and, “<em><strong>Al-Walaa</strong>’</em>”, means having love in the heart, and it means aiding and assisting, and it means, in the matter of inheriting and payment of blood-monies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Muslim he loves and has alliance for the beloved servants of Allaah, meaning that he restricts his love to those who are beloved and obedient servants of Allaah, and he aids them, so the Muslim is with the Muslims, they are allies to each other. Just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَأُولُو الْأَرْحَامِ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلَىٰ بِبَعْضٍ فِي كِتَابِ اللَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And blood-relations are more entitled to inheritance from each other as decreed by Allaah. </strong></span>[8:75]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So payment of blood-monies for accidental killing occurs between the Muslims, and it is what is called mutual responsibility. All of this enters into alliance, so there is no alliance between a Muslim and an unbeliever, and love and aiding and inheriting and payment of blood-money and guardianship in marriage and guardianship in legal matters and so on, this does not occur between a Muslim and a disbeliever, rather this is between the Muslims, because of his saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَن يَجْعَلَ اللَّهُ لِلْكَافِرِينَ عَلَى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ سَبِيلًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And Allaah will never give a way to the unbelievers over the believers. </strong></span>[4:141]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory that the believers are distinguished from the disbelievers, so it is not permissible for one who singles out Allaah and obeys the Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> to have love and alliance with those who oppose Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And, <strong>“<em>Al-Mu<u>h</u>aaddah</em>”</strong>(opposing), means that the person is upon one side, and Allaah and His Messenger and the believers are on the other side, and those who oppose are upon the side of the unbelievers in this opposition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>Even if that person is the most closely related to him</strong>”: meaning in lineage. So if your close relative is one who opposes Allaah and His Messenger, then it is obligatory upon you to oppose him and to cut off from him, and whoever is an obedient servant of Allaah and an ally to His Messenger, then it is obligatory upon you that you should love him and have alliance with him, even if he be far removed from you in lineage, even if he be a non-arab, or a black person, or a white person, or a red person, it is obligatory upon you to have love and alliance for him and that you love him, whether he is from your land, or whether he is from the farthest place in the East, or the farthest place in the West. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَالْمُؤْمِنُونَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَاتُ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلِيَاءُ بَعْضٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the believing men and the believing women are friends and allies to each other. </strong></span>[9:71]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: between them there is love and mutual help and mutual aid, and between them there is to be affection, this is between the believers.</p>
<hr />
<p>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَّا تَجِدُ قَوْمًا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ يُوَادُّونَ مَنْ حَادَّ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَلَوْ كَانُوا آبَاءَهُمْ أَوْ أَبْنَاءَهُمْ أَوْ إِخْوَانَهُمْ أَوْ عَشِيرَتَهُمْ ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ كَتَبَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمُ الْإِيمَانَ وَأَيَّدَهُم بِرُوحٍ مِّنْهُ ۖ وَيُدْخِلُهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا ۚ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُوا عَنْهُ ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ حِزْبُ اللَّهِ ۚ أَلَا إِنَّ حِزْبَ اللَّهِ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You will not find a people who truly believe in Allaah and the Last Day loving those who oppose Allaah and His Messenger even if they are their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kinsfolk. Rather Allaah has ordained true faith for their hearts and has strengthened them with strength from Him and He will enter them into gardens which have rivers flowing beneath their trees they shall remain forever therein. Allaah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. They are the party of Allaah. Indeed the party of Allaah are the ones who will be successful. </strong></span>[58:22]<sup>11</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]: <strong>Shaykh Fawzan’s Explanation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>لَّا تَجِدُ</strong> </span>“<strong>You will not find</strong>”: this is an address to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>meaning: this will not happen and will never exist, that one who is a true believer in Allaah and His Messenger will love the disbelievers, so if a person does love them, then he is not a true believer, even if he claims to be.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn-ul-Qayyim <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said in <em>Al-Kaafiyat-ush-Shaafiyah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>Do you love the enemies of the beloved One and still claim,</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>That you love Him? That is not possible</em><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>And likewise you strive hard to oppose those He loves,</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>Where is the love O brother of Satan?</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is not possible ever, that he loves the disbelievers, whilst he says, “I love Allaah and His Messenger”, because of His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تَتَّخِذُوا عَدُوِّي وَعَدُوَّكُمْ أَوْلِيَاءَ تُلْقُونَ إِلَيْهِم بِالْمَوَدَّةِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you who believe do not take My enemies and your enemies as friends and allies, for whom you have affection </strong></span>[60:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Up until His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قَدْ كَانَتْ لَكُمْ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ فِي إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَالَّذِينَ مَعَهُ إِذْ قَالُوا لِقَوْمِهِمْ إِنَّا بُرَآءُ مِنكُمْ وَمِمَّا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ كَفَرْنَا بِكُمْ وَبَدَا بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكُمُ الْعَدَاوَةُ وَالْبَغْضَاءُ أَبَدًا حَتَّىٰ تُؤْمِنُوا بِاللَّهِ وَحْدَهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There is for you a fine example in Ibraaheem and those with him, when they said to their people, “We are free of you and whatever you worship besides Allaah, we have rejected you, and there has appeared between us and you enmity and hatred forever until you truly believe in Allaah and single Him out with all worship. </strong></span>[60:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا كَانَ اسْتِغْفَارُ إِبْرَاهِيمَ لِأَبِيهِ إِلَّا عَن مَّوْعِدَةٍ وَعَدَهَا إِيَّاهُ فَلَمَّا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ أَنَّهُ عَدُوٌّ لِّلَّهِ تَبَرَّأَ مِنْهُ ۚ إِنَّ إِبْرَاهِيمَ لَأَوَّاهٌ حَلِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And Ibraaheem’s seeking forgiveness for his father was only because of a promise which he had made to him. So when it became clear to him that he was an enemy to Allaah, then he dissociated himself from him. Indeed Ibraaheem is one who frequently supplicated to His Lord and who was forbearing. </strong></span>[9:114]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the religious way of Ibraaheem. He dissociated himself from his father, the closest of the people to him, when it became clear to him that he was an enemy to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>aayah</em> shows that <span style="color:#ff0000;">having love for an unbeliever negates true faith in Allaah and in the Last Day, either in its very origin, or with regards to its completion</span>. However, if love of them has with it supporting what they are upon and their unbelief, then this is to exit from the fold of Islaam, but if it is just having love without aiding them, then this is counted as something which causes a person’s <em>eemaan</em> (belief) to be deficient and is <em>fisq</em> (open sin) and something which weakens <em>eemaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is said that this aayah came down with regard to Aboo ‘Ubaidah ibn al-Jarraa<u>h</u> <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhu, </em>when he killed his father on the day of Badr, because his father was upon unbelief, and he wanted to kill his son Aboo ‘Ubaidah, but Aboo ‘Ubaidah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhu </em>killed him, because he was an enemy to Allaah and he was not prevented by that fact that it was his father, that did not prevent him from killing him out of anger for the sake of Allaah the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>Those ones</strong>”: meaning those who keep away from loving and having affection for those oppose Allaah and His Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">كَتَبَ فِي قُلُوبِهِمُ الْإِيمَانَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He</strong> (Allaah)<strong> ordained <em>eemaan</em> for their hearts </strong></span>[58:22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning Allaah confirmed and firmly planted <em>eemaan</em> in their hearts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَيَّدَهُم بِرُوحٍ مِّنْهُ ۖ وَيُدْخِلُهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He strengthened them with a <em>Roo<u>h</u></em> from Him, and He willl enter them into gardens beneath which rivers flow.</strong></span>[58:22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>At-Ta’yeed </em></strong>means strengthening, He strengthened them with a <em>Roo<u>h</u></em> from Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the word <em>Ar-Roo<u>h</u></em> has a number of different usages in the Qur’aan, from them is <em>Ar-Roo<u>h</u></em> which is the <strong>spirit</strong> through which there is life, and from them is <strong>revelation</strong> as occurs in His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَكَذَٰلِكَ أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ رُوحًا مِّنْ أَمْرِنَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And likewise We sent down by revelation to you a <em>Roo<u>h</u></em> </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(revelation)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> by Our command.</span> </strong>[42:52]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them is Jibreel <em>‘alaihissalaam</em>, that he is <em>Roo<u>h</u>-ul-Qudus</em> (the Pure Spirit), and <em>Ar-Roo<u>h</u>-ul-’Ameen </em>(the Trustworthy Spirit).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ نَزَّلَهُ رُوحُ الْقُدُسِ مِن رَّبِّكَ بِالْحَقِّ لِيُثَبِّتَ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَهُدًى وَبُشْرَىٰ لِلْمُسْلِمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: the Pure Spirit </strong>(Jibreel <em>‘alaihissalaam</em>)<strong> brought it</strong> (the Qur’aan)<strong> down from your Lord in truth, to make those who believe firm and as guidance and as good news for the Muslims </strong>(those who submit to Allaah’s commands) </span>[16:102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">نَزَلَ بِهِ الرُّوحُ الْأَمِينُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The Trustworthy Spirit</strong> (Jibreel <em>‘alaihissalaam</em>) <strong>descended with it</strong> (the Qur’aan)<strong>. </strong></span>[26:193]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them is what occurs in this <em>aayah </em>and it is <strong>strength</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, “<em>Ayyadahum</em> <em>bi roo<u>h</u>imminh</em>”, meaning with strength from Him, He the Perfect and Most High, strength of true faith in the world, and in the hereafter:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَيُدْخِلُهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He will enter them into gardens</strong></span> [58:22]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The plural of <em>jannaah, </em>and the <em>jannah</em> in the language, it means a garden. It is called a <em>jannaah </em>because it is <em>mujtannun bil-ashjaar</em> (hidden or concealed by trees), meaning hidden and covered by intertwined trees, because paradise contains shade and trees and rivers and palaces, and its highest part and its ceiling is the Throne of the Most Merciful, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">With rivers flowing beneath it they will remain therein forever</span> </strong>[58:22]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, they will remain in it and will not move away from it. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> لَا يَبْغُونَ عَنْهَا حِوَلًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They will not want to move away from it </strong></span>[18:108]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They will not fear death and they will not have to fear anyone forcing them out or evicting them, as occurs in this world. A person in this world may live in palaces, however he is not secure from death so that he has to depart from them, nor is he secure from enemies overcoming him and expelling him. A person in this world is always fearful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُوا عَنْهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him </strong></span>[58:22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since they angered their close relatives who were unbelievers and had enmity towards them, so they will receive in replacement the pleasure of Allaah the Perfect and Most  High, Allaah will be pleased with them and they are pleased with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> أُولَٰئِكَ حِزْبُ اللَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They are the party of Allaah</strong></span> [58:22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: the group of people for Allaah, and as for the disbelievers, then they are the party of Satan, just as Allaah the Most High said about them:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> أُولَٰئِكَ حِزْبُ الشَّيْطَانِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They are the party of Satan</span> </strong>[58:19]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning the group of people for Satan and the helpers of Satan. As for those people (i.e. the believers) then they are the supporters of the Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this matter relates to having enmity towards the disbelievers and not having love and alliance for them. And it does not necessitate that we cut off from the disbelievers in social matters and matters of worldly benefit. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Rather a number of affairs are an exception to that:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The first one is: </strong></span>that along with our hatred of them and our enmity to them, then it is obligatory that we call them to Allaah the Perfect and Most High. It is obligatory that we call them to Allaah and we do not leave them and just say, “They are enemies of Allaah and our enemies.” It is obligatory upon us that we call them to Allaah so perhaps Allaah may guide them. And if they do not respond, then we fight them along with the ability.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> So either then they will enter into Islaam, or they will pay the <em>jizyah</em> (an amount of money that is given over to the Muslims), if they are from the Jews and Christians or the Magians, whilst they are humbled and submitting to the rule of Islaam, and they are then left upon what they are upon. However, with the condition that they <em>jizyah</em> is handed over and that they submit to the rule of Islaam. However, if they are not people of the Two Books and they are not Magians, then there is disagreement between the scholars about taking <em>jizyah</em> from them.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> [Meaning the Muslims united under a Muslim ruler, i.e. the army of Muslims, with the ability to do so.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Secondly</span>: </strong>there is nothing to prevent having a truce with the unbelievers when there is a need, if the Muslims have need of it, because of the fact that the Muslims are not able to fight against them, and there is fear for the Muslims from their evil, then there is no harm in having a truce until the Muslims become strong enough to fight them, or if they request a truce:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِن جَنَحُوا لِلسَّلْمِ فَاجْنَحْ لَهَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if they incline towards peace, then you incline to it </strong></span>[8:61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then a truce is made with them. However it will not be a perpetual truce, rather a temporary peace with a time-limit in accordance with the view of the ruler of the Muslims regarding what is beneficial.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Thirdly</span>: </strong>there is nothing to prevent returning their fine treatment, if they treat the Muslims well, there is nothing to prevent returning their fine treatment. Allaah the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَّا يَنْهَاكُمُ اللَّهُ عَنِ الَّذِينَ لَمْ يُقَاتِلُوكُمْ فِي الدِّينِ وَلَمْ يُخْرِجُوكُم مِّن دِيَارِكُمْ أَن تَبَرُّوهُمْ وَتُقْسِطُوا إِلَيْهِمْ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُحِبُّ الْمُقْسِطِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah does not forbid you from those who do not fight against you with regard to the religion and who do not expel you from your homes from treating them well and treating them with justice. Allaah loves those who treat the people justly. </strong></span>[60:8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Fourthly</span>: </strong>the father who is a disbeliever, it is obligatory upon his son who is Muslim to treat him well. However he should not obey him with regard to unbelief, because of His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَوَصَّيْنَا الْإِنسَانَ بِوَالِدَيْهِ حَمَلَتْهُ أُمُّهُ وَهْنًا عَلَىٰ وَهْنٍ وَفِصَالُهُ فِي عَامَيْنِ أَنِ اشْكُرْ لِي وَلِوَالِدَيْكَ إِلَيَّ الْمَصِيرُ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِن جَاهَدَاكَ عَلَىٰ أَن تُشْرِكَ بِي مَا لَيْسَ لَكَ بِهِ عِلْمٌ فَلَا تُطِعْهُمَا ۖ وَصَاحِبْهُمَا فِي الدُّنْيَا مَعْرُوفًا ۖ وَاتَّبِعْ سَبِيلَ مَنْ أَنَابَ إِلَيَّ ۚ ثُمَّ إِلَيَّ مَرْجِعُكُمْ فَأُنَبِّئُكُم بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We commanded man to treat his parents well, his mother bore him upon a state of weakness and hardship upon weakness and hardship, and his weaning was in two years. We enjoin him to give thanks to Me and to your parents, to Me is your return. And if they strive to make you associate something along with Me, that which you have no knowledge of, then do not obey them, but live along with them in this world in a good manner and follow the path of those who turn to Me</span>. </strong>[31:14-15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The parent has a right, even if he is an unbeliever. However, you should not love him with love of the heart, rather you recompense him for having brought you up and for the fact that he is a father and he has a right,so you recompense him for that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Fifthly</span>: </strong>having mutual business dealings with them, and buying needs from them, and importing goods and weapons from them by paying their price, there is no harm in that. And the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>used to have dealings with the disbelievers. Likewise he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> dealt with the people of Khaibar and they were Jews upon the basis that they would farm the land in exchange for a part of its produce. This is not from alliance and love, rather it is affairs of mutual benefit. It is obligatory that we are aware of these matters, and that they do not enter into love and alliance and are not something prohibited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise taking a loan from them, the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>took some food from a Jew as a debt and he left his coat of armour as a surety with him and he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>died and his coat of armour was left as a surety with the Jew, for some food which he bought for his family. There is nothing to prevent this because these are worldly matters and matters of welfare and it does not indicate love and affection in the hearts. So we must differentiate between this and this, because there are some people, who when he hears the texts of enmity towards the unbelievers and not loving them, then he may understand that he cannot have any dealings with them and cannot have any connection with them whatsoever, and that there is to be a total cut-off from them. No, this is something limited by rulings and limits and conditions which are well known with the people of knowledge, which are taken from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Sixthly</span>: </strong>Allaah has permitted marriage to the women of the people of the Book with the condition that they are chaste with regard to their honour and dignity. And Allaah has made permissible for us to eat the meat slaughtered by them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Seventhly</span>:</strong> that there is no harm in responding to their invitations and eating their food which is permissible, just as the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Eighthly</span>: </strong>is treating neighbours who are disbelievers well, because they have the right of being neighbours.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Ninthly</span>:</strong> it is not permissible to wrong or oppress them. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَا يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شَنَآنُ قَوْمٍ عَلَىٰ أَلَّا تَعْدِلُوا ۚ اعْدِلُوا هُوَ أَقْرَبُ لِلتَّقْوَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And let not hatred of a people prevent you from treating them justly. Do justice, it is closer to <em>taqwaa</em> </strong>(dutifulness to Allaah)<strong>. </strong></span>[5:8]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 5: Is it permissible for a Muslim who believes in one God to participate in the wedding ceremonies of Mushriks (those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship), and help them arrange such ceremonies on account of a blood or marriage relationship, or the like? Also, is it permissible to attend their funerals, without praying for their dead, and the burial? Is it permissible to sit and commiserate with them?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ans:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is not permissible to share in their occasions, which involve Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) or Bid`ah (innovation in Islam). </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Moreover, it is not permissible to follow their funeral processions; because this is a type of forbidden association with them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 2:</strong> <span style="color:#993300;">Is there a meaning for &#8216;Ibaadah (worship) such that it is possible for us to know of? Does it have a general and a specific meaning?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong> Yes. Its general meaning is as I have indicated earlier, namely the submission to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, with love and awe by doing that which He commands and avoiding that which He has forbidden, and in the manner set forth by His legislations. This is the general meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The specific meaning, i.e. its meaning in detail, then, as Shaykh-ul-Islaam ibn Taymeeyah said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It is a comprehensive name covering whatever Allaah loves and is pleased with, both sayings and actions, the apparent and the hidden, such as fearing (Khawf), having awe (Khashyah), having true trust and reliance (Tawakkul), Prayers (Salaat), Zakaat (obligatory charity), Fasting (Siyaam) and the like, from the ordinances of Islaam.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then if you mean that the general and specific meaning [of &#8216;Ibaadah] is what has been mentioned by some scholars, namely that &#8216;Ibaadah is either <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Kawniyyah</strong> </span>or <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Shar&#8217;iyyah</span></strong>, meaning that man could be in a Kawniyyah and Shar&#8217;iyyah state of submission to Allaah, then the Kawniyyah worship is a general one, comprising the believer and unbeliever and the righteous as well as the wicked, due to the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes to Ar-Rahmaan as a slave.</span> [Qur&#8217;aan, soorat Maryam (19): 93].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore all that is in the heavens and the earth is, in the universal sense (Kawnee), submitting to Allaah, The One free from all imperfection. None can stand to oppose Allaah or work against Him in whatever He wants as to His Universal Will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As to the specific worship, <strong>al-&#8216;Ibaadah ash-Shari&#8217;yyah</strong>, which is the submission to Allaah, the Most High&#8217;s, Shar'(legislation), then this is specific to the believers in Allaah, the One free of all imperfection, who carry out His Command. Then some of this is more specific and some is less. The more specific worship is like that of the Messengers &#8216;alyayhimussalaatu was salaam as signified in the Saying of Allaah, The Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Blessed be He Who sent down the criterion (of right and wrong, i.e. this Qur&#8217;aan) to His slave (Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم).</span> [Qur&#8217;aan, sooart al-Furqaan (25): 1].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And if you (Arab pagans, Jews, and Christians) are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down (i.e. Qur&#8217;aan) to Our slave (Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم), then produce a Soorah of the like thereof and call your witnesses (supporters and helpers) besides Allaah, if you are truthful.</span> [Qur&#8217;aan, soorat al-Baqarah (2): 23],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And remember Our slaves, Ibraaheem, Ishaaq, and Ya&#8217;qoob, [all] owners of strength [in worshipping Us] and [also] of religious understanding,</span> [Qur&#8217;aan, soorat Saad (38): 45]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the likes of these ayaat describe the Messengers, &#8216;alayhimus-salaat was-salaam, with al-&#8216;Uboodiyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 3:</strong> <span style="color:#993300;">Would those specifically choosing al-&#8216;Ibaadah al-Kawniyyah and excluding al-&#8216;Ibaadah ash-Shar&#8217;iyya, be rewarded?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer</strong>: Those will not be rewarded for it, because they are submitting to Allaah willingly or unwillingly. And so man may get sick, turn poor, and lose(s) his beloved ones having no desire whatsoever for this. In fact, he dislikes it. But this is submission to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, in the universal (Kawnee) sense.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="art">Man always looks for what benefits him and what protects him from harm. However, to accomplish this, man must be able to realize what is harmful. He must then know whom he should need, trust, and love so that he can attain what is beneficial as well as to feel good about his choice. He also must know the proper and good approach that would make him achieve this goal. This latter condition requires that man:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="art">1.Know about harm<br />
2.What ways can be used to drive harm away</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="art">Certainly, man can have no better guidance than that which comes from the One Who had perfected everything, and the One who Has no deficiency in Himself and in His Attributes. The One Who is Ever-Living and Who does not die. There can be no One better than the One Who Has no need for anything; the One Who is rich; the Giver; the One who, after all, controls man&#8217;s soul. Man is so poor to Him. He is Allaah, the True and only God. Man can bring harm to himself if he seeks other than Allaah for help. Allaah is the One Who can help man drive away any harm for it cannot occur without His Will and His Power.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) sent down His Books and chose His Messengers to guide man to:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1.Know His Lord as He (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) had explained about Himself, and<br />
2.Seek Him Alone while living in accordance with His plan</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowing Allaah&#8217;s Names and Attributes liberates man from worshiping any form of creation because creation is weak and is in need of The Creator, Allaah. The knowledge about Allaah leads man to know that he is created to live according to Allaah&#8217;s way as revealed to the last Messenger Muhammad . This Revelation contains a complete code of life. Everything that is beneficial or harmful is established so that man can center his life around this Revelation. If man commits wrong and knows that Allaah is Oft-Forgiving he would turn to Him and to Him alone seeking His forgiveness:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Know, therefore, that there is no God Who deserves to be worshiped except  Allaah; and ask forgiveness for your sins.&#8221;</strong>      (Qur&#8217;an, 47:19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="art">It is wrong to think or believe that Allaah created other &#8216;gods&#8217; besides Him so that man turns to them for help; loves them or fear them, etc. He is the same God of all nations. He does not order that people should make of stars, sun, fire, Jesus, Moses, etc. gods besides Him. He (Most Exalted) cannot be &#8216;contradictory&#8217;. He has one way (religion) that calls man to surrender his will only to Him. He warned that if man (even Muhammad  would take partners with Him, then his work will fail and will be among losers:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And verily, it had been revealed to you (O Muhammad ) as  has been revealed to those before you. If you join others in worship with Allaah (then) surely (all) your deeds will be in vain and you will certainly be among the losers. Nay!  But worship Allaah and be among grateful.&#8221;</strong>(Qur&#8217;an, 39:65-66)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="art">Let us know what Muhammad , the man-Prophet, who knew Allaah best, used to say:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;O Allaah, I seek refuge in You for Your Pleasure and against Your Wrath,and in Your Forgiveness and against Your Punishment and in You from You, I cannot Praise You as You can Praise Yourself.&#8221;</em> (Muslim, Abu Dawoud, at-Tirmidhi, ibn Majah)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;I have surrendered myself to You, I have directed my face to You, I have entrusted my affairs to You, I have compelled my back to refuge in You, in want and in fright of You, there is no resort nor survival from You except (in turning) to You. I have faith in Your book (i.e. the Qur&#8217;an) which You brought down and in the Prophet (Muhammad ) you have sent.&#8221;</em> (Al-Bukhari, Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="art">When we read in the Qur&#8217;an that:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;Whatever of Mercy (i.e. of good), Allaah may grant to mankind,  none can withhold it, and whatever He may withhold, none can  grant it thereafter. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.&#8221;</strong>   (Qur&#8217;an, 35:2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="art">And when we read that:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;If Allaah touches you with hurt, there is none can remove it but He; and if He intends any good for you, there is none who can repel His favor which He causes it to reach homsoever of His slaves He will, and He is the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221;</strong> (Qur&#8217;an, 10:117)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="art">We should be motivated to return to Him Alone at times of ease and at times of hardship.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when we read that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;If Allaah helps you none can overcome you, and if He forsakes you, who is there, after Him, that can help you. And in Allaah (alone) let believers put their trust.&#8221; </strong>(Qur&#8217;an, 3:160)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="art">The Qur&#8217;an, therefore, leads man to a true liberation from any false attachment. It brings peace to the heart. It helps the believer against hypocrisy and all forms of dishonesty. Imagine, for example, a believer facing a problem at work. He sees wrong and faces unlawful practices. He does not fear rejecting what is wrong. He knows that the job is only a means to gain his sustenance. While he may be unable to correct what is wrong, he knows well that Allaah is the One Who provides. If he leaves his job for the sake of Allaah, Allaah will give him a better one. Allaah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him. He will make a way for him to get out (from) every (difficulty), and He will provide him from (sources) he could never imagine.&#8221;</strong>(Qur&#8217;an, 65:2-3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="art">The above texts, necessitates that man must depend upon Allaah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) asking Him Alone for assistance. It also requires that man must love Allaah and worship Him Alone to gain His pleasure and His help. Is it not true that the people who consider this life as the &#8220;Final Goal&#8221; end up worshiping many things in it? You see them so careful about &#8220;having it all&#8221;. They torture themselves: pain, difficulty, constant worry, keeping their hands in the banks for loan after loan to keep up with the &#8220;demands of development&#8221;. They are under the constant threat of fore-closure. They constantly see poverty in front of their eyes. The Prophet  said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;Allaah says: &#8216;Son of Adam: Fill your time with My worship and I will fill your heart with richness, and end off your poverty. But if you donot, I would make your hands fully busy (i.e. in worldly affairs) and I would not end off your poverty.'&#8221;</em> (At-Tirmidhi said that it is a good hadeeth)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="art">Our purpose of existence on earth is more meaningful than being slaves to worldly gains. There can be no meaningful life better than that prescribed by our Creator Allaah. Every act done according to Allaah&#8217;s way is an act of worship. Man is the beneficiary and Allaah is in no need:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O mankind! It is you who stand in need of Allaah, but Allaah is Rich (Free of all wants and needs), Worthy of All Praise.&#8221;</strong> (Qur&#8217;an, 35:15)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">’<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Abd</strong> </span>[Lit. ‘slave’]. Mankind and Jinn are ‘<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ibaad</strong> </span>(singl.‘abd) of Allaah meaning they surrender to Allaah’s Universal Pre-decree, none is able to escape His Pre-ordainment, because they are a Creation of His. So, whether believers or non-believers in Allaah, they are, in the general sense, slaves [‘Ibaad] of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Exalted, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto Ar- Rahmaan (the One Whose Mercy encompasses everything) as a slave.&#8221;</em> </span>[Qur’aan, soorat Maryam (19): 93].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The believer, however, who devotes his worship to Allaah alone, is distinguished as being a “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>slave-worshipper</strong></span>” to Allaah. In this sense, the term ‘Abd is specific as being the “slaveworshipper” of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The slave (‘Abd) of Allaah, who obeys Allaah, is a “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>worshipping slave</strong></span>.” In the general sense, he is part of the creation and thus he is also a “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>submissive slave</strong></span>.” The Kaafir, however, is a “submissive ‘Abd” in the general sense only. The believing slaves fulfill the exclusive meaning of the ‘Uboodiyyah. And the‘Uboodiyyah of the Messengers (‘alayhimus- Salaam: May Allaah protect them from all kinds of evil) is the very special slavery to Allaah, Most High. None can compete with the Messengers’ degree of ‘Uboodiyyah to Allaah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&#8216;Uthaymeen<br />
Sharh Usoolul-Eemaan (pp.4-7)<br />
Al-Istiqaamah magazine , Issue No.1 &#8211; Dhul-Hijjah 1416H / May 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh said in <i>Sharh Usoolul-Eemaan</i> (pp.4-7):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] <b>The deen (religion) of Islaam</b>: It is the way of life that Allaah sent the Prophet Muhammad <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> with. By it, Allaah terminated the validity of all other religions, perfected this religion for His worshippers, completed His favour upon them and has chosen only this religion for them &#8211; no other religion will be accepted by Him from anyone. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Muhammad is not the father of any man amongst you. Rather he is the Messenger of Allaah and the khaatim (last and final) of the Prophets.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:40].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islaam as your religion.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:3].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed the religion with Allaah is Islaam.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan 3:19].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Whosoever seeks a religion other than Islaam, never will it be accepted from him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan 3:85].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; obligated all of mankind to take Islaam as their religion. So Allaah said, whilst addressing His Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Say: O Mankind! Indeed I have been sent to you all as the Messenger of Allaah; to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. None has the right to be worshipped except Him; it is He who gives life and cause death. So believe in Allaah and His Messenger &#8211; the Prophet who can neither read nor write &#8211; who believes in Allaah and His Words. So follow the Messenger of Allaah so that you may be rightly-guided.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-A&#8217;raaf 7:158].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in <i>Saheeh Muslim</i> (1/93), from Abu Hurayrah <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;By Him in whose Hand is the life of Muhammad! There is no one from this nation, be he a Jew or a Christian, who hears of me and dies whilst not having eemaan (faith) in what I have been sent with, except that he will be one of the companions of the Hellfire.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <i>eemaan</i> (faith) in the Prophet implies: affirming that which he was sent with, along with acceptance of it and submission to it. Without these two matters, mere affirmation is not sufficient. This is why even though Abu Taalib (the Prophet&#8217;s uncle) affirmed what was sent to the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and that Islaam was the best of religions, yet he did not accept his message nor submit to it; and thus he did not have <i>eemaan</i> in the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] <b>The religion of Islaam</b> contains all that was beneficial from the previous religions. It is suitable for implementation in any age, any where and by any nation. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said, whilst addressing His Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And We have sent down to you the Book in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it, testifying to the truth contained therein whilst exposing the falsehood that has been added therein.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:48].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That Islaam is suitable for implementation in any age, any where and by any nation does not mean that it becomes submissive to nations &#8211; being altered and changed by them &#8211; as some people falsely think. But rather it means that whenever it is truly adhered to then it brings benefit and goodness to that nation, as well as reforming and correcting it &#8211; in whatever age or place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] <b>The religion of Islaam</b> is the religion of truth. It is the way of life that Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; guaranteed His help and victory to those who truly adhere to it, and that He would make it dominant over all other religions. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;It is He who has sent His Messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth, that it may prevail over all other religions, even if the pagans detest it.&#8221;</b> [Soorah at-Tawbah 9:33].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allaah has promised to those amongst you who truly have <i>eemaan</i> (true faith and belief) and act in obedience to Allaah and His Messenger, that He will grant them ruler ship upon the earth, just as He granted it to those before them, and that He will establish their Religion for them and grant them the authority to practice their Religion which He chose and ordered them with. And He will certainly change their situation to one of security, after their fear. Providing that they worship and obey Me, not associating anything else in worship with Me. Then, whoever rejects this favour by disobedience to their Lord &#8211; then they are the rebellious transgressors.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Noor 24:55].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] The religion of Islaam is a complete religion comprising both <i>&#8216;aqeedah</i> (beliefs) and <i>sharee&#8217;ah</i> (laws).</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>It commands them with <i>tawheed</i> (to single out Allaah alone for worship) and prohibits them from shirk (associating partners with Allaah, in that which is particular to Him).</li>
<li>It commands them with being truthful and prohibits them from lying.</li>
<li>It commands them with <i>&#8216;adl</i> (justice) and prohibits them from injustice and oppression.</li>
<li>It commands them with fulfilling trusts and prohibits them from acting treacherously.</li>
<li>It commands them keeping promises and prohibits them from breaking them.</li>
<li>It commands them with kindness and good treatment of parents and prohibits them from disobedience to them in that which is not sinful.</li>
<li>It commands them with joining the ties of relations and prohibits them from severing them.</li>
<li>It commands them with good treatment of neighbours and prohibits the causing of harm to them.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In short, Islaam orders alls that is good, from manners and morals, and prohibits all that is evil from it. Likewise, it orders all actions which are righteous and good and prohibits all actions that are evil and harmful. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed Allaah enjoins upon you justice, kindness and the giving of good to relatives and near ones. And He prohibits you from all shameful and evil deeds, oppression and transgression. Thus He admonishes you, that you may take heed and be reminded.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nahl 16:90].</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh &#8216;Abdul-Muhsin bin Hamad Al-&#8216;Abbaad<br />
His treatise &#8220;<i>Fadlus-Salaat &#8216;alaan-Nabee</i>&#8221; (pg. 11-15)<br />
Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Meaning of Salaat on the Prophet:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Salaat of Allaah upon His Prophet has been interpreted to mean His praising of him before the angels, while the Salaat of the angels upon him has been interpreted to mean their supplication for him. This is the way Abul-&#8216;Aaliyah (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) has defined it as mentioned by Al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh in the introduction of the chapter on <b>&#8220;Verily, Allaah and His angels send their Salaat upon the Prophet. O you who believe, send your Salaat upon him as well as Salaam.&#8221;</b> [Surah Al-Ahzaab: 56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the explanation of the angels&#8217; sending Salaat upon the Prophet, Al-Bukhaaree reported the following saying of Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>), after mentioning the (above) interpretation of Abul-&#8216;Aaliyah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;To &#8216;send their Salaat&#8217; </b>means to send their blessings.&#8221; Meaning: They supplicate for him to be blessed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Salaat of Allaah on the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) has also been explained as meaning His Forgiveness and Mercy on him. Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr quoted many narrations (from the Salaf) in his <i>Fat&#8217;h-ul-Baaree</i> concerning this. He afterward commented on the Salaat being defined as such, saying: &#8220;The most preferable and likely of these opinions (concerning the definition of Salaat) is that which was mentioned previously from Abul-&#8216;Aaliyah that the meaning of Allaah&#8217;s Salaat on His Prophet is His praising and honoring of him, while the Salaat of the angels, as well as everyone else, upon him means their requesting the same thing (i.e. praise and honor) for him from Allaah. However, what is intended here by their request is that of an increase in praise and honor and not the same amount as intended by the original Salaat.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh (Ibn Hajr) said: &#8220;Al-Haleemee said in <i>ash-Shu&#8217;ab</i>: &#8216;The meaning of Allaah&#8217;s Salaat on the Prophet is His extolling of him.&#8217; So what is meant by our statement: &#8216;<i>Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Muhammad&#8217;</i> is &#8216;O Allaah, Exalt Muhammad.&#8217; What is intended by this is: Extolling him in the worldly life with the highest form of remembrance, while manifesting his Religion and preserving his legislation. As regards to the Hereafter, what is intended by it is that he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) be given tremendous reward, granted the ability to intercede on behalf of his ummah and that his virtue be manifested in the praiseworthy station.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So based on this, what is meant by Allaah&#8217;s statement <b>&#8220;Send your Salaat upon him&#8221; </b>is: &#8220;Invoke your Lord to send His Salaat on him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great scholar, Ibn Al-Qayyim said in his book &#8220;<i>Jalaa-ul-Afhaam fis-Salaati was-Salaam &#8216;alaa Khair-il-Anaam</i>&#8221; while discussing the meaning of the Salaat of Allaah and His Angels on His Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) and His commanding the believing servants to send their Salaat on him, after refuting the claim that the meaning of Salaat is Mercy and Forgiveness:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Rather, the Salaat that the people were commanded with in it &#8211; i.e. the ayah in Surah Al-Ahzaab &#8211; is a request to Allaah that he implements what He has informed us about concerning His Salaat and the Salaat of the Angels, and that is: Praising him, manifesting his virtue and nobility, and seeking to honor and elevate him.&#8221; So it consists of a notification and a request. This asking and supplicating on our part was called &#8220;Salaat on him&#8221; for two reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>First: </b>It entails that when a person sends Salaat on him, he is praising him and extolling the mention of his virtue and nobility, as well as desiring and loving for Allaah that He do the same. So it consists of a notification (i.e. of a person&#8217;s praises) as well as a request (from Allaah that He send His praises).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Second: </b>Such an action was called Salaat from us due to the fact that we are asking Allaah to send His Salaat on him (i.e. the Prophet). So therefore, the meaning of Allaah&#8217;s Salaat on the Prophet is His praising of him in order to elevate his remembrance and rank with Allaah, while the meaning of our Salaat on the Prophet is: Asking Allaah to do that (i.e. the above) for him.&#8221; [End of Ibn Al-Qayyim&#8217;s words]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Meaning of Salaam on the Prophet:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the meaning of Salaam on the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>), Al-Majd Al-Fayrooz Abaadee said in his book <i>As-Silaatu wal-Bushr fis-Salaati &#8216;alaa Khair-il-Bashr</i>: &#8220;It means: As-Salaam &#8211; which is one of Allaah&#8217;s Names &#8211; be upon you. And the interpretation of that is: &#8216;May you not be void of goodness and blessing, and may you be safe from detestable and harmful things. This is since a Name of Allaah is only mentioned upon certain things in the hopes of gathering all of the meanings of good and blessing for those things, and to remove the occurrence of defects and corruption from those things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is befitting that the Salaam (here) take on the meaning of <i>Salaamah </i>(i.e. peace/safety). Meaning: May Allaah&#8217;s divine decree on you be that of peace and security &#8211; i.e. May you be safe and secure from blemishes and defects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if you say: &#8216;O Allaah, send your Salaam on Muhammad&#8217;, then what you intend from this is: &#8216;O Allaah, decree for Muhammad &#8211; with regard to his Call, ummah and remembrance &#8211; safety and absolvement from every defect. Thus throughout the passage of time, let his Call increase in status, his ummah in numbers, and his remembrance elevation.'&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">[6] </span><strong style="line-height:1.5em;">Question</strong><span style="line-height:1.5em;">: What are the books you recommend a young person that is starting out in his Islaamic studies to read?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he is a novice, then from the books of Fiqh, we advise him to read <strong>&#8220;Fiqh As-Sunnah&#8221; of Sayyid Saabiq</strong>, while seeking assistance from some of its references, such as <strong>&#8220;Subul-us-Salaam </strong>(the ways of Peace &amp; Safety)<strong> &#8220;</strong> (of Imaam As-Sana&#8217;aanee, rahimahullaah). And if he looks into <strong>&#8220;Tamaam-ul-Mannah&#8221;</strong> (of Al-Albaanee) then that will be stronger for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I advise him to read &#8220;<strong>Ar-Rawdat-un-Nadiyyah</strong>&#8221; (of Sideeq Hasan Khaan).<br />
As for the subject of Tafseer, then he should habitually read from the book <strong>&#8220;Tafseer Al-Qur&#8217;aan-ul-&#8216;Adheem&#8221; of Ibn Katheer</strong> – [chm file download ]even though it is somewhat long – for it is the most authentic from the books of Tafseer today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, on the subject of religious exhortation and heart-softening narrations, he should read the book <strong>&#8220;Riyaad-us-Saaliheen&#8221; of Imaam An-Nawawee.</strong> [Daeef hadeeth in Riyadh us Saleheen &#8211; Albanee ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, with regard to the books related to Creed, I advise him to read the book <strong>&#8220;Sharh Al-&#8216;Aqeedat-ut-Tahaawiyyah&#8221; of Ibn Abee Al-&#8216;Izz Al-Hanafee</strong>. And he should seek assistance, also, from my comments and explanations to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, he should make it his customary practice to study from the<strong> books of Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah</strong> and his student <strong>Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyyah</strong>, may Allaah have mercy on them. For I hold them to be from the rare and unique Muslim scholars that have treaded upon the methodology of the Salaf As-Saalih (righteous predecessors) in their understanding, while having Taqwaa and righteousness. And we do not purify anyone over Allaah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Ahadeeth of Tawheed from the Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah of Shaykh Al-Albaani </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">Chapters of Tawheed and the Shahadtayn Part 14</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>37- What a Muslim does with his close relative who is a Mushrik And Abu Talib died upon Shirk</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">161- The Messenger of Allaah said to Ali bin Abu Ta lib: &#8216;Go and bury your father.&#8217; He said; &#8216;No, I won&#8217;t bury him, because he died as a Mushrik.&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Messenger said to him: &#8216;Go and bury him, and do n&#8217;t speak to anyone until you come to me. &#8216;I came to him and I had signs of dirt and dust upon me. He ordered me to wash, so I washed and he supplicated for me with supplications which would not please me to exchange anything for them on the face of this earth.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>From the benefits of the hadeeth</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <span style="color:#0000ff;">That it is permissible for a Muslim to take the responsibilities of burying his close Mushrik relative</span>. This does not negate his hate for his relative&#8217;s shirk. Do you not see that &#8216;Alee refused to bury his father for the first time. Whereby, he said: &#8216;he died as a mushrik &#8216; thinking that if he buried him then this would enter into being in alliance with his father which is pro hibited. Like the saying of Allaah Ta’ala: &lt;&lt;<em>Take not as friends the people who incurred the Wrath of Allaah</em> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Messenger ordered him again to bury his father he hastened to fulfill the Messenger&#8217;s order. And he left that which seemed to be correct to him the first time. It is also from obedience, that a person leaves his own opinion for the command of his Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It appears to me that the son burying his mushrik father or his mother is the last of what the son possesses of good companionship wit h his mushrik father in this world. As for after the burial then it is not allowed for him to pray for him, nor seek forgiveness for him, this is due to the clear statement of Allaah Ta&#8217;ala: &lt;&lt; <em>It is not proper for the Prophet and those who believe to ask Allaah&#8217;s Forgiveness for the Mushrikeen even though they be of kin</em> &gt;&gt;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">So, if this is the case, what is the situation of t he one who supplicates for mercy and forgiveness on the pages of newspapers and magazines for some of the kuffar , announcing their deaths, for a small amount of dirhams !</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who is concerned for his hereafter should fear Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- <span style="color:#0000ff;">It is not legislated for him to wash the unbeliever, nor should he shroud him. And nor should he pray upon him</span> even if he is a close relative, since, the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam did not order Alee to do so. If this had been permissible, the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam would have mentioned it, since delaying the explanation of an order when there is a need for it, is not permissible. This is the Madhab of the Hambalees and other than them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- <span style="color:#0000ff;">It is not legislated for the relatives of that Mushrik to follow the funeral procession</span>. Because the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam did not do this for his uncle. His uncle was the kindest and the most compassionate of the people to him. Even to the extent that the Prophet supplicated to Allaah for him, whereby his uncle&#8217;s punishment will be the least in the Hellfire, as has been previously explained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in all of this there is a lesson for those peop le who have been deceived by their ancestry, but they do not do any thing for their hereafter with their Lord, and Allaah the Great spoke the truth when He said: &lt;&lt; <em>There will be no kinship among them that Day, nor will they ask of one another.</em> &gt;&gt;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Shaykh Ahmad ibn Bazmool</strong><br />
Transcription by: Umm Yusuf min Sri Lanka</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The shaykh <em>hafidhahullah</em> then stated that this issue of knowing merely the groups and the likes is a very important subject. It is taken from the statement of Muhammad ibn Sareeh <em>rahimahullah</em> this is a matter or this <strong><span style="color:#993300;">knowledge is a matter of <em>deen</em>, so be careful who you take your <em>deen</em> from</span></strong>. This matter is a matter of <em>deen</em>, so be careful who you take your <em>deen</em> from. So this is how important this issue is. Is that the knowledge when o­ne takes from someone or o­ne hears from someone or o­ne learns from someone that knowledge is going to be <em>deen</em> something that is going to weighty o­n the Day of Judgment something that he is going to meet Allaah with so it is important that he takes his knowledge o­nly from those who are known to have knowledge. And who are known to have <em>taqwa </em>and who are known to be upon righteousness, because what he takes is going to be his path to the Hereafter so look to who you take your <em>deen</em> from means that a Muslim must look and takes his <em>deen</em> from <em>Ahlus sunnah</em>, the <em>salafiyoon</em> the o­nes who follow the <em>salaf us salih</em> and secondly that the o­ne that he takes his <em>deen</em> from is someone who has knowledge, known for knowledge, known for being upright and known for having <em>taqwa</em>. This knowledge is a matter of <em>deen</em> so be careful who you take your <em>deen</em> from.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the shaykh Ahmad bin Bazmool <em>hafidhahullah ta&#8217;ala</em> stated that Imaam Malik <em>rahimahullah</em> mentions in the introduction of Saheeh Imaam Muslim that there was <span style="color:#993300;">in Madinah a hundred men that were pointed to by the people as being worshippers and being people who were righteous and being people having abstinence from the <em>dunya</em> but no o­ne would take knowledge from them</span>. This statement by Imaam Malik <em>rahimahullah</em> is saying, that it is not enough for a person to be known for worship and being known for having abstinence from the <em>dunya</em> and being known for the outward expression of his worship that you take from him. That these people were known for that and these people pointed to them for that but no o­ne would take their affairs from them because it was not from their affair. Their affair was worshipping and righteousness but their affair was not knowledge. <span style="color:#993300;">He said that if we would understand that any of us who would see a brother who has his <em>thobe</em> properly clad and the length of his beard is long we would think that he is a scholar of his time of the mufti of his area and this is a great mistake.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the shaykh Ahmad bin Bazmool <em>hafidhahullah ta&#8217;ala</em> states that there is no doubt that is obligatory upon the people to learn <em>ilmi shar&#8217;ee</em>, Islamic knowledge and this is based o­n the Quraanic verse, Allaah <em>subhana wata&#8217;alah</em> says &#8220;Ask the people of knowledge if you do not know.&#8221; And it is based upon the statement of Prophet Muhammad salallahu alaihi wa sallam &#8220;that seeking knowledge is an obligation upon every Muslim&#8221;. And a man came to Imaam Malik <em>rahimahullah</em> and said, &#8220;I want to seek knowledge&#8221; and Imaam Malik <em>rahimahullah</em> told him <span style="color:#993300;">start with that which you needfor your night and your day</span> because he means that the areas of knowledge are many and extensive and what is important is what you need is for your night and your day. And of course the first thing that you need is <strong>Tawheed</strong>, because it is the basis for all actions. And then you need <strong><em>taharah</em> </strong>the proper way to purify yourself and then you need the proper manner of how to make <strong><em>salaah</em> </strong>and like this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is understood and this has been explained, it is clear that that man needs what he needs for his day and his night of <em>Tawheed </em>and of <em>taharah</em> purification of <em>salaah</em>. Then we can see the mistake of those who want that the Muslims get involved or start without knowledge in <strong><em>siyaasah</em> or political issues</strong> upon the methodology of the <em>hizbiyyah</em> or partisanship or defending the people who are upon <em>shirk</em> and <em>bid&#8217;ah</em>. We see that these people who call to these types of issues are not individuals from whom we should take are knowledge from.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ahmad bin Bazmool <em>hafidhahullah ta&#8217;ala</em> then went o­n to say that in reality the <strong>weakness of this <em>ummah</em> and the humiliation of this <em>ummah</em></strong> is because of the ignorance of the <em>ummah</em> regarding this <em>deen</em>. It is not like some people say that the weakness of the <em>ummah</em> is because it does not have the physical strength or the weakness of the <em>ummah</em> is due to the fact that the disbelievers are conspiring against it. The shaykh says no, <strong>the weakness of the ummah is from inside the ummah, that the ummah does not have knowledge of deen</strong> . This <em>ummah</em> does not support Allaah so Allaah does not support it. As Allaah says in the Qur&#8217;aan, &#8220;If you support Allaah, Allaah will support you and will make your foothold firm. He said that the scholars say, that supporting Allaah means learning the <em>deen</em>, the <em>ahkam</em> the regulations of the <em>deen</em>, acting upon the <em>deen</em> and studying the <em>deen</em>. He says it is not like those people think that what we need to do is concentrate o­n the materialistic issues and if we knew about the strategies and conspiracies of the disbelievers and their political plans and we had a system arranged with all sort of leaders and the like that that will solve our problems. He said no, it is clear that humiliation comes from ourselves. Based o­n the <em>hadith</em> of Prophet <em>salallahu alaihi wa sallam</em> that if you deal in <em>eena</em> which is an illegal transaction a form of usury which means a Muslim will enter into which is forbidden regarding transaction and you follow the tails of the cows meaning will give in to agriculture and these type of issues and get them more importance than the Hereafter and you leave <em>Jihaad</em> neither do you establish <em>Jihaad</em> nor do you for <em>Jihaad</em> for <em>Jihaad</em> he said has two types of preparations <strong><em>Roohi wa Maddi</em></strong>, <em>Roohi</em> meaning spiritual preparation and <em>Maddi</em> meaning material preparation. And this is why you see the mistake of Usaamah bin Laden among many reasons for his mistakes he is wrong and incorrect is he thinks that <em>Jihaad</em> is o­nly the materialistic preparation and he has totally forgotten about the spiritual preparation and he has totally forgotten about many issues in Islaam. And that which he is doing is nothing to do with the <em>sunnah</em> and which he is doing has nothing to do with Islaam and he is in ignorance of these issues and the scholars have responded against him. So it is the issue that the Muslims, the <em>ummah</em> will not learn the <em>deen</em> and will get involved in <em>tijaarah</em> and forbidden trading transaction and will leave <em>Jihaad</em> and will become pleased with the <em>dunya</em>, then Allaah <em>subhana wata&#8217;alah</em> will send upon him humiliation. And He will not lift this humiliation off from them until they return to their <em>deen</em>. The scholars say return to the <em>deen</em> is learning the <em>deen</em>, acting upon the <em>deen</em> and spreading the <em>deen</em>. He says it is not through explosions and bombings and harming individuals who had no hand in any evil and this type of thing but it is returning to the <em>deen</em> of Allaah learning it, practicing it and spreading it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ahmad bin Bazmool <em>hafidhahullah ta&#8217;ala</em> went o­n to say so we know and understand this. There is a very important point that we must understand and that is that <strong>it is forbidden for anyone who does not have knowledge to talk</strong>. That is if he is <em>jaahil </em>ignorant is forbidden to talk in the matters of the <em>deen</em><span style="color:#339966;">. </span>And this is something very clear from the Qur&#8217;aanic verses in which Allaah says, &#8220;<span style="color:#993300;">Do not talk about those matters which you have no knowledge, verily regarding the hearing, the heart and the talk all of these matters a person will be questioned about.</span>&#8221; And then Allaah <em>subhana wata&#8217;alah</em> mentions the forbidden matters after mentioning <em>al fawaahish</em> outwardly and inwardly and mentioning other matters and He says and to ascribe to Allaah that which he has no authority or that you commit shirk and then He says and you speak about Allaah when you have been forbidden that you speak about Allaah when you have no knowledge. He said that the scholars have got from this that speaking about Allaah without knowledge is worse than shirk. Speaking about Allaah without knowledge is worse than shirk, for two reasons o­ne is that this speaking about Allaah <em>tabarakta wat&#8217;ala</em> without knowledge is something that is general something that it will affect everybody but the state of the something he has done regarding himself. So it is forbidden for anyone to speak about Allaah without knowledge. And there is the narration of the Prophet <em>salallahu alaihi wa sallam</em> in which some of his companions was with o­ne of his companions o­n a journey and he got injured and when he got injured he also fell into sexual defilement, state of <em>junub</em> and it was a very dark cold night and he wanted to know if he should take wudhu or <em>tayammum</em> and he asked them if it is possible to do this and they said no you must take a ghusl you must take a full <em>ghusl</em>, so when he did this, he died. So when this reached the Prophet <em>salallahu alaihi wa sallam </em>he said, &#8220;they killed him they killed him, may Allaah kill them. Why did they not ask if they were ignorant? Verily the cure for ignorance, is asking.&#8221; So this shows that it is forbidden for someone who does not know, to talk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Shaykh Ahmad bin Bazmool <em>hafidhahullah </em>says if we have understood from what has preceded, the o­ne being questioned if he does not know, if he cannot answer it is <em>haraam</em> for him to answer. He must also know that<strong> the Muslim who does not know it, is forbidden for him to ask someone who does not know</strong>. It is forbidden for him in matters of <em>deen</em> to ask someone who does not know. Rather he has to ask an <em>aalim</em> a scholar someone who has knowledge and this is what Muhammad ibn Sar&#8217;ee rahimahullahu meant when he said this matter is a matter of knowledge of <em>deen</em> so be careful who you take your <em>deen</em> from.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said also in our daily life we had a medical situation or whatever, will we go to a mechanic ?, and if we had a problem with our car will we go to a farmer? and if we wanted to construct a house will we go to someone who is a specialist in cleaning?. No, we will go to each individual who has a specialty in which they are specialist in. So when it comes to an issue of <em>deen</em> we must go to the <em>ulemaa</em> we must go to the scholars. <strong>And it is not right to say ask anybody or to do what everybody else is doing this is a major mistake also</strong>. As comes in a narration of Abu Darda <em>raliallahu anhu </em>in this in the khilafa of Uthmaan raliallahu anhu in the time of Uthmaan <em>raliallahu anhu</em> when he went to the <em>masjid</em> and he prayed and he saw some <em>tabi&#8217;een</em> praying but they were not praying according to the <em>sunnah</em>. There <em>salaah</em> was not the <em>salaah</em> according to the <em>sunnah</em>. Abu Darda went home angry. And when Umm Darda <em>raliallahu anha</em> saw him she said, &#8220;What has made you angry, what has caused you to get angry.&#8221; He said, &#8220;By Allaah I don&#8217;t see anything that we were doing in the time of the Prophet <em>salallahu alaihi wasallam</em> that the Muslims are doing except that they pray together. Meaning that many of the <em>sunan</em> many of the practices that they were doing in the time of the Prophet <em>salallahu alaihi wasallam </em>that individuals were not doing it and what was left was that they were just praying together. This is Abu Darda&#8217;s statement while he is at the period which is close to the Prophet <em>salallahu alaihi wasallam</em> and there were a lot of <em>sahabahs</em> still alive and there were many <em>tabi&#8217;een</em> so what about now o­ne thousand four hundred years after that are the people the general masses upon <em>sunnah</em>? Are the general masses upon knowledge? Are the general masses people that we should follow? No! but we should follow the <em>ulemaa</em> <em>Rabbaniyeen</em>, the scholars who know the <em>deen</em> of Allaah <em>tabarakta wata&#8217;la</em> <strong>we should not follow what our mothers were upon our fathers were upon our relatives are upon but we should follow that which the scholars are upon</strong>. These people are not right that they follow the general masses but we should follow the Prophet <em>salallahu alaihi wasallam</em> and the o­ne who directs us to the right. In fact what the Prophet <em>salallahu alaihi wasallam</em> was upon are the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Shaykh Ahmad bin Bazmool <em>hafidhahullah </em>stated that the <strong>people are of two types</strong>. The <em>awwam</em> or the general laymen who have no knowledge and the <em>tullabul ilm,</em> <em>al ulemaa</em> they are together, <em>tullabul ilm</em> students of knowledge and the <em>ulemaa</em>. Now the <em>ulemaa</em> and the students are of two types. The <em>ulemaa</em> who are not in reality scholars and those are the o­nes who have <em>hizbiyyah</em> or innovation or partisanship or politics or this movement oriented overthrowing governments and blowing up things and things of this nature and <em>bid&#8217;ah</em> and mistakes in their <em>aqeedah</em> and their <em>manhaj</em>. These individuals should never be taken from whatsoever. The second is the <em>tullabul ilm</em> and the <em>ulemaa</em> who are upon the <em>sunnah</em>, <em>salafiyeen</em> upon the way of the <em>salaf us saalih</em> . They are upon the way of the <em>sunnah</em> and o­n the way of the <em>salaf us saalih</em>. These individuals the scholars are the source that you go to. The students of knowledge are actually made a (unclear ) source. They are individuals that you benefit from but you are never to take their statements over the statements of the <em>ulemaa</em>, of the scholars. So if we reiterate this point, the<em> awwam</em> the general masses don&#8217;t take anything from them but rather they should be taught, for they are ignorant.And those people who are considered scholars but their methodology is incorrect, their a <em>qeedah</em> and <em>manhaj</em> is incorrect they are involved in <em>siyasah</em> or politics or <em>hizbiyyah</em> or matters that are secretive and things of this nature they should not be taken from for they are in reality they are part of the seventy two groups that are promised the Hellfire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather the o­ne that should be taken from are the <em>tullabul ilm</em> and <em>ulemaa</em> who are upon the <em>sunnah </em>and who are upon the way of the <em>salaf us saalih</em>. But the distinction must be made that <strong>we take the words of the<em> ulemaa</em> over the words of the student of knowledge</strong>. For instance <em>Kibar ulema</em>a the Great body of Scholars like Shaykh Rabee for example says something then we take what he has said and what they have said because they are the greater scholars. And it is not right to take what a student of knowledge says just because he is <em>salafee</em> unless he has some clear evidence that he has stated that the scholars have missed. But if generally speaking the people have of taking the students of knowledge because he is <em>salafee</em> over the scholars is a great mistake.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ahmad bin Bazmool <em>hafidhahullah </em>said this issue of importance of returning to the people of <em>ilm </em>, returning in going to the people of knowledge as a source in going back to them we have two stories from the Prophet Muhammad salallahu alaihi wasallam regarding this issue. o­ne is the story regarding the <strong>man from before us from <em>Bani Israel</em> who had killed 99 individuals</strong> and he wanted to get to Allaah <em>tabarakta wata&#8217;la</em> so he found an <em>aabid</em> a worshipper, he said notice an <em>aabid</em> a worshipper not an <em>aalim</em> a scholar. A worshipper who was worshipping in seclusion and he said to him, &#8220;I have killed 99 individuals, is there any means for me to repent to Allaah to make Taubah&#8221;. So this <em>aabid</em> who was ignorant said, &#8220;No&#8221;. So he killed him and he completed a hundred individuals. So then he went to a scholar and saying to the scholar I have killed a hundred individuals is there any means for me to repent. The <em>aalim</em> said what is(unclear)between you and making <em>Taubah</em> to Allaah. Of course you can make <em>taubah</em> but you are in a land that is evil and it is upon you to go to such and such land where there are righteous people who worship Allaah so you go there and worship Allaah with them.&#8221; So this shows you the issue of going to the scholar verses going to someone who is ignorant.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second story</strong> is about two individuals, o­ne who was righteous and the other was a sinner. And every time the righteous o­ne would pass by the sinner he would correct him and advice him but he would not accept. So o­ne day the righteous person said to him, &#8220;By Allaah, Allaah will not forgive you.&#8221; So Allaah <em>tabarakta wata&#8217;la </em>said, &#8220;Who is it who is bold enough to go over Me or above Me, verily I have forgiven him and I have made your deeds nothing.&#8221; So this is the righteous person because he was ignorant he led him to go into the area that was described by Allaah <em>tabarakta wata&#8217;la</em> that he would not forgive o­ne of His creatures. So Allaah <em>tabarakta wata&#8217;la</em> wiped away or made nothing the deeds of the obedient o­ne and forgave the disobedient o­ne. So this shows us the importance of knowledge number o­ne and that we should acquire it and the importance of returning to the <em>ulemaa</em>. Don&#8217;t ask anyone and everyone but ask <em>Raazikeena fil ilm</em> those who are well grounded in knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In closing Shaykh Ahmad bin Bazmool <em>hafidhahullah</em> that someone might say <strong>what is wrong with taking knowledge from the <em>hizbiyeen </em>and <em>mubtadiyah </em>(One who commits bid&#8217;ah)</strong>, if they have something beneficial to give. I&#8217;ll just take the good and I will leave the bad. He said there were several issues wrong with this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o­ne, is that the Prophet <em>salallahu alaihi wasallam</em> warned against the <em>ulemaa</em> <em>as soo or al jahaal</em>, taking from the evil scholars or the ignorant. And this is in a <em>hadith</em> in which he said, &#8220;That Allaah <em>tabarakta wata&#8217;la </em>does not take the knowledge after having given it by taking it away from your hearts but by the death of the religious learned men, the scholars, until there will remain nothing but the ignorant people who will contort it and will give verdicts according to their opinions and they will mislead others and they will go astray and will lead others astray.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second matter is that Allaah <em>tabarakta wata&#8217;la</em> and the Prophet <em>salallahu alaihi wasallam</em>&#8216;s order of <em>hizbudeen </em>, preserving o­nes <em>deen</em>. And the person who goes and sits with the innovator or <em>hizbee</em> is not preserving his <em>deen</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thirdly, is that taking from the <em>hizbiyeen</em> or the innovators is that they are from the <em>asaaghir</em>, the small o­nes and we have been forbidden or the Prophet <em>salallahu alaihi wasallam</em> indicated that from the signs of the hour is that the people will take their knowledge from the <em>asaaghir</em>. And he said that the <em>asaaghir</em> are the innovators.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fourthly is that the <em>mubtadih</em> you cannot forsake from the fact that he will not oppose you. You will think that he is giving you the best, but he will take you step by step until he pulls you and that is the way it has been amongst the past (unclear).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the fifth matter is that the person who is going there saying &#8220;I will get the good and leave the bad&#8221; is ignorant. So he cannot protect himself from falling into a fitnah. So he can&#8217;t protect himself from falling into a fitnah. So for all these reasons above and more it is important that you take o­nly from the scholars who are known for the knowledge who are well grounded in their knowledge and we do not ask or take from anyone else. And then he said hadha wa salallahu wa nabiyinah Muhammad.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center"><span style="color:#993300;">The Ahadeeth of Tawheed from the Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah of Shaykh Al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">161- The Messenger of Allaah said to ‘Alee bin Abu Talib: ‘Go and bury your father.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said; ‘No, I won’t bury him, because he died as a <em>Mushrik</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger said to him: ‘Go and bury him, and don’t speak to anyone until you come to me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I came to him and I had signs of dirt and dust upon me. He ordered me to wash, so I washed and he supplicated for me with supplications which would not please me to exchange anything for them on the face of this earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>From the benefits of the hadeeth </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- That it is permissible for a Muslim to take the responsibilities of burying his close <em>Mushrik</em> relative. This does not negate his hate far his relative’s <em>Shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do you not see that ‘Alee refused to bury his father the first time. Whereby, he said: ‘he died as a <em>Mushrik</em>‘ thinking that if he buried him then this would enter into being in alliance with his father which is prohibited. Like the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>:</p>
<p align="center">&lt;&lt;Take not as friends the people who incurred the Wrath of Allaah &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Messenger ordered him again to bury his father he hastened to fulfill the Messenger’s order. And he left that which seemed to be correct to him the first time. It is also from obedience, that a person leaves his own opinion for the command of his Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It appears to me that the son burying his <em>Mushrik</em> father or his mother is the last of what the son possesses of good companionship with his <em>Mushrik</em> father in this world. As for after the burial then it is not allowed for him to pray for him, nor seek forgiveness for him, this is due to the clear statement of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p align="center">&lt;&lt;It is not proper for the Prophet and those who believe to ask Allaah’s Forgiveness for the <em>Mushrikeen </em>even though they be of kin&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if this is the case, what is the situation of the one who supplicates for mercy and forgiveness on the pages of newspapers and magazines for some of the <em>Kuffar</em>, announcing their deaths, for a small amount of <em>Dirhams</em>!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who is concerned for his hereafter should fear Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- It is not legislated for him to wash the unbeliever, nor should he shroud him. And nor should he pray upon him even if he is a close relative, since, the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> did not order ‘Alee to do so. If this had been permissible, the Prophet<em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> would have mentioned it, since delaying the explanation of an order when there is a need for it, is not permissible. This is the <em>Madhab</em> of the Hambalees and other than them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- It is not legislated for the relatives of that <em>Mushrik</em> to follow the funeral procession. Because the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> did not do this for his uncle. His uncle was the kindest and the most compassionate of the people to him. Even to the extent that the Prophet supplicated to Allaah for him, whereby his uncle’s punishment will be the least in the Hellfire, as has been previously explained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in all of this there is a lesson for those people who have been deceived by their ancestry, but they do not do any thing for their hereafter with their Lord, and Allaah the Great spoke the truth when He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&lt;&lt; There will be no kinship among them that Day, nor will they ask of one another &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta&#8217; has read what was sent by to the General Chairman by the undersecretary of the foreign ministry for political affairs. This letter was refereed to the Committee by the administration of scholarly research and Ifta&#8217;. This letter is No. 23l that was sent in 1408 A.H. The Undersecretary sent this message:&#8221;I have received a request from the embassy of the Custodian of the two Sacred Mosques in Bonn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">It inquires if it is obligatory upon he who embraces Islam to change his name in order to be admitted access to the sacred area in order to perform Hajj or not? Can he who does not change his name be admitted entrance to these places? I would like to receive an answer in order to send it to the embassy there.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After reviewing the question, the Committee responded that if he confirms that he is a Muslim, he is legally permitted to enter to the sacred precincts regardless of his name.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Question</strong>:  <span style="color:#993300;">Why is our religion called &#8220;Islaam&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because one who enters it <span style="color:#800080;"><strong>submits (Aslama)</strong></span> himself to Allaah, and he <span style="color:#800080;"><strong>surrenders to (Istislam)</strong></span>, and abides by, all of the judgements that come from Allaah and from His Messenger Salallaahu alayhi wasallam. Allaah Almighty said:</p>
<p>وَمَن يَرْغَبُ عَن مِّلَّةِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِلاَّ مَن سَفِهَ نَفْسَهُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And who turns away from the religion of Ibraheem except him who fools himself?</span> [Baqarah 2:130]</p>
<p>He also said:</p>
<p>إِذْ قَالَ لَهُ رَبُّهُ أَسْلِمْ قَالَ أَسْلَمْتُ لِرَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">When His Lord said to him, &#8220;Submit (i.e. be a Muslim)!&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have submitted myself (as a Muslim) to the Lord of all that exists.&#8221;</span> [Baqarah 2:131]</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>مَنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ لِلّهِ وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌ فَلَهُ أَجْرُهُ عِندَ رَبِّهِ</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">But whoever submits his face (himself) to Allaah and he is a good-doer then his reward is with his Lord</span> [Baqarah 2:112]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">[Translated by <strong>Aboo Talhah Daawood ibn Ronald Burbank</strong>]</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Posted by <strong>Saad Burbank</strong> @ <a href="http://alitisaambissunnah.wordpress.com/2011/09/19/the-story-of-how-an-najjaashee-became-the-king-of-abyssinia/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.alitisaambissunnah.wordpress.com</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* Concerning an-Najjaashee&#8217;s refusal to surrender the Muslims in his land to the Mushrikoon from Quraish, and his refusal to accept gifts to bribe him to do that:-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* az-Zuhree said: &#8220;I had this hadeeth narrated by &#8220;Urwah ibn az-Zubayr (rahimahullaah): from Umm Salamah (radiyallaahu &#8220;anhaa). So &#8220;Urwah said: &#8220;Do you know what he (i.e. an-Najjaashee) meant by his saying: &#8220;Allaah did not take any bribe from me, when He restored my kingdom to me, such that I should accept any bribe to keep my kingdom; And Allaah did not do what the people wanted with regard to me, such that I should obey the people against Him.&#8221; ?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I said; &#8220;No.&#8221;&#8230; So then &#8220;Urwah explained it, saying:  &#8220;Aa&#8217;ishah (radiyallaahu &#8216;anhaa) narrated to me that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">&lt;&lt; His father was previously king of his people, and he had a brother, and his brother had twelve sons. But the father of an-Najjaashee had no child besides an-Najjaashee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">So the people of Abyssinia started plotting together and they said: We ought to kill the father of an-Najjaashee, and give the kingship to his brother, then his brother has twelve sons. So then later they can inherit the kingship and the Abyssinian people will remain for a long time without any infighting between them. So they attacked (the king) and killed him, and they made his brother king.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">So then an-Najjaashee entered upon his uncle, and he impressed him so much that he consulted nobody else besides him, and he was found to be a person of intellect and firm resolve.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">So when the rest of the Abyssinians saw the status which he now had with his uncle they said: This boy has got the better of his uncle now, so we do not feel safe that he will not make him king over us (after himself), and he knows that we have killed his father. So if that happens, he will not leave a single noble amongst us except he will kill him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">So they went to his uncle and said: You know that we killed his father, and put you in his place; and we do not feel safe that he will not become king over us (after you). So either you kill him, or you banish him from our land.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">He said, &#8220;Woe to you, you killed his father yesterday, and now I have to kill him today! Rather I will send him away from your land.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">So they took him away, and put him in the market place; and they sold him as a slave to a trader from the traders who threw him into a ship, having bought him for 600 or 700 dirhams.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">Then he departed with him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">Then when it was the evening of that same day some clouds from the autumn clouds appeared. So his uncle went out to enjoy the rain, but he was struck by a lightening bolt which killed him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">So the people quickly went to his children, but they found that they were stupid people. There was not a single one that had any good in him. So the affair of the Abyssinians was thrown into confusion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">So some of them said to others:</span><br />
<span style="color:#800080;"> &#8220;You know, by Allaah, that the only one who is suitable to be king over you is the one who you sold this morning. So if you have any concern for the affair of the Abyssinians, then go and get him before he leaves.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">So they went searching for him. So they found him and they brought him back; and they placed the crown upon his head, and they sat him upon his throne, and they made him the king.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">But the trader (came and) said: &#8220;Give me back my money, for you have taken my slave!&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">They said: &#8220;We will not give you anything.&#8221;</span><br />
<span style="color:#800080;"> So the trader said, &#8220;Then by Allaah, I will go and speak to him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">So he went to him and spoke to him, and said: &#8220;O king! I bought a slave and the people who sold him to me took the price, but then they seized the slave and took him away from me, and they won&#8221;t give me my money back.&#8221; So this was the first case that was seen from the firmness, wisdom, and justice of an- Najjaashee that he said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">&#8220;You must either give him his money back; or hand over his slave to him so that he may take him wherever he wants.&#8221;</span><br />
<span style="color:#800080;"> So the people said: &#8220;Rather we will give him his money.&#8221; So they gave it to him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">So this is why ((when the Najjaashee did not surrender the Muslims, and did not accept the bribe from the Quraish to hand over the Muslims)), he said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">&#8220;Allaah did not take any bribe from me, when He restored my kingdom to me, such that I should take any bribe to keep my kingdom; And Allaah did not do what the people wanted with regard to me, such that I should obey the people against Him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* <strong>Shaikh al- Albaanee</strong> mentioned that it is reported by Ibn Hishaam in his abridgement of Ibn Ishaaq&#8221;s &#8220;Seerah&#8221; (1/363-364), and by Aboo Nu&#8221;aym in &#8220;ad-Dalaa.il&#8221; (pp.81- 84), and that its chain of narration is &#8220;hasan&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* &#8211; This is the same one, an- Najjaashee, who sent a message to the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8220;alaihi-wa sallam) to say that he had accepted Islaam; and he died upon Islaam (radiyallaahu &#8220;anhu).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; Then Ibn Ishaaq reports through his chain of narration from &#8220;Aa.ishah that when an- Najjaashee died that the people mentioned that light was continually seen over his grave. Shaikh al-Albaanee said its chain is hasan (good).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; He is the one who is mentioned in al-Bukhaaree and Muslim in a hadeeth of Aboo Hurairah (radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu) that when he died, the Prophet (sal Allaahu alaihi wa sallam) was told through Revelation, and that he ordered the Companions to form rows and he prayed the Funeral Prayer for him, as no one in his land prayed the Funeral Prayer for him.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Source : Tafseer Ibn Kathir of Surah Al-Kahf</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> And never say of anything, &#8220;I shall do such and such thing tomorrow.&#8221; Except (with the saying), &#8220;If Allah wills!&#8221; And remember your Lord when you forget and say: &#8220;It may be that my Lord guides me to a nearer way of truth than this.&#8221;</span> &#8211; Surah Kahf: (23, 24 ayah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) declared Allah&#8217;s Oneness and proclaimed to be the Messenger of Allah (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) and revelation of Divine Message, the disbeliveers of Makkah sent some men to Jewish rabbis in al-Medina and said: &#8220;Ask them (the rabbis) about Muhammad (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam), and describe him to them, and tell them what he is saying.They are the people of the first Book, and they have more knowledge of the Prophets than we do.&#8217; So they set out for al-Medina, they asked the Jewish rabbis about the Messenger of Allah (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam). They described him to them and told them some of his teachings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The rabbis said: &#8216;Ask him about three things which we will tell you to ask, if he answers them then he is a Prophet who has been sent (by Allah); if he does not, then he is saying things that are not true, in which case how you will deal with him will be up to you. Ask him about some young men in ancient times, what was their story? For there is a strange and wondrous tale. Ask him about a man who traveled a great deal and reached the east and the west of the earth. What was his story? And ask him about he Ruh (soul or spirit) what is it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he tells you about these things, then he is a Prophet, so follow him, but if he does not tell you, then he is a man who is making things up, so deal with him as you see fit.&#8217; So, the men came back to Makkah and said: &#8216;O people! We have come to you with a decisive solution which will put an end to the problem between you and Muhammad (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam). The Jewish rabbis told us to ask him about some matters,&#8217; and they told them what they were. Then they came to the Messenger of Allah (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) and said: &#8216;O Muhammad (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) tell us,&#8217; and they asked him about the things they had been told to ask.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) said: &#8220;I will tell you tomorrow about what you have asked me.&#8221; But he (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) did not say, &#8216;If Allah Wills.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah Messenger (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) never spoke anything except with revelation. So, he waited for the revelation from Allah but fifteen days passed away without any revelation concerning those matter which the disbelievers asked, neither did Jibreel (alaihis-salaam) come to him. The people of Makkah started to doubt him and said: &#8216;Muhammad (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) promised to tell us the next day and now fifteen days have gone by and he has not told us anything in response to the questions we asked.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) felt sad because of the delay in revelation and was grieved by what the people of Makkah were saying about him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Jibreel (alaihis-salaam) came with the revelation of Soorah al-Kahf, which contained answers to the questions and also the above mentioned verse explaining the correct etiquette when determining to do something in the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Determining to do something in the future should always be attributed to the Will of Allah, Who is the Knower of the Unseen and Who Alone Knows what was and what is yet to happen and what is not to be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported in Saheeh al-Bukharee from Abu Hurayrah (radhiyallahu anhu), who said: &#8220;The Messenger of Allah (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) said: &#8220;<strong>Sulaiman Ibn Dawood (alaihimus-salaam)</strong> said: &#8216;Tonight I will go around to all my seventy wives (according to some reports it is ninety or one hundred wives) so that each one of them will give birth to a son who will fight for the sake of Allah.&#8217; It was said to him, (according to one narration, an Angel said to him), say, &#8216;If Allah Wills.&#8217; But he did not say it. He went around to the women but none of them gave birth except for one, who gave birth to a half-formed child.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) said: &#8220;By the One, in Whose Hands is my soul, had he said, &#8216;If Allah wills,&#8217; he would not have broken his oath, and that would have helped him to attain what he wanted.&#8221; [Saheeh Muslim (vol. 3, no. 1275)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if one determines to do something in the future or even takes an oath, he should say, &#8216;If Allah Wills&#8217; or &#8216;Insha&#8217;Allah.&#8217; If one forgets to say &#8220;Insha&#8217;Allah&#8221; then he should say when he remembers it even if it is a year later, as Ibn Abbas (radhiallahu anhu) explained.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 1: Here in Sri Lanka some Kafirs (disbelievers) have accepted Islam, especially Buddhists, but they stay married according to their former religions. One might be married to his niece and they have children. In such a case, we cannot separate them. What should we do?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: If both spouses accept Islam together, and they are married in a way that is impermissible in Islam, they must be separated at once, such as a couple who accepts Islam while the wife is her husband&#8217;s niece.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In such a case, they must be forced to leave each other, as it is impermissible for a Muslim to marry his niece.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is according to Allah&#8217;s saying (Exalted be He), Forbidden to you (for marriage) are: your mothers until His saying, your sister’s daughters and similar cases. A man who accepts Islam while he is married to two sisters is asked to divorce one of them. This is according to what was narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhy and Al-Nasa&#8217;y, on the authority of Al-Dahhak ibn Fayruz, from his father that he said, When I embraced Islam, I was married to two sisters. The Prophet (peace be upon him) ordered me to divorce one of them. The wording of Al-Tirmidhy is choose either one of them that you wish. May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 3: a person embraced Islam and the members of his family are still non-Muslims. Then his parents died leaving behind a legacy for him and his brothers. It is well-known that this Muslim person does not deserve inheritance from his father&#8217;s legacy. If his brothers offered him what they think is his share of inheritance, should he accept it? It is said that it is permissible for him to take it as a gift. If this is true, must he tell them that he will accept it as a gift or is his intention enough?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ans:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible for this Muslim person to take the money offered for him by his father or brothers whether they are dead or alive as long as it does not draw him back to their religion and as long as they are rational people and know that he does not deserve inheritance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">Q: Does mere pronouncement of Shahadah (Testimony of Faith) suffice for a person to be rightfully called a Muslim, or does one have to do other things in order for their Islam and Iman (faith) to be complete?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is enough for a non-Muslim to pronounce the first pillar of Islam, that is, to bear witness that La ilaha illa Allah (there is no deity but Allah) and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah to be rightfully called a Muslim provided that this testimony is pronounced out of one’s certainty, knowledge, true belief, and sincere work. A person will then be asked to perform Salah (Prayer) and observe other acts of `Ibadah (worship).</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet (peace be upon him) sent Mu`adh (may Allah be pleased with him) to Yemen, he said: Invite them to bear witness that La ilaha illa Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. If they do that, then inform them that Allah has made it obligatory upon them to offer the Five Obligatory Daily Prayers. If they obey, then inform them that Allah has made it obligatory upon them to pay Zakah (obligatory charity) which is taken from the rich among them and distributed among the poor. The Prophet (peace be upon him) did not ask Mu`adh to command them to offer Salah until their Tawhid (monotheism) and Iman in the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) were firmly established. First of all, they are required to declare the Oneness of Allah and believe in Muhammad as the Messenger of Allah. Once they embrace Islam, the former Kafir (disbeliever) will hold the same rulings applied to Muslims. Then they will be required to offer Salah and perform all other religious acts. If they refrain from performing these acts, other rulings will be applicable to them.For example, if they abstain from offering Salah, they are given the chance to offer Tawbah (repentance). Otherwise, the Muslim ruler may punish him by capital punishment. If they arrogantly refuse to pay or and fight for that, they will also be fought. This is based on the fact that the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) fought those who denied Zakah. If they deny Sawm (fast), the Imam (ruler) may inflict Ta`zir (discretionary punishment) on them in a way that serves as a deterrent for them. The same applies to abstention of performing Hajj in case a person is financially and physically capable of performing it. This ruling is applicable to all sins which are liable to Ta`zir or Had (ordained punishment for violating Allah&#8217;s Law).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In conclusion, a person will be considered as having embraced Islam once they declare Shahadah whereby they will be treated as Muslims. If they die soon after declaring Shahadah, they will dwell in Jannah (Paradise). For example, if they embrace Islam after sunrise and die before they can offer the Zhuhr (Noon) Prayer, they will be regarded as Muslims though they have not performed any Salah. This was the case with some of the Sahabah who were killed on the battlefield soon after they embraced Islam. They belong to the dwellers of Jannah, even though they did nothing except having declared Allah&#8217;s Oneness and believed in the Messenger of Allah. However, if they live until the time of Salah is due, they will be commanded to offer it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If they amass wealth which reaches Nisab (the minimum amount on which Zakah is due), they will be commanded to pay Zakah. They will also be required to observe Sawm if they witness the month of Ramadan. They will also be obliged to perform Hajj if they have the means.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In general, they will hold the same rulings applied to Muslims whether those related to this life or the Hereafter. They will be obliged to fulfill all the duties of Islam. However, if they die before the time of Salah has become due, they will be regarded as Muslims and shall be consigned to Jannah. In case of their persistent refusal to offer Salah, they will be treated as Kafirs. This is the view held by a large number of scholars. Other scholars hold that theywill be considered as having committed minor Kufr (disbelief that is not tantamount to taking the Muslim out of Islam). Although they will have to be put to death, they will not be considered as having committed major Shirk (disbelief that takes the Muslim out of Islam). The same applies to abandoning Zakah or Sawm. The correct opinion is that whenever a person abandons Salah intentionally, they are regarded as having denied its obligatory status. Accordingly, they will be executed according to the correct view maintained by scholars. The majority of Fuqaha&#8217; (Muslim jurists) hold the view that they will be considered disobedient Muslims. This is the view held by the majority of later Fuqaha&#8217;. However, `Abdullah ibn Shaqiq Al-`Aqily reported that the Companions were unanimous on the fact that whoever abandons Salah will be considered as having committed Kufr.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Is it necessary for new converts to Islam to change their names? Should an adult convert be circumcised?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is permissible for new Muslims to change their names if they carry wrong or bad meanings, as this is a sign of conversion to Islam. If one asks the reason for a convert having changed their name, in most cases, their names before converting to Islam were not suitable, thus they felt it necessary to change them to Islamic names such as Saleh, Ahmad, `Abdullah, `Abdul-Rahman, Muhammad, etc. Names which suggest slavery to other than Allah such as `Abdul- Messiah, `Abdul-Zahra, or `Abd-Musa must be changed to `Abdullah, `Abdul-Rahman and the like, as servitude is to Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) Alone. Therefore, it is best to change names which express servitude to other than Allah and which are familiar and used by the Kuffar (disbelievers) to Islamic names.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is better for new Muslims to get circumcised by highly-skilled, experienced doctors, even when accepting Islam as adults. A group of scholars hold that it is Wajib (obligatory) upon new converts be circumcised unless there is fear of harm. If a doctor feels that circumcision may harm them, it is waived in this case. However, if a doctor know that it will not cause them any harm, they should be circumcised.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Circumcision is a stressed Sunnah and Wajib according to a group of scholars. Therefore, if it is feasible for an adult to be circumcised without suffering any harm, it is better and safer to undergo such procedure, otherwise they do not have to do it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If getting circumcised will drive a person away from Islam, it should not be mentioned to them. It can also be abandoned, for embracing Islam is a great bounty even without being circumcised. Therefore, a new convert need not be informed of this if it will turn them away from Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a new convert becomes steadfast in Islam, they should be circumcised, if it would not pose any risk to their health; otherwise they should not undergo this procedure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: A family is composed of a father, a mother, four sons, and four daughters. They were all Christians. Three sons and one daughter converted to Islam. Their father died and left them a huge fortune which is around 18,000,000 Saudi Riyals. do the children who embraced Islam have the right to inherit from their non-Muslim father?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: If the matter is as mentioned, the Muslim children whose father died as non-Muslim will not inherit. The origin of this ruling is what is related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim on the authority of Usamah ibn Zayd (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: Neither a Muslim inherits from a disbeliever, nor does a disbeliever inherit from a Muslim.</p>
<p>May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">~~~~~~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 1: This letter is sent by some Dutch women who have embraced Islam, praise be to Allah, and who have many inquiries concerning the issue of inheritance, as our parents are non-Muslims, and a Muslim must not inherit a Kafir (disbeliever). Our parents asked us to tell them how to share their property after their death, which falls into many categories: First, a house, as the money will only be available when the house is sold after their parents&#8217; death;we cannot take part of this money during their lifetime. Is it permissible for the parents to make a grant contract with their children during their lifetime, by paying an annual sum of money that can only be reclaimed after they die and the children sell the house? Is it permissible for the parents to make a grant contract with their children, so that the latter are the real owners of the house during the lifetime of the parents, and after their death each one takes their right? If a Kafir mother has two daughters, one of whom is a Muslim and the other is a Kafir, is it permissible for the mother to make a will for her Kafir daughter to grant half of her inheritance to her Muslim sister? It is said that no bequest must be made to an heir. If we are not entitled to inherit, is it permissible to make a will for us with one third of the money? Second, jewels and valuable objects. Is it permissible for the Kafir parents to distribute such items among their children during their lifetime as a grant, provided that the children use them during their fathers&#8217; lifetime, and after their death these things are returned to the children as agreed upon in the grant? Third, trivial objects and things of low value, such as clothes, mugs and furniture. Is it permissible for us to take them and use them after their death? Is it permissible for us to give them to some Muslims or Kafirs, or simply get rid of them? If the mother dies, and the father is still alive, is it permissible for their daughter to accept her father&#8217;s offer and take her mother&#8217;s things such as clothes?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: A Muslim does not inherit a Kafir, neither does a Kafir inherit a Muslim, according to the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him), Neither a Muslim inherits a Kafir, nor does a Kafir inherit a Muslim. Agreed upon by Al-Bukhari and Muslim in the Hadith reported from Usamah (may Allah be pleased with him). <strong>However, it is permissible for the Muslim children to accept the grants, gifts and wills from their Kafir parents. They can also make contracts with them according to the Shar`y (Islamically lawful) regulations.</strong> However, it is impermissible for them to inherit their parents. If the Kafir parents deprive their Muslim children from their inheritance and dedicate all of it to their Kafir children, the Muslim children have no right to claim any of their parents&#8217; property, as this claim only takes the form of inheritance, which is a compulsory right. It is known that a Muslim does not inherit a Kafir. May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A: A person who converts to Islam does not have to make up for Salah and Sawm (fasting) which they did not perform during the days of their Kufr (disbelief), as Allah stated, Say to those who have disbelieved, if they cease (from disbelief), their past will be forgiven. (Surah Al-Anfal, 8: 38). The Prophet (peace be upon him) also stated, Islam wipes out all that has gone before it (previous misdeeds). The Prophet (peace be upon him) did not order those who embraced Islam to make up for any missed rites of Islam. The scholars also unanimously agreed upon this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: The submitter says he has recently converted to Islam. He had bought a house before he converted to Islam through a transaction widely prevailing in the West. To clarify, he paid a certain amount of the price in advance and borrowed the remainder on credit. Knowing that a Muslim may not pay or receive interest, he inquires about the ruling on interest that he has to pay for that loan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: If the reality is as you have mentioned, the person in question should submit his new status to the authority from which he took the loan asking it to take back only the capital, i.e. without interest, as interest is prohibited according to Islam. Doing so is more precautionary and frees him from accountability for paying the usurious interest. If the borrowing authority approves of it, it will be alright, praise be to Allah. Otherwise, he will have to pay the interest stipulated in the contract he had signed before converting to Islam.</p>
<p>May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A: There is no problem with dictating Shahadah to a woman who wants to become a Muslim if this is performed by a man or a woman. Yet it is preferable if it is a woman who does so, so that the new Muslim woman can learn all that she needs to know about Islam with complete ease.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Repenting from all sins but keeping the ill-gotten money</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 6: A person used to abandon Salah (prayer), drink alcohol and commit vile deeds. He has a lot of ill-gotten money. He then turned to Allah with sincere repentance with regard to all the sins mentioned above except the ill-gotten money. Should he get rid of such ill-gotten money? Or will he be treated like a new Muslim who is not asked about the source of his wealth?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: on turning to Allah with sincere repentance with regards to the ill-gotten money, it is obligatory for one to get rid of such evil money. In case he is not able to define the ill-gotten money, he can give out what he thinks to clear himself from such guilt. This is to be followed if his sins have not caused him to leave Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On committing sins that make a person leave Islam such as the abandonment of Salah, according to the most preponderant opinion of scholars, even if such a person does not deny its obligation, repentance can be realized by performing Salah and embracing Islam again. This is because Islam wipes out all that has gone before it. <strong><span style="color:#0000ff;">Also, one is not obliged to get rid of the money he got before adopting Islam. This is because Allay (Exalted be He) says about the disbelievers, Say to those who have disbelieved, if they cease (from disbelief), their past will be forgiven</span></strong>. As mentioned in the Sahih (Authentic Book of Hadith), the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, Islam wipes out all that has gone before it (previous misdeeds). And penitence also wipes out all that has gone before it.</p>
<p>May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 4: Has the gradual communication of the Islamic legislation ended by the completion of delivering the Message? Is it permissible for a Da`y (caller to Islam) to tell a new Muslim about the commands and the prohibitions of Islam gradually, so that they are not shocked?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is permissible to convey the Message of Islam to others gradually, acting upon the Hadith of Mu`adh when he was sent by the Prophet (peace be upon him) to Yemen. The Six Hadith Compilers (Al-Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhy, Al-Nasa&#8217;y, and Ibn Majah) reported from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) told Mu`adh ibn Jabal when he sent him to Yemen: You are going to people of a (Divine) Book. So when you come to them call them to testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. If they obey you in that, inform them that Allah has enjoined on them five Salahs (to be offered) in every day and night. If they obey you in that, inform them that Allah has enjoined on them Sadaqah (obligatory charity) to be taken from the rich among them and given to the poor among them. If they obey you in that, beware (not to take as obligatory charity) their precious property! And fear the supplication of a wronged person, for there is no barrier between them and Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Islamic legislation, it has come to an end by the death of the Prophet (peace be upon him), as Allah (Exalted be He) says: This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islâm as your religion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Some people hasten to explain some matters to new Muslims, some of these matters may be minor details, for example, wearing the complete Hijab (veil) for women and growing a beard for men and circumcision and other such matters. Can you comment on this subject?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: These are minor details, if they are clarified at the beginning, there is nothing wrong with that, and if they are delayed to a later time, there is also nothing wrong with that. The most important thing is to explain the basics of the religion so that the person can enter Islam. As for subsidiary matters like shaving the beard or shortening it, or wearing Hijab, or circumcision and the like, these should better be delayed to a later time so that the person is not repelled or discouraged and just to teach them the foundations of Islam first and its great pillars. After they embrace Islam, they can be encouraged to perform the rest of the practices of Islam.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Do not recite Surah Al-Fatihah during Ruku` or Sujud instead of Tasbih!</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">Q4: Is it permissible for a new Muslim to recite Surah Al-Fatihah and some Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) instead of the obligatory Tasbihs (glorifications of Allah) and Du`a&#8217; (supplications) that are obligatory in Salah (Prayer) or is there anything else that can be said instead, because this is difficult at the beginning?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: A new Muslim should recite the Qur&#8217;an and Dhikr (Remembrance of Allah) in the correct places during Salah as soon as they can, as Allah says: Allâh burdens not a person beyond his scope. However, they should not recite Surah Al-Fatihah while in Ruku` (bowing) or Sujud (prostration) instead of Tasbih.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">Q: On our visit to Uganda, we noticed that some Christians bring their children to embrace Islam in an orphanage for newly converted Muslims. When the parents were asked why they themselves do not embrace Islam, their answer was that they fear being circumcised. What is the opinion of Your Eminence concerning this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">It is not necessary to demand that they be circumcised, if they fear that, for this is Sunnah (action following the teachings of the Prophet) and not an obligatory action, according to the majority of scholars. Those who maintain that circumcision is obligatory restrict it to situations where there are no fears for the circumcised person&#8217;s safety</span>.</p>
<p>If this fear of circumcision prevents those Christians from embracing Islam, they should not be asked to do it at the time of embracing Islam. When Islam becomes firm in their hearts, this matter can be reconsidered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and his Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Question</strong>: An Indonesian Christian woman who had come to Berlin, in West Germany, for a special task she is entrusted with by the government of Indonesia, converted to Islam. The woman belongs to an influential family which has good connections with President Suharto. Moreover, her husband is an official in the Indonesian Ministry of Defense and Security. In Sha&#8217;a Allah (If Allah wills), through her conversion to Islam, being an intellectual and influential woman, she will prove to be useful to Islam and Muslims. However, the dilemma is that her husband is a Christian bigot and thus she cannot declare her conversion to Islam. Until now, no one knows about her conversion except us (7 people only). Nevertheless, she intends to tell her husband and children about her conversion to Islam in her own way so that she can call them to Islam. Your Eminence Shaykh, I do not know what to do in this regard knowing that Allah prohibited that a Muslim woman be married to a non-Muslim man and that such a woman has to leave her husband immediately after her conversion to Islam. On account of her being a new convert to Islam, I do not think she can enforce such an Islamic ruling and I fear that she may go back to disbelief. Furthermore, she does not belong to an ordinary family. Had she belonged to an ordinary family, leaving the husband would have been easy. Therefore, I ask you about the issue and want, if possible, a fatwa from Shaykh Ibn Baz. May I postpone ordering her to leave her non-Muslim husband until her belief gets stronger? Or, what should I tell her?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">She has to tell her husband about her conversion to Islam and that she is now prohibited to be his wife until he embraces Islam</span>.</p>
<p>If he embraces Islam while she is in her `Iddah (waiting period), she will remain his wife without the need to contract marriage anew.</p>
<p>However, if he converts to Islam after the `Iddah is over, he may marry her anew through a new marriage contract provided that she shows her consent and all Shar`y (Islamic legal) conditions are met.</p>
<p>May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">Q: One of my Non-Muslim workers has converted to Islam. A few hours later, he asked for a Mus-haf and a translation to read. After a few days, he asked to go and perform `Umrah (lesser pilgrimage). My question is: Should I let him touch the Mus-haf and travel to Allah&#8217;s Sacred Land, or wait a year or more until he becomes a true Muslim, and I am sure that has sincerely embraced Islam?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: If you are sure concerning his Islam, it is permissible for you to give him a Mus-haf to read and accompany him to perform Hajj or `Umrah. You will be rewarded for this Insha&#8217;a Allah, for the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated: &#8220;Whoever calls others to follow guidance, their reward will be equivalent to those who shall follow them (in righteousness)&#8221; And Allah helps His servant as long as the servant helps their fellow brothers .</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">Q: Thanks to Allah, some Japanese women accepted Islam. They began to struggle with the atheist Japanese society that prefers disbelief and distorted Christianity to Islam. Indeed, there are no obligations in the distorted Christianity, so a person may drink Khamr (intoxicant), eat pork, have girl friends, and at the same time be a Christian who believes in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. On the other hanzd, a new Muslim has to stand out and become different from non-Muslims and keeps away from their society and gatherings when it comes to `Aqidah (creed); so they become subject to be ostracized and regarded as insane.Non-Muslims may even isolate new Muslim converts and deny them work. They cannot accept them as fellow Japanese while seeing them do what they deem as awful offense i.e. becoming Muslims, abandoning non-Muslim parties, Khamr, pork, and praying to Allah, the God that such non-Muslim people deny as the true Lord?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">The problems the girls face are even worse, as they are weaker and usually depend on work to support themselves or on their non-Muslim families to support them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">Among the various problems the Muslim women face is the observation of the religious obligations e.g. wearing the Hijab (veil). Many times, a woman is prevented from wearing Hijab and offering Salah (Prayer) at her workplace. as she cannot pray on time, she makes up for the missed prayers together lest she should be fired from work; her only source to earn her living, as she lives apart from her non-Muslim family.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">Another problem a Muslim young woman may face is her inability to fast Ramadan when she hides her Islam from her family, especially her strict Christian mother. This mother prefers that her daughter becomes a disbeliever to becoming a Muslim. This girl studies at the university and her family supports her.She lives, eats, and drinks with them in the same house. This might lead her to committing many prohibitions. She cannot fast Ramadan, as this will be strange to her family. If they know of her conversion, they might harm and prevent her from continuing her education which will be her only way to earn her living in the future. A third problem a new Japanese Muslim may face is when his wife and children remain non-Muslims and he does not know what to do about them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">We would like to ask your Eminence the following questions:</span><br />
<span style="color:#800000;"> 1. What should a Muslim woman do in such circumstances in Japan?</span><br />
<span style="color:#800000;"> 2. What should this Muslim man do with his non-Muslim wife and children? Is his disbelieving wife still lawful to him?</span><br />
<span style="color:#800000;"> 3. Is Salah (Prayer) offered by a woman outside her house and in public places while sitting behind a screen to cover her `Awrah (private parts of the body that must be covered in public) valid? May Allah reward you with the best!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <strong>Firstly</strong>, anyone who reverts to Islam and conceals it lest they should be harmed need to indirectly show the merits of Islam to people they fear from without makingtheir reversion known. They should invoke Allah (Exalted be He) to guide them, perhaps Allah will guide them to accept Islam. This would ward off their evil. If they are not guided and are expected to harm the person, or the country does not allow the practicing of the Islamic rites, then this person should migrate to muslim lands, if possible. Allah (Exalted be He) says, He who emigrates (from his home) in the Cause of Allâh, will find on earth many dwelling places and plenty to live by. i.e. they should find another place away from the place they detest, a way out from deviation to guidance, from distress to relief, and from poverty to welfare.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A weak person who can not migrate is excused as they are prevented from immigration or due to being a woman. Allah (Exalted be He) says, Verily! As for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves (as they stayed among the disbelievers even though emigration was obligatory for them), they (angels) say (to them): &#8220;In what (condition) were you?&#8221; They reply: &#8220;We were weak and oppressed on the earth.&#8221; They (angels) say: &#8220;Was not the earth of Allâh spacious enough for you to emigrate therein?&#8221; Such men will find their abode in Hell &#8211; What an evil destination! Except the weak ones among men, women and children who cannot devise a plan, nor are they able to direct their way. These are they whom Allâh is likely to forgive them, and Allâh is Ever Oft-Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving. These Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) mean that the weak people are not able to develop plans, spend, and direct their way if they migrate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>, a weak woman should be in contact with the Islamic centers in her country, as they might help her. Otherwise, she should be patient and wait for a way out. She should invoke Him (Exalted be He) to facilitate her affairs. She will be rewarded In sha’a-Allah (if Allah wills). She should abide by the teachings, rulings, and obligatory acts of Islam as much as she can for Allah (Glorified be He) says, So keep your duty to Allâh and fear Him as much as you can The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, If I order you to do something, do as much of it as you can. (Al-Bukhari and Muslim agreed upon its authenticity.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly</strong>, when a man converts to Islam but his wife remains in disbelief, it is permissible for him to keep her, if she is from the People of the Book (a Christian or a Jew),since the basic ruling is that it is permissible for a Muslim to marry chaste women of the People of the Book. Allah (Exalted be He) says, Made lawful to you this day are At-Tayyibât [all kinds of Halâl (lawful) foods, which Allâh has made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, milk products, fats, vegetables and fruits)]. The food (slaughtered cattle, eatable animals) of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) is lawful to you and yours is lawful to them. (Lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women from the believers and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, it is not permissible for him to stay with her if she is not from the people of the Book. Allah says, Likewise hold not the disbelieving women as wives.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, if a woman converts to Islam while her husband remains a disbeliever, she becomes unlawful to him for Allah says, O you who believe! When believing women come to you as emigrants, examine them; Allâh knows best as to their Faith, then if you ascertain that they are true believers send them not back to the disbelievers. They are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers nor are the disbelievers lawful (husbands) for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If she is forced to stay with him, she should be patientuntil she finds a way out and there is no harm on her as the early Muslim women did. Zaynab (may Allah be pleased with her) the daughter of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) stayed with her husband Abu Al-`As ibn Al-Rabi`, after she converted to Islam, before he converted to Islam. The Prophet (peace be upon him) did not separate them. When she followed the Prophet (peace be upon him) to Madinah, their marriage was annulled. However, the Prophet (peace be upon him) gave her back to him after he became a Muslim.</p>
<p><strong>Fourthly</strong>, as for the children, they should follow the best religion of their parents. If one of the parents embraces Islam, all the minor children will be Muslims, as children follow the best religion of their parents.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifthly</strong>, a woman should cover before any Ajnaby (man lawful for the woman to marry). She should stay away from anything that shows her adornment, stay at her house, and she should not leave it except out of necessity and in such a case she should dress modestly. If the time of Salah is due while she is out of her house, she has to offer it in a place away from men. The excuse mentioned in the question does not exempt her from standing while offering Salah, because standing is a pillar of Salah for anyone who is able to.</p>
<p>May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">Q: People who embrace Islam in Europe are given written certificates by the Islamic institutions to prove that they are Muslims. Such certificates had never been given to Muslims throughout the history of Islam. Is not the witnessing of two just Muslims and the testimony of the new Muslim himself sufficient? Is not this written certificate a Bid&#8217;ah (rejected innovation in religion)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: A Muslim does not need such a certificate to prove his faith before Allah; however, it may be required by people to settle some matters. Thus, a person is required to state their religion on their identity card, passport, family records, and birth certificate. They sometimes might not be able to prove that they are Muslims, as when one travels to a country where he knows no one, or if a person dies abroad. In this case, a person is identified by their passport, identity card, or these other certificates, as it is usually too difficult to prove [that a person is a Muslim] in such cases.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, there is no harm in this certificate. Although it is an innovation, it is not a Bid&#8217;ah related to religion; the prohibited Bid&#8217;ah is only that related to religion, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated, Whoever introduces a practice into this affair of ours that is not of it, it is to be rejected. He thus clarified that the rejected Bida&#8217;s are those innovated in matters of religion.</p>
<p>May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 1: A Christian couple came to me and showed interest to embrace Islam, I requested them to perform Ghusl (ritual bath), to pronounce Shahadah (Testimony of Faith) in consent, and to get circumcised. Is what I did correct? Please provide in writing the statements of Salaf (Righteous Predecessors) in this regard and the procedures the new converts are advised to follow at the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) used to call the disbelievers to Islam by asking them to testify that there is no deity [<span style="color:#888888;">worthy of worship</span>] but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. If they accepted this, the Prophet (peace be upon him) would ask them to apply the rest of the tenets of Shari`ah depending on the circumstances and the importance of these tenets. Among the reports mentioned in this regard is the one narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them) that when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) sent Mu`adh to Yemen (as governor) the Prophet said to him, &#8220;You will reach a community of the People of the Book, the very first thing to which you should call them is to testify that there is god but Allah. Another wording is, First call them to Tawhid (monotheism), and if they accept this, then tell them that Allah has enjoined upon them five prayers during the day and the night. If they accept it, then tell them that Allah has made Zakah obligatory on them; it should be collected from the rich and distributed among the poor. If they agree to it, do not take (as a share of Zakah) the best of their wealth. Beware of the supplication of the oppressed for there is no barrier between him and Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, it was narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim from Sahl ibn Sa`d Al-Sa`idy The Prophet (peace be upon him) said to `Aly (may Allah be pleased with him) when he handed him the banner on the day of Khaybar, &#8220;Go to them patiently and calmly until you enter the land. Then, invite them to Islam, and inform them of what has been enjoined upon them; by Allah, if He gives guidance to somebody through you, it is better for you than possessing red (precious) camels.&#8221; Another wording is, Invite them to testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and that Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the Messenger of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Salaf disputed over the necessity of Ghusl for new Muslim converts.Among the scholars who believed it was obligatory were Malik, Ahmad, and Abu Thawr (may Allah be merciful with them) because of the report related by Abu Dawud and Al-Nasa&#8217;y from Qays ibn `Asim (may Allah be pleased with him), who said, I came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) with the intention of embracing Islam. He commanded me to perform Ghusl with water (boiled with) the leaves of the lote-tree. Using the verb &#8220;commanded&#8217; implies the obligation of this act.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, Al-Shafi`y and some Hanbaly scholars stated that this act is Mustahab (desirable) unless the new Muslim convert becomes Junub (in a state of major ritual impurity) shortly before converting to Islam, in which case they are obliged to perform Ghusl. Abu Hanifah stated that a new Muslim convert is not obliged to perform Ghusl in all cases. Therefore, the couple mentioned above may perform Ghusl on the basis the cited Hadith, as well as other similar Hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to circumcision, it is obligatory for men but only recommended for women. However, it could be delayed until Islam is firmly established in their hearts, lest it should induce their aversion to Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the basis of the above-mentioned points, all that you required the couple to do who newly converted to Islam is correct. May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Question: </strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">&#8220;Is it obligatory upon new Muslims to change their previous names such as George, Joseph, and others?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It is not obligatory to change the name unless it means worshipping other than Allah. However, changing one‎s name to something better is permissible. Accordingly, changing one‎s name from a foreign name to an Islamic name is proper and good, but as to whether it is obligatory, no it is not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if a person‎s name is Abd Al-Masih (slave of the Messiah) or similar names that indicate servitude to other than Allah, it becomes obligatory to change it. It falls under the ruling of worshipping other than Allah by the Ijma‎ (consensus) of scholars as reported by Abu Muhammad ibn Hazm (may Allah be merciful to him). Allah is the Grantor of success.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Today many realize that all of the materialistic and secular progress produced a spiritual vacuum that led to social, economical, political and psychological problems. That is why people who used to say: &#8220;let us live this life and enjoy it.&#8221; or &#8220;hey! We don&#8217;t want to know about God&#8221;, are in search again</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم <em>salal-laahu &#8216;Alayhi wasallam</em> ) was born in Makkah which is one of the most important cities of the <em>Jazeeratul-&#8216;arab</em> (the Arabian Peninsula). Makkah (Mecca) was not inhabited by people until Allaah commanded Prophet Ibraheem (Abraham عليه السلام: <em>&#8216;alayhis-salaam</em> [2]), to take his wife Hajar and his son Ismaeel (Ishma&#8217;il) to live there. Allaah sent them because He willed that from this place (i.e. Makkah) a message for all mankind would arise. Ibraheem (عليه السلام) left his wife Hajar and his son Isma&#8217;eel in Makkah and returned to Palestine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At that time Makkah was a land where there was scarcity of water so when the child Isma&#8217;eel became thirsty his mother Hajar could not find any water for him. Allaah sent the angel Jibreel (Gabriel) <em>&#8216;alayhis-salaam</em> عليه السلام who started hitting the ground with his feet and Allaah caused water to gush forth. This special water still exists to this day and its called the <em>ZamZam</em> water. This water was the answer to the Du&#8217;a (prayer) that Ibraheem (<em>&#8216;alayhis-salaam</em> عليه السلام) made and it is mentioned in the Qur&#8217;aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring to dwell in an uncultivable valley by Your Sacred House (the Ka&#8217;bah at Makkah); in order, O our Lord, that they may perform As-Salât (establish prayer), so fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits so that they may give thanks.</span></em> [Qur&#8217;an, Ibrahim (14): 37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Soon people started coming to Makkah and eventually it flourished until it became one of the most important cities in the Arabian Peninsula. When Isma&#8217;eel (عليه السلام) became older, Allaah commanded Ibraheem (عليه السلام) and his son to raise the Ka’aba.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Later Isma&#8217;eel (عليه السلام) married and had many children and grand-children. Generations later they became many tribes. Our Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) came from the tribe called Quraysh. For many years the descendants of Ibraheem and Isma&#8217;eel (<em>&#8216;alayhimus-Salaam</em>) worshiped Allaah alone but as the generations passed the people forgot the way of Ibraheem and started worshiping idols, sun, moon, stars, fire and other dieties.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Each tribe had many families and a leader whom the people followed and obeyed. &#8216;Abdul Muttalib, the grand-father of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم), was one of the leaders of his tribe called Quraysh. The place where these Arabs lived became known as the Arabian Peninsula. Every Arab defended his own tribe against other tribes in the course of many wars between tribes. Before the coming of Islam, the Arabs were known for some good qualities such as respecting the neighbors, being generous, keeping promises, etc.. They also had very bad qualities such as drinking alcohol and burying their young girls alive because they did not like it when girls were born.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) was born in the tribe of Quraysh in Makkah on a Monday in the year 571 C.E. His father’s name was &#8216;Abdullah and his mother’s name was Aaminah bint [3] Wahab. His grand-father &#8216;Abdul-Muttalib was very pleased and named him Muhammad. His complete name is Muhammad bin [4] &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Abdul Muttalib bin Hashim from the tribe of Quraysh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet’s father &#8216;Abdullah was one of the best youth in all of Makkah. After his marriage with Aaminah he travelled to a land called <em>Bilaad ush-Shaam</em>. Today this comprises West of Iraq, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Palestine. On his way back to Makkah he fell ill and died. His death occurred seven months before the birth of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was the culture of the Arabs to get their children suckled by nursing women who lived away from the city life thus the children could learn to adapt themselves to the harsh conditions of the desert. Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) was suckled by his mother for a little while but later was given to a woman called Haleemah As-Sa’diyyah. She took him to her house which was located outside of Makkah and he stayed with her until he was four years old.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) turned six years old, his mother Aamina died. &#8216;Abdul Muttalib took Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) in his custody and took care of him. He loved Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) very much but he died when the Prophet was only eight years old. The Prophet was then looked after by his uncle, Abu Taalib, who loved him dearly. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) started working at a very young age as a shepherd for the people of Makkah but did not get much in return. At the age of fifteen he started going with his uncle on business trips. He gained a lot of good reputation and thus the people of Makkah started calling him <em>Al-Ameen</em> (the trustworthy).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Makkah there lived a very honorable woman by the name of Khadeejah bint Khuwaylid. She heard about the Prophet’s (صلى الله عليه وسلم) truthfulness and sent him on a business trip. She had a servant-boy by the name of Maysara who accompanied the Prophet on that journey. The Prophet took her caravan to the lands of <em>Ash-shaam</em> and came back with a lot of profit. The servant-boy informed Khadeejah of his excellent manners and qualities. Khadeejah was very impressed by this and wanted to marry the Prophet. The Prophet’s uncle, Abu Taalib, arranged the marriage between them. At that time Khadeejah was forty years old and the Prophet was twenty five years old. She was a very good wife and a great help to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) had six children with Khadeejah, two boys and four girls. Their names were &#8216;Abdullah, Qaasim, Zainab, Ruqayyah, Umm Kulthum and Fatimah. &#8216;Abdullah and Qaasim died at a young age. He also had another son named Ibraheem from Maria al Qibtiyah who was from Egypt. Ibraheem too died at a very young age. All his daughters became Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once the people of Makkah differed amongst themselves as to who will rebuild the Ka’bah when its building became weak. There is a special stone called the ‘Black Stone’ and all the tribes wanted this great honor to place it in position. They could not come to a solution thus they started arguing and even were getting prepared to fight. Some amongst them suggested that the first person to come to their meeting would be the judge and will decide about whom amongst them would place the Black Stone. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) was the first one to come to the meeting and he was thirty five years old at that time. When they saw the Prophet come they all shouted with joy, &#8220;this is <em>Al-Ameen</em> (the trustworthy) and we accept him as our judge.&#8221; The Prophet was a very wise man. He ordered for a sheet to be placed on the ground and then he placed the Black Stone in the middle of it. The Prophet asked each tribe to hold one end of the sheet thus all the tribes worked in unity and carried the stone. All the tribes being pleased with this judgment showed once again the wisdom of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of Quraysh loved and respected him but the Prophet himself was not pleased about some matters. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) was greatly bothered when he saw his people worshiping idols, drinking alcohol and gambling. Thus he did not like to mix with them but when he saw some good he shared with them. Many times he went into seclusion in order to avoid the evil of the society he was living in. He (صلى الله عليه وسلم) went to a cave in a mountain called Hiraa for one a month each year in order to contemplate about the way of Ibraheem which was pure from idol worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One night of Ramadhan in the year 610 (C.E) an extraordinary event that would change the course of history happened. The Archangel Jibreel was sent to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم by Allaah. He squeezed the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) three times and each time Jibreel asked the Prophet to ‘Read’. The first verses of the Qur&#8217;aan were revealed to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) on that night….</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Read! In the Name of your Lord, Who has created (all that exists), has created man from a clot (a piece of thick coagulated blood). Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous. Who has taught (the writing) by the pen, has taught man that which he knew not.</span> [Qur&#8217;an, Al Alaq (96): 1-5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) was very frightened due to this incidence thus he hurried home and he asked his wife to cover him. Khadeejah (may Allaah be pleased with her) covered the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and comforted him. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) narrated the incident to her and Khadeejah, after showing her support, took him to her cousin Waraqah bin Nawfal. He was a wise man and knew the stories of the Prophets who came before. Waraqah comforted Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and explained to him the great responsibility that is going to be given to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The moment that changed history began. Allaah ordered the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) to call people to Islam (though not openly). Allaah told him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">O you (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) enveloped (in garments)! Arise and warn!</span></em> [Quran, AlMuddaththir (74):1-2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) obeyed the command of Allaah and started calling the people towards the worship of Allaah alone, without any partners (idols, saints, angels and other creation that the people of Makkah worshiped before Islam). The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) began preaching to his family and then his friends. The first to accept Islam was his wife Khadeejah, may Allaah be pleased with her. The first amongst the men to believe in Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) was Abu Bakr as-Sideeq, and amongst the boys the first to believe were Ali who was the cousin of Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and Zaid bin Harith, may Allaah be pleased with them all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) preached for three years in secrecy and met in a house called the place of Arqam. Then Allaah commanded the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) to call the people openly to the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Therefore proclaim openly (Allah&#8217;s Message of Islamic Monotheism) that which you are commanded, and turn away from Al-Mushrikeen</em> (polytheists, idolaters, and disbelievers, etc. &#8211; see V.2:105)</span>. [Qur&#8217;an, Al-Hijr (15): 94].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) obeyed and called the people of Makkah for a meeting on mount Safa. He told them the message of Tawheed, that is to worship none but Allaah. A man amongst the crowd started shouting angrily at the Prophet and he was Abu Lahab the uncle of Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم). Allaah revealed a whole chapter about him. Allaah Says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Perish the two hands of Abû Lahab (an uncle of the Prophet), and perish he! His wealth and his children (etc.) will not benefit him! He will be burnt in a Fire of blazing flames! And his wife too, who carries wood (thorns of Sadan which she used to put on the way of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم ), or use to slander him). In her neck is a twisted rope of Masad (palm fibre).</em></span> [Qur&#8217;an, Al-Masad (111): 1-5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) preached this way for ten years. During this time he and those who accepted Islam suffered many types of torment. The people of Makkah called the Prophet names, calling him crazy, insane, magician and other bad names. They warned the people of other tribes to not to talk to him. They put thorns on his way and also tortured other Muslims. The Muslims were very patient because the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) told them to be patient to gain the pleasure of Allaah. Amongst them were Bilal bin Rabah, Ammar bin Yaasir, may Allaah be pleased with all of them. The parents of Ammar, Yaasir and Summaiyah, were tortured and killed by the <em>Mushrikeen</em> (disbelivers) thus they became the first <em>Shaheeds</em> (martyrs) of Islam. The only person who stood up for Prophet was his Uncle Abu Taalib.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet ordered the Muslims who were tortured extensively to leave and migrate to a land in Africa called Abyssinia (now Ethiopia). The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) chose this place because the King of Abyssinia, an-Najaashi was a just ruler. The Muslims began to migrate to Abyssinia secretly without the knowledge of the Quraysh until they were almost one hundred. An-Najaashi honored them and treated them well. The Quraysh were angered by the behaviour of An-Najaashi and in order to harm the Muslims who were settled in Abyssinia they sent some delegates to trick An-Najaashi. The delegates were loaded with gifts and they asked An-Najaashi to return the Muslims to the Makkahns. They told him that the Muslims were bad rebellious people who invented a new religion, but Allaah caused their plot to fail. An-Najaashi was a just ruler and when he enquired with the Muslims about their religion he realized that Islam was the true religion. Later An-Najaashi also believed in Islam. But did not say it in the open because he feared for his life from his people who were mostly Christians.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The number of Muslims began to grow day after day. Even some of the leaders of the Quraysh accepted Islam, amongst them were Hamza bin Abdul Muttalib, &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khataab, may Allaah be pleased with them. The Mushrikeen were angered by this and they plotted against the family of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم). They boycotted the Muslims by stopping the trade with them and the Muslims entered the state of siege for three years. The Muslims suffered so much so that they had to eat from the leaves of the trees. When some leaders saw this they felt sympathetic and ended the boycott. In that year his uncle Abu Taalib died and also his wife Khadeejah (may Allaah be pleased with her) died. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) was greatly affected by this. In fact this year was called the Year of Sorrow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Mushrikeen from Quraysh took this opportunity and increased their transgression towards the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم). But the Prophet was very patient and he continued to call the people from other tribes to Islam. During these difficult moments the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) reached a city called at-Taaif hoping to find some support but he was hurt again. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) also called to Islam the tribes visiting Makkah for Pilgrimage but the tribes refused.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the eleventh year of Prophethood six people from the city of Madeenah contacted the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and accepted Islam secretly due to their fear of Quraysh. When they returned to Madeenah they preached Islam to their people and, all praise is due to Allaah, many accepted Islam. A year later twelve people from Madeenah came and met the Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) in a place called al-Aqabah. They gave their allegiance to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم). This pledge is known as the Pledge of <strong>al-&#8216;Aqabah al-Uulaa</strong> (The First Pledge of al-&#8216;Aqabah) The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) sent his companion Mus’ab bin Umair, may Allaah be pleased with him, with them to Madeenah to teach them Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam began spreading rapidly in Madeenah, so much so that every house at least had one person who was a Muslim. A year later, seventy three men and women from Madeenah came to Makkah in order to perform Hajj (Pilgrimage). There they met Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) in the middle of the night at a place called Mina because they did not want to be seen by the Mushrikeen of Quraysh. The uncle of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) Al-‘Abbas was present and they all gave the pledge of support to the Prophet and they invited the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) to stay with them in Madeenah. This was the <strong>Second Pledge of al-‘Aqabah</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Mushrikeen amongst the Quraysh knew about the Second Pledge of al-‘Aqabah. This greatly worried them and thus they increased their torture on the Muslims. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) permitted some Muslims to migrate to Madeenah and they left Makkah in secrecy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Soon after the Mushrikeen of Quraysh plotted to kill the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم), but Allaah the Most High informed the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) of their plan. The Prophet told his closest companion Abu Bakr as-Sideeq that he intended to migrate to Madeenah and Abu Bakr agreed to go with him. The Mushrikeen amongst the Quraysh surrounded the Prophet’s home in order to kill him. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) ordered his cousin &#8216;Ali bin Abee Taalib (may Allaah be pleased with him) to sleep on his bed and Allaah then caused the Mushirkeen to not see the Prophet whilst he was leaving the house. The Prophet then met with Abu Bakr and they both left to Madeenah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Later when the Mushrikeen realized that the Prophet had already left they put a price of hundred camels on his head. Anyone who would inform about the whereabouts of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) would get that reward of hundred camels. They were hiding in a cave and the Mushrikeen were very close to the cave but Allaah protected the Prophet and Abu Bakr and they were able to reach Madeenah safely. Allaah Says about this in the Qur&#8217;aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">If you help him (Muhammad  صلى الله عليه وسلم) not (it does not matter), for Allah did indeed help him when the disbelievers drove him out, the second of two, when they (Muhammad  صلى الله عليه وسلم and Abu Bakr) were in the cave, and he (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said to his companion (Abu Bakr): &#8220;Be not sad (or afraid), surely Allah is with us.&#8221; Then Allah sent down His Sakeenah (calmness, tranquility, peace, etc.) upon him, and strengthened him with forces (angels) which you saw not, and made the word of those who disbelieved the lowermost, while it was the Word of Allah that became the uppermost, and Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise</span></em>. [Qur&#8217;an, At-Tawbah (9): 40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) reached Madeenah there was a great reception for him and his companion. Madeenah was later called Al-Madeenatu-Nabawiyyah, the City of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم). Allaah named those who migrated to Madeenah from Makkah as ‘<em>Muhajireen</em>’. When the transgression of the Mushrikeen increased Allaah ordered the Prophet to fight them. Allaah Says in Qur&#8217;aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And fight in the Way of Allah those who fight you, but transgress not the limits. Truly, Allah likes not the transgressors</span></em>. [This Verse is the first one that was revealed in connection with Jihad, but it was supplemented by another (V.9:36)]. [Qur&#8217;an Al-Baqarah (2):190].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A caravan of Quraysh was returning to Makkah from Ash-Shaam (greater Syria area) and it had lots of goods in it. When the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) heard about this he decided to take it because of what the Mushrikeen took from the wealth of the believers of Makkah. This caravan was led by Abu Sufyaan. When he came to know about this he sent for the Mushrikeen of Makkah to help guard his caravan but before their arrival Abu Sufyaan&#8217;s caravan was able to flee. Whilst on his way back he met his people who were coming to protect the caravan. Abu Sufyaan told them to return back to Makkah but the leaders of Quraysh refused and proceeded to fight the Muslims. They kept marching in the direction of the city of Madeenah with an army of one thousand men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) consulted with the <em>Muhajireen</em> and the <em>Ansaar</em> (the helpers, the people of Madeenah who helped the Prophet and his companions were given this title) and told them to stand up against the transgression of Quraysh. Both the Ansaar and the Muhajireen agreed to this and they were 314 in number. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) called upon Allaah for help and the battle of ‘Badr’ started on the day of Friday the 17th of Ramadhan, a year after the migration of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) to Madeenah. Allaah sent angels to fight the Quraysh and gave the Muslims a great victory. Seventy of the Mushrik were killed, seventy were taken as captives and fourteen Muslims were martyred. The Quraysh wanted revenge and they prepared an army of three thousands men which was led by Abu Sufyaan. When the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) came to know of this he again consulted with his companions and decided to confront the Mushrikheen of Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) took 1000 companions to the Mount Uhud and organized their positions. He told a special group of Muslims to not leave their own place at any cost and they were positioned where they could easily protect the Muslims from the enemies. When the battle began victory was almost guaranteed for the Muslims and when the special group saw this they wanted to collect the spoils of war and thus left their positions. The Mushrikeen seized this opportunity and killed many Muslims, amongst them was Hamza bin &#8216;Abdul Muttalib, the uncle of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم). Even the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) was hurt on his face and some of his teeth were broken. This battle took place on Saturday the 15th of Shawwal, three years after the migration of Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There were many Jews living in Madeenah and they did not keep their promise to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) of not attacking and not harming the Muslims. They went to the Mushrikeen of Makkah and told them to continue with their fight and promised them wealth, arms and support against the Muslims. Thus the Mushrikeen of Makkah started to call upon other tribes to fight against the Muslims and they managed to gather an army of 10,000 fighters who was led by Abu Sufyaan. They went to fight the Muslims on the 15th of Shawwal 5 AH. The Prophet consulted with his companions once again and they all agreed to stay in Madeenah and protect it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Madeenah was exposed geographically for attacks from all its sides and thus there was great danger in this. One of the companions by the name Salman al Farisy, who was a Persian, suggested building a big ditch/trench around Madeenah in order to prevent the Mushrikeen of Makkah from entering the city. An army of 3000 Muslims was prepared to fight the Mushrikeen. When the army of the Makkans arrived at Madeenah it could not pass the trench and was confused as to what it could possibly do to win the war. For a whole month the enemy forces surrounded Madeenah but the weather was getting worse by the day. On one of the cold winter nights a strong wind blew their tents and caused much devastation to their army. They were hit by pebbles and sand and were forced to retreat. Thus the plot of the Jews failed. Allaah reminds us of this in the Qur&#8217;aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Remember Allah&#8217;s Favour to you, when there came against you hosts, and We sent against them a wind and forces that you saw not [i.e. troops of angels during the battle of Al-Ahzab (the Confederates)]. And Allah is Ever All-Seer of what you do.</span></em> [Qura&#8217;an, Al-Ahzab (33): 9].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This battle is known as the <strong>battle of Ahzaab</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A year later the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) wanted to perform &#8216;Umrah (a visit to the Ka&#8217;abah, the Sacred House in Makkah). When he and his companions entered a place called Al-Hudhaibiyah they were prevented by the Mushrikeen from entering Makkah and performing the &#8216;Umrah. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) started negotiating with the Quraysh and in the end they agreed on a peace treaty, the ‘<strong>Treaty of Hudaibiyyah</strong>’. From the conditions were:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) Ending of the war between the Mushrikeen of Makkah and Muslims for ten years.<br />
2) The &#8216;Umrah was to be delayed until the next year.<br />
3) The Arabian tribes are given the choice to join Muslims or the Quraysh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) gained much benefit from this treaty and he started preaching Islam to people outside of Madeenah. Many entered the fold of Islam during this period but the Quraysh broke their covenant by attacking the tribes that gave allegiance to the Muslims. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) decided to open Makkah and he prepared an army of 10,000 people. On the 20th of Ramadhan 8 AH, the Muslims reached Makkah. When the Quraysh saw the Muslims they lost their morale and the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) opened Makkah without a fight. Then he performed <em>tawaaf</em> (circumambulation) of the Ka’abah and destroyed the idols inside it. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم( was reciting the following verses from the Qur&#8217;aan whilst he was breaking the idols:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And say: &#8220;Truth (i.e. Islamic Monotheism or this Qur&#8217;an or Jihad against polytheists) has come and Batil (falsehood, i.e. polytheism, Satan, or etc.) has vanished. Surely! Batil is ever bound to vanish.&#8221;</em></span> [Qur&#8217;an, Al-Isra (17): 81]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) pardoned the people of Makkah. They became convinced that Islam was the true religion and they became Muslims. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) made da&#8217;wah (call to Islam) outside of Madeenah and the victory of Makkah boosted the morale of Muslims even more and many other people embraced Islam. Allaah Says about this in the Qur&#8217;aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">When comes the Help of Allah (to you, O Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) against your enemies and the conquest of Makkah), and you see that the people enter Allah&#8217;s religion (Islam) in crowds.</span></em> [Qur&#8217;an, An-Nasr (110): 1-2].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the 10th year AH the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) called his companions to come and perform Hajj (Pilgrimage to Makkah) with him in order to teach them the method of performing Hajj. About 100,000 came to perform Hajj. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) stood on the mount of Mercy on the day of &#8216;Arafah (the 9th Day of the 12th month of the Islamic calendar) and gave his magnificent Sermon in which he summarized for them their rights and their duties. He (صلى الله عليه وسلم) recited this verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.</span></em> [Qur&#8217;an, al-Maidah (5): 3].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) completed the &#8216;farewell pilgrimage’, it is called like this because this was the last pilgrimage of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Two months after his return to Madeenah from the pilgrimage, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) became very ill and his soul surrenderd to Allaah the Most High on the 12th of Rabbi Al Awwal, 11 A.H. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) was 63 years of age and was buried in the apartment of &#8216;Aaisha, his wife, may Allaah be pleased with her. The Muslims were very saddened by the death of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) but Abu Bakr, may Allaah be pleased with him, stood up and said “whoever worshiped Muhammad, then Muhammad is dead and whoever worshiped Allaah verily Allaah is ever living and NEVER dies”. Then he recited the following verse from the Qur&#8217;aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) is no more than a Messenger, and indeed (many) Messengers have passed away before him. If he dies or is killed, will you then turn back on your heels (as disbelievers)? And he who turns back on his heels, not the least harm will he do to Allah, and Allah will give reward to those who are grateful.</span></em> [Qur&#8217;an, Aali Imran (3):144].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) was medium in height. He was not too tall nor was he too short. He had a good body build up. He was trustworthy, wise, perseverant and gentle. He did not curse nor hurt anyone. He was kind to every one even those who hurt him. The Prophet was a great leader and an honorable fighter. He (صلى الله عليه وسلم) had a great character and did not have false pride and arrogance. He was forgiving and was noble. Allaah described him by saying: “verily you are of a great noble character.” He was kind to his neighbors and to the children. He called the people to worship Allaah alone like all the Prophets before him and he eliminated shirk. He corrected the people and removed the evil from the society. After the Prophet&#8217;s (صلى الله عليه وسلم) death the companions took the task of spreading Islam because Islam is for everyone the Chinese, Americans, Indians, Arabs, non-Arabs and all of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) is the final and last Prophet and Messenger sent by Allaah to mankind. There will not be any more Prophet after him. The Qur&#8217;aan that was revealed to the Prophet is filled with the Message of ‘<em>Tawheed</em>’ (i.e. to worship Allaah alone without associating partners with Him). We do not worship Prophets, good people, the dead or the living, nature, etc., but we worship the only True God, Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslim love the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and strive to follow his way in Islam, following him leads to Paradise and turning away from his way leads to Hell.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) called to Islam which is the Tawheed of Allaah: singling Allaah alone as the True God worthy of worship. The basis of Islam is ‘Laa ilaahaa Illal-laah, Muhammad Rasoolullah’ i.e. to bear witness that ‘there is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah’. This is what makes the person a Muslim and there is no religion accepted by Allaah except Islam. All the Prophets and Messengers like Adam, Noah, Ibraheem, Musa (Moses), and &#8216;Eesa (Jesus) called their nations to submit to Allaah in Tawheed. This is the Universal Message.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allaah, The Most Gracious, The Most Merciful<br />
All Praise is due to Allaah, Lord of everything that exists</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:large;"><strong><span style="color:green;">The Importance of Being Truthful</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Falaah Isma&#8217;eel recently relayed a heart-melting story that may interest you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Shaikh visited Holland, he was of course met by Muslims from Holland and they told him, &#8220;If you had come two weeks earlier you would have seen it yourself. We prayed over this man.&#8221; Then they told him the following story.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[What follows is not verbatim, but a summary, with some explanations so as to clarify some terms that may be new to non-Muslims.]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was a 26-year-old Christian from Holland. One day, he changed his dress to thobes, a burnoose, grew a beard, and the people started calling him &#8220;the one who looks like Jesus.&#8221;One day, he met some Muslims, and he said to them, &#8220;I love Jesus.&#8221; And the Muslims told him, &#8220;We also love Jesus, and it is even a condition of Islam. We love Jesus and Moses.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this man tried imitating Jesus, helping others when he could, cutting their lawns and the like. After two years, he entered the mosque [the Muslims&#8217; place of worship] for the first time, and he was greeted with &#8220;ahlan&#8221; [which means welcome, and thus was not greeted with the greeting reserved for Muslims &#8220;as-salaamu &#8216;alaykum&#8221; (which means: may peace and safety be upon you on the Day of Judgement)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8220;no; I want to be a Muslim.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, the Muslims witnessed his testimony (pronounced &#8220;shahada&#8221;) &#8211; there is none deserving of worship except Allaah, and Muhammad is His servant and Messenger, and Jesus is His servant and Messenger &#8211; taught him the basics, and taught him how to pray. He began praying in congregation with them, not missing a single congregation. Then one day, he noticed that the other Muslims were arriving at the mosque after him, so he asked for a key to the mosque. And he was given one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslims then observed that not only was he opening the mosque, but additionally he was routinely found in optional prayer whenever they entered the mosque for the dawn prayer. [They would enter and find him already engaged in the worship of Allaah.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then one day, he told the Muslims how he decided to become Muslim. He said he had a dream about Jesus (the son of Mary), and Jesus said to him, &#8220;Be Muslim. Be Muslim. Be Muslim.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I woke up, and a few days later, I had the same dream. This happened three times.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[The shaikh interjected and said, this is success from Allaah.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So after having prayed for 20 days with the other Muslims, he died.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the mercy of Allaah, and Allaah saved him [from dying upon other than Islam].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is Sidq (truthfulness); he truthfully loved Jesus, so he became Muslim. Allaah guided him to become Muslim, because he was truthful in his love for Jesus.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif;">If one is truthful in his love for Jesus and his following Jesus, then this should lead him to the true religion of Jesus (Islam) and should lead him to following whom Jesus commanded to be followed after him &#8211; Muhammad, the seal of all Prophets.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif;">After all, the religion of all the Prophets was Islam, and their creed was the same, and their message was the same, and they confirmed each other.</span><span style="font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif;"> It is only the deviant who have distorted the message of the previous Prophets, and thus Allaah promised to preserve His last revelation (the Qur`an) from corruption.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Question</strong>: What is the Masjid, (mosque) linguistically and religiously?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Linguistically, the masjid is the place of prostration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Religiously, it is everything that is built for the Muslims to offer the five prayers in congregation.<br />
It is also used to refer to that which is more general that this. Thus, it also includes that place that a person uses in his house(or has allocated) to offer the voluntary prayers in, or he uses it to perform the obligatory prayers when he is unable to offer them in the masjid where the people have established congregational prayer. From this is that which Al-Bukhari and others recorded from Jabir, may Allah be pleased with him, who said that the messenger of Allah sallahu alayhi was sallam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;I was given five (things) that no one was given before me. I was aided with Ar-Ru&#8217;b (fright cast into the hearts of enemies) for a month&#8217;s distance (of travel), and the earth was made a Masjid (place of prayer) for me and a means of purification. So any man from my nation (the Muslims) whom the (time for) prayer catches, then let him offer the prayer&#8230;.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Al-Bukhari no. 33 and Muslim no.521)</p>
