										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">By  Shaykh ul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah as-Salafi <em>-Rahimullaah-<br />
</em>From his book ‘Madaarij as-Saalikeen’ </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<em>Al-Hayaa</em> (modesty) is divided into 10 subdivisions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Hayaa Jinayah</em> (the shamefulness of committing a crime), <em>Hayaa Taqseer</em> (the shamefulness of deficiency), <em>Hayaa Ijlaal</em> (the modesty regarding the magnificence of Allaah), <em>Hayaa Karm</em> (modesty in being hospitable), <em>Hayaa Hishmaa</em> (shyness in personal matters), <em>Hayaa Istissghar lilnafs </em>(modesty and humbling one’s soul), <em>Hayaa Muhabbah</em> (bashfulness of love), <em>Hayaa Uboodeeyah </em>(shyness in worship), <em>Hayaa Sharaf wa Izzah</em> (being ashamed of his own nobility and honour) and <em>Hayaa</em> (being shy) of one who is modest from his own self.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <em>Al-Hayaa</em> (the shamefulness) of committing a crime:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this is the <em>Hayaa</em> of Aadam <em>-alaihi salam-</em> when he fled in Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> said ‘Are you escaping from Me O Aadam?’ he answered: ‘No, my Lord rather being ashamed in front of You.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. <em>Hayaa Taqseer</em> (the shamefulness of deficiency):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is like the <em>Hayaa</em> of the Angels who glorify Allaah day and night and do not disobey Him and when the Day of Judgment comes they say ‘You (O Allaah) are far from imperfection and we did not truly carry out Your worship.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. <em>Hayaa Ijlaal</em> (modesty regarding the magnificence of Allaah):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>Hayaa</em> is of having knowledge, it is the level of knowledge a slave has of his Lord – then the level of his <em>Hayaa</em> in this, will be in accordance to his level of knowledge of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. <em>Hayya Karm</em> (modesty in being hospitable):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Like the <em>Hayya</em> of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>from the people when they called him to the <em>Walima</em> (wedding party) of Zainab and they sat with him for a very long time and he stood up and was shy from telling them to leave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. <em>Hayaa Hishmaa</em> (Shyness regarding personal matters):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Like the <em>Hayya</em> of Ali bin Abi Taalib <em>-radiAllaah anhu &#8211;</em> in asking the Prophet regarding the discharge/wetness a man feels when being aroused, due to the status of the Prophet’s <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>daughter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. <em>Hayaa Istissghar lilnafs</em> (modesty and humbling one’s soul):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Like the <em>Hayaa</em> of the slave of Allaah from His Lord when he asks Him for his needs, whereby he realizes that he is so needy and is humbled by it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There could be two reasons for this type of <em>Hayaa</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a) The questioner regards himself as small and insignificant and regards his sins as great in number.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b) He (the questioner) regards the One he is asking (Allaah) as Great.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. <em>Hayaa Muhabbah</em> (bashfulness of love):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the <em>Hayaa</em> of the one who loves when he remembers what he feels for his beloved, to such an extent that if this feeling occurs to him in the absence of his beloved then it stimulates the <em>Hayaa</em> in his heart and reaches his face (bashfulness) and he does not know why he feels this is.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. <em>Hayaa Uboodeeyah</em> (shyness in worship):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>Hayaa</em> is combined with love and fear and one witnesses that his worship of the One being worshipped (Allaah) is not good enough and the worth and value of the One being worshipped is higher and more magnificent than his worship. Thus this worship will certainly obligate his feeling shy of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. <em>Hayaa Sharaf wa Izzah</em> (being ashamed of nobility and honour):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the value and the goodness of his sacrifice, giving and goodness is less (than he is capable of) then <em>Hayaa</em> emanates from this  great and powerful soul and his soul becomes ashamed even though he has sacrificed (but it is not according to the caliber of his capability).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. As for the <em>Hayaa</em> of the person from his own self:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the <em>Hayaa</em> of the honorable, noble and lofty soul, which is not pleased with the deficiency within itself, which is(the deficiency) of being satisfied with less (goodness). So he finds himself being shy from himself to such a degree that it is as though he possesses two souls one soul feels shy from the other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the most complete type of <em>Hayaa</em>, because if a soul feels shyness from his own self then it will obviously feel a greater shyness from other than himself.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Summarised from ‘Madaarij as-Saalikeen’ vol.2 p.250-251 as collected in ‘Nadratul Na’eem’ 5/1798]</p>

<p><strong>[Source</strong>: <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2018/01/28/the-ninety-nine-names-of-allaah/">The Ninety-Nine Names of Allaah </a>– Dawud Burbank [Audio|En] &amp; Transcribed PDF]</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>The following is Translated &amp; Compiled by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 – Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, Allaah is not ashamed to set forth a parable</span></strong>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Baqarah: 26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 – What is mentioned in the hadeeth of Ya’ala bin Umayyah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> saw a man bathing at an open place where there was no partitioning and without a wrapping garment, so the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> climbed the <em>Mimbar</em>, and he praised Allaah and glorified Him and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘Indeed Allaah <em>– Azza wa Jal –</em> is The Shy One, The One who Conceals, He loves modesty and covering up, so if one of you bathes (outside) then he should cover up.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Narrated by Abu Dawood and Nisaa’ee – authenticated by Albaani in ‘Irwa’ no. 2335]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – The hadeeth of Salman <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said: The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘Indeed your Lord <em>– Tabaaraka wa Ta’ala –</em> is The Shy One, The Generous, Allaah is Shy from His slave if the slave raises his hands towards Him, that He would return them without anything.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Narrated by Abu Dawood, Tirmidhi and Ibn Maajah – authenticated by Albaani in ‘Irwa’ no. 2335]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 – The author Muhammad al-Hamood an-Najdi said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Know – may Allaah have mercy upon me and you – that the greatest modesty which is necessary to have is with Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>, He Who fluctuates His blessings and His virtue day and night. We cannot do without Him even for a blink of an eye. We are under His Hearing and Sight, and nothing of our condition, statements and actions is absent from Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just like Allaah <em>–Azza wa Jal-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Whatever you (O Muhammad) may be doing, and whatever portion you may be reciting from the Qur’aan, – and whatever deed you (mankind) may be doing (good or evil), We are Witness thereof, when you are doing it. And nothing is hidden from your Lord (so much as) the weight of an atom on the earth or in the heaven. Not what is less than that or what is greater than that but is (written) in a Clear Record</span>.</strong> &gt;&gt; [Yunus: 61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Summarised from ‘an-Nahaj al-Asma’ fee Sharh ‘Asmaa Allaah al-Hussna 3/99-]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5  – Shaykh Muhammad Khaleel Haraas <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Name of Allaah Ta’ala <em>al-Hayyee</em> (The Shy One) is a Name which is appropriate to Him, and it is not like the <em>Hayya</em> (Modesty) of the creation, which is a change and effect, which seizes a person when he is frightened by that which brings him shame or fault.  Rather it is leaving that which is not appropriate with His abundant Mercy and His perfect Generosity and Kindness, and His great Pardoning and His Gentleness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the slave of Allaah openly sins even though modesty is the thing that he is in most need of, and modesty is the weakest thing he has, and he uses Allaah’s blessings to sin.  However, Allaah <em>– Subhanahu–</em> along with His perfection in not needing anything whatsoever and His complete ability over modesty, is shy from the slave from removing his veil and humiliating him, so Allaah covers up the slave with that which disguises him from the means of covering up, then after that Allaah pardons his sins and forgives them.  Just like the hadeeth of Ibn Umar <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">‘Indeed Allaah comes close to the believer, and covers him then asks him, between Himself and the slave: Did you not do such and such, on such and such day? Until the slave of Allaah acknowledges his sins, and is certain that he will definitely be destroyed and Allaah says to him: I covered up your sins in the <em>Dunyaa</em> and today I will forgive them for you.’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Narrated by Bukhari and Muslim &#8211; Taken from ‘an-Nahaj al-Asma’ fee Sharh ‘Asmaa Allaah al-Hussna 3/103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allāh , may His Praise and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

Chapter 71<br />
Modesty and Courtesy towards the Believers</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And be kind and humble to the believers who follow you.&#8221;</b></span><b> (26:215)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;O you who believe! Whoever from among you turns back from his religion (Islam), Allah will bring a people whom He will love and they will love Him; humble towards the believers, stern towards the disbelievers.&#8221;</b></span><b> (5:54)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Verily, the most honourable of you with Allah is that (believer) who has At-Taqwa [he is one of the Muttaqun (the pious)].&#8221;</b></span><b> (49:13)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;So ascribe not purity to yourselves. He knows best him who fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him [i.e., those who are Al-Muttaqun (the pious)].&#8221;</b></span><b> (53:32)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And the men on Al-a`raf (the wall) will call unto the men whom they would recognise by their marks, saying: `Of what benefit to you were your great numbers (and hoards of wealth), and your arrogance (against Faith)?&#8217; Are they those, of whom you swore that Allah would never show them mercy. (Behold! It has been said to them): `Enter Jannah, no fear shall be on you, nor shall you grieve.&#8221;&#8217;</b></span><b> (7:48,49)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>602.</b> `Iyad bin Himar (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah has revealed to me that you should humble yourselves to one another. One should neither hold himself above another nor transgress against another.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>603.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Wealth does not diminish by giving Sadaqah (charity). Allah augments the honour of one who forgives; and one who serves another seeking the pleasure of Allah, Allah will exalt him in ranks.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>604.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him)<span style="color:#008000;"> passed by some children and greeted them (by saying As-salamu `alaikum to them). Then he said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to do the same.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>605.</b> Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> A slave-girl of Al-Madinah would take hold of the hand of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and take him wherever she desired.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>606.</b> Al-Aswad bin Yazid (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) was asked: &#8220;What did Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to do inside his house?&#8221; She answered:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;He used to keep himself busy helping members of his family, and when it was the time for Salat (the prayer), he would get up for prayer.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>607.</b> Tamim bin Usaid (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I came to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) while he was delivering a Khutbah and said:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, a stranger (meaning himself) has come to inquire about his Deen. He is quite ignorant about his Deen</span>.&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) interrupted his Khutbah and turned to me.<span style="color:#008000;"> Then a chair was brought for him and he sat on it. He started instructing me what Allah had taught him. Then he resumed his Khutbah and completed it.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>608.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: When the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) finished eating his food, he would lick his three fingers (i.e., the forefinger, the middle finger and the thumb). He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;If anyone of you drops a morsel, he should remove anything harmful from it and then eat it. He should not leave it for Shaitan.</span>&#8221; He commanded us to clean out the dish saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;You do not know in what portion of your food the blessing lies.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>609.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Every Prophet has tended sheep.&#8221;</span> He was asked: &#8220;And did you?&#8221; He replied:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Yes, I tended them for a few carats for the Makkans.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>610.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;If I am invited to a meal consisting of a sheep&#8217;s foot or shoulder, I would respond and I would accept as a gift a shoulder or a foot of a sheep.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>611.</b> Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) had a she-camel called Al-`Adba&#8217; which would not allow any other camel to surpass her. A bedouin came riding his camel which outstripped it. The Muslims were much grieved at this. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) perceived it and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;It is Allah&#8217;s Way that he lowers whatever raises itself in the world.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>

Chapter 84<br />
Exaltation of Modesty</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">681. Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) passed by a man of the Ansar who was admonishing his brother regarding shyness. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Leave him alone, for modesty is a part of Iman.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">682. `Imran bin Husain (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Shyness does not bring anything except good.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In a narration of Muslim: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;All of shyness is good.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">683. Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Iman has sixty odd or seventy odd branches. The uppermost of all these is the Testimony of Faith: `La ilaha illallah&#8217; (there is no true god except Allah) while the least of them is the removal of harmful object from the road. And shyness is a branch of Iman.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">684. Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was even shier than a virgin behind her veil. When he saw something which he disliked, we could perceive it on his face.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Source: My Advice to the Women &#8211; Umm Abdillah al-Waadi&#8217;iyyah &#8211; pgs 253-259</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shyness is of two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. What consists of character and disposition and cannot be acquired. Shyness is the behavior Allah granted the servant. The Prophet sallallahu alayhe was salaam said &#8221; Shyness brings about nothing but good.&#8221; It prohibits a person from committing despicable actions and displaying degrading behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2.What is attainable through knowing Allah and knowing His greatness as well as His closeness to His servants.His overseeing them, and His knowledge of what deceives the eyes while being hidden in the chests.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shyness from Allah may be caused by witnessing and reflecting over His blessings and the shortcomings associated with being thankful for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The praiseworthy shyness is the behavior that encourages the performing of commendable actions and abandoning the wretched.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the statement : &#8221; If you do not feel shy then do as you wish .&#8221; One meaning is that it does not command to do whatever you wish, but it conveys a meaning of blame and prohibition. One way of interpreting it is that it conveys a threat/warning. The second way to interpret it is that it is a way of conveying information. The thing that prohibits a person from doing bad actions is shyness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nawawee said , The Scholars said that the reality of shyness is the character that encourages the abandonment of despicable actions and prevents against negligence concerning the rights of the people who possess rights over others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Al Qaasim al Junayd said Shyness is recognizing Allahs favors, meaning His blessings and the recognizing of ones own negligence in light of them both.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When shyness is lost, every type of evil is committed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are five signs of wretchedness :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The harshness in the hearts<br />
2. The unflinching eye<br />
3. The lack of shyness<br />
4. The seeking of worldy pleasures.<br />
5. Longevity in life</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of shyness is Asmaa bint Aboo Bakr in the hadeeth where she carried the date stones and was offered to ride behind the Prophet sallallahu alayhe was salaam but was too shy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em style="line-height:1.5em;"><a>Sahih Bukhari Volume 4, Book 55, Number 616:</a></em></p>
<p>Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;(The Prophet) Moses was a shy person and used to cover his body completely because of his extensive shyness. One of the children of Israel hurt him by saying, &#8216;He covers his body in this way only because of some defect in his skin, either leprosy or scrotal hernia, or he has some other defect.&#8217; Allah wished to clear Moses of what they said about him, so one day while Moses was in seclusion, he took off his clothes and put them on a stone and started taking a bath. When he had finished the bath, he moved towards his clothes so as to take them, but the stone took his clothes and fled; Moses picked up his stick and ran after the stone saying, &#8216;O stone! Give me my garment!&#8217; Till he reached a group of Bani Israel who saw him naked then, and found him the best of what Allah had created, and Allah cleared him of what they had accused him of. The stone stopped there and Moses took and put his garment on and started hitting the stone with his stick. By Allah, the stone still has some traces of the hitting, three, four or five marks. This was what Allah refers to in His Saying:&#8211; &#8220;O you who believe! Be you not like those Who annoyed Moses, But Allah proved his innocence of that which they alleged, And he was honorable In Allah&#8217;s Sight.&#8221; (33.69)</p>
