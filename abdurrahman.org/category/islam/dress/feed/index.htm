										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 29 : Point 37</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And there is no harm in praying whilst wearing <em>saraaweel</em> (broad and loose trousers).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F370749995&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/praying-in-trousers-or-pants" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This word <em>as-saraweel</em> is in the singular.[04] So <em>saraaweel</em> (loose trousers), this word <em>assaraaweel</em> is the singular and it is something well known; it is what is worn upon the `<em>awrah</em>, over the private parts, that which needs to be covered from navel to knee so it is sewn to fit the lower half of the body and it has legs. The prayer is correct in <em>saraweel</em> (loose trousers), this is with regard to the man because the `<em>awrah</em> of the man is between the navel to the knee, and trousers (<em>saraaweel</em>), they cover that. So if a person prays in <em>saraaweel</em> (loose trousers), which properly cover what’s between his navel and his knee, then his prayer will be correct. As for the woman then all of her is `<em>awrah</em> in the prayer except for her face if she has no men who are non mahram. So if he prays in an <em>izaar</em> (waist wrapper) then that would be better than trousers (<em>saraweel</em>) or if he prays in a <em>qamees</em> (a shirt) reaching down to the shins then that would be even better because it will be more beautiful for the appearance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O Children of Aadam, take your adornment at every Prayer.</strong></span><br />
(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), aayah 31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Masjid, meaning at every Prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Az-zeenah</em>, adornment, is as Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Adornment is more general just being a cover for the private parts.”</strong> [05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> They mentioned as occurs in Lisaanul-`Arab, this word is a word originally from Persian introduced into Arabic. And the singular term is <em>saraaweel</em> and the plural is <em>saraaweelaat</em>, meaning trousers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[05] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> In this speech from Imaam al-Barbahaariyy <em>rahimahullaah</em>, there is some refutation of some of the categories of the Shee`ah, those who hold it is forbidden to pray in <em>saraaweel</em> (trousers) because they are affected from wind that comes out of the trousers. So they make it obligatory to remove the trousers when performing the Prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> <strong>Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmiyy</strong> <em>rahimahullaah</em> said in his explanation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">“I say, as for <em>saraaweel</em> (loose trousers), which it is permissible to pray in then they are the <em>saraaweel</em> (looser trousers) which cover the `<em>awrah</em>, those which are broad and loose upon the body such that the person is able to carry out the prayer in the most complete manner. As for if they are tight and they show off the shape of the buttocks then prayer in them would be makroo`ah (disliked) and the prayer may even be null and void if the one wearing them is not able to carry out the pillars, if he is not able to sit properly for the tashahhud and between the sajdahs. And Allaah is the one who grants success.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise <strong>Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymiyy</strong> hafizahullaah said in his explanation of this point:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Likewise, prayer in saraaweel (loose trousers) covers two things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Firstly, it covers the permissibility of sufficing of wearing loose trousers if they cover and they are loose and wide. And it also contains a refutation of some of the sects of the Ismaa`eeliyys and those who follow their way because when they want to pray, it is essential upon them, they hold, to take off their trousers.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh `Abdul `Azeez bin Baaz</strong> was asked about <em>al-bantaloon</em> (tighter trousers);</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Is it permissible to pray in these trousers?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh `Abdul `Azeez Bin Baaz <em>rahimahullaah</em> responded,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;">“If the trousers <em>saraaweel</em> cover what’s between the navel and the knee of the man and they are <em>waasi</em>` (broad), they are not <em>dayyiq</em> (tight) then in that case the Prayer will be correct in them and what is better is that there should be a long shirt over them which covers between the navel and knee. And if it goes down to halfway down the shins or down to the ankles, that is better because that will cover better. And Prayer in an <em>izaar</em> (a waist wrapper) is even better than prayer in loose trousers which do not have a long shirt over them because the <em>izaar</em> is more complete in covering than just loose trousers.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">An answer from <strong>Shaykh Muhammad Naasiruddin al-Albaaniyy</strong> <em>rahimahullaah</em> that you find on some of his taped answers to the questions, he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">“Wearing these tight trousers, <em>bantaloon</em> it has two problems (<em>museebataan</em>):</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The 1st problem is:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">The person wearing them will be resembling the disbelievers whereas the Muslims used to wear <em>saraaweel</em> (looser trousers) that were very broad and loose, which some people still wear in Syria and Lebanon. And the Muslims had not used to know about these <em>bantaloon</em>, these tight trousers, except when they were colonised; and then when the colonialists departed they left their evil affects behind and the Muslims took them up based upon their stupidity and their ignorance. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">And, </span><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The 2nd problem is:</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#800000;"> These tight trousers describe the shape of the `<em>awrah</em>.”</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân:</strong> No, it is not allowed with Isbâl. A child should be raised in accordance with the Sunnah. One should not let it practice Isbâl.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><em>[<strong>Isbaal</strong> is to wear garments that extend below the ankles]</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First Shubuha (Doubt):</strong> Isbaal is permitted as long as it is not done out of Makheelah. Some refer to the following hadeeth as an evidence:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Abdullah bin Umar رضي الله عنهم ا reported that: “I came to visit the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه و سلم and I was wearing an Izaar Yataqa’qa’ (clanking because of its trailing below the ankles) . He صلى الله عليه و سلم said: “Who is this?” I said: “Abdullah bin Umar”. He said: “If you are an Abd (i.e. a true slave) of Allaah, then pull up your Izaar”. I did. He then said: “more!”. (Ibn Umar) said: “I pulled it up until it reached the middle of shank; this was the (length) of his Izaar until he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) died”. He then looked towards Abee Bakr and said: “If anyone trails his garment arrogantly, Allaah will not look at him on the Day of Judgment”. Then Abu Bakr said: “My Izaar sometimes hangs low (in another narration he said: “one of the sides of my lower garment hangs low if I do not take care of it”)[99]. The Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلمsaid: “But you are not one of them (in another narration he said: You are not one of those who do so conceitedly)[100].] [101]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Discussion</strong>: The hadeeth supports the Tahreem of Isbaal rather than the opinion which permits the Isbaal as long as it is not done out of conceit. In fact the hadeeth clearly makes it obligatory on the Muslim not to let his Izaar hang lower than his ankles, and that he must tuck it up even though his intention was like that of Abu Bakr in the hadeeth i.e. not done out of conceit. In fact Abu Bakr said: “One side of my Izaar hangs low if I do not take care of it”. In our times, however, people let their Izaars hang low, unlike Abu Bakr, and then they claim: “Well we do not do it out of arrogance!”. Don’t they realize the commands of Allaah’s Messenger to tuck up the Izaar and that his Izaar was extending to the middle of his shanks? Don’t they know that He صلى الله عليه و سلم never thinks about Makheelah? Isn’t he our example?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also clear that Abu Bakr did not say that: “I made my Izaar trailing”. In fact he said in one narration: “Sometimes my Izaar hangs low”. So, its his Izaar that goes down when as he said: “I do not take care of it”. Its clear that when he takes care of it it stays above his ankles, but when it gets loose it hangs low. Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajer reported that Ibn Sa’dd reported a narration from the way of Talha bin Abdullaah bin Abdur-Rahmaan bin Abee Bakr, that ‘Aaaishah رضي الله عنها وعنهم said: “Abu Bakr was Ahnaa (had an inclination in his back), his Izaar could not hold on him, it used to get loose around his loins”. Al-Hafidh also reported a narration from the way of Qayess Ibn Abee Haazim who said: “I visited Abee Bakr and he was a thin person.” [102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who design garments, pants, etc. whose lower ends abide by the Sunnah, but when they wear them they get loose and sometimes trail below the ankles, resemble the case of Abu Bakr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم considered that Abu Bakr was not “one of those who hang their garments out of conceit”, because Abu Bakr did not intend to lower his Izaar below the ankles, and it only trailed when he did not take care of it. Those who intend to trail out of conceit are threatened with a grave punishment:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allaah will not look (on the Day of Resurrection)</strong>[103]<strong> at person who drags his Izaar (behind him) out of conceit</strong></span>.&#8221; [104]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allaah will not look at a person , on the Day of Judgemt, who drags his Izaar out of pride and arrogance</strong></span>.&#8221; [105]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, on the Day of Judgment, Allaah will not talk to or sanctify the Musbil. This is confirmed in the authentic hadeeth in which Abu Dharr reported the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم as saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“There are three (kinds) of persons to whom Allaah will neither speak on the Day of Judgment, nor will He look at them nor purify them, and they will have a painful Punishment. He (Abu Darr) said: “Allaah’s Messenger repeated it three times. Abu Dharr remarked: “They failed and they lost; who are these persons, O Messenger of Allaah? He صلى الله عليه و سلم replied: “<span style="color:#993300;">The one who wears a trailing robe (the Musbil), the one who takes account of what he gives, and the seller of goods by false oaths</span>.”</span></strong> [106]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Certainly Abu Bakr received a testimony from the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم that he did not lower his Izaar out of arrogance. Those who intentionally make Isbaal, when did they receive a purifying testimony?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another incident, Abdullah Ibn Umar passed by the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم and his Izaar was hanging low. He said describing this incident:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I happened to pass before Allaah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم with my garment hanging low. He said: Abdullah, tug up your lower garment. I tugged it up, and he again said: “Tug it still further”. I tugged it still further and I went on tugging it afterward, whereupon some of the people said: “To what extent?” Thereupon he said: “To the middle of the shanks.” [107]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم did not keep silent when he saw Abdullah bin Umar hanging low his Izaar. This shows that the prophibition of Isbaal for men is not restricted only to the case if it is done out of Makheelah. Abdullah bin Umar is one of the great Sahabah. Imagine what would the position of the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم be if he sees the clothes on many Du’aat (those who invite others to this Deen), or even “scholars” each trailing his Jubbah,[108] garment, or pants? <span style="color:#993300;">We know that Ibn Umar hastened to comply with the Prophet’s command. Now it takes hours, talks, lectures to convey the Prophet’s command and still you find people arguing that: “Well! As long as Isbaal is not done out of conceit then its OK!” Indeed it makes the clement person preplexed! To Allaah alone, is the complaint!</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">الإسبال Isbaal</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>What is Isbaal?</strong></span><br />
Isbaal is to wear garments that extend below the ankles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Is it Forbidden?</strong></span><br />
Yes, because the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The part of an <em>Izaar</em> (garment) which hangs below the ankles is in the Fire.&#8221; [73]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Some hold the opinion that <em>Isbaal</em> is forbidden when it is done out of pride, conceit or arrogance. Is this argument true?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer is: No, because:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>First</strong></span>: The threat to punish in Hell those who drag their garments bellow the ankles is clear [74].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Second</span></strong>: Several texts indicate that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) was commanding the people to pull up their garments. The majority of the Muslim Scholars (Al-Jumhoor) agree that when the text is in the imperative from, intended for <em>Tahreem</em> (forbidding something), unless there is another authentic evidence that indicates otherwise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[73] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, V.7, hadeeth # 678.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[74]The punishable part is that which violates the command of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) i.e below the ankles. Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajer is with the opinion that the obvious literal meaning of the hadeeth holds true i.e. the clothes together with the part below the ankles will be in Hell as it is the case in the saying of Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى):</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">“Certainly! You (disbelievers) and that which you are worhipping now besides Allaah, are (but) fuel for Hell!” (Qur’aan 21:98).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">See Fathul Baaree V. 10, hadeeth # 5789 (same as # 678 above), PP. 268-269, Published by Daar Ar-Rayyaan, Cairo, Egypt.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one incident, the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) sighted someone dragging his lower garment. He rushed to him and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Pull up your <em>Izaar</em> and fear Allaah”. The man said: “I am a an <em>Ahnaf</em> [75] person with trembling knees”. He (the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)) said: “Tuck up your <em>Izaar</em>! Certainly, all of Allaah’s creation of Allaah is good”. Since then the man was not seen except with his <em>Izaar</em> touching the middle of his shanks or up to the middle of his shanks [76].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is clear that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) did not question the man whether he was doing it out of pride or arrogance. In fact its clear that from the condition of the man that he did not even think about arrogance! Nevertheless the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) did not accept it his <em>Isbaal</em> and considered that <em>Isbaal</em> is incompatible with <em>At-Taqwa</em> (the fear of Allaah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Third</strong></span>: The generalized prohibition of <em>Isbaal</em> is clear in the saying of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). On one occasion he said to Sufyaan bin Sahl:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O Sufyaan bin Sahl! Do not lower your garment below your ankles because Allaah does not love the <em>Musbileen</em> (those who lower their lower garments below their ankles).”</strong> [77]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jaabir bin Saleem said that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) told him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;&#8230;And beware of the <em>Isbaal</em> of the <em>Izaar</em> because it is from Al-Makheelah (conceit, arrogance, etc.) and Allaah does not love it.”</strong> [78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One can notice the text (underlined) in the imperative from indicating the forbidding of Isbaal whether it is done out of Makheelah or not. Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajer in his commentary about some of the Ahaadeeth mentioned above said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The <em>Isbaal</em> mentioned in these <em>Ahadeeth</em> is a grave sin if it is done out of <em>Makheelah</em>, otherwise the apparent meaning of the <em>Ahadeeth</em> indicates that it is forbidden.” [79]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Fourth</strong></span>: The manifestation of the ِAayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">And whatsoever the messenger gives you take it, and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain from it.</span>” (Qur’aan 59:7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is known that the <em>Ath-Thawb</em> [80] of the most honorable of mankind, Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) was up to the middle of his shanks.” [81]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is confirmed in another hadeeth in which Uthmaan (رضي الله عنه) reported that the “<strong>The lower garment of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) extended to the middle of his shanks</strong>.” [82] Who else is more humble than him (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)? He knew that <em>Isbaal</em> necessitates <em>Al-Makheelah</em> even if the <em>Musbil</em> does not intend it. This is supported by the hadeeth of Jaabir bin Saleem in which the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) made it clear that <em>Isbaal</em> is a manifestation of arrogance:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[75] Ahnaf, a person afflicted with a distortion of the foot with each foot moving towards the other one along the big toe.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [76] Reported by Ahmad and others, and it satisfies the conditions set by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim. See As-Silsilah As-Saheehah, hadeeth # 1441.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [77] Saheeh Sunnan Ibn Majah by Shayekh Nassir-ud- Deen Al-Albaanee # 2876.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [78] Silsilat Al-Ahaadeeth as-Saheehah, the Series on the Collection of Authentic Ahaadeeth, by Shayekh Al-Albaanee, hadeeth # 770.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [79] Fathul Baaree, V. 10, P. 263.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [80] Ath-Thawb: garment.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [81] Reported by Ahmad, At-Tirmithee in Ash-Shamaa’il Al-Muhammadiyyah and by others. The hadeeth is authentic as reported by Waleed An-Nassr in his book Al-Isbaal Liqhayr Al-Khuyalaa’, P. 15.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [82] Reported by At-Tirmithee in Ash-Shamaa’il Al-Muhammadiyyah and Al-Albaanee authenticated it # 98.</span></p>
<p>He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) commanded Jaabir bin Saleem saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And Tuck up your <em>Izaar</em> up to the middle of your shanks, and if you dislike it, then up to the ankles (i.e. up to a point above the ankles) and beware of <em>Isbaal</em> because it is arrogance.&#8221;</strong> [83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shouldn’t we, therefore, abide by the command of Allaah in the above ِAayah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Fifth</strong></span>: Isbaal by men is an immitation of women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) forbade that men dress like women and vice versa. He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah cursed the man dressed like a women and the women dressed like a man.” [84]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In fact Ibn Umar رضي االله عنهما said that: “the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The one who trails his <em>Thobe</em> out of conceit, Allaah will not look at him on the the Day of Judgment”.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ummu Salamah رضي االله عنها said: “What should the women, O Messenger of Allaah, do with the lower ends of their dresses?” He said: “They may let them hang down a span”. She said: “Still their feet will be uncovered”. He said: “Then let them hang the ends down a forearm’s length, not exceeding it.” [85]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Lowering the garments below the ankle is a the code of dress of women. Shaykh ul Islaam Ibn Taymmeyah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“&#8230;The imitation (of others) in the outward appearances produces a proportional assumption of the deeds and manners. That is why we are ordered to oppose the Kuffar&#8230; and that is also why men and women are prohibited from imitating each other in accordance with the Ahadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; من تشبه بقومٍ فهو منهم &#8221;<br />
<b>“Whoever takes the similitude of certain people becomes one of them”</b> [86]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[83] Silsilat Al-Ahadeeth as-Saheehah, hadeeth # 1109 and 1352.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [84] Saheeh Abee Dawood, hadeeth # 3454, Ibn Majah 1903, Saheeh Al-Jaami’e As-Sagheer, hadeeth #5095, and others.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [85] An authentic narration reported by Abee Dawood (# 3467 in Saheeh Abee Dawood), An-Nassaa’ee (#5336) and At-Tirmithee (Saheeh At-Tirmithee #1415), and Ibn Majah #3580 &amp; 3581.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [86] An authentic hadeeth collected by Abee Dawood, Ahmad, and others. See As-Silsilah As-Saheehah V.1, 676</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man who imitates women acquires from their manners according to the extent of his imitation, such that it he may end up in complete effeminacy&#8230;The woman who imitates men assumes part of their manners until she attains levels of <em>Tabarruj</em> [87], <em>Burooz</em> [88] and <em>Mushaarakah</em> with men [89] driving some of them to show their bodies as men do, demanding superiority over men, and doing whatever contradicts the bashfulness of the woman&#8230;” [90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Ummar bin Al-Khattaab (رضي الله عنه) saw a man dragging his <em>Izaar</em>, he called upon him and said: “Are you having your menses?”. The man said: “O Ameer Al-Mu’mineen [91]! Does a man have menses?” Umar said: “What made you drag your <em>Izaar</em> over your feet?” He then ordered a blade, rapped (the lower ends of) the man’s <em>Izaar</em> and cut what trailed below the ankles&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Today we see that men are trailing their <em>Izaar</em> (<em>Thobe</em>, trousers, pants, etc.) like women while women wear clothes whose lower ends are way above the ankles! May Allaah guide our men and women to abide by the Commands of Allaah and His Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Sixth</strong></span>: Isbaal is extravagancy:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has set a measure for everything, including the clothes for men. If a Muslim exceeds the limits set by Sharee’ah then he becomes an extravagant. Allaah, Most Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And eat and drink but waste not by extravagance, certainly He (Allaah) likes not the extravagants.”</span> (Qur’aan 7: 31).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[87] <em>Tabarruj</em>, displaying beautification as a show off to strangers. Displaying beautification to the husband is not <em>Tabarruj</em>.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [88] <em>Burooz</em>, show off.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [89] <em>Mushaarakah</em>, joining men in all walks of life.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [90] Sheikh ul Islam Ibn Taymmeyah in his book Al-Fatawa (Arabic), V. 22, P. 254.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [91] Ameer Al-Mu’mineen, the Commander of the Faithful. It is a title given to the Islamic Caliph. This incident was narrated by Kharshah bin Al-Hurr. The report is found in Waleed An-nasr’s book Al-isbaal Lighayer Al-Khuyalaa, p. 18, where he attributed it to At-Tabaree. It is reported in a summarized version by Ibn Abee Shaybah in his Mussannaf (V.8, p. 393) with a <em>Saheeh</em> <em>Isnaad</em>, as An-Nasr said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajer, may Allaah’s Mercy be upon him, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“If the <em>Thobe</em> (as well as all other garments) exceeds the appropriate size [92] of the one who wears it, then it would be prohibited based upon extravagance and that leads to <em>Tahreem</em>.” [93]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Seventh</strong></span>: <em>Isbaal</em> and impurities:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ubaid bin Khalid said: “I was walking trailing my <em>Burd</em> [94]. A man talked to him saying: “Pull up your <em>Thobe</em> because that (will keep it) more clean and will last longer”. I looked (to see who was talking to me) and he was the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). I said: “It is only a black and white-striped <em>Burdah</em> (outer garment)”. He said: “Don’t you have an example in me?” I said: “I looked (at him) and his <em>Izaar</em> was (extending) to the middle of his shanks.” [95]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullah Ibn Mas’oud narrated that: “A young man paid a visit to Umar (رضي الله عنه) (after he was stabbed by Abu Lu’lu’ah Al-Majoosee) and he started praising Umar (رضي الله عنه). (The narrator) said: “Umar saw the man trailing his Izaar”. He said to him: “<strong>O son of my brother! Lift your clothes, for this will keep them clean, and save you from the Punishment of your Rabb</strong>.” [96]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The painful suffering from the fatal wounds in Umar’s body did not prevent him from talking about the issue of Isbaal because Umar realized the threat of punishment in Hell for those who hang down their lower garments. In this there is a great lesson for all Muslims and especially our young generations that they should take this matter seriously and abide by the commands of Allaah and His Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). On the other hand the incident shows that Umar while leading an Ummah did not say this is a “minor issue” as some Muslims respond when they are adviced about this issue or that of the beard. He considered all matters of Deen in light of the teachings of the Qur’aan and Sunnah. Certainly if a person is new to Islaam or if he is ignorant, then we gradually teach him the importance of Tawheed and that the Sunnah is an integral part Tawheed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[92] The appropriate size takes into consideration what is prohibited and what is permitted. For example, it is prohibited to wear pants that “just fit in” and display or “framelike” the shapes of the private parts of men. This would alos be considered an an immitation of the Kuffar.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [93] Fathul Baaree, V. 10, P. 263.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [94] Burd, a black decorated square outer garment.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [95] Shayekh Al-Albaanee said that the hadeeth is authentic as in Ash-Shamaa’il Al-Muhammadiyyah (Sumarized Version), # 97.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [96] Collected by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim. See Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree V. 5, hadeeth # 50. It is also reported by Ibn Abee Shaybah in his Musannaf , V. 8, P. 27.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When these matters are made clear to him, then it is very natural to call him to abide by them. Setting the priorities without compromising or indefinitely postponing the reminders is, <em>inshaaa</em>’ <em>Allaah</em>, the beneficial approach.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Note</strong></span>: Someone may ask the question: “If the Sunnah for women is to trail their dresses, then what about the impurities that may attach to the dresses?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A women asked Umm Salamah رضي االله عنها the following question: “I am a women having a long trail of my garment and I walk in a filthy place; (then what should I do?). Umm Salamah replied: “The Messenger of Allaah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: ‘What comes after it cleanses it’. “ [97]</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[97] The hadeeth is reported by Imaam Malik, Ahmad, At-Tirmithee, Abee Dawoood, and Ad-Daarimee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sharee’ah permitted the trailing by the women in order to cover her feet which are illegal to keep naked before others. That is the exception upon which the ruling for women regarding the trailing is different from that for men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Summary</strong></span>: <em>Isbaal</em> is forbidden due to the following reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1-The threat of punishment in Hell for the <em>Musbil</em>,<br />
2-The clear command of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) to pull the garments above the ankles,<br />
3-The absolutely generalized terms regarding its Tahreem,<br />
4-The demand to follow the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and abide by his orders,<br />
5-It is a Makheelah (pride, arrogance, conceit, etc.),<br />
6-It is an imitation of women,<br />
7-It is an extravagancy,<br />
8-The Musbil cannot protect against filth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shayekh Al-Albaanee said that the hadeeth is authentic since it is supported by another sound narration reported by Abee Dawood and in which a women of the Banu Abd Al-Ashhal reported: “I said O Allaah’s Messenger! Our road to the mosque has an unpleasent stench; what should we do when it is raining? He asked: “Is there not a cleaner part after the filthy part of the road?”. She replied: “indeed there is one”. He said: “It makes up for the other”. See Mushkatul Masaabeeh, V.1, hadeeth # 504 and 512.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Clearing Some Shubuhaat </span></strong>[98]<strong><span style="color:#993300;"> Regarding Isbaal</span></strong></p>
<p>[98] Shubuhaat, unclear matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>First Shubuha:</strong></span> Isbaal is permitted as long as it is not done out of Makheelah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some refer to the following hadeeth as an evidence:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Abdullah bin Umar رضي االله عنهماreported that: “I came to visit the Messenger of Allaah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and I was wearing an Izaar Yataqa’qa’ (clanking because of its trailing below the ankles) . He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: “Who is this?” I said: “Abdullah bin Umar”. He said: “If you are an Abd (i.e. a true slave) of Allaah, then pull up your Izaar”. I did. He then said: “more!”. (Ibn Umar) said: “I pulled it up until it reached the middle of shank; this was the (length) of his Izaar until he ((صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)) died”. He then looked towards Aboo Bakr and said: “If anyone trails his garment arrogantly, Allaah will not look at him on the Day of Judgment”. Then Abu Bakr said: “My Izaar sometimes hangs low (in another narration he said: “one of the sides of my lower garment hangs low if I do not take care of it”)[99]. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)said: “But you are not one of them (in another narration he said: You are not one of those who do so conceitedly)[100][101]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Discussion</strong>: The hadeeth supports the <em>Tahreem</em> of <em>Isbaal</em> rather than the opinion which permits the <em>Isbaal</em> as long as it is not done out of conceit. In fact the hadeeth clearly makes it obligatory on the Muslim not to let his <em>Izaar</em> hang lower than his ankles, and that he must tuck it up even though his intention was like that of Abu Bakr in the hadeeth i.e. not done out of conceit. In fact Abu Bakr said: “One side of my Izaar hangs low if I do not take care of it”. In our times, however, people let their <em>Izaars</em> hang low, unlike Abu Bakr, and then they claim: “Well we do not do it out of arrogance!”. Don’t they realize the commands of Allaah’s Messenger to tuck up the <em>Izaar</em> and that his <em>Izaar</em> was extending to the middle of his shanks? Don’t they know that He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) never thinks about <em>Makheelah</em>? Isn’t he our example?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also clear that Abu Bakr did not say that: “I made my <em>Izaar</em> trailing”. In fact he said in one narration: “Sometimes my Izaar hangs low”. So, its his <em>Izaar</em> that goes down when as he said: “I do not take care of it”. Its clear that when he takes care of it it stays above his ankles, but when it gets loose it hangs low. Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajer reported that Ibn Sa’dd reported a narration from the way of Talha bin Abdullaah bin Abdur-Rahmaan bin Abee Bakr, that ‘Aaaishah رضي االله عنها وعنهم said: “Abu Bakr was Ahnaa (had an inclination in his back), his Izaar could not hold on him, it used to get loose around his loins”. Al-Hafidh also reported a narration from the way of Qayess Ibn Abee Haazim who said: “I visited Abee Bakr and he was a thin person.” [102]</p>

<span style="color:#999999;"> [100]Ibid. Also reported by Abee Dawood.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [101] The hadeeth was reported by Imaam Ahmad, Abdul Razzaaq, At-Tabaraanee and others. Al-Albaanee said: The hadeeth’s Isnaad is according to the conditions laid down by Ash-Shayekhan (i.e. the two Shayeks: Al- Bukhaaree and Muslim), As-Silsilah As-Saheehah, V. 4, P. 95. The part of the hadeeth starting with the saying of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم): If anyone trails his Izaar” and ending with “you are not of those who do so conceitedly” is reported by Al-Bukhaaree, Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree V. 7, hadeeth # 675.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [102] Fathul Baaree V. 10, P. 255.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who design garments, pants, etc. whose lower ends abide by the Sunnah, but when they wear them they get loose and sometimes trail below the ankles, resemble the case of Abu Bakr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) considered that Abu Bakr was not “one of those who hang their garments out of conceit”, because Abu Bakr did not intend to lower his Izaar below the ankles, and it only trailed when he did not take care of it. Those who intend to trail out of conceit are threatened with a grave punishment:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>Allaah will not look (on the Day of Resurrection) </strong>[103]<strong> at person who drags his Izaar (behind him) out of conceit.</strong>&#8221; [104]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>Allaah will not look at a person , on the Day of Judgemt, who drags his Izaar out of pride and arrogance</strong>.&#8221; [105]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, on the Day of Judgment, Allaah will not talk to or sanctify the Musbil. This is confirmed in the authentic hadeeth in which Abu Dharr reported the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) as saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[103] See Appendix.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [104] Al-Bukhaaree, Muslim, and Ahmad. See Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, V. 7, hadeeth # 675., and Saheeh Muslim, V. 3, Ahadeeth # 5191-5195.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [105] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, V. 7, hadeeth # 679 and Saheeh Muslim, hadeeth # 5201.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There are three (kinds) of persons to whom Allaah will neither speak on the Day of Judgment, nor will He look at them nor purify them, and they will have a painful Punishment. He (Abu Darr) said: “Allaah’s Messenger repeated itthree times. Abu Dharr remarked: “They failed and they lost; who are these persons, O Messenger of Allaah? He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) replied: “The one who wears a trailing robe (the Musbil), the one who takes account of what he gives, and the seller of goods by false oaths.” [106]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Certainly Abu Bakr received a testimony from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) that he did not lower his Izaar out of arrogance. Those who intentionally make Isbaal, when did they receive a purifying testimony?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another incident, Ubdullah Ibn Umar passed by the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and his Izaar was hanging low. He said describing this incident:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I happened to pass before Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) with my garment hanging low. He said: Abdullah, Tuck up your lower garment. I tucked it up, and he again said: “Tug it still further”. I tucked it still further and I went on tugging it afterward, whereupon some of the people said: “To what extent?” Thereupon he said: “To the middle of the shanks.” [107]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) did not keep silent when he saw Abdullah bin Umar hanging low his Izaar. This shows that the prophibition of Isbaal for men is not restricted only to the case if it is done out of Makheelah. Abdullah bin Umar is one of the great Sahabah. Imagine what would the position of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) be if he sees the clothes on many Du’aat (those who invite others to this Deen), or even “scholars” each trailing his Jubbah,[108] garment, or pants? We know that Ibn Umar hastened to comply with the Prophet’s command. Now it takes hours, talks, lectures to convey the Prophet’s command and still you find people arguing that: “Well! As long as Isbaal is not done out of conceit then its OK!” Indeed it makes the clement person preplexed! To Allaah alone, is the complaint!</p>

Al-Albaanee also reported it in Saheeh Al-Jaami’, V.3, hadeeth # 3062.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[107] Reported by Muslim, Saheeh Muslim V. 3, hadeeth # 5200.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [108] Jubbah, a cloak.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Second Shubuha:</span></strong> The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) himself dragged his garment, so why is it that trailing is forbidden? People who say stand by the above statement take the following texts as their evidence:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra (رضي الله عنه): “We were with Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) when the sun eclipsed. Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) stood up dragging his cloak till he entered the mosque&#8230;” [109]. In another narration, Abu Bakra said: “Allaah’s Messenger came out dragging his cloak till he reached the mosque.” [110] Still in another narration by Abu Bakra: “He got up dragging his garment hurriedly till he reached the mosque.” [111]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other case is when the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) made an early salutation after the third rak’ah of an afternoon prayer. “A man called Al-Khirbaaq who had long arms got up and said: “Has the prayers been shortened, O Messenger of Allaah? He came out angrily trailing his cloak and when he came to the people he said: Is he telling the truth? They said: “Yes”. He then said one rak’ah, then gave the salutation, then made two prostrations (of forgetfullness), then gave the salutation.” [112]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third incident as reported by Abur Rahman bin Abee Sa’eed Al-Khudree who narrated it from his father. He (the father) said: I went to Qibaa’ with the Messenger of Allaah(صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) on Monday till we reached (the habitation) of Banu Saalim. The Messenger of Allaah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) stood at the door of ‘Itbaan and called him loudly. So he came out dragging his lower garment. Upon this Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: “We have made this man to make haste”. ‘Itbaan said: “Messenger of Allaah, if a man parts with his wife suddenly without seminal emission, what is he required to do (with regard to bath)?”. The Messenger of Allaah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: “It is with the seminal emission that bath becomes obligatory.” [113]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[109] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, V. 2, hadeeth # 150.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [110] ibid, hadeeth # 170.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [111] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, V. 7, hadeeth # 676.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [112] See Saheeh Muslim, V. 1, hadeeeth # 1187.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [113] Saheeh Muslim, V. 1, hadeeth # 674.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of the above Ahadeeth are supporting evidences for the opinion that if a person does not intend to lower his garment, but it happens that he draggs it due to to certain circumstances, like being in a hurry, angry, etc. then he is not a Musbil by intention. Therefore, he is to be reminded but not blamed. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) came in a hurry, so did ‘Itbaan. Another exception is due to necessity.114 For example if someone has a wound on his ankle, he may cover it by extending his lower garment if he does not have any other means to protect it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Third Shubuha:</strong></span> It was reported in the Musannaf of Ibn Abee Shayebah with an authentic chain of narrators that Abdullah bin Mas’oud (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) “used to dragg his lower garment; when he was asked about it he said: ‘I have thin shanks’. “ [115]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1-Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajer responded to this issue saying: “it indicates that he extended it lower than the recommended, which is the middle of the shanks. It is improper to suspect that he let it exceed the ankles as indicated by his response: ‘I have thin shanks’116. It is possible that he was not aware of the story of Umr bin Zarrarah,117 and Allaah knows best.” [118]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2-The narration about Ibn Mas’oud is of the Mawqoof [119] category opposed by many Marfoo’[120] narrations. Certainly the Marfoo’ takes precedence over the Mawqoof. The evidence is in what is established by the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[114] See Fathul Baaree, V. 10, P. 257.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [115] Musannaf Ibn Abee Shayebah, V. 6, P. 26 # 11.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[116] In fact Abdullah bin Mas’oud reported that the “The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) disliked ten things”. He mentioned them and amongst them was “the dragging of the Izaar (i.e. below the ankles). This was reported by Imaam Ahmad in his Musnad, V. 6, PP. 103-104, hadeeth # 4179 . The checker, Ahmad Shaakir, may Allaah’s Mercy be upon him, said: ”Its Isnaad is Saheeh”. This supports Al-Hafid’s position that the “Isbaal” in Abdullah bin Mas’oud’s garment was an extension lower than the middle of the shanks but not exceeding the ankles. Certainly Ibn Mas’oud would not opposee the Prophet’s position on Isbaal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[117] Abu Umamah (رضي الله عنه) reported that: “While we were with the Messenger of Allaah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), Umr Bin Zararah AlAnsaaree followed us and he was dressed with a cloak and a trailing Izaar. The Messenger of Allaah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) began to hold the side of his Thobe, humbling himself to Allaah and saying: ‘I am your slave, the son of your male-slave, the son of your female-slave”, until Umr heard it. Upon this he said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah!, I am a person with thin shanks’. He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: ‘O Umr! Allaah has perfected everything He has created; O Umr! Allaah does not like the Musbil.’ “-Reported by At-Tabaraanee and others. Al-Hafidh said: “Its narrators are Thuqaat (trustworthy). See Fathul Baaree, V. 10, PP. 275-276.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[118] Fathul Baaree, V. 10, P.276.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [119] Mawqoof, “stopped”; a narration from a Sahabee (Companion) not traced to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [120] Marfoo’, “raised”; a narration attributed to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fourth Shubuha:</strong></span> Some people consider the matters of Isbaal , the growing of the beard, and the entire outward appearance of the Muslim as “minor” or “trivial” issues. They base this conclusion on their understanding that the Deen of Allaah is divided into a “crust or a shell” and a “core”. The outward appearance is from the “crust” part.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This classification of Islamic matters is an innovation.[121] It is aimed at diluting the Deen of Allaah leaving it for the taste of men and women to decide for themselves whether they have to abide by some of its rules and regulations. In fact we are ordered by Allaah to “fully, perfectly, and whole-heartedly” enter the Deen of Islaam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“O you who believe! Enter perfectly in Islaam and follow not the footsteps of Satan.”</span> (Qur’aan 2:208)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer said in his Tafseer (exegesis) of this ِAayah: “<strong>Enter in Islaam and obey all of its rules and regulations</strong>”. Al-Alloosee, may Allaah’s Mercy be upon him, commented about the same ِAayah, saying: “Entirely enter in Islaam and do not let anything of your outward and inward natures except that Islaam contains them leaving no room for anything else.” [122]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) ordered, forbade, warned and set the example regarding the Isbaal, the beard, the straightening of the lines in the prayers. So, the Muslim should not take these matters lightly because insisting one even one sin, no matter how small, may subject the Muslim to the threat of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is truth in the saying that: “had it not been for the shell, the core would spoil”! Islaam is an intact message. The deeds of the heart reflect on the outward behavior and appearance. This evident in the hadeeth in which the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: “Truly there is a piece of flesh in the body; if it is sound, the the whole body is sound, and if it is corrupt the whole body is corrupt. Truly it is the heart”-Saheeh Muslim, V. 3, # 3882.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is also certain is that the outward appearance influences the inward condition. In the hadeeth reported by An-Nu’maan bin Basheer, the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: “Straighten your rows (in prayers) or Allaah would certainly put your faces in contrary directions (i.e. would create dissension amongst you).”- Saheeh Muslim, V. 1, hadeeth # 874 and 875. In another narration reported by Abee Daawood, the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: “&#8230;or Allaah would make your hearts differ.”-See Saheeh Al-Jaami’, hadeeth # 1202.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[122] Rooh Al-Ma’aanee, V. 1. The Tafseer of ِAayah # 208 of Soorat Al-Baqara. Published in 1408/1987 by Daar Al-Fikr, Beirut, Lebanon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">So when they turned away (from the Path of Allaah), Allaah turned away their hearts (from the right Path).</span>” (Qur’aan 61, 5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sahl bin Sa’d narrated that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Beware of the small sins! The similitude of the small sins is like a group of people who came down to the depth of a valley; one (person amongst them) brought a stick (of wood), and another (person) brought another stick (etc.), until they collected what was enough to get their bread baked. It is certain that when the small sins take hold of their possessor they destroy him (her).” [123]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ubaadah bin Qurss said: “you do certain things that are “thinner than hair” in your sight (i.e. not blameworthy in your consideration), but at the time of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) they were considered from the grave offenses.” [124] When this saying of Ubaadah bin Qurss was mentioned to Muhammad Ibn Seereen,[125] he believed it and said: “I consider that trailing of the <em>Izaar</em> is one of the grave offenses because of the severe threat of Punishment that was related in the texts about it. People think of it as one of the minor sins because of their excessive ignorance and false pride.”[126]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[123] Reported by Imaam Ahmad and others. See As-Silsilah As-Saheehah, V. 1, hadeeth # 389.</span><br />

Publisher’s name not mentioned. 125 Abu Bakr, Muhammad Ibn Seereenn, died 110 Hj/729. He was one of the known Fuqahaa’ (Jurists) of the City of Bara-Iraq.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Approved Length of the Lower Garment:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Izaar (including pants) must be above the ankles and preferably to the middle of the shanks:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I happened to pass before Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) with my garment hanging low. He said: Abdullah, Tuck up your lower garment. I tucked it up, and he again said: “Tug it still further”. I tucked it still further and I went on tugging it afterward, whereupon some of the people said: “To what extent?” Thereupon he said: “To the middle of the shanks.” [127]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Huthaifah said: “Allaah’s Messenger took by shank (or by the muscle of my shank) and said: “This is the extent of the <em>Izaar</em>. If you dislike it, have it lower (i.e. above the lower end of the shank’s muscle). If you (still) dislike it, then (know that) it is not legitimate that the <em>Izaar</em> extend below the ankles.” [128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-’Alaa bin Abdur Rahmaan reported that his father (Abdur Rahmaan bin Ya’qoob) said: “Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudree about wearing lower garment”. He said: “You have come to the man who knows it well. Allaah’s Messenger said: ‘The <em>Izaar</em> of the Muslim should be halfway down his legs-and he is guilty of no sin if it extends between that and the ankles, but what comes lower than the ankles is in Hell. (On the Day of Judgment), Allaah will not look at him who conceitedly trails his lower garment.’ “ [129]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[127] Reported by Muslim, Saheeh Muslim V. 3, hadeeth # 5200.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [128] Reported by Ahmad, At-Ttirmithee, An-Nassaa’ee, and others. At-Tirmithee said it is sound and acceptable hadeeth (At-Tirmithee, Book of Dress # 1783). See As-Saheehah, V. 4, # 1765.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [129] Saheeh Abee Dawood, hadeeth # 3449. Also reported by Ibn Maajah. Al-Albaanee said it is Saheeh as in As-Saheehah, and in Saheeh Al-Jaami’ As-Sagheer, # 921.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajer, may Allaah’s Mercy be upon him, said: “It is concluded, therefore, that there are two two cases regarding the men’s Izaar: a highly recommended case where the length of the lower garment is halfway down the shanks, and a permissible length where its lower border is above the ankles.” [130]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Note</strong>: Shortening the lower garment above the middle of shanks is an exaggeration in Deen and it is prohibited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>What Clothes Are Covered Under The Laws Regarding Isbaal?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When it comes to the Issue of Isbaal for men, what matters is the length and not the kind of dress. Abdullah bin Umar reported that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<em>Isbaal</em> is lower garment, <em>Al-Qameess</em>,[131] and turban [132]. If anyone trails any of them conceitedly, Allaah will not look at him on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221; [133]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Hazm said describing the <em>Musbil</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<em>Isbaal</em> generally covers trousers, lower garments, shirts, and everything people wear.” [134]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[131] Al-Qamees, the Shirt that covers the body halfway to the middle of the legs. Included in this category is the Morocon بُرنُس hooded cloak, جلاَّبية <em>Jallaabiyyah</em> (a loose shirt like garment, the common dress of the male population of Egypt), العبائة Al-’Abaa’ah (a cloak-like, woolen wrap, occasionally striped), and the like Fathul Baaree, V. 10, P. 260.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[132] This shows that trailing and hanging down is not confined to the <em>Izaar</em> in all of its forms. One should not exceed the usual customs and practices that do not oppose the Islamic teachings. The turban as well as its ends should not be very long in order to safeguard against conceit and arrogance besides this would be considered as extravagance. Some of toady’s lengthy turbans may need a special instrument to roll them! Similarly there is trailing and hanging in the wide sleeves of some garments especially in some parts of Egypt and in Sudan. Imaam Ibn Qayyim, may Allaah’s Mercy be upon him, said: “Lengthy and wide sleeves, which look like bags, were never worn by the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) or anyone of his companions, and (their style) is in opposition to his Sunnah. Their permissibility is doubtful because they they are related to false pride”. Imaam Ash-Shawkaanee, may Allaah’s Mercy be upon him, described the clothes of some of the scholars as having “wide sleeves such that each one would be sufficient to make of it an outer garment or a shirt for one of his children or to one of the orphans!&#8230;”-Nayel Al-Awtaar, V. 2, 108.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[133] Saheeh Abee Dawood, # 3450, Saheeh Ibn Maajah, # 3567, An-Nassaa’ee, and Ibn Abee Shayebah. Shayekh Al- Albaanee authenticated it in Saheeh Al-Jaami’ # 2770.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[134] Ibn Hazm’s Al-Muhalla, V. 4, P. 100, the Chapter on Salaat (Prayers).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajer quoted At-Tabaree saying: “In the lifetime of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) most people used to wear the <em>Izaar</em> and Al-’Ardiyah (loose outer garments, cloaks, robes, etc.). But When people started wearing shirts and other kinds of clothes (like cloaks etc.), the same ruling of prohibition applied to the trailing and hanging of the <em>Izaar</em> was applied to them. Ibn Battaal said: ‘This is a good analogical deduction. So, even if there is no text that includes the <em>Thobe</em> , the prohibition clearly involves all (i.e. all dresses that hang low)’.” [135]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Isbaal</em> And Prayers:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You may have noticed some people tugging up their lower garments (especially pants) when they are about to start their prayers. They refer to a hadeeth reported by Abee Dawood in which it is said that: “Allaah does not accept the prayers from a man trailing his lower garment”. However, the hadeeth is weak. Shayek Nassir ud Deen Al-Albaanee said: “Its Isnaad is weak, because of Abu Ja’far, an un-known as Ibnul Qattan said&#8230;So, whoever authenticated the Isnaad of this is mistaken.” [136]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having said the above, one should be aware that intending to pray in a state of <em>Isbaal</em> out of conceit, subjects the <em>Musbil</em> to a grave punishment from Allaah. Abdullah bin Mas’oud said:“I heared Allaah’s Messenger saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Anyone who conceitedly trails his Izaar during prayers, Allaah has nothing to do with pardoning him and protecting him (from Hell or from bad deeds).”</strong> [137]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration came as <em>Mawqoof</em> (i.e. a narration from a companion. In this case by Abdullah bin Mas’oud). It reads:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The Musbil during prayer has nothing to do with pardoning him and protecting him (from Hell or from bad deeds).”</strong> [138]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[135] Fathul Baaree, V. 10, P. 260.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [136] Al-Albaanee, Mushkat ul Massabeeh, V. 1, # 761.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[137] Reported by Abee Dawood V. 1, Book of Salat, hadeeth # 637 (Arabic or English Texts). The narration is in At-Tabaraanee in Al-Mu’jam Al-Kabeer , V. 9, P. 315. The checker said: it is authentic.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[138] Reported by Abee Dawood and At-Tayaalisee, V. 1, P. 352, Al-Baihaqee, V. 2, P. 432 (Book of Zuhd), Al-Haythamee in Majma’ Az-Zawaa’id, V. 5, P. 124 (he said: At-Tabaraanee reported it and its narrators are trustworthy), and Al-Albaanee authenticated it in Saheeh Al-Jaami’, hadeeth # 5888. Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajer said: “It was reported by At-Tabaraanee with a good Isnaad from Abdullah Ibn Mas’oud. An issue like this could not just be an opinion (i.e. of Abdullah Ibn Mas’oud)&#8230;”-Fathul Baaree, V. 10, P. 257.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Musbil</em>, therefore, should be aware that <em>Isbaal</em> is a great offense during prayers or after its completion. It should be also noted that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) ordered that we should not make <em>Kaft</em> of our clothes or hair during prayers. <em>Kaft</em> is to draw, cluster, pile up, tuck up, or band clothes together right before or during prayers to prevent their spreading [139]. Like, for example, to bring together and assemble the sides of one’s <em>Thobe</em> between the legs when one is about to enter the prayers or during <em>Ruk’oo</em> or <em>Sujood</em>, to pile up the ends of the head-cover on the head or the shoulders, to tuck up the lower ends of the pants,[140] or the ends of the sleeves, etc. In the hadeeth narrated by Abdullah bin Abbaas ,رضي االله عنهما the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said::</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I have been ordered (and thus his Ummah) to prostrate on seven bones: on forehead (along with the tip of the nose), pointed towards his nose, both hands, both knees and the toes of both feet, and not to tuck up the clothes and the hair.” [141]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[139]See Ibn Al-Atheer in An-Nihaayah fee Ghareeb Al-hadeeth, V. 4, P. 184.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[140]This is not to be confused with tucking up and then cutting off the trailing ends of the lower garments halfway to the middle of the legs or to an extent that keeps the lower ends of the Thobe, pants, trousers, etc. above the ankles. Even if the lower end is within the recommended limits, it should not be tucked up at its end because that constitutes Kaft.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[141]Saheeh Al-Bukharee, V. 1, hadeeth # 774.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Dress of Men</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The dress of men is governed by the following legislations:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1-It is forbidden if it extends below the ankles. The Musbil is under the threat of punishment in Hell.<br />
2-Isbaal itself is Makheelah.<br />
3-If the Musbil intends conceit and arrogance, Allaah will not look at him on the Day of Judgment.<br />
4-Isbaal is not confined to the lower garments. It covers the cloak, robe, pants,trousers, turban, sleeves, etc.<br />
5-The person who does not intend Isbaal and his lower Izaar hangs low out of his control is not a Musbil.<br />
6-The recommended length of the lower garment is halfway to the middle of the shanks, and the permissible is to up to the ankles.<br />
7-The dress must not resemble that of the Kuffar.<br />
8-The dress must not be for fame.<br />
9-The dress must not resemble that of women.<br />
10-The dress must not contain forbidden pictures (human and animal life), or material the essence of which is in disagreement with Islamic Principles including the immitation of the Kuffar.<br />
11-Wearing golden rings, bracelets, necklace, etc. Is forbidden.<br />
12-It is forbidden to wear pure silk.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Ruling on offering Salah without a turban</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Is it permissible to offer Salah (Prayer) without a turban? Is it permissible for the Imam (the one who leads congregational Prayer) to pray without a head cover? Is wearing a cap sufficient? Please support your answer with evidences. May Allah protect you. As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: There is nothing wrong with offering Salah without a turban because the head [with regard to men] is not included in `Awrah (parts of the body that must be covered in public), and it is not obligatory to cover it when offering Salah, whether the person praying is an Imam, a Munfarid (person offering Prayer individually), or a Ma&#8217;mum (person being led by an Imam in Prayer).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if wearing a turban is customary then it is best to do it, especially when offering Salah with others. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: <strong><em><span style="color:#008000;">O Children of Adam! Take your adornment (by wearing your clean clothes), while praying [and going round (the Tawâf of) the Ka‘bah,]</span></em></strong> The turban is considered a type of adornment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is well known that men who are Muhrims (pilgrims in the ritual state for Hajj and `Umrah) offer Salah bareheaded, because they are not allowed to cover their heads while in Ihram (ritual state for Hajj and `Umrah). Hence it is known that there is nothing wrong with offering Salah bareheaded. </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah guide all to acquire beneficial knowledge and act upon it! He is the All-Hearer and All-Respondent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Baaz Fatwas &#8211; <a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaSubjects.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;HajjEntryID=0&amp;HajjEntryName=&amp;RamadanEntryID=0&amp;RamadanEntryName=&amp;NodeID=3329&amp;PageID=1687&amp;SectionID=14&amp;SubjectPageTitlesID=23811&amp;MarkIndex=1&amp;0#ToofferSalah(Prayer)withoutaturban" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.alifta.net</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 10: Some people wear a turban, some wear a Qulunsuwah (cap), and many offer Salah (Prayer) with bare heads, I mean men. Which manner is the best in reward? We appreciate your advice, may Allah reward you with the best. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is desirable for a Muslim to wear his full garment when going to Prayer, the head cover included; because Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) enjoined His servants to adorn themselves when going to Salah. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <em><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O Children of Adam! Take your adornment (by wearing your clean clothes), while praying [and going round (the Tawâf of) the Ka‘bah,]</strong></span></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Besides, it has not been reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he offered Salah without a head cover</strong></span>. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>In fact, he used to always wear a turban, and the practice of Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the best guidance.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<p><b>[Question]</b></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">Sometimes whilst praying – especially during <i>rukoo’</i> (bowing) and <i>sujood</i> (prostration) – part of the <i>awrah</i>(private parts) of a person becomes exposed due to his wearing trousers. So what is the ruling concerning the wearing of trousers whilst praying?</span></p>
<p><strong>[Answer] </strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> “If the man’s trousers cover what is between his navel and his knees and are loose fitting, wide and baggy, then it fulfills the condition for the correctness of the Prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, what is more preferable is to wear a <strong><i>qamees</i> </strong>(long shirt) – which reaches half-way down to the shins, or just above the anklebone – over the trousers. This is a more complete form of covering the <i>awrah</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, Prayer in an <i>izaar</i> (a loose lower garment) is more preferable than Prayer in a pair of trousers without a long shirt – since the <i>izaar</i> far better covers the <i>awrah</i> than a pair of trousers.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth question of Fatwa no. 8598</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 4: Does rolling up the sleeves count as part of the tucking up that is not allowed during Salah?If it is part of that tucking up, does the ruling differ if I start praying with my sleeves rolled up, meaning, I do not roll them up during the Salah, or does it make no difference?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>not permissible to roll up the sleeves or to fold them up before the Salah or during it</strong></span> to avoid that they will touch the ground when performing Sujud (prostration), because the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, <span style="color:#008000;">I have been commanded to pray on seven bones and <strong>not to tuck up my hair or my clothes</strong></span>.

Their heads will appear like the humps of the Bactrian camel inclined to one side. They will not enter Jannah and they will not smell its fragrance which is perceptible from such and such a distance</span>.&#8221;<br />

Chapter 117<br />
Excellence of wearing white clothes and the permissibility of wearing red,<br />
green, yellow and black clothes made from Cotton, Linen but not Silk</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;O Children of ¢dam! We have bestowed raiment upon you to cover yourselves (screen your private parts) and as an adornment, and the raiment of righteousness, that is better.&#8221; (7:26)</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And (Allah) has made for you garments to protect you from the heat (and cold), and coats of mail to protect you from your (mutual) violence.&#8221;</b></span><b> (16:81)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>779.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: I heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Put on white clothes because they are the best; and use them for shrouding your dead.&#8221;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi and Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>780.</b> Samurah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8216;Wear white clothes because they are the purest and they are closest to modesty; and shroud the dead in it.&#8221;</span><br />
[An-Nasa&#8217;i and Al-Hakim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>781.</b> Bara&#8217; (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was of medium stature. I saw him wearing a red mantle. I have never seen anything more graceful than that.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>782.</b> Abu Juhaifah Wahb bin `Abdullah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> I saw the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) by Al-Abtah valley in Makkah, in a red tent made from tanned skin. Bilal brought him ablution water. Then Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) came out wearing a red mantle; and I can still remember looking at whiteness of his shanks. So he made his ablution, and Bilal (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) pronounced the call for prayer  (Adhan). I kept following the movement of his (Bilal&#8217;s) face to the right and to the left when he recited: `Come to the prayer; come to the success.&#8217; Then a spear was fixed (as a Sutrah) in front of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) who then stepped forward and led the prayer. Dogs and donkeys passed in front of him (beyond the spear) and no one prevented them from doing so.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>783.</b> Abu Rimthah Rifa`ah At-Taimi (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> I saw Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) wearing two green garments.</span><br />
[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>784.</b> Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) entered Makkah on the day of its conquest and he was wearing a black turban.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>785.</b> Abu Sa`id `Amr bin Huraith (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> As if I am seeing Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) wearing a black turban and both ends of it are falling over his shoulders.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is:<span style="color:#008000;"> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was delivering a Khutbah wearing a black turban.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>786.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> The body of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was shrouded in three white Yemeni cotton garments, among which was neither a gown nor a turban.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>787.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> One morning Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) went out wearing a black blanket made of camel&#8217;s or sheep&#8217;s black hair with patterns of camels&#8217; bags upon it.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>788.</b> Al-Mughirah bin Shu`bah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I was with Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) in a journey one night, and he asked me,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Do you have any water with you?&#8221;</span> I said, &#8220;Yes<span style="color:#008000;">.</span>&#8221; So he dismounted from his riding camel and walked away (to answer the call of nature) until he disappeared in the darkness. When he returned, I poured out some water from a vessel and he washed his face. He was wearing a long woollen cloak and could not take out his forearms from his sleeves, so he brought them out from below the cloak and then washed them, and then passed his (wet) hands over his head. I stretched out my hand to take off his Khuff (leather socks), but he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Leave them. I put them on after performing Wudu&#8217;,&#8217;</span>&#8216; and he passed his (wet) hands over them.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is:<span style="color:#008000;"> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was wearing a Syrian cloak with tight sleeves.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is:<span style="color:#008000;"> This incident took place during the battle of Tabuk.</span></p>

Chapter 119<br />
Description of the length of Qamees and the Sleeves, the end of the Turban, the<br />
Prohibition of wearing long Garments out of Pride and the undesirability of<br />
wearing them without Pride</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>790.</b> Asma` bint Yazid (May Allah be pleased with her) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> The Qamees sleeves of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) reached down to his wrists.</span><br />
[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>791.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Whoever allows his lower garment to drag out of vanity will find that Allah will not look at him on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;</span> On this Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) submitted: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! My lower garment keeps sliding down though I take care to pull it and wrap it.&#8217;<span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;</span> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;You are not of those who do it out of vanity.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>792.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will not look at him who trails his lower garment out of pride.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>793.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;What is below the ankles of a lower garment is condemned to the Fire (Hell).&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>794.</b> Abu Dharr (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;There are three to whom Allah will neither speak on the Day of Resurrection nor will look at them nor purify them (i.e., of their sins), and they will be severely tormented.</span>&#8221; When he repeated this (statement) thrice, Abu Dharr (May Allah be pleased with him) said: &#8220;They are doomed and destroyed! (But) who are they, O Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)?&#8221; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;One whose lower garment trails, one who boasts of kindness shown to another; and one who promotes sale of his business by taking false oaths.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>795.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will not look at one who trails his lower garment, Qamees or turban arrogantly.&#8221;</span><br />
[Abu Dawud and An-Nasa&#8217;i].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>796.</b> Abu Juraiy Jabir bin Sulaim (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I noticed a man whose opinion was followed by every body, and no one acted contrary to what he said. I asked who he was, and I was informed that he was Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). I said to him twice: &#8220;Alaikas-salam ya Rasul-Allah (may Allah render you safe).&#8221; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Do not say: `Alaikas-salamu.&#8217; This is the salutation to the dead (in Jahiliyyah times)</span>.<span style="color:#0000ff;"> Say, instead: `As-salamu `alaika (may Allah render you safe).</span>&#8221;&#8217; I asked: &#8220;Are you Messenger of Allah?&#8221; He replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;(Yes) I am the Messenger of Allah, Who will remove your affliction when you are in trouble and call to Him, Who will cause food to grow for you when you are famine-stricken and call to Him, and Who will restore to you your lost riding beast in the desert when you call upon Him.&#8221;</span> I said to him: &#8220;Give me instructions (to act upon).&#8221; He ((sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said<span style="color:#0000ff;">, &#8220;Do not abuse anyone.&#8221;</span> (Since then I have never abused anyone, neither a freeman, nor a slave, nor a camel, nor a sheep). He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) continued,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Do not hold in contempt even an insignificant act of goodness, because even talking to your brother with a cheerful countenance is an act of goodness. Hold up your lower garment half way to the leg, and at least above the ankles; for trailing it is arrogance, and Allah dislikes pride. And if a man imputes to you of bad things he knows you possess, do not impute to him bad things that you know he has for he will assume the evil consequences of his abuse.&#8221;</span><br />
[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>797.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to a man who was performing Salat while his lower garment was trailing,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Go and perform your Wudu&#8217; again.&#8221;</span> That man went and came back having performed it. The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said (again),<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Go and perform your Wudu&#8217;.</span>&#8221; Someone present said to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam): &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! You ask him to perform his Wudu&#8217; and then you kept silent (without saying the reason for it).&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He performed Salat while his lower garment was below his ankels. Allah does not accept the Salat of a man who trails his lower garment.&#8221;</span><br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>798.</b> Qais bin Bishr At-Taghlibi reported that his father, who attended the company of `Abud-Darda&#8217; (May Allah be pleased with him) told him: There was a man in Damascus who was a Companion of the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). He was called Ibn Al-Hanzaliyyah. He was a lonesome person and would rarely spend some time in the company of people. He would spend most of his time in performing Salat and when he finished, he would engage himself in Tasbih (Subhan-Allah) and Takbir (Allahu Akbar), till he would go home. He passed by us one day when we were sitting with Abud-Darda&#8217; (May Allah be pleased with him). The latter said to him: &#8220;Tell us something which will benefit for us and will not harm you.&#8221; He said: &#8220;Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) sent a detachment. When they returned, one of them came to the assemblage in which Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was present and said to his neighbour during the conversation: `I wish you had seen us when we encountered the enemy. So-and-so (a believer) took up his spear, struck and said: Take this from me and I am the Ghifari boy. Now what do you think of this?&#8217; The neighbour said: `I think that he lost his reward because of boasting.&#8217; He said: `I see no harm in it.&#8217; They began to exchange arguments till Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) heard them and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `Subhan-Allah (Allah is free from every imperfection)</span>. He would be rewarded (in the Hereafter) and praised (in this world)&#8217;. I noticed that Abud-Darda&#8217; (May Allah be pleased with him) felt a great pleasure at this remark and, raising his head began to repeat: &#8220;Have you heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) say this!&#8221; Ibn Al-Hanzaliyyah (May Allah be pleased with him) continued responding till I asked Abud-Darda&#8217; (May Allah be pleased with him) not to annoy him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Al-Hanzaliyyah (May Allah be pleased with him) happened to pass by us another day and Abud-Darda&#8217; said to him: &#8220;Tell us something which will benefit us and will not harm you.&#8221; He said: &#8220;The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) told us,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `He who spends to purchase a horse (for Jihad) is like one who extends his hand for spending out of charity without withholding it.&#8221;&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He passed by us another day and Abud-Darda&#8217; (May Allah be pleased with him) said to him: &#8220;Tell us something which might benefit us, and will not harm you.&#8221; He said: &#8220;The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) once said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `Khuraim Al-Usaidi is an excellent man were it not of his long hair and his lower garment which is hanging down.&#8217;</span> When Khuraim heard about what the Prophet had said about him, he trimmed his long hair up to his ears with a knife and raised his lower garment half way on his shanks.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On another occasion he passed by us and Abud-Darda&#8217; (May Allah be pleased with him) said to him: &#8220;Tell us something that will benefit us and will not harm you.&#8221; He said that he heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) say, while coming back from an expedition:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;You are returning to your brothers, so set your saddles and clothes in order so that you look tidy and graceful. Allah hates untidiness.&#8221;</span><br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>799.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The lower garment of a believer should be half way below the knees. He is guilty of no sin if they are up to the ankles. That which is below the ankles is in the Fire (of Hell). Allah will not look at one who allows his lower garment to trail out of vanity.</span><br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>800.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: My lower garment was trailing as I passed by Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) so he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Raise your lower garment, Abdullah.&#8221;</span> I lifted it up and he told me to raise it higher. I complied with his orders and as I was still trying to find the best place (for it), one of the people asked where it should reach and he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Half way down the knees.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>801.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will not look at the one who trails his lower garment out of arrogance.&#8217;</span>&#8216; Umm Salamah (May Allah be pleased with her) asked: &#8220;What should women do with the hem of their clothes?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;They might lower them a hand&#8217;s span.&#8221;</span> She said: &#8220;But their feet would still remain exposed.&#8221; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Let them lower those equal to arm&#8217;s length but not more than that.&#8221;</span><br />
[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].</p>

He (the Holy Prophet) said: I have not sent it to you that you wear it, but I have    sent It to you so that you may derive benefit out of it; and Usama (donned) the garment    (presented to him) and appeared to be brisk, whereupon Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon    him) looked at him with a look by which he perceived that the Messenger of Allah (may    peace be upon him) did not like what he had done.

Khatab say that he had heard from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be    upon him): He who wears silk garment has no share for him (in the Hereafter), and I am    afraid it may not be that striped garment; and so far as the red saddle clotb is concerned    that is the saddle cloth of Abdullah and it is red. I went back to Asma&#8217; and informed her.    whereupon she said: Here is the cloak of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). and    she brought out to me that cloak made of Persian cloth with a hem of brocade, and its    sleeves bordered with brocade and said: This wall Allah&#8217;s Messenger&#8217;s cloak with &#8216;A&#8217;isha    until she died, and when she died. I got possession of it. The Apostle of Allah (may peace    be upon him) used to wear that, and we waslied it for the sick and sought cure thereby.</font></p>

Then I married AbdurRahman bin Az-Zubair who, by Allah, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, has only something like a fringe of a garment, Showing the fringe of her veil.

Do you hope that (emigration)?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8216;Yes.&#8221; So Abu Bakr waited to accompany the Prophet and fed two she-camels he had on the leaves of As-Samur tree regularly for four months One day while we were sitting in our house at midday, someone said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;Here is Allah&#8217;s Apostle, coming with his head and a part of his face covered with a cloth-covering at an hour he never used to come to us.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you, (O Prophet)! An urgent matter must have brought you here at this hour.&#8221; The Prophet came and asked the permission to enter, and he was allowed. The Prophet entered and said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;Let those who are with you, go out.&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;(There is no stranger); they are your family. Let my father be sacrificed for you, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I have been allowed to leave (Mecca).&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8221; I shall accompany you, O Allah&#8217;s Apostles, Let my father be sacrificed for you!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes,&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostles!

And Asma&#8217; bint Abu Bakr cut a piece of her girdle and tied the mouth of the leather bag with it. That is why she was called Dhat-an-Nitaqaln. Then the Prophet and Abu Bakr went to a cave in a mountain called Thour and remained there for three nights. &#8216;Abdullah bin Abu Bakr. who was a young intelligent man. used to stay with them at night and leave before dawn so that in the morning, he would he with the Quraish at Mecca as if he had spent the night among them. If he heard of any plot contrived by the Quraish against the Prophet and Abu Bakr, he would understand it and (return to) inform them of it when it became dark. &#8216;Amir bin Fuhaira, the freed slave of Abu Bakr used to graze a flock of milch sheep for them and he used to take those sheep to them when an hour had passed after the &#8216;Isha prayer.

<p style="text-align:justify;">For one year I wanted to ask &#8216;Umar about the two women who helped each other against the Prophet but I was afraid of him. One day he dismounted his riding animal and went among the trees of Arak to answer the call of nature, and when he returned, I asked him and he said, &#8220;(They were) &#8216;Aisha and Hafsa.&#8221; Then he added, &#8220;We never used to give significance to ladies in the days of the Pre-lslamic period of ignorance, but when Islam came and Allah mentioned their rights, we used to give them their rights but did not allow them to interfere in our affairs. Once there was some dispute between me and my wife and she answered me back in a loud voice. I said to her, &#8216;Strange! You can retort in this way?&#8217; She said, &#8216;Yes. Do you say this to me while your daughter troubles Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8217; So I went to Hafsa and said to her, &#8216;I warn you not to disobey Allah and His Apostle.&#8217; I first went to Hafsa and then to Um Salama and told her the same. She said to me, &#8216;O &#8216;Umar! It surprises me that you interfere in our affairs so much that you would poke your nose even into the affairs of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his wives.&#8217; So she rejected my advice. There was an Ansari man; whenever he was absent from Allah&#8217;s Apostle and I was present there, I used to convey to him what had happened (on that day), and when I was absent and he was present there, he used to convey to me what had happened as regards news from Allah&#8217;s Apostle . During that time all the rulers of the nearby lands had surrendered to Allah&#8217;s Apostle except the king of Ghassan in Sham, and we were afraid that he might attack us. All of a sudden the Ansari came and said, &#8216;A great event has happened!&#8217; I asked him, &#8216;What is it? Has the Ghassani (king) come?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Greater than that! Allah&#8217;s Apostle has divorced his wives! I went to them and found all of them weeping in their dwellings, and the Prophet had ascended to an upper room of his. At the door of the room there was a slave to whom I went and said, &#8220;Ask the permission for me to enter.&#8221; He admitted me and I entered to see the Prophet lying on a mat that had left its imprint on his side. Under his head there was a leather pillow stuffed with palm fires. Behold! There were some hides hanging there and some grass for tanning. Then I mentioned what I had said to Hafsa and Um Salama and what reply Um Salama had given me. Allah&#8217;s Apostle smiled and stayed there for twenty nine days and then came down.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 648, Vol. 3 for details)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><a href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-2zH" target="_blank">BEAUTIFICATION IN PRAYER </a></strong><br />
By: Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan</p>
<p><strong>Question: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">May Allaah treat you well. The questioner says: the imam of the masjid possesses a lot of wealth, but when he comes to the prayer; he wears a dirty Izaar (bottom waist wrap) and a dirty garment. When I say to him why doesn&#8217;t he purchase new garments for the prayer; he says whoever is humble for Allaah then he will raise him, so what is the ruling of his prayer?</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p>This is not humbleness to Allaah. Allaah says;</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O children of Adam, take your adornment within every masjid&#8230;&#8221;</span> (7:31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning in every prayer, and the adornment here does not only mean covering the private area, but the adornment comprises of clothing used for beautification for the prayer; while facing the Lord of everything that exist. You are <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>standing in front of Him</strong></span>, so you beautify yourself with whatever you are able to from beautification in appreciation for the prayer and glorification of the position between yourself and your Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is something required and as mentioned in the Hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;if Allaah expands His favors upon, then display them&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the prophet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily Allaah loves that the signs of His favors are seen upon His servants&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is not from humility, yes; you should not wear extravagant boasting clothing, so you become someone who is looked at. You should wear moderate clothing which are clean and beautiful, as the prophet صلى عليه و سلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily Allaah is beautiful and He loves beauty&#8221;</span></p>

Amma-ba&#8217;d</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#008000;"><em> &#8220;There are three people that Allaah will not speak to on the Day of Judgement, will not look at them, will not purify them; and for them is a painful punishment: one who lets his garment hang below his ankles, the Mannan, and the Munaffiq who does his business with false oaths.&#8221;</em></span> (Muslim no. 106)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said<em><span style="color:#008000;">: &#8220;Whoever drags his garment out of arrogance, Allaah will not look at him on the Day of Judgement.&#8221;</span></em> (Al-Bukhaaree no. 5784 and Muslim no. 2085)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) also said:<em><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Whatever is below the ankles is in the fire.&#8221;</span> </em>(Al-Bukhaaree no. 5787)[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) also said:<em><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;The Izar of the believer is at the middle of his shin, and there is no harm &#8211; or he said &#8211; no sin upon someone if it is anywhere between that and the ankles. What is lower than that is in the Fire. And whoever drags his Izar arrogantly, Allaah will not look at him on the Day of Judgement.&#8221;</span></em>[2] (Abu Dawud no. 4093, Ibn Majah no. 3573, An-Nasa&#8217;i 5/490, no 9716 and Al-Mawatta&#8217; 2/914, 915)</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Refutation of Doubt &#8220;We are like Abu Bakr; we&#8217;re not doing it out of Pride&#8221; </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the course of his series of classes of Readings from &#8211; Complete Characteristics of Muhammad (sallalallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), student Abul-Hasan Maalik (hafidhahullaah) relayed the proofs from the pure Sunnah concerning the Isbal as relates to the Izaar, Thobe, Kamees (shirt), and even the &#8216;Imaamah (turban).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning those who violate these boundaries with the excuse &#8220;We are like Abu Bakr; we&#8217;re not doing it out of Pride,&#8221; Abul-Hasan relayed the following from the scholars:</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;The scholars have mentioned a few different reasons why it is not correct for you to try to compare yourself with Abu Bakr As-Sideeq (radiallaahu &#8216;anhu).</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>&#8211; <strong>Firstly</strong>, we don&#8217;t have a testimony as Abu Bakr did from the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) that he wasn&#8217;t doing it out of pride. The Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: You are not one doing it out of Pride. None of you have a testimony from the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) (saying) you&#8217;re not doing it out of pride. (That&#8217;s) number one.</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>Number two</strong>, the &#8216;ulemma mention that it happened to Abu Bakr because of his thinness, he was a thin man. Very small (waist), and it was hard for him to keep his izaar up, and it used to fall.</p>
<p>&#8211; <strong>The third issue</strong> the &#8216;ulemma mention is that he was striving to keep it up! He wasn&#8217;t just letting it all hang out and down like this. He was striving to keep it up.</p>
<p>&#8211; [<strong>Fourthly</strong>,] they (the scholars) also mention another narration that the Prophet mentioned that isbal itself is nakhyila &#8211; isbal itself is arrogance. The &#8216;ulemma mentioned that at the very least it leads to arrogance&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul-Hasan relayed other benefits and explanations and rulings from &#8216;ulemma such as Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah, Imam Ibnul-Qayyim, and Imam An-Nawaawee (rahimahumullaah) concerning matters such as isbal for the sleeves of the kamees (they can&#8217;t be too long or wide)[3] and the isbal for the &#8216;Imaamah (the tail of the turban cannot be very long). And this is not a minor issue, rather it concerns the major matter of obeying Allaah and His Messenger, the matter of following the Sunnah[4] of the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), whom Allaah Ta&#8217;aala commanded us to follow and take as an example. The Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) is the best example to follow.[5]</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>[1] Shaikh Muhammad Ibn Saalih al-&#8216;Uthaimeen (rahimahullaah) said: &#8220;The Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) did not confine this to arrogance, and it is not correct to do so based on the Hadeeth before it, because Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudri (radiallaahu &#8216;anhu) said that the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> &#8216;The Izar of the believer is at the middle of his shin, and there is no harm &#8211; or he said &#8211; no sin upon someone if it is anywhere between that and the ankles. What is lower than that is in the Fire. And whoever drags his Izar arrogantly, Allaah will not look at him on the Day of Judgement.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
<p>Because the two actions are different, the punishment for each is different. Whenever the ruling and the reason for that differ, it is not possible to restrict a general ruling. This is because that would lead to a contradiction.&#8221;</p>
<p>[2] The hadeeth is authenticated by Imam Al-Albaanee (rahimahullaah).</p>
<p>[3] Imam Ibn Baaz (rahimahullaah) said: &#8220;As for the sleeves, the Sunnah is that they should not extend beyond the wrist, and with Allaah is the facilitation to do what is right.&#8221;</p>
<p>[4] The word Sunnah refers to the Prophet&#8217;s statements, actions, and his tacit approvals &#8211; some of which are obligatory (such as Ash-Shahadatayn, having the correct &#8216;aqeedah, the 5 obligatory prayers, Zakat, Hajj, fasting Ramadan, obedience to parents, growing the beard, returning the salaam, keeping your thobe or izaar above the ankles) and some of which are recommended (such as the optional prayers, optional fasting, using the miswak, beginning the salaam). The word Sunnah has also been used to refer to the &#8216;aqeedah and manhaj, and the word Sunnah has also been used to refer to the entire Religion.<br />
[5] Among the many ayat Allaah revealed in this regard are the statements of Allaah, Ta&#8217;aala:</p>
<p>لَقَدْ كَانَ لَكُمْ فِي رَسُولِ اللَّهِ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَة لِمَنْ كَانَ يَرْجُو اللَّهَ وَالْيَوْمَ الآخِرَ وَذَكَرَ اللَّهَ كَثِيرا</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah (Muhammad), you have a good example to follow for him who hopes in (the Meeting with) Allaah and the Last Day and remembers Allaah much.</em></span> (Al-Ahzab, ayah 21)</p>
<p>قُلْ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ تُحِبُّونَ اللَّهَ فَاتَّبِعُونِي يُحْبِبْكُمُ اللَّهُ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ ذُنُوبَكُمْ وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَحِيم</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Say (Oh Muhammad to mankind): &#8220;If you (really) love Allaah then follow me (i.e. accept Tawheed, follow the Qur`an and the Sunnah), Allaah will love you and forgive you of your sins. And Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221; </em></span>(Aali &#8216;Imran, ayah 31)</p>
<p>قُلْ أَطِيعُوا اللَّهَ وَالرَّسُولَ فَإِنْ تَوَلَّوْا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ الْكَافِرِينَ</p>
<p>Say (Oh Muhammad): &#8220;Obey Allaah and the Messenger (Muhammad).&#8221; But if they turn away, then Allaah does not like the disbelievers. (Aali &#8216;Imran, ayah 32)</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Cuffing the Pants in Prayer, by Shaykh Zaid al-Madkhalee (hafidhahullaah) </strong></span></p>
<p>Bismillaah Al-Hamdulillaah wa salatu wa salaamu &#8216;ala rasulullaah<br />
Amma-ba&#8217;d</p>
<p><strong>Cuffing the pants in prayer by Shaykh Zaid</strong></p>
<p>Here is an excerpt:</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: What is the ruling on rising or cuffing the pants in prayer if they are beneath the ankles?</p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Zaid al-Madkhalee (hafidhahullaah)</strong> answered:</p>
</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Obligatory. If the pants or the garment, or the trousers, or the izar, hangs beneath the ankles, the man falls into a sin from the major sins and this is not specific to the prayer, rather it is general for all times. As it appears in the hadith: Allaah will not look at the one (man) who drags his garment out of arrogance.[Muslim (2085)]</p>
<div style="text-align:left;">
<p>If a person comes with an attempt to remain neutral, saying &#8216;I don&#8217;t drag my garment due to arrogance; rather it is normal or routine.&#8217; Then bring him the proof with another narration, the statement of the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam): Whatever is beneath the ankles is in the fire. [Musnadof Imam Ahmad (9064)]</p>
<p>So he (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) did not say, &#8216;due to arrogance,&#8217; nor did he restrict this to a condition or a description. Therefore there are two punishments for the one who drags his garment, one of them being more severe than the other &#8211; and they are both severe&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#008000;">Guidelines on Children’s Clothes with Pictures and on Dolls</span></span><br />
</strong>Sheikh Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee (may Allah have mercy on him)</p>
</header>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">Here, one of the sisters asks: What is the ruling on clothing children with clothes which contains pictures of things which have souls if it is not possible to erase these pictures from them, because by erasing them (the pictures), the garment is spoiled?</span></p>
<p>So, the Sheikh replied:</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p>Without doubt, it has to be said, that for the likes of this question, the purchasing of the garment which is illustrated with pictures, has to have definitely already occurred by mistake or negligence from the father or mother who bought (it), because <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>the fundamental principle is that it is not appropriate for the Muslims that they purchase clothes which have pictures on them</strong></span>. However, a person may be unaware, and he may be negligent, and they may forget…and he may forget and he may purchase a garment, (and) after he returns with it to his house it becomes clear to him that there is a full prohibited picture on it. So, in this situation also, this question (above) is not to be found. It is imperative that another introduction precede it (this question), and it is…the changing of the garment for another garment from the place where it was purchased from, (whereby this new garment) does not have on it a prohibited picture. So if… so if it was not possible for the father or the mother to change it (for another garment), then here in the third stage (of this situation) this question comes about.</p>
<p>So, I remind about these two introductions (which should be placed before the question) because the majority of the people are heedless when they proceed to the markets. They buy everyday necessities (which are made) from different materials, from them which are the likes of those things which are spread out (carpets, rugs, mats etc.) and blankets or what resembles that, those (things) which are predominantly illustrated with pictures and decorated. And they do not pay any attention to them at all (these materials which have pictures) and they buy them <strong><span style="color:#993300;">with the excuse that these materials are not respected (because they are sat on, slept on etc.) and are not hung up</span></strong>. So, we say: It is imperative upon the Muslims that they be those who are awake (and) not those who are asleep, and that they pay attention to the plot of the disbelievers, those who are invading them in the midst of their own house with diverse ways – and that which is from them (these ways) are these clothes which are illustrated with pictures.And it (this matter) is mentioned bit by bit, specifically if the people are in need of it. And in a manner more specific when they are made heedless through some of the erroneous guidelines, through some of the fataawa (religious edicts) which are not based upon authentic proof, like (the fataawa for) these dolls and children’s toys which cram up the markets and the mothers go and buy for the boys and girls many a thing from these amusements in the name of them (being) toys for children or toys for girls.</p>
<p>So, it is imperative that we remember something here, and it is that the toys (i.e. dolls) which are allowed to be used for the small children… rather I say for girls only and not for the males from the children, that there is not out there any proof for the permissibility (of these toys/dolls) except the hadeeth of ‘Aaishah (may Allah be pleased with her) which says that she used to send for the daughters from the daughters of her neighbours to come to her and she would play with them with girls’ toys and the Messenger (sallallahu ‘alaihi wa ‘ala aalihi wa sallam) would help her in that and consent to her (doing that) and he would not rebuke her. Rather, indeed he (sallallahu ‘alaihi wa ‘ala aalihi wa sallam) [entered upon her] one time and saw amongst her toys a horse with two wings. So he (‘alaihi salaam) said to ‘Aaishah, playing about with her: ‘A horse which has two wings?!’ She said: ‘O’ Messenger of Allah, have you not heard’ or ‘has it not reached you that the horse of Sulaymaan (‘alaihi salaam) had wings?’ and he (‘alaihi salaatu wa salaam) laughed and he affirmed her in that. This hadeeth is the proof which makes it possible for us to rely upon it in allowing girl’s toys (i.e. dolls) with images and sculptured forms.</p>
<p>However, there is a principle of fiqh (jurisprudence) out there that every text which comes and carries within its folds a ruling which is an exception from the general proofs, then this ruling is halted at and it is not increased upon because it is against the fundamental principle. And that which was like that, i.e. that which was against the fundamental principle, then an analogy (qiyaas) is not made from that which was irregular to the fundamental principle, (and) because that which was against (an) analogy (being made with it), cannot (then) be used to make (a further) analogy based upon it, and indeed it is but connected (back) to the general principle.</p>
<p>If this meaning is clear to all, inshaa’Allah, then at this time we say: The toys which Sayyidah ‘Aaishah (may Allah be pleased with her) [had], they were from that type which some of the other women engaged in, in diverting the attention of their children away from requesting food and drink in the state of them fasting. And indeed they (the women) used to take for them images from coloured wool, from cotton and give them to those who were fasting from the youngsters, diverting their attention away from requesting food and drink. This type from the images, this type from the toys of the children, it was a local (type of image and toy) and it was a domestic [i.e. in the house] (type of image and toy), and it was not imported from outside the Islamic households, let alone being imported from the lands of disbelief and misguidance which manufacture toys and figures which are in accordance with their tastes, with their habits and their customs, and which do not agree in any way whatsoever with the habits of the Muslims and their customs and the rulings of their share ‘ah. <span style="color:#339966;">And from that which shows you this, is what you see in these (imported) images, from the (imported) figures (which) sometimes are small (in size) and sometimes are big (in size), until (even) a young girl (who) can just about hold the doll and (yet) it is the same length as her and the same width as her and it has blond hair and clipped (in its hair) from the sides like the male children. And it (the imported doll) has a garment which are shorts i.e. the garment which has no legs to it, and it has the short garment which reveals the thighs (of the dolls). These sculptured forms contain the customs of those disbelievers and their habits and their mannerisms.</span></p>
<p>So, if we entered these sculptured forms into our houses, then first that (shows) that we are pleased with what they contain (i.e. from the customs, habits and mannerisms of those who made them)…firstly…, and secondly, that we are teaching our children (those) mannerisms and that we are bringing them up since their tender age upon finding pleasant these objects which are mutually contradictory to the Islamic clothing, and in particular that which is related to the men. And due to this, it is imperative upon us to beware of these imported clothes from the lands of disbelief with their [different] types and their (different) forms and their (different) purposes, and from that are the clothes of young children.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#993300;">So we, with great sorrow, every time we enter a house we find the children of our brothers, those who adhere – according to our claim – to the Book of our Lord and the Sunnah of our Prophet, despite all of that, we find that the children have been dressed in clothes which have pictures on them and lewd pictures. Then, this calamity has spread until we have begun to clothe our youths who have passed the age of responsibility with shirts which have pictures on the back and on the front. And (when) sometimes we pray the Friday prayer, there comes to the Friday prayer, as you know, the one who does not pray except on the day of Friday, and most of his life he spends in play and amusement and despite that he (stills) attends the Friday prayer. So, we see him praying and behind him i.e. on the back of his shirt, there is a picture of a woman with her hair flowing and visible from her is her arm and her neck and the likes of that, and we face this picture (whilst praying).</span></p></blockquote>
<p>These strange acts of heedlessness from the Muslims, I think that that which helps in spreading these shameful things and these Islamic violations is the saying that the prohibited images are indeed only but firstly, the three- dimensional images which have a shadow. As for that which is not three- dimensional, then these they claim are permissible and allowed and especially if they were not formed by the hand but were rather but formed with a photo camera or a printer. So, these are from the whisperings of shaytaan which he has thrown amongst humanity in this time and beautified for them (the fact) that there is nothing wrong with them.</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So, it is upon the Muslims therefore, to stay away from buying any type from the types of clothes which have these pictures on them due to what we have mentioned earlier.</strong></span></p>
<p>And in conclusion I say in response to that question (asked above): If the affair revolves around scraping off (the picture from) the garment and wasting the benefit from it and around seeking pleasure from it (the garment) despite its obvious and hidden shortcomings…I say if…., then seeking benefit (from it) is permissible. However, I believe that the believing woman and the one who with her capability is truly the mistress of the house, (should) <strong>erase the traces of that picture by scraping (it) off and with embroidery whereby the head is wiped out</strong> because the affair is as he (‘alaihi as salaam) said:</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><em>‘Indeed, the picture is but the head’.</em></span></p>
<p>So, if the head is wiped out, the picture is wiped out, even if some of its traces remain. And with this has the answer been completed inshaa’Allah.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>What is the ruling regarding people who wear shorts when they play sports and people who watch them play?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Playing sports is allowed when it does not prevent one from what is obligatory. If it were to prevent one from something that is obligatory then it would be unlawful. If it becomes something that people spend most of their time in, then it would become a waste of time, in which case the least of what could be said is that it is Makruh (disliked). As for a person playing a sport, who is wearing only shorts that expose his thigh, or even more then that, then this is not allowed. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>For what is correct is that it is obligatory for young men to cover their thighs, and that watching a sport whose participants have their thighs exposed like this is not allowed</strong></span>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">A woman is commanded to cover her hair with a veil when she prays by herself in her house, whereby she is allowed to expose it outside the salât. Therefore, it is the Right of Allâh on us to take an adornment when praying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No one has the right to circumambulate the Ka’bah nakedly[1] even if he is alone in darkness where no one can see him. Likewise, it is not permissible for him to pray nakedly even if he is by himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is from this point that we understand that, taking of an adornment in salât, is not for the purpose of veiling from people. Doing that is one thing and veiling from people is another thing. Also, it is understood that, an individual may cover in salât that which is permissible for him to expose outside the salât, and a woman may expose in salât that which she covers from the sight of men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The example of the first issue is like that of the shoulders. For verily the Prophet (Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam), has forbidden one of us to pray in one cloth that covers not his shoulders this is because it is the right of salât that one covers his shoulders when he prays though it is permissible for him to expose his shoulders to men outside the salât.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise the free woman,[2] it is a must on her to put on a head-covering when praying as the Prophet (Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam),  said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“لاَ يَقْبَلُ اللهُ صَلاَةَ حَاءِضٍ إِلاّ بِخِمَارٍ”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<em>Allâh the Almighty will not accept the prayer of the woman who reached puberty except with a head-covering”</em> though it is not upon her to put on <strong>Khimâr</strong> [i.e., head-covering] whenever she is with her husband or her family members. That is because it is permissible for her to expose the hidden adornment to them, but it is not permissible for her to expose her head when praying, neither to her family members nor other than them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the opposite of that are the face, the hands and the feet. It is impermissible for her to expose these parts to foreign men according to the most correct opinion. Contrary to what was before the abrogation of that rule, as a matter of fact, she is only allowed to expose her garment. But as for covering those parts [face, hands and feet] in salât, it is not obligatory according to the consensus of the scholars though they are from the hidden adornment. But as for the ruling of the hands, the <strong>majority</strong> of the scholars like Abu Haneefah, Shafi’ee and others, have agreed upon the permissibility of exposing them in salât. And this is one of the narrations of Imam Ahmad. Also, according to Abu Haneefah it is permissible to expose the feet when praying, and this is the strongest opinion; because Ayesha has considered it from the apparent adornment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] It is agreed upon. And it is emanated in <strong>“Sahih Abi Dawud”</strong> [637] and <strong>“Ir’waa Al-Ghalil”</strong> [275].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] I said: Particularization of Khimâr to the free woman is of the issues that has no proof for it. Rather, the generality of the following Hadith negates that. And look in the previous comment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"> Taken from <strong>“The Veil of The Muslim Women and Her Dress in Salat” &#8211; </strong>by Sheikh-ul-Islâm Ibn Taymiyyah which has its verification by the Muhaddith of our times Sheikh Muhammad Nasrideen Al-Albaani may Allâh have mercy on them both. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz</strong> (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing wrong with wearing a watch on either the right or left hand, like a ring, because it is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wore a ring on his right hand and left hand. End quote.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen</strong> (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Putting a watch on the right hand is not better than putting it on the left hand, because a watch is like a ring, and there is no difference between putting a watch on the right hand or left hand. But undoubtedly putting it on the left hand is easier with regard to correcting it and looking at it, and it is safer in most cases, because the right hand moves more so it is more likely to cause damage to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The matter is broad in scope, so we should not say that the Sunnah is to wear it on the right hand, because it is narrated in the Sunnah that it is permissible to wear a ring on both the right and the left hand, and a watch is like a ring. End quote.</p>

<p>Q 4: What is the ruling on men wearing watches on the right or left hand?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The ruling is flexible in this regard and it is permissible to wear it in the right or left hand, equally for men and women, just like rings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions</p>
