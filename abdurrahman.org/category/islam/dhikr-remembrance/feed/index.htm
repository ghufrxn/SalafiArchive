										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From <a href="http://alifta.net/Fatawa/MoftyDetails.aspx?languagename=en&amp;Type=Mofty&amp;section=tafseer&amp;ID=2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">`Abdul-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz</a> to the honorable brother H. M. Th., may Allah grant him safety! May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you. In respect of your request for Fatwa registered in the Department of the Scholarly Research and Ifta’ (no. 1513), dated (21/4/1407 A.H.), it contains three questions. Here are the answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"> Q3: What is the wisdom behind saying, <span class="f"> </span><strong>لا حَوْلَ وَلا قُوَّةَ إِلا بِالله</strong> &#8220;<strong>La Hawla Wala Quwwata Illla Billah</strong>&#8221;  (There is no might nor power except with Allah) when the Mu`adh-dhin says, <strong> حي على الصلاة</strong> &#8220;<strong>Hayya `Ala Al-Salah</strong> (Come to Salah)&#8221; and  <strong>حي على الفلاح &#8220;Hayya `Ala Al-Falah</strong> (Come to Success)&#8221; taking into consideration that they imply a call to Salah? Is there a Hadith that refers to that?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The wisdom behind that saying is that man is weak by nature. He has no ability to move from a condition to another except with the help of Allah. Even his going to Salah in congregation needs the help and power of Allah. A servant of Allah has no might or power except with Allah. He realizes that he is weak, powerless, and unable to answer this call unless Allah helps him Alone. Therefore, upon hearing that call, he says: &#8220;La Hawla Wala Quwwata Illa Billah&#8221;.</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is authentically reported from `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) as related by Muslim in his Sahih. May Allah grant us all success! May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!</p>
<p><em>Issued by the office of His Eminence and was read to His Eminence again on 4/4/1415 A.H.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tafseer Ibn Kathir : Surah Faatir 35:11</strong><br />
(darussalam english publication)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Righteous Deeds ascend to Allah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(To Him ascend the good words,)</span> means, words of remembrance, recitation of Qur&#8217;an, and supplications. This was the view of more than one of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jarir recorded that Al-Mukhariq bin Sulaym said that &#8220;`Abdullah bin Mas`ud, may Allah be pleased with him, said to them, &#8220;If we tell you a Hadith, we will bring you proof of it from the Book of Allah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>When the Muslim servants says, `Glory and praise be to Allah, there is no god worthy of worship except Allah, Allah is Most Great and blessed be Allah,&#8217; an angel takes these words and puts them under his wing, then he ascends with them to the heaven. He does not take them past any group of angels but they seek forgiveness for the one who said them, until he brings them before Allah, may He be glorified.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, recited:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">(To Him ascend the good words, and the righteous deeds exalt it).&#8221;</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that An-Nu`man bin Bashir, may Allah be pleased with him, said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>(Those who remember Allah and glory Allah by saying, `Glory be to Allah, Allah is most Great, all praise is due to Allah and La ilaha illallah, these words go around the Throne buzzing like bees, mentioning those who said them. Would one of you not like to have something with Allah mentioning him)&#8221;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was also recorded by Ibn Majah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(and the righteous deeds exalt it).</span> Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The good word is the remembrance of Allah, may He be exalted, which is taken up to Allah, and the righteous deed is the performance of obligatory duties. Whoever remembers Allah when doing an obligatory duty, his deed carries his remembrance of Allah and takes it up to Allah, may He be exalted. Whoever remembers Allah and does not perform the obligatory duties, his words will be rejected, as will his deed.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q: What is the ruling on some people who sway from right to left and backwards and forwards while reciting the Qur&#8217;an? Please advise, may Allah reward you.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Swaying while reciting the Qur&#8217;an is one of the habits that should be abandoned. It contradicts the etiquettes required when reciting the Qur&#8217;an. When reciting or listening to the Qur&#8217;an, a person should listen carefully and not play with things so that the listener and the reciter ponder over the meanings of the Qur&#8217;an and their hearts be submissive to Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Scholars mentioned that this is one of the habits of the Jews when reciting their Book, and we are forbidden to imitate them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From Anas <em>&#8211; RadhiAllaahu anhu &#8211;</em> who said: &#8216;A Bedouin came to the Prophet<em> &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> and said: &#8216;O Messenger of Allaah!  Teach me some goodness.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet <em> &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> took him by the hand and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8221; قل: سبحان الله، والحمد لله، ولا إله إلا الله، والله أكبر.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>‘Say: ‘Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu Akbar.)&#8217;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Bedouin counted them on his hand, when he finished he began to reflect then came back to the Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> smiled and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> &#8216;The desperate one has reflected.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Bedouin came and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;O Messenger of Allaah! ‘Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest.’  This is for Allaah, what is for me?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>اللهم اغفر لي وارحمني وعافني وارزقني واهدني</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8216;Say: O Allaah forgive me, and have mercy on me, and pardon me, and provide for me, and guide me.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8216;O Bedouin! If you say: <em>&#8216;SubhanAllah&#8217;</em>, Allaah says: &#8216;you have spoken the truth,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>If you say: <em>&#8216;Alhamdulillah&#8217;</em>, Allaah says: &#8216; you have spoken the truth, </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>If you say: <em>‘</em><em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em>, Allaah says: &#8216;you have spoken the truth,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>If you say: <em>Allaahu Akbar</em>, Allaah says: &#8216;you have spoken the truth, </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>If you say: O Allaah forgive me, Allaah says: I have done so,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>If you say: O Allaah have mercy on me, Allaah says: I have done so, </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>If you say: O Allaah give me provision, Allaah says: I have done so,</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Bedouin  counted it seven times on his fingers,  then went away.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Muhaddith al-Albaani</strong> <em>-Rahimullaah &#8211;</em> said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by al-Bayhaqi in &#8216;Shuab al-Eemaan&#8217;, and this <em>Isnaad</em> is <em>Jayyid</em> (good) its narrators are trustworthy as for al-Hasan bin Tawab; then I had become exhausted searching about him until I found who he was. So I performed a <em>Sajdah</em> to Allaah thankful for His success and I ask Him for an increase in His excellence.&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Case</strong>: During Menses, it is not unlawful to celebrate Allah&#8217;s Praises (Saying Takbeer, Tasbeeh, and Tahmeed),[29] saying Bismillah before acting upon something (eating, drinking, etc..), reading Hadeeth, Islamic discussions, invocation upon Allah (Dua&#8217;), and listening to the recitation of Qur&#8217;an.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been confirmed by &#8216;Aisha (radhi Allaahu anha) that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;lean on my lap and recite Qur&#8217;an while I was in menses&#8221;</span> (Al-Bukhari and Muslim).[30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also Umm &#8216;Atiyya reported that she heard the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) saying: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The Unmarried young virgins and the mature girl who stay often screened or the young unmarried virgins who often stayscreened and the menstruating women should come out and participate in the good deeds as well as the religious gathering of the faithful believers but the menstruating women should keep away from the Musalla (praying place).&#8221;</span> [31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Case</strong>: The reciting of the Qur&#8217;an by a menstruating woman either via direct looking or silently (in her heart) without the actual uttering by the tongue is permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The majority of the scholars are with the opinion that it is not prohibited for her to utter the Qur&#8217;anic recitation. Imam Bukhari, Ibn Jareer At- Tabaree and Ibn Al-Munthir, Imam Malik, and Imam Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee (in one of his earlier sayings) are with the opinion that it is permissible for her to recite the Ayah (verse in the Qur&#8217;an).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shayekul Islam Ibn Taymeeyah said: &#8220;Basically, there is no Sunnah to prevent her from reciting Qur&#8217;an. The &#8220;hadeeth&#8221; that: &#8220;A menstruating woman and the one who is in state of Jannabah [32] should not recite anything of the Qur&#8217;an&#8221;, is a weak hadeeth as agreed upon by the knowledgeable scholars of Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In fact women at the time of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to have their monthly cycles of menses.Had the recitation of Qur&#8217;an been prohibited for them (as it is the case with Salat) then the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) would have made it clear to his Ummah (Islamic community) and his wives would have known about it and they would have dissipated this knowledge to the people. Because no one had related a prohibition by the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) about this issue, then it cannot be made unlawful especially when it is known that he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not prohibit it at the time when menses was very much present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, recitation by the tongue is not Haram (legally unlawful).[33] This author said: &#8220;having known the dispute between the scholars about this matter, then it is more proper for the menstruating woman not to recite Qur&#8217;an by the tongue except when it is necessary e.g. if she is a teacher or if she is preparing for an exam.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[29] Takbeer: saying Allahu Akbar (Allah is The Greatest); Tasbeeh: saying Subhana Allah (Most Glorified is Allah); Tahmeed: saying Al Hamdulil&#8217;lah: All Praise is due to Allah.<br />
[30] Saheeh Al-Bukhari (Arabic-English) V.1, P.179, Hadeeth # 296.<br />
[31] Agreed upon Hadeeth. In Saheeh Al-Bukhari (Arabic- English), V. 1, P. 192, Hadeeth # 321.<br />
[32] Jannabah: Is the state in which a man (or a woman) has sexual discharge during sexual intercourse or in a dream, etc. In this state a Muslim is not allowed to pray or do other kinds of worships unless and until he (she) performs Ghusl (have a full shower) or do Tayammum if he/she cannot use water for any reason.<br />
[33] Ibin Taymeeyah in Al-Fatawa (religious decrees) V. 26, P. 191.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">عَنْ أَبِي ذَرٍّ رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ أَيْضًا، &#8220;أَنَّ نَاسًا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه و سلم قَالُوا لِلنَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه و سلم يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ ذَهَبَ أَهْلُ الدُّثُورِ بِالْأُجُورِ؛ يُصَلُّونَ كَمَا نُصَلِّي، وَيَصُومُونَ كَمَا نَصُومُ، وَيَتَصَدَّقُونَ بِفُضُولِ أَمْوَالِهِمْ. قَالَ: أَوَلَيْسَ قَدْ جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ مَا تَصَّدَّقُونَ؟ إنَّ بِكُلِّ تَسْبِيحَةٍ صَدَقَةً، وَكُلِّ تَكْبِيرَةٍ صَدَقَةً، وَكُلِّ تَحْمِيدَةٍ صَدَقَةً، وَكُلِّ تَهْلِيلَةٍ صَدَقَةً، وَأَمْرٌ بِمَعْرُوفٍ صَدَقَةٌ، وَنَهْيٌ عَنْ مُنْكَرٍ صَدَقَةٌ، وَفِي بُضْعِ أَحَدِكُمْ صَدَقَةٌ. قَالُوا: يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ أَيَأْتِي أَحَدُنَا شَهْوَتَهُ وَيَكُونُ لَهُ فِيهَا أَجْرٌ؟ قَالَ: أَرَأَيْتُمْ لَوْ وَضَعَهَا فِي حَرَامٍ أَكَانَ عَلَيْهِ وِزْرٌ؟ فَكَذَلِكَ إذَا وَضَعَهَا فِي الْحَلَالِ، كَانَ لَهُ أَجْرٌ&#8221;. </span><br />
[رَوَاهُ مُسْلِمٌ]</h3>
<p>Also on the authority of Abu Dharr (radi Allaahu anhu):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people from amongst the Companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to the Prophet ﷺ, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, the affluent have made off with the rewards; they pray as we pray, they fast as we fast, and they give [much] in charity by virtue of their wealth.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He ﷺ said, &#8220;Has not Allah made things for you to give in charity? Truly every <em>tasbeehah</em> [saying: <em>&#8216;subhan-Allah&#8217;</em>] is a charity, and every <em>takbeerah</em> [saying: &#8216;Allahu akbar&#8217;] is a charity, and every <em>tahmeedah</em> [saying: &#8216;<em>al-hamdu lillah</em>&#8216;] is a charity, and every <em>tahleelah</em> [saying: &#8216;<em>laa ilaha illAllah</em>&#8216;] is a charity. And commanding the good is a charity, and forbidding an evil is a charity, and in the <em>bud`i</em> [sexual act] of each one of you there is a charity.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, when one of us fulfills his carnal desire will he have some reward for that?&#8221; He ﷺ said, &#8220;Do you not see that if he were to act upon it [his desire] in an unlawful manner then he would be deserving of punishment? Likewise, if he were to act upon it in a lawful manner then he will be deserving of a reward.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">The Ruling of making <em>Dhikr</em> collectively in Unison according to the Imams of the Salaf</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Researched by Ahmad bin Muhammad an-Najjar </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[The scenario]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is collectively coming together to make <em>Dhikr</em> (remembrance of Allaah) in unison (one voice) whether that <em>Dhikr</em> is reciting the Qur’aan, or making <em>Dua’</em> or making<em>Tasbeeh</em> (saying: <em>SubhanAllaah</em>) etc. doing this without the aim of educating or learning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Its ruling According to the Imams of the Salaf ]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the Imams of the Salaf from the (<em>Sahabah</em>) Companions and those that followed them in goodness are all agreed upon the rejection of every innovation in the<em>Deen</em>, and rejecting every worship or form of worship which the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>did not do, nor what his noble Companions did not practice.  There are narrations from a group of the Companions and those who followed their way, concerning this form of making <em>Dhikr</em>, and here are their statements:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Umar bin al-Khattab </strong><em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><strong>]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Abu Uthmaan an-Nahdi who said: ‘A worker for Umar bin al-Khattab wrote to Umar saying that there are a group of people who gather together to make <em>Dua’</em> for the Muslims and the leader.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Umar <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> wrote to him: ‘Bring them to me with yourself.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man came and Umar said to the doorman, prepare the whip. When they entered upon Umar <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> he descended upon their leader by hitting him with the whip.’[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The rightly guided Khalifah Umar bin al-Khattab <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> rejected that a group gathered to make <em>Dhikr</em> in a form that the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>did not do, nor did the best of his Companions. To the extent Umar <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em>did not suffice by rejecting what they did by just speaking about it, rather he beat their leader with a whip, and this shows the great concern the Companions had in rejecting innovated <em>Bida’</em> in the <em>Deen</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From ‘Amr bin Salamah:  We were sitting by the door of Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood before lunch, so that if he came out, we could walk with him to the <em>Masjid</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Moosaa al-Ash’aree came and said: Has Abu Abdur-Rahmaan come out yet?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We said: No.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, he sat down with us, waiting for him to come out, and when he came out, we all gathered towards him, and Abu Moosaa said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O Abu Abdur-Rahmaan! Previously I saw something in the <em>Masjid</em>, which I disliked. But, <em>Alhamdulillaah</em>, what I saw, was nothing but good.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: What was it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Moosaa said, ‘If you live, you will see it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Abu Moosaa said, ‘I saw a group of people, sitting in circles waiting for the prayer.  In every circle there was a man and in their hands were small stones and he would say: ‘Say <em>Allaahu Akbar</em> 100 times’ and they would say ‘<em>Allaahu Akbar</em>’ 100 times.  Then, he would say, ‘Say <em>laa ilaha ilAllaah</em> 100 times’ and they would say ‘<em>laa ilaha ilAllaah</em>’ 100 times and he would say, ‘Say <em>SubhaanAllaah</em>’ 100 times and they would say ‘<em>SubhaanAllaah</em>’ 100 times.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood said, ‘So what did you say to them?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘I did not say anything to them, rather I waited for your opinion [or ‘I waited for your command’].’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘Why did you not command them to count their bad deeds [i.e. seek forgiveness from your deeds] and guarantee them that their good deeds would not be lost?!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he walked and we walked with him until he reached one of those circles and he stood there and said, ‘What is this that I see you doing?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘O Abu Abdur-Rahmaan! These are nothing but small stones with which we are counting, saying ‘<em>Allaahu Akbar</em>, <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> and <em>SubhaanAllaah</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, ‘Count your sins; I guarantee that you will not lose anything of your good deeds!  Beware, O <em>Ummah</em> of Muhammad!  How quick you are to your destruction!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here we are, the Companions of your Prophet – abundant, everywhere and here is his clothing which has not been [wasted away] and his utensils have not been broken. I swear by Him in Whose Hand is my soul, <strong>either you are an <em>Ummah</em> more rightly-guided than the <em>Ummah</em> of Muhammad or you are opening the door of misguidance.’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said; ‘We swear by Allaah, O Abu Abdur-Rahmaan, we did not intend anything but good.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘How many people intend good but never achieve it.  Verily the Messenger of Allaah – narrated to us, ‘Indeed there will be a people who read the Qur’aan but it does not pass beyond their throats.’  I swear by Allaah, I do not know. Perhaps most of them are from amongst you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he went away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Amr bin Salamah said, ‘We saw some of those sitting in those circles fighting on the Day of <em>Nahrawaan</em>, along with the Khawaarij.’<strong></strong><strong>[2]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Ibn Mas’ood <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> reprimanded a group who were gathered together in the form of circles, remembering Allaah, and Ibn Mas’ood used as an evidence against their misguidance in that they opposed that what the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> were upon, those who had witnessed the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, and they knew his statements, his actions, and his situations, which the Companions used to use to show their guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Abu Hanifah an-Nu’man]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Abu Hanifah <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘That raising the voice in making <em>Takbeer</em> (saying <em>Allaahu Akbar</em>) is principally a <em>Bida’</em>, because it is <em>Dhikr</em>, and the Sunnah regarding <em>Dhikr</em> is with lowering the voice.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Malik bin Anas]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn Wahab who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I said to Malik <em>-Rahimullaah-</em>: ‘What would you say if you saw a group of people gathering together and all of them together reading one <em>Soorah</em> till the end of the<em>Soorah</em>?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Malik rejected that and found fault with that and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This is not how the people used to do this, rather one man used to recite to another person for learning purposes.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Wahab also said in ‘Taj wal-Ikleel li Mukhtasir Khaleel’:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Malik disliked that recitors gather together reciting one <em>Soorah</em>, and he said: ‘this was not from the practice of the people,’ and he regarded it as a <em>Bida’</em>.[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Yahya bin Ma’een &amp; Ahmad bin Hanbal]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Fadl bin Mihraan said: ‘I asked Yahya bin Ma’een and Ahmad bin Hanbal: ‘Indeed we have a group of people who get together and make <em>Dua’</em>, recite Qur’aan (collectively) and remember Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> together, how do you view these people?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Yahya bin Ma’een he said: ‘They should read from the <em>Mus’haf</em> (Qur’aan), and make <em>Dua’</em> after the prayer and remember Allaah individually to themselves.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Fadl bin Muhammad said: ‘I said: ‘I have a brother who takes part with them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahya said: ‘Forbid him from that.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: ‘He does not accept.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahya said: ‘Admonish him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: ‘He does not accept. Should I boycott him?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘Yes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I came to Ahmad and told him similar to what I had said to Yahya and Ahmad also said to me:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘They should read from the <em>Mus’haf</em>, and remember Allaah Ta’ala individually and seek the hadeeth of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: ‘Should I forbid my brother?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad said: ‘Yes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: ‘And if he does not accept.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad said: ‘Of course he will <em>InshAllaah</em>, since indeed this is an innovation, this type of gathering which you describe.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: ‘and if he does not accept should I boycott him?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad smiled and remained silent.’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If an opponent contests what has preceded and says, there are <em>Sharia’</em> texts which indicate to the excellence of gathering for <em>Dhikr</em>, and this is what is established in Saheeh Muslim from Abu Hurairah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> who said: ‘Indeed Allaah <em>–Tabaraka wa Ta’ala –</em> has  noble Angels who travel around, they search for gatherings of <em>Dhikr</em>, and if they find gatherings where there is <em>Dhikr</em> they sit with those people and they encompass each other with their wings, until they fill that which is between them and the heavens of the <em>Dunyaa</em>, then when they leave they ascend and climb to the heavens.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah <em>– Azza wa Jal-</em> asks them – while He knows more about them than they do -: ‘From where did you come?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They will reply:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘We came from worshippers of Yours on the earth, and they were saying:<em>SubhaanAllaah</em> (Far is Allaah from imperfection), <em>Allaahu Akbar</em> (Allaah is the Greatest), <em>laa ilaaha illAllaah</em> (there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah) and <em>Alhamdulillaah</em> (Praise be to Allaah) and they were asking of You. . . .’[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there are other similar evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reply to this objection is from different points:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- The wording ‘<em>Dhikr’</em> and ‘<em>Tasbeeh’</em> is mentioned in the texts (Book &amp; Sunnah) unrestrictedly. For an unrestricted wording in the <em>Sharia’</em> it is not allowed to limit it to a particular number or amount, or to a particular form, except if there is a text from the<em>Sharia’</em> present regarding it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <em>Dhikr</em> in a collective form with voices in unison, then this has not been mentioned in the Book of Allaah nor in the Sunnah of His Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, what is mentioned in the texts, with the encouragement to perform <em>Dhikr</em> in a plural form does not indicate in itself to making <em>Dhikr</em> collectively, because it is an unrestricted wording, and an unrestricted wording cannot be limited except with a<em>Sharia’</em> evidence, and there is no proof to restrict making <em>Dhikr</em> in unison in this issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- That the Companions did not understand this form of <em>Dhikr</em> from these texts of the<em>Sharia’</em>, rather they rejected this form, and they dispraised the one who did this form of <em>Dhikr</em>.  They regarded this from the innovated matters in the <em>Deen</em>, as has preceded in the story of Umar and Ibn Mas’ood, and the understanding of the Companions of the texts of the two revealed sources (the Book &amp; the Sunnah) precedes the understanding of other than them.  Rather it is an obligation to follow their understanding, and it is not allowed to abstain from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- That the Imams also rejected what the Companions rejected as has been mentioned from Abu Hanifah, Malik, Ahmad bin Hanbal and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates that they are united upon rejecting and criticizing this form of <em>Dhikr</em>, and along with that I will add two more statements of two Imams from the Maliki <em>Madhab</em>, and they are Qurtubi and Tartooshi.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul-Abbas Ahmad al-Qurtubi said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for the saying of the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘No people gather together in one of the houses of Allah, reciting the Book of Allah and studying it among themselves, without tranquility descending upon them, mercy enveloping them, the angels surrounding them, and Allah making mention of them amongst those who are with Him.’[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The houses of Allaah are the <em>Masajid</em>, as Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; In houses (<em>Masajid</em>), which Allah has ordered to be raised, in them His Name is glorified in the mornings and in the afternoons or the evenings&gt;&gt;[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who hold it permissible to read the Qur’aan in congregation in unison (one voice) adhere to this hadeeth, as is done here in Morocco.  Some of our scholars have disliked that, and held the opinion that it is a Bida’, since it was not the way of the Salaf in reciting like this.  But rather the hadeeth is understood to be that every individual studies the Book of Allaah by them self, or with someone who will correct them.’[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tartooshi said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘These <em>Aathaar</em> (narrations) necessitate the permissibility of congregating to recite the noble Qur’aan with the intent of studying it, learning it, and revising it. That takes place by a student reading it to a teacher, or a teacher reading it to a student. And if two people have an equal level of knowledge then one of them reads to the other for revision and studying purposes, this is how teaching and learning occur, without having to recite in congregation.’[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concluding, I bring attention to an issue: which is that being continuous upon gathering for the <em>Dhikr</em> of Allaah – even if it does not include doing so in unison – has not been legislated, because there is no text from the Qur’aan nor from the Sunnah being continuous in gathering in this way. Likewise, being continuous upon this type of congregation resembles the congregations which are permissible, like the five daily prayers, the <em>Juma’</em> prayer, the two <em>Eid</em>, and the <em>Hajj</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, there is a distinction between what is taken as Sunnah and custom, and these gatherings, which resemble legislated ones, and between that which is done sometimes, since this is permitted, and this is the guidance of the Companions of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, as they would sometimes gather together.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Imam Ibn Taymeeyah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Gathering for optional prayers, or to listen to Qur’aan, or for the <em>Dhikr</em> of Allaah, etc. if that is done sometimes then it is better since it has been authentically reported from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> that he prayed an optional prayer in congregation sometimes. Likewise, he went out to his Companions and there would be amongst them one who would recite and the others would listen, and the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> would sit with them to listen. And the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> would, if they gathered order one of them to recite while they would listen. . . . .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for taking gatherings successively repeating them, repeatedly and regularly over weeks, months and years, other than gatherings which have been legislated. Then these type gatherings which resemble gatherings for the five daily prayers, the <em>Juma’</em>prayer, the two <em>Eid</em>, and the <em>Hajj</em>, that is because those other gatherings are innovated and newly invented. Therefore, there is a difference between what is taken as a Sunnah and what is taken as a habit and that which resembles what is legislated, and this difference has been mentioned by Imam Ahmad and others from the Imams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr al-Khalaal narrated in ‘the book of manners’ from Ishaq bin Mansoor al-Kosaj that he said to Abu Abdullaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It is disliked that a people gather to make <em>Dua’</em> to Allaah and to raise their hands to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad said: ‘I do not reject for brothers, if they should unintentionally gather except that they should not do it a lot.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ishaq bin Rahawayeeyah said the same as what Imam Ahmad said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the wording: ‘not do it a lot’ means not to take it as a habit so much that it is done a lot, and this is the speech of Ishaaq.’[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymeeyah also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Gathering upon reading, <em>Dhikr</em> and <em>Dua’</em> is good and recommended as long as it is not taken as a regular habit – just like those gatherings which are legislated – and that there is no evil <em>Bida’</em> connected to it.’[13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaatabi al-Maliki said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Constantly making <em>Dua’</em> in a form of a congregation was not from the actions of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, as it was not from the statements of the Messenger, nor was it from that which he allowed.’[14]</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>‘Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest,’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">By AbdurRazaaq bin AbdulMuhsin al-Badr<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<hr />
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 01</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AbdurRazaaq bin AbdulMuhsin al-Badr said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Indeed the best speech and the most excellent remembrance after the Noble Qur’aan is four statements</strong>. They have an exceptional value, they consist of a great matter and have a high status in the <em>Deen</em> of Allaah, and they are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest,’ (Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu akbar).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many texts, which show the excellence of these four statements that emphasize this great matter, and the value of these statements and the resulting great reward when establishing them and their noble excellence and their continuous benefits in the <em>Dunyaa</em> and the Hereafter. We will attempt to present some of the excellence of these statements from some of the texts, which mention these benefits.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- So from the excellence of these words is that they are the most beloved speech to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Muslim collected in his book from the hadeeth of Sumrah bin Jundab <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘The most beloved speech to Allaah consists of four, there is no harm with which one you begin, <em>Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu akbar</em>.’</strong></span>[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And collected by Tayyalisi in his ‘Musnad’ with the wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There are four statements that are the most beloved speech to Allaah, and they are in the Qur’aan, there is no harm which one you begin with: <em>Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu Akbar</em>.</strong></span>’[2]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- From their excellence is that the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> informed us that they are more beloved to him than what the sun rose upon (i.e. from the <em>Dunyaa </em>and what is in it,)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim collected in his book ‘<em>Saheeh</em>’ from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah who said: the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Indeed that I say: ‘Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest,’ (<em>Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu akbar</em>) is more beloved to me than what the sun rose upon</strong></span>.’ [3]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – From their excellence is, what is mentioned in ‘<em>Musnad</em>’ of Imam Ahmad and ‘<em>Shu’ab al-Eeman</em>’ by Bayhaqi with a good <em>Isnaad</em> from Assim bin Bahdalah from Abu Salih from Umm Hani bint Abu Talib who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Messenger of Allaah walked past me so I said: ‘Indeed I have become old and weak – or something similar to this – then he ordered me with an action which I should do while I am sitting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Say <em>Subhana Allaah</em> one hundred times, indeed it is equivalent to freeing one hundred slaves from the offspring of Isma’eel. And</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Say <em>Alhamdulillaah</em> one hundred times, it is the equivalent to one hundred horses saddled with reins ready to carry a person in the path of Allaah. And</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Say <em>Allaahu akbar</em> one hundred times, since it is the equivalent to one hundred camels slaughtered for the sake of Allaah. And</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Say <em>La illaah ila Allaah</em> one hundred times, </strong></span>Ibn Khalf (the narrator from Aasim) said: I think he said<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>: it fills what is between the heavens and the earth and on that day no one will have an action raised except the one who came with the like of it.’</strong></span> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Mundhari said: Ahmad collected it with a <em>Hasan</em> <em>Isnad </em>[5] and the ‘allaama al-Albaani declared its <em>Isnad</em> <em>Hasan</em>.[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reflect upon this great reward, which is a result of these words. So whoever says <em>Subhana Allaah</em> hundred times then it is the equivalent to freeing a hundred slaves from the sons of Isma’eel, the offspring of Isma’eel was mentioned specifically because they are the noblest of the Arabs in lineage.  Whoever says <em>Alhamdulillaah</em> a hundred times then he will have the reward as the one who gave charity of one hundred horses saddled and reined ready to carry the <em>Mujahideen</em> in the path of Allaah. Whoever says <em>Allaahu Akbar</em> a hundred times then he will have the reward as the one who spends camels slaughtered for the sake of Allaah. Whoever said <em>laa illaah ila Allaah</em> a hundred times then it fills what is between the heavens and the earth and no one’s action is raised except if one comes with what was mentioned.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- From the excellence of the status of these words, is that they are an expiation for sins. It is mentioned in ‘<em>al-Musnad</em>’, ‘Sunnan Tirmidhi’ and ‘Mustadrak al-Hakim’ from the hadeeth of Abdullaah bin ‘Amr bin al-‘Aaas <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211; </em>who said the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘There is no person on earth who says: ‘<em>laa illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu akbar, wa Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, La hawla wa la quwwata illa billaa</em>, (There is no capability nor is there any power except with Allaah) except that his sins are expiated even if they were more than the foam on the sea.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tirmidhi declared it to be <em>Hasan</em>, and al-Hakim authenticated it and Dhahabi agreed with him and al-Albaani declared it to be <em>Hasan</em>.[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the meaning ‘expiation of sins’ here it means minor sins, as is mentioned in Saheeh Muslim from Abu Hurairah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211; </em>that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘The five daily prayers, from one <em>Juma’</em> till the next <em>Juma’</em>, from one <em>Ramadhan</em> till the next <em>Ramadhan</em> is an expiation for what takes place between them as long as the major sins are kept away from.’</strong></span> [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore expiation of sins has been limited to keeping away from the major sins; because a major sin can only be expiated by repentance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also there is a hadeeth that has been collected with the same meaning by Tirmidhi and other than him from Anas bin Malik <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> walked passed a tree which had dry leaves and he hit that tree with his stick and the leaves began to fall, the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Indeed <em>al-Hamdu lillaahi, wa Subhana Allaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu akbar, </em>cause the sins of a slave of Allaah to fall just like the leaves of this tree are falling.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Declared <em>Hasan</em> by al-Albaani.[9]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">5- From the excellence of these words is that they are plants of Paradise, Tirmidhi collected from Abdullaah bin Mas’ood, from the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I met the Prophet Ibrahim on the night when I was taken on the night journey, and Ibrahim said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>O Muhammad convey my <em>Salam</em> to your <em>Ummah</em>, and inform them that Paradise has very fine soil, sweet water. That it has lowland and its plants are:  </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘<em>Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu akbar</em>’ </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest)’</strong></span> [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the <em>Isnaad</em> of this hadeeth is AbdurRahman bin Ishaaq, however the hadeeth has two supporting narrations which strengthen this narration from the hadeeth of Abu ‘Ayyoub al-Ansari and from the hadeeth of Abdullaah bin Umar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning is that plants in Paradise grow quickly due to these statements, just like the plants that are planted on lowland and the growth of its plants is fast.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 – From its excellence is that there is none better according to Allaah than a believer who lives his life in Islaam and says ‘Allaahu akbar, Subhana Allaahi, la illaah ila Allaah, and al-Hamdu lillaahi,’ a lot.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is collected by Imam Ahmad and by Nisa’ee in ‘Amal al-Yawm wa Laylah’ with a Hasan Isnaad from Abdullaah bin Shaddad: is that a group of three people from the tribe of Udhraah came to the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and accepted Islaam and Abdullaah said that the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Who will look after them?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Talha said: ‘I will.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullaah said: ‘They stayed with Talha and the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>sent out a delegation and one of them went in it and was martyred.  Abdullaah said: then the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> sent another a delegation and another person went with them and was martyred.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullaah continued: then the third person died on his bed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Talha said: ‘I saw these three people who stayed with me [in a dream] they were in Paradise, and I saw the one who died on his bed in front of them, and I saw the one who was martyred last after him and I saw the one who was martyred last behind them.  Talha said: I came to the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and I mentioned this to him, and the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Why did you not stop them from going with the delegation, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>there is none better according to Allaah from a believer who lives his life in Islaam and says ‘<em>Allaahu akbar, Subhana Allaahi, la illaah ila Allaah, and al-Hamdu lillaahi</em>,’ a lot.’</strong></span>[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This great hadeeth shows the great excellence of the one who has a long life and his actions are good, and his tongue continues to be moist with the <em>Dhikr</em> of Allaah – Azza wa Jal, and success is from Allaah Alone.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Previously, we covered a number of virtues of these four statements: they are the best speech after the Qur’aan, they are ‘Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest,’ (<em>Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu Akbar</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here we will continue with another number of benefits from these statements from the Ahadeeth of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> which mention these statements:</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">7- From their excellence is that Allaah chose these statements and chose them for His slave, and Allaah has set aside for the one who remembers Allaah saying them, with great and abundant reward.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the ‘<em>Musnad</em>’ of Imam Ahmad and ‘Mustadrak’ of al-Hakim with an authentic <em>Isnaad </em>from the hadeeth of Abu Huraira and Abu Sa’eed <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhumma</em>: that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Indeed Allaah chose four statements: ‘Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest,’ (<em>Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu Akbar</em>). So whoever says ‘<em>Subhana Allaah</em>,’ twenty good deeds are written for him, and twenty bad deeds are taken away.  Whoever says ‘<em>Allaahu akbar</em>’ then he gets likewise. Whoever says ‘<em>La illaah ila Allaah</em>,’ then he gets likewise.  Whoever says ‘<em>Alhamdulillaahi Rabbil Al-Ameen</em>’ from his own self then thirty good deeds are written for him and thirty sins are cancelled from him.’</strong> </span>[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reward for the slave of Allaah saying <em>al-Hamd</em> (Praise) is increased more than the other four, when he says it from his own self; this is because <em>al-Hamd</em> does not generally occur except after a reason for saying it, like eating or drinking, or the occurrence of a blessing, so it is as if the <em>al-Hamd</em> occurs due to something in return, for that which has been rendered to the slave of Allaah at the time of saying <em>al-Hamd</em>, so if the slave of Allaah mentions <em>al-Hamd</em> from his own self without any pushing factor to do so, nor for a new blessing (which Allaah has given him) then his reward is increased.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">8- From their virtues is: that they are a protection from the Hell-Fire for the one who says them and they will come as a savior on the Day of Judgement for the one who says them and they will precede him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hakim collected in ‘al-Mustadrak’ and Nisa’ee in ‘Amal al-Yawm wa Layla’ and others from Abu Hurairah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said that Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Take your protection.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah against an enemy that has arrived?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘No, but your protection from the Hell-Fire, say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> ‘Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest,’ (<em>Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu Akbar</em>) since indeed they will come on the Day of Judgement as saviours and preceding good actions and they are the lasting good deeds of the righteous.’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hakim said: ‘This hadeeth is <em>Saheeh</em> upon conditions of Muslim and they did not collect it. Dhahabi agreed with al-Hakim. And it was authenticated by the <em>‘allaama</em> al-Albaani <em>-Rahimullaah</em>.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth includes an addition to the Ahadeeth which have preceded which is describing these statements that they are the lasting good deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَالْبَاقِيَاتُ الصَّالِحَاتُ خَيْرٌ عِندَ رَبِّكَ ثَوَابًا وَخَيْرٌ أَمَلًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong> But the enduring good deeds are better to your Lord for reward and better for </strong>[one’s] <strong>hope.</strong> </span>&gt;&gt; [18:46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The lasting good deeds are those deeds due to which their reward remains, and is continuous, and this is the best at what a slave of Allaah can expect and hope for and expect the best reward.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">9 – And from its benefits is: that they make a curve around the <em>‘Arsh</em> of ar-Rahman and they have a buzzing sound like the buzzing of the bee, by which they mention /remember the one who said them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the ‘Musnad’ of Imam Ahmad and Sunnan Ibn Majah and ‘al-Mustadrak’ by al-Hakim from Nu’man bin Basheer <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said: the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Indeed what you remember/mention from the magnificence of Allaah is saying <em>Subhana Allaah, Allaahu Akbar, la illaah ila Allaah</em> and <em>Alhamdulillaah</em>, it curves around the ‘<em>Arsh</em>, they have a buzzing sound like the buzz of the bee, which (mention/remember) its (companion/the one) who says it. Does not one of you want that, or wish that someone still remembers you by it.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Busseeri said in: ‘Zawaid Sunnan Ibn Majah: ‘Its <em>Isnaad</em> is <em>Saheeh</em>, its narrators of trustworthy, and it was authenticated by al-Hakim.[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the benefit of this hadeeth is this great virtue, which is that these four statements curve around the  ‘<em>Arsh</em>, i.e. that they go around it, they have a buzzing sound like the buzz of the bee, i.e. a sound which is similar to the sound of the bee and in doing so it remembers the person who said them, and those words are the greatest encouragement for <em>Dhikr</em> with these statements, this is why the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said in this hadeeth: ‘Does not one of you want that, or wish that someone still remembers you by it.’</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">10 – From their excellence: that the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> mentioned that they are heavy on the scales.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nisa’ee narrated in ‘Amal al-Yawm wa Layla’ and Ibn Hibban in his book called ‘Saheeh’ and al-Haakim and other than them from Abu Salma <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘<em>Bakhin Bakhin</em> – and pointed with his five fingers – how heavy they are on the scale: ‘Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest,’ (<em>Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu Akbar</em>) and a righteous son that dies and his father is a Muslim and he benefits by him.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haakim authenticated it and Dhahabi agreed[4] and the hadeeth has a support from the hadeeth of Thawbaan <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em>, and al-Bazzar collected it in his ‘Musnad’ and said its <em>Isnaad</em> was <em>Hasan</em>. [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying in the hadeeth: ‘<em>Bakhin Bakhin</em>’ this is a word, which is said when, being amazed by something and explaining its excellence.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">11- From the excellence of these words is that for the slave of Allaah they are <em>Sadaqah </em>(giving charity) when he says each one of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is collected by Muslim in his ‘Saheeh’ from Abu Dharr <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em>: Some of the companions of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O Messenger of Allaah, the affluent have made off with the rewards, they pray as we pray they fast as we fast, and they give away in charity the extra of their wealth.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Has not Allah made things for you to give away in charity? </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Every <em>Tasbihah</em> (saying: <em>Subhana Allaah</em>) is a charity, every <em>Takbirah </em>(saying: <em>Allaahu Akbar</em>) is a charity, every <em>Tahmidah</em> (saying: <em>al-Hamdu lillaah</em>) is a charity, and every <em>Tahlilah</em> (saying: <em>la illaah ila Allaah</em>) is a charity, to enjoin a good action is a charity, to forbid an evil action is a charity, and in having relations with your wife is a charity.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, when one of us fulfils his desire (with his wife) will he have some reward for that?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Do you not think that if he were to act upon it unlawfully he would be sinning? Likewise, if he has acted upon it lawfully he will have a reward.’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The poor people thought that there was no <em>Sadaqah</em> except by giving money, and they were incapable of doing that, so the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> informed them that all types of good actions and being good is <em>Sadaqah</em>, and the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> mentioned that at the head of good actions are these four statements ‘Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest,’ (<em>Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu Akbar</em>).</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">12 – From the excellence of these statements is that the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> made these statements in place of the Noble Qur’aan for the one who truly cannot read it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Abu Dawood, Nisa’aee, Daraqutni and other than them from Ibn Abee Awfa <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said: ‘A man came to the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah indeed I cannot learn the Qur’aan, so teach me something that will give me a reward.’ He <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Say: ‘Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest, There is no capability nor is there any power except with Allaah.’ (<em>Subhana Allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu Akbar wa La hawla wa la quwwata illa billaa</em>.)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Bedouin said: ‘like this – and he closed his hand – and said: This is for Allaah, what is for me?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">اللهم اغفر لي وارحمني وعافني وارزقني واهدني</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Say: O Allaah forgive me, and have mercy on me, and pardon me, and provide for me, and guide me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Bedouin took them [this supplication] and closed the palm of his hand. The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for this person then he has filled his two hands with goodness.’[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Muhaddith</em> Abu Tayyib al-Atheem ‘Abbadi said in his comments on Sunnan Daraqutni its Isnad is Saheeh and Albaani <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said its <em>Sanad</em> is <em>Hasan</em>.[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are some of the virtues mentioned in the Prophetic Sunnah regarding these four statements.  There are specific virtues for every one of these statements. Whoever reflects upon these preceding virtues finds that they are very great, and show the great status of these statements and their lofty status and their many benefits and their advantages upon the believer, the slave of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps the secret to this great excellence – and Allaah knows best – is what has been mentioned by some of the people of knowledge, which is that the Names of Allaah –Tabaraka wa Ta’ala – are all incorporated in these four statements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">As for what is embodied in ‘<em>Subhana Allaah</em>’ is the Name of Allaah which show purity like <em>al-Qudoos </em>(The Holy) and <em>as-Salaam</em> (The Source of Peace).</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">As for ‘<em>Alhamdulillaah</em>’ then it is comprises and affirms the different types of perfection for Allaah –<em>Tabaraka</em> – in His Names and His Attributes.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">As for ‘<em>Allaahu Akbar</em>’ then it contains the Magnificence of Allaah and regarding Him as Great, and that none can enumerate praise upon Him, so whoever this possesses, then, He is the One Who is worthy of worship, which means that there is none worthy of worship except Him.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I swear by Allaah, look how great these statements are, and how magnificent their matter is, and how great is the result of the good for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah that He gives us the capability to observe these statements and to be continuous upon them, and makes us from its people, those whose tongues are moist with remembering them, indeed Allaah is The Protector of that and He is The Capable One.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth ad-Daeefah’ 1/83</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">A summary of the research by the Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ Muhammad Nasiruddeen al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani said in ‘Silsilah ad-Da’eefah’:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">83 – ‘What a blessed reminder are prayer beads and indeed the best place to prostrate on is the earth and on that which the earth produces.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Mawdoo</em></strong><strong> (Fabricated)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by ad-Daylamee in ‘Musnad al-Firdaws’ (4/98); he said that Abdoos bin Abdullaah informed us that Abu Abdullaah al-Hussain bin Funjoowayah a-Thaqafi informed us that ‘Ali bin Muhammad bin Nassrooweeyah narrated to us that <strong>Muhammad bin Haroon bin Isa bin Mansoor al-Hashami</strong> narrated to us that Muhammad bin ‘Ali bin Hamzah al-‘Alawee narrated to me that Abdul Samad bin Musa narrated to me that Zainab bint Sulayman bin ‘Ali narrated to me that Umm al-Hasan bint Jafar bin al-Hasan on the authority of her father on the authority of her grandfather on the authority of ‘Ali <em>marfoo’</em> (ascribed to the Messenger of Allaah &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Research of the Isnad]</strong>[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Suyooti mentioned it in his book ‘al-Manha fee as-Subha’ (2/141) and Shawkani conveyed it from him in ‘Nail-Awtaar’ (2/166-167) and they remained quiet about this narration!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say (Albaani): This chain has darkness upon darkness; the majority of the narrators are <em>Majhool</em> (unknown) and some of them have been blamed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I did not find anyone who wrote a biography for Umm al-Hasan bint Jafar bin al-Hasan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Khateeb wrote a biography for Zainab bint Sulayman bin ‘Ali in his ‘Tareekh’ (14/334) and he said: ‘She was of the best of women.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Khateeb wrote a biography for Abdul Samad bin Musa, he is al-Hashmi, (14/41) but he did not mention anything about him eitherpraising or criticizing him. However, Dhahabi conveyed in ‘al-Meezan’ on the authority of al-Khateeb that he said regarding him: ‘Indeed they regarded him as weak <em>(Da’eef)</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps that was in some of al-Khateeb’s other books, then I corrected that and said: Rather that is in another hadeeth which will be mentioned with no. 2898.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Dhahabi said: ‘He narrates rejected narrations on the authority of his grandfather Muhammad bin Ibraheem al-Imaam’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say (Albaani): Perhaps he is the point of objection in this hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Muhammad bin ‘Ali bin Hamza al-‘Alawee then al-Khateeb also wrote a biography for him (3/63) and said: ‘Ibn Abee Haatim said: I heard from him and he is <em>Sadooq</em> (truthful) who died in the year 286.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad bin Haroon, he is Muhammad bin Haroon bin al-Abbas bin Abee Jafar al-Mansoor, and al-Khateeb also mentioned him (3/356) saying: ‘He was from the people who had intelligence, had excellence and was a lecturer. He held the post of an Imaam of the masjid al-Madina in Baghdad for 50 years and he died in the year 308.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Abdullaah bin al-Hussain bin Funjoowayah at-Thaqafi then he is Thiqaah (trustworthy), his biography is in ‘Siyaar alaam an-Nubala’ (17/383) and ‘Shadhrat ad-Dhaab’ (3/200).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise with Abdoos bin Abdullaah, his biography is in ‘Siyaar alaam an-Nubala’ (19/98) and in ‘Lisaan al-Meezan’ (4/95).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[The Explanation]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From what has preceded it becomes clear to you that the <em>Isnaad</em>(chain) is <em>Da’eef</em> (weak), so it cannot be used as evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now, in my opinion, this hadeeth is <em>Baatil</em> (false) due to its meaning for the following reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Firstly: that prayer beads are a <em>Bida’</em> which were not present at the time of the Prophet &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> and were innovated after the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>[2], so how could it make sensethat the Messenger &#8211;<em> alayhi asallam-</em> would encourage his Companions ina matter they did not know?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The evidence for this is what Ibn Waddah al-Qurtubi mentioned in ‘al-Bida’ wal-Nahee anhaa’ (p.12) on the authority of Saltt bin Bahraam who said: ‘Ibn Mas’ood passed by a woman who had a<em>Tasbeeh</em> (prayer beads) and would count upon them, so he broke it and threw it away. Then he passed by a man who was counting upon pebbles, so he kicked him with his leg. Then he said: You have preceded the Prophet! You have carried out an oppressive <em>Bida’</em>! You have preceded the Companions of Muhammad &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> in knowledge!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The chain up to Saltt is Saheeh, he is <em>Thiqaah</em> (trustworthy) from the<em>Atbaa’ at-Tabi’een</em> (followers of the successors of the Companions), so its chain is broken.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then it was narrated on the authority of Abaan bin Abee ‘Ayaash who said: I asked al-Hasan about a <em>Nathaam</em> (a thread with pearls etc. arranged upon it) made from pearls and date stones etc, is<em>Tasbeeh</em> counted upon it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he said: None of the women of the Prophet &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>or the female emigrants did this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, its chain is very weak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Secondly: that prayer beads oppose the guidance of the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>: Abdullaah bin ‘Amr said: ‘I saw the Messenger of Allaah &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> counting the <em>Tasbeeh</em> with his right hand.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Abu Dawood (1/235), Tirmidhi (4/255) who graded it hasan, Ibn Hibban (2334), Hakim (1/547), Bayhaqi (2/253) and its chain is <em>Saheeh</em> just as Dhahabi said. I researched it in ‘Saheeh Abu Dawood’ (1346).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[The Command of the Messenger]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then prayer beads oppose the command of the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>, when he said to some women:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘You should make <em>Tasbeeh</em>[3], <em>Tahleel</em>[4], <em>Taqdees</em>[5] and do not be negligent and forget Tawheed (and in a narration: mercy), <strong>and count them on your </strong>fingertips since they will be questioned and will respond.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth is <em>Hasan</em>, narrated by Abu Dawood and other than him, Hakim and Dhahabi authenticated it and an-Nawawi and al-Asqalani graded it as <em>Hasan</em> as is mentioned in ‘Amali al-Adhkaar’ (1/84) and it has supporting evidence on the authority of ‘Aeysha which is <em>Mawqoof</em> (the Isnad only goes back to the Companion), see ‘Saheeh Abu Dawood’ (1345).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why a group of scholars have made the hadeeth ‘What a blessed reminder are prayer beads…..’ <em>Da’eef</em>; as is mentioned by Shaykh Muhammad Khaleel al-Qawooqjee in ‘Shawaariq al-Anwaar al-Jaleela’ (1/113).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Here the Shaykh mentions technical information related to the <em>Isnad</em>of the hadeeth]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[He continues:]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It may be said: Some of the Ahadeeth mention performing <em>Tasbeeh</em>with pebbles and the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> approved of it, therefore there is no difference between this and <em>Tasbeeh</em> using prayer beads, as Shawkani said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say (Albaani): Perhaps this would be acceptable if the Ahadeeth regarding this were authentic, however this is not the case. Most of what is narrated regarding this are two Ahadeeth which Suyooti brings in his booklet as we indicated, so it is necessary to mention them and explain their mistakes:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Firstly on the authority of Sa’ad bin Abi Waqqas that he and the Messenger of Allaah &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> entered upon a woman while she was counting <em>Tasbeeh</em> on date stones or pebbles in front of her and the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said: ‘Shall I inform youof that which is easier upon you than this or better?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘<em>SubhanAllaah</em> equivalent to the number of what Allaah created in the heavens….’ the hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Abu Dawood (1/235), Tirmidhi (4/277-278), Ibn Hibban 92330 – in his book ‘Zawaid’, Doorqi in ‘Musnad Sa’ad’ (130/1), Mukhalas in ‘al-Fawaid’ (9/17/2), and Hakim (1/547-548)[6] by way of ‘Amroo bin al-Harith that Sa’eed bin Abi Halaal narrated to him on the authority of Khuzaimah on the authority of ‘Aeysha bint Sa’ad bin Abi Waqqas on the authority of her father.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tirmidhi said: ‘Hadeeth <em>Hasan</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hakim said: ‘<em>Saheeh al-Isnad</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dhahabi agreed with him, however he was mistaken because this Khuzaimah is <em>Majhool</em> (unknown) even Dhahabi himself said in ‘al-Meezan’: ‘Khuzaimah is unknown and so is Sa’eed bin Abi Halaal.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hafidh said likewise in ‘Taqreeb’: ‘Indeed he is unknown.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even with Sa’eed bin Abi Halaal being Thiqaah, as-Saajee mentioned on the authority of Ahmad that he became confused and Yahya also described him as confused as in ‘al-Fasal’ by Ibn Hazm (2/95).Perhaps what supports this argument is his narrating this hadeeth, because some of the trustworthy narrators who narrated from Sa’eed do not mention Khuzaimah in their chain, so the chain becomesbroken. This is why Hafidh al-Mizee did not mention ‘Aeysha bint Sa’ad amongst the shuyookh (those who were narrated from) of Ibn Abi Halaal, so this <em>Isnad</em> is not without the defects of <em>Jahaala</em> (a narrator being unknown) or <em>Inqitaa’</em> (a break in the chain), so how can this hadeeth be Saheeh or Hasan?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of those who authored works claiming Prayer Beads are from the Sunnah were ignorant of this information or they pretended to be ignorant of it such as those of the present day who follow their desires and blindly follow their Shaykh Abdullaah al-Ghamaari who likewise pretended to be ignorant of this truth. He mentioned this hadeeth in his ‘Kanz’ (103) so that he could make the Prayer Beads permissible for his <em>Mureeds</em> (loyal followers) consequently making it permissible for them to wear them around their necks just as some of the <em>Mushayikh</em> (shaykhs) of the Soofi orders wear them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">See the refutation against him in the introduction to volume three of this ‘Silsilah’ (p.37) and you will see the strangest of the strange.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second hadeeth is on the authority of Safeeyah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Messenger of Allaah &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> entered upon me while I had 4,000 date stones in front of me and I would count<em>Tasbeeh</em> upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘O daughter of Huyaiya what is this?!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She answered: ‘I am counting <em>Tasbeeh</em> upon them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘I have said more <em>Tasbeeh</em> than this while I have been standing here near you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She requested: ‘Teach me O Messenger of Allaah!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘Say <em>SubhanAllaah</em> equivalent to the number of what Allaah created of things….’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Tirmidhi (4/274), Abu Bakr ash-Shafi’ee in ‘al-Fawaaid’ (73/255/1), Haakim (1/547) by way of Hashim bin Sa’eed on the authority of Kanana Maula (the freed slave of<strong>)</strong> Safeeyah, from her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tirmidhi regarded it as weak by saying: ‘This hadeeth is <em>Ghareeb</em>(strange), we do not know it except from this route of the hadeeth of Hashim bin Sa’eed al-Koofee and his <em>Isnaad</em> is not well-known.Also, there is a hadeeth on this issue on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Hakim then he said: ‘<em>Saheeh al-Isnaad</em>’ and Dhahabi[7] agreed with him and this is strange coming from him, since he mentioned this Hashim bin Sa’eed in ‘al-Meezan’ and said: ‘Ibn Ma’een said: He is nothing. Ibn ‘Adee said: Whatever he narrated cannot have supporting narrations.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why Hafidh said in ‘Taqreeb’: ‘He is weak’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Kanana’s condition is unknown; no-one other than Ibn Hibban regarded him as trustworthy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I amended this and said: However a group of narrators have narrated from Kanana and from them were Zuhayr and Hudayj, the two sons of Muwayyeeyah, Mohammad bin Talha bin Musrif and Sa’adaan bin Basheer al-Juhani; all these four are trustworthy and also included along with them is Yazeed bin Mughliss al-Bahilly, whom a group regarded as trustworthy while others regarded him as weak. So the one from whom the likes of these narrate is included in the group of those who are regarded as ‘<em>Sadooq</em>’; just as I recently researched in a uniquely detailed piece of study ‘Tamaam al-Mina’ (p.204-206), so do not be deceived by some of the ignorant ones, like Saqqaf and other than him; therefore the defect in this hadeeth is only Hishaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What indicates that these two hadeeth are weak is that this story is mentioned on the authority of Ibn Abbas without mentioning pebbles and its wording is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abbas said: On the authority of Juwayreeyah that the Prophet &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> left her early when he went to pray the morning prayer, while she was in her place of prayer, then he returned after he had prayed <em>Duha</em> prayer and she was still sitting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he said to her: Are you still in the same state that I left you in?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She answered: Yes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I have already said four statements after you, three times, and if they were weighed against what you have said today then they would outweigh what you have said. They are: SubhanAllaahi wa bihamdihee, ‘adad Khalqihi, wa ridha nafsihi, wazeenat ‘arshihee, wa Midaad kalimaatihi.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allaah is free from imperfection and praise is for him; to the amount of his creation, the pleasure of His own Self, the beautification of His <em>‘Arsh</em> and the extent of His words.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Muslim (8/83-84) and Tirmidhi (4/274) and he authenticated it. Also narrated by Nisa’ee in ‘Amal al-Yawm wa Layla’ (161-165), Ibn Majah (91/23), Ahmad (6/325 &amp; 429-430).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this authentic hadeeth indicates two matters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first is that the person in the story is Juwayreeyah and not Safeeyah as was mentioned previously in the second hadeeth!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second matter is that the mention of pebbles in the story is rejected. What supports this is that Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> rebuked those whom he saw counting <em>Tasbeeh</em> upon pebbles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This has been mentioned on the authority of Ibn Mas’ood via many chains, one of which has already preceded. If the use of pebbles forcounting <em>Tasbeeh</em> was that which the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>had relayed then it would not have been hidden from Ibn Mas’ood,inshAllaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed this rebuke was adopted by some of those who graduated from the school of Ibn Mas’ood, including none other than Ibraheem bin Yazeed Nakhai, the scholar from Koofa, who used to prohibit his daughter from helping women braid thread together for prayer beads which they would use for <em>Tasbeeh</em>[8]!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah in ‘al-Musannaf’ (2/89/2) with a good chain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[The Amount of <em>Dhikr</em>]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the <em>Dhikr</em> were a lot, a person might perhaps say: It is not possible to enumerate exactly the amount counted upon fingers as is the waymentioned in the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reply is: indeed this matter of contempt came from another<em>Bida’</em>, which is the act of performing the <em>Dhikr</em> (remembrance) of Allaah much more than the limited amount – which Allaah the Most-Wise did not legislate. So this <em>Bida’</em> necessitated another <em>Bida’</em>which is the prayer beads since, as far as I know, the most that has been mentioned in the authentic Sunnah is indeed one hundred andit is possible for the one used to doing so to count this easily on one’s fingers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever says one hundred times a day: ‘Laa ilaaha illAllaahwahdahu la shareeka lahu…..’ the hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the intent is: one hundred in the morning and one hundred in the evening; as is clearly mentioned in some of the authentic narrations and they have been explained in ‘Saheehah’ (2762).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for what Ibn Abi Shaybah (2/391) narrated on the authority of Weeqa on the authority of Sa’eed bin Jubayr who said: Umar bin al-Khattab saw a man counting <em>Tasbeeh</em> with prayer beads he had, Umar said: What would be better than this would be for him to say: ‘SubhanAllaah …..’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is rejected due to the following reasons: the disconnection between him and Sa’eed as well as Weeqa being weak and he is Ibn Eyaas who is <em>layin</em> in hadeeth (he is not discarded, he is upright in himself but his hadeeth are not precise).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If there was only one resultant evil from the prayer beads which is that they have, or have nearly, annihilated the Sunnah of counting on fingers – which they agree is better – then this would have been sufficient evil since it is indeed rare that I see an old person count the <em>Tasbeeh</em> on his fingertips!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the people have also diversified innovating with this <em>Bida’</em>, so you see some of those who ascribe themselves to one of the Soofiorders wearing prayer beads around their necks![9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the people use prayer beads while they are talking to you or while they are listening to you talk! The last thing my eyes fell upon a few days ago was a man going along some streets, busy with people, on an ordinary bicycle and in one of his hands were prayer beads!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They make a pretence to the people of not neglecting the remembrance of Allaah, even for the blink of an eye! Many of these<em>Bida’ </em>become the cause of the loss of an obligation. It has happened to me – and to others – many a time that I have given my Salaams to one of them and they have replied with just a signal, without saying as-Salaam! The evils of these <em>Bida’</em> are innumerable. How excellent was the saying of the poet:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every good is in the following of the Salaf * and every evil is in the innovations of the Khalaf[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A Summary of what the Shaykh mentioned:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A- that prayer beads are a <em>Bida’</em> which were not present at the time of the Prophet &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> and were innovated after the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>[11], so how could it make sensethat the Messenger &#8211;<em> alayhi asallam-</em> would encourage his Companionsin a matter they did not know?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">B- That prayer beads oppose the guidance of the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>: Abdullaah bin ‘Amr said: ‘I saw the Messenger of Allaah &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> counting the <em>Tasbeeh</em> with his right hand.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">C- Then prayer beads oppose the command of the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>, when he said to some women: ‘You should make<em>Tasbeeh</em>, <em>Tahleel</em>, <em>Taqdees</em> and do not be negligent and forget Tawheed (and in a narration: mercy), <strong>and count them on your fingertips</strong> since they will be questioned and will respond.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">D- Ibraheem bin Yazeed Nakhai, the scholar from Koofa, used to prohibit his daughter from helping women braid thread together for prayer beads which they would use for <em>Tasbeeh</em>!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">E- As far as I know, the most that has been mentioned in the authentic Sunnah is indeed one hundred and it is possible for the one used to doing so to count this easily on one’s fingers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">F- If there was only one resultant evil from the prayer beads which is that they have, or have nearly, annihilated the Sunnah of counting on fingers – which they agree is better – then this would have been sufficient evil since it is indeed rare that I see an old person count the<em>Tasbeeh</em> on his fingertips!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">G- How excellent was the saying of the poet: Every good is in the following of the Salaf * and every evil is in the innovations of the Khalaf[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Headings were added for clarity (T.N.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] What supports that is the statement of the scholars of language: ‘Indeed the words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>‘as-Subha</em>’ (Prayer beads) is a newly created word, it was unknown to the Arabs.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] To say ‘SubhanAllaah’ (T.N.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] To say ‘La illaha ill Allaah’ (T.N.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] ‘To say ‘SubhanAllaah al-Malikul Quddoos; or Subooh Quddoos Rabb al-malaikatu war-Ruhu; and it is possible that Taqdees means to say Allaahu Akbar’. (Mishkat al-Masabih (2/9) –Checked by shaykh Albani) (T.N.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] Suyooti attributed it in ‘al-Manha’ to Nisa’ee and Ibn Majah and Shawkani followed him in that, however there is some speculation about this due to two points:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a- That Ibn Majah did not relate this narration at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b- That Nisa’ee narrated it in ‘al-Yawm wa Layla’ as is mentioned in ‘at-Thufah’ (3/325), so it was necessary to qualify it and I did not see this in the printed version.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] Suyooti followed him in this in ‘al-Manha’ &amp; Shawkani was deceived by it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] In this and what has preceded is a clear refutation of Shaykh al-Habashee in his claim that no-one has preceded me in rejecting prayer beads.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] Shaykh Abdullaah al-Ghamari, the shaykh of the Darqaweeyah order and other orders, encourage them saying: ‘There is nothing wrong with wearing prayer beads around the neck as it is the same as a writer placing his pen on his ear!’ How amazing it is when a <em>Faqih</em> makes a good analogy because this is the most baseless analogy on the face of this earth as it is built upon fabricated ahadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] The transliteration of which is: ‘Kullu khairin fee ittiba’ man Salaf * wa Kullu Sharrin fee Ibtida’ man Khallaf’(T.N.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] What supports that is the statement of the scholars of language: ‘Indeed the words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>‘as-Subha</em>’ (Prayer beads) is a newly created word, it was unknown to the Arabs.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12] The transliteration of which is: ‘Kullu khairin fee ittiba’ man Salaf * wa Kullu Sharrin fee Ibtida’ man Khallaf’(T.N.)</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">By <strong>Shaykhul Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah</strong><br />
And Checked by<strong> Shaykh Muhammad Nasir-rudeen al-Albani</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Compiled by Hajaj bin Abdullaah al-Areeni<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise belongs to Allaah, Lord of all the worlds. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, upon his family, his Companions and all those who follow his guidance until the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then to proceed, indeed Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> sent Muhammad <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> with the most eloquent of speech, Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And he does not speak from his own desire, indeed it is revelation sent down to him</span></strong>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Whatever the Messenger gave you then take it, and whatever he prohibits you from then keep away from it</span></strong>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Whoever obeys the Messenger then he has obeyed Allaah</span></strong>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has blessed this <em>Ummah</em> with the guidance of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and from the greatest of these blessings of guidance, is the ease of worship, coupled with the great reward for fulfilling that worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> mentioned, in many hadith, actions and sayings, which, if performed grant us great and well-known results. This is to encourage good actions and sayings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This collection of hadeeth, contain some of the valuable pearls of sayings, from the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>. They yield immense rewards, in return of easy &amp; effortless actions, for those whom Allaah has made them easy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have chosen these hadeeth from the book <em>S<strong>aheeh al-kalima at-Tayyib </strong></em>by the Shaykh Muhammad Nasir-rudeen al-Albaani <em>-Rahimullaah</em>. This book consists of authentic hadeeth from the book of Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> called <strong><em>al-kalima at-Tayib</em></strong>. All of the hadeeth mentioned in this pamphlet have been graded authentic from the research of Shaykh al-Albaani <em>-Rahimullaah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This pamphlet has only been only limited to the texts of the hadeeth, since not more than the text is required. I have named this collection <strong><em>Hawiz ala jawaiz</em></strong> (Gaining Rewards). Because these chosen hadeeth, which yield great rewards or great known results which the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> informed us of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It would be of great benefit, if someone by Allaah’s permission could carry out research similar to this. Delving into the books of hadeeth to bring forth knowledge guidance &amp; good works to the people.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Hadeeth</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever says: –</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَه،ُ لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْد،ُ وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah Alone, He has no partners, to Him belongs the Dominion and for Him is all praise, and He is capable of all things.’ –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">La ilaha ‘illa Allaahu wahdahu la shareeka lahu, lahul mulku wa lahul hamdu wa huwa ala kulli shayin qadeer</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One hundred times in one day, then it is equivalent to him freeing ten slaves, a hundred good deeds are written for him, a hundred bad deeds are erased, it is a protection for him against shaytaan during that day until the evening, and no one comes with a better deed than him except for the man who does more actions than him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever says: &#8211;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">‘Far is Allaah from imperfection and all praise is for Him’</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Subhana allaahi wa bihamdihi</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One hundred times in one day, then his mistakes / sins are cancelled out, even if they are like the foam on the ocean.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are two words which are gentle on the tongue, heavy on the scales, and beloved to ar-Rahmaan: &#8211;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ ، سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ الْعَظِيمِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">‘Far is Allaah from imperfection and praise is for Him, Far is Allaah The Sublime from imperfection</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Subhana allaahi wa bihamdihi, Subhana allaahil atheem</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed that I say:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ ، وَالْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ ، وَلَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ ، وَاللَّهُ أَكْبَرُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">‘Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest,’</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Subhana allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu akbar</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; is more beloved to me than what the sun rose upon.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is one of you so weak that he cannot acquire a thousand good deeds everyday? So a questioner from amongst those sitting there asked him: How can anyone of us gain a thousand rewards?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: say:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8211; Far is Allaah from imperfection –</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Subhana allaahi</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A hundred times, so a thousand good deeds are written for him or a thousand sins are cancelled for him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shall I not inform you of a statement, which is a treasure from the treasures of Paradise? I said: Yes O Messenger of Allaah, may my father and mother be sacrificed for you! He said: say:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">لَا حَوْلَ وَلَا قُوَّةَ إِلَّا بِاللَّهِ</h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">There is no capability nor is there any power except with Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">La hawla wa la quwwata illa billaa</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">7 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoso ever, reaches the morning &amp; reaches the evening and he says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">-‘Allaah is far from imperfection and all praise is for Him’ –</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Subhana allaahi wa bihamdihi</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One hundred times, then no one brings anything better than him on the day of judgment, than what he has brought. Except the one who says what he has said, or has said more than him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">8 – On the authority of Mua’ad bin Abdillaah ibn Khubayb on the authority of his father who said we went out on a very dark and rainy night searching for the Messenger of Allaah so that he could pray for us, then I found him and he <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said : Recite. So I did not say anything, then he said: Recite. So I did not say anything, and he said: Recite, so I said: what should I recite? He said: recite:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">“قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ”</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">‘Say that Allaah is the One.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the last two Soorahs (<em>al-muawaathatayan</em>) in the evening and the morning, three times for it will suffice you for everything.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">9 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the major supplication for forgiveness is to say</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُمَّ أَنْتَ رَبِّي لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ خَلَقْتَنِي وَأَنَا عَبْدُكَ وَأَنَا عَلَى عَهْدِكَ وَوَعْدِكَ مَا اسْتَطَعْتُ أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّ مَا صَنَعْتُ أَبُوءُ لَكَ بِذَنْبِي وَأَبُوءُ لَكَ بِنِعْمَتِكَ عَلَيَّ فَاغْفِرْ لِي فَإِنَّهُ لَا يَغْفِرُ الذُّنُوبَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">O Allaah You are my Lord, there is none worthy of worship in truth except You, You created me and I am Your slave and I abide to Your covenant and promise as best as I can, I seek refuge in You from the evil that I have committed, I profess to you my sins and I acknowledge Your favour upon me, so forgive me verily no one forgives sins except you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Allaahumma anta rabbee, la ilaha illa anta, Khalaqtanee, wa ana abduka, wa ana ala ahdika wa wa’dika mastata’tu, a’outhu bika min sharri ma sanatu, aboo’u laka bini’matika alayya, wa aboo’u bee thambee, faghfirlee fa’innahu la yaghfiru ath-thunooba ‘illa ‘anta</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if the worshipper says this when the morning arrives, truly believing in it and he dies, enters Paradise, and if he says this when the evening arrives truly believing in it enters Paradise.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">10 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is not one from amongst the worshippers, that if he says, in the morning of everyday and the evening of every night: <em>&#8211;</em></p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الَّذِي لَا يَضُرُّ مَعَ اسْمِهِ شَيْءٌ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَلَا فِي السَّمَاءِ وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">In the name of Allaah with whose name nothing is harmed what so ever, on this earth nor in the heavens whatsoever, and He is the All Hearing and All Knowing</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Bismil-lahil-lathee la yadhurru ma’a ‘issmihi shay’un fil ‘ardhi wa la fissama’i wa huwa ‘as-samee’ul –‘aleem</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Three times nothing harms him what so ever.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">11 – On the authority of Abu Huraira <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em>, the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> had placed Abu Huraira to look after the charity, some one came to him to take from the charity – and this person came night after night, so on the third night Abu Huraira said to him: I will take you to the Messenger of Allaah. So he said Why don’t you leave me and I will teach you some words that Allaah will benefit you by – and Abu Huraira was of those who were very attentive regarding good deeds – so the person said to him: When you go to bed, read Ayaat ul-Kursi:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">(الله لا إلهَ إلا هُوَ الحيُ القَيُومَ )</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Allaah, none has the right to be worshipped except Him The Ever living, The One Who sustains and protects all that exists&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[verse 255 from Soorah Baqarah]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Until the end of the <em>Ayaah</em>, then this will continue to be a protection for you from Allaah, and Shaytan will not be able to come near you until the morning arrives. The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: He spoke the truth even though he is a liar, [that was Shaytan].</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">12 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who ever recites the last two <em>Ayaat </em>from <em>Soorah al-Baqarah</em> at night, then those two verses will be sufficient for him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">13 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shall I not show you what will be better for you than a servant? When you lie down on your bed, say SubhanAllaah 33 times, say al-hamdulillaah 33 times and say Allaahu akbar 34 times.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">14 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who ever wakes up at night, and says: &#8211;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَه،ُ لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْد،ُ وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ،الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ ،وَ سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ ، وَلَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ ، وَاللَّهُ أَكْبَرُ ،وَ لَا حَوْلَ وَلَا قُوَّةَ إِلَّا بِاللَّهِ العليِ الْعَظِيمِ.</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah Alone, He has no partners, He has the Dominion and for Him is all praise, and He is capable of all things, praise is for Him, and Far is Allaah from imperfection, and There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest, there is no capability nor is there any power except with Allaah the Most High the ‘Atheem.’ (Supreme)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">La ilaha ‘illa Allaahu wahdahu la shareeka lahu, lahul mulku wa lahul hamdu wa huwa ala kulli shayin qadeer Subhana allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu akbar</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">La hawla wa la quwwata illa billaa</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he says : <strong>اللهمَ اغْفِرْلي</strong> <em>O Allaah forgive me </em>(Allaahumma aghfirlee), or he supplicates and his supplication is answered, and if he makes <em>Wudu</em> and prays then his prayer is accepted.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">15- The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who ever goes to bed with purification….there is not an hour of the night that he asks Allaah for something of good from this world and the hereafter, except that Allaah grants him that which he asked for.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">16 – Abu Salma said that he heard Abu Qatada say that he heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A good dream is from Allaah <em>–Tabaraka wa Ta’ala</em>&#8211; and a bad dream is from Shaytaan, so if anyone sees something in his dream which he dislikes, then he should spit on his left side 3 times when he awakens, and he should seek refuge with Allaah from its evil, then it will not harm him if Allaah so wills.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">17 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A good dream is from Allaah, so if any one of you sees something in his dream that he likes, then he should not relate it to anyone except the one whom he loves, and if he sees that which he dislikes, then he should not relate it to anyone, rather he should spit on his left side 3 times, and he should seek refuge with Allaah from the evil of the accursed shaytaan, and the evil of what he saw, then it will not harm him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">18- The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Lord <em>–Tabarak wa Ta’ala-</em> descends every night to the lowest heavens, when there remains the last third part of the night, and He says who is there that supplicates to me so that I may answer his supplication, who is there that asks of me so that I may grant him what he asks for, who is there that seeks my forgiveness so that I may forgive him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">19 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, there is an hour from the night, which if a Muslim asks Allaah in that time from the good of the affairs of this world and the hereafter, then Allaah gives him of it, and that is in every night.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">20 – On the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever says, as he leaves from his house:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ ، تَوَكَّلْتُ عَلَى اللَّهِ ،ولَا حَوْلَ وَلَا قُوَّةَ إِلَّا بِاللَّهِ تعالى</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">In the name of Allaah, I have placed my trust in Allaah, and there is no capability nor is there any power except with Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Bismillaahi tawwakaltu alalaahi wa la hawla wa la quwwata illa billahi taa’la</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">then it is said to him: indeed you have been saved, and you have been protected, and you have been guided, and shaytaan has been kept away from him, so another shaytaan says: how can you affect a man who has indeed been guided and saved and been protected.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">21 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a man enters his home, and he remembers Allaah when he enters and when he eats his food, the shaytaan says: there is no place for you to spend the night nor is there any dinner. And if he does not remember Allaah when he enters his house then the shaytaan says: you have found a place to spend the night and if he does not remember Allaah while he is eating his food then he says you have found food to eat.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">22 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O my son if you enter your home then say <em>Salaam</em> it will be a blessing for you and your family.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">23 – When the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> would enter the <em>Masjid</em> he would say:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَعُوذُ بِاللَّهِ الْعَظِيمِ وَبِوَجْهِهِ الْكَرِيمِ وَسُلْطَانِهِ الْقَدِيمِ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8211; I seek refuge with Allaah The Supreme and with His Noble Face, and His eternal authority from the accursed shaytaan –</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">A’outhu bil-lahil ‘atheem, wa bi-wajhihil-kareem, wa bi-sultanihil-qadeem min ‘ash-shayanir-rajeemi</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said: if he says this supplication then the shaytaan says: this person has been protected from me for the rest of the day.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">24 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the people knew what was there (in benefit for them) in the call to prayer and praying in the front row, and they could not get to it except by drawing lots, then they would draw lots.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">25- The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is none from the <em>Jinn</em>, mankind and anything else that hears the reach of the <em>Muaddthin’s</em> (the caller to prayer) voice except that they will testify for him on the day of Resurrection.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">26 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you hear the <em>Muaddthin</em>, then repeat what he says, then send prayers upon me, since indeed the one who sends prayers upon me once, Allaah sends ten prayers upon him. Then ask Allaah for me to be an intercessor since it is a high station in Paradise, which is not befitting except for a servant from the servants of Allaah and I hope that I am the one, so whoever asks intercession for me then intercession will take place for him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">27 -The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who ever says, when he hears the call to prayer:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُمَّ رَبَّ هَذِهِ الدَّعْوَةِ التَّامَّةِ وَالصَّلَاةِ الْقَائِمَةِ آتِ مُحَمَّدًا الْوَسِيلَةَ وَالْفَضِيلَةَ وَابْعَثْهُ مَقَامًا مَحْمُودًا الَّذِي وَعَدْتَهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; O Allaah Lord of this perfect call to prayer and Owner of this prayer to be performed, bestow upon Muhammad a station in Paradise and a rank above the rest of creation and give him the honorable station which you have promised him –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaahumma rabba hathihi ‘addawatittamati, was-salatil qa’imati, ‘ati Muhammadan ál-waseelata wal faaheelata, wab’ath-hu maqqaman mahmoodan ‘allathee wa’adtahu</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">then my intercession occurs for him on the day of Judgment.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">28- A man said O Messenger of Allaah indeed the callers to the prayer are more favored than we are. So the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: repeat what they say, and when you finish ask, and you will be given.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">29 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A supplication that is made between the Adhaan and the Iqama is not rejected.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">31 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Two things which are not rejected, or rarely rejected: A supplication made at the time of the call to prayer, and at the time when the battle becomes severe.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">31 -The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shall I not teach you something, which the people who proceeded you attained, and those who come after you will proceed you with, and there will be no-one better than you except the one who does what you do? They said of course O Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>. So he said: say: – far is Allaah from imperfection, Allaah is the Greatest and Praise is to Allaah – SubanAllaah and Allaahu akbar and Alhamdulillaah at the end of every prayer 33 times each.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">32 -The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever says SubhanAllaah at the end of every prayer 33 times, says al-hamdulillaah 33 times, and says Allaahu akbar 33 times, then this adds up to 99, and if he says –</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ِ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ ، لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah Alone, He has no partners, He has the Dominion and for Him is all praise, and He is capable of all things’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">La ilaha ‘illa Allaahu wahdahu la shareeka lahu, lahul mulku wa lahul hamdu wa huwa ala kulli shayin qadeer</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To complete a hundred, then his mistakes/sins are forgiven even if they were equivalent to the foam on the sea.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">34 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are two characteristics or two qualities that if a Muslim slave of Allaah is continuous upon, will enter Paradise, they are simple but those who do them are few. To say SubhanAllaah at the end of every prayer ten times, says alhamdulillah ten times and says Allaahu akbar ten times, which is equivalent to 150 times on the tongue and 1500 on the scales. And he says Allaahu Akbar 34 times when he goes to bed and he says alhamdulillah 33 times and says SubhanAllaah 33 times, and that is equivalent to 100 on the tongue and 1000 on the scales.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">34 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> used to teach us <em>al-Istikharah</em> (a prayer said for aid in making a decision) for all matters, just like he used to teach us a chapter from the Qur’aan, he would say: If any of you intends to undertake a matter then he should pray two <em>Rakah</em> other than an obligatory prayer then he should say</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَسْتَخِيرُكَ بِعِلْمِكَ وَأَسْتَقْدِرُكَ بِقُدْرَتِكَ وَأَسْأَلُكَ مِنْ فَضْلِكَ الْعَظِيمِ ، فَإِنَّكَ تَقْدِرُ وَلَا أَقْدِرُ ، وَتَعْلَمُ وَلَا أَعْلَمُ وَأَنْتَ عَلَّامُ الْغُيُوبِ ، اللَّهُمَّ إِنْ كُنْتَ تَعْلَمُ أَنَّ هَذَا الْأَمْرَ خَيْرٌ لِي فِي دِينِي وَمَعَاشِي وَعَاقِبَةِ أَمْرِي أَوْ قَالَ عَاجِلِ أَمْرِي وَآجِلِهِ فَاقْدُرْهُ لِي وَيَسِّرْهُ لِي ثُمَّ بَارِكْ لِي فِيهِ وَإِنْ كُنْتَ تَعْلَمُ أَنَّ هَذَا الْأَمْرَ شَرٌّ لِي فِي دِينِي وَمَعَاشِي وَعَاقِبَةِ أَمْرِي أَوْ قَالَ فِي عَاجِلِ أَمْرِي وَآجِلِهِ فَاصْرِفْهُ عَنِّي وَاصْرِفْنِي عَنْهُ وَاقْدُرْ لِيَ الْخَيْرَ حَيْثُ كَانَ ثُمَّ أَرْضِنِي بِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah I request of You with Your knowledge, and by Your Power I seek capability, and I ask of you of your great favour, since indeed You are the One who is able while I am not, and You know and I do not, and You are the One who knows the unseen. O Allaah if You know that this matter – here he mentions his need – is good for me in this world and for my living and for the matters of my hereafter – or he said, for my affairs now and the future – then decree it for me and make it easy for me and bless it for me. And if You know that this matter is evil for me in this world and for my life and for the matters of my hereafter – or he said, for my affairs now and the affairs of my future – then turn it away from me and turn me away from it, and decree goodness for me where ever it may be and make me pleased with it.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">35 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The supplication of Yunas, when he supplicated while he was in the belly of the whale:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ سُبْحَانَكَ إِنِّي كُنْتُ مِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; There is none worthy of worship in truth except You, far are You from imperfection, indeed I am from amongst the <em>Thalimoon</em>(oppressors) –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">La ilaha ‘illa ‘anta, subhanaka ‘innee kuntu minath-thalimeena</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No Muslim ever supplicates with this for anything except that Allaah responds to him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">36 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah does not afflict a slave with grief nor sadness, except that if the slave says: &#8211;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي عَبْدُكَ وَابْنُ عَبْدِكَ وَابْنُ أَمَتِكَ نَاصِيَتِي بِيَدِكَ مَاضٍ فِيَّ حُكْمُكَ ، عَدْلٌ فِيَّ قَضَاؤُكَ ، أَسْأَلُكَ بِكُلِّ اسْمٍ هُوَ لَكَ سَمَّيْتَ بِهِ نَفْسَكَ أَوْ عَلَّمْتَهُ أَحَدًا مِنْ خَلْقِكَ أَوْ أَنْزَلْتَهُ فِي كِتَابِكَ أَوِ اسْتَأْثَرْتَ بِهِ فِي عِلْمِ الْغَيْبِ عِنْدَكَ أَنْ تَجْعَلَ الْقُرْآنَ رَبِيعَ قَلْبِي وَنُورَ صَدْرِي وَجِلَاءَ حُزْنِي وَذَهَابَ هَمِّي</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah indeed I am Your slave, and the son of Your slave, and the son of Your female slave, my forelock is in Your Hand, Your command over me is forever executed and Your decree over me is just. I ask of You with all Your names, which belong to You, which You have named Yourself with, or which You have taught someone from Your creation or revealed it in Your Book or that which You have taken unto Your self with the knowledge of the unseen with You, that You make the Qur’aan the life of my heart and light of my breast and keep away from me my sadness, and that my grief goes away –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaahumma ‘innee ‘abduka, wabnu ‘abdika, wabnu amatika, nasiyatee biyadika, madhin fiyya hukmuka, adlun fiyya qadha’uka, asaluka bikulli ismin huwa laka, sammayta bihi nafsaka, aw anzaltahu fee kitabika, ‘aw allamthu ahadan min khaliqika, aw ista’tharta bihi fee ilmil ghaybi ‘indaka, án taj’alal-qurana rabee’a qalbee, wa noora sadree, wa jala’a huznee, wa thahaba hammee</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah takes away his grief and sadness and replaces it with happiness.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">37 – Uthman ibn al-Aas came to the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and said: O Messenger of Allaah indeed the shaytaan comes between me and my prayer, and my recitation becomes confusing? The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: This is a shaytaan called <em>khunsabun</em>, so if you sense his presence then seek refuge in Allaah from him and spit on your left hand side three times. Uthman said: I did that and Allaah kept him away from me.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">39 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no one from among Allaah’s servants, who is afflicted with an affliction except that he says: –</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"> إِنَّا لِلَّهِ وَإِنَّا إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُونَ  اللَّهُمَّ أْجُرْنِي فِي مُصِيبَتِي وَأَخْلِفْ لِي خَيْرًا مِنْهَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, we belong to Allaah and indeed to Him is our return – O Allaah recompense me for my affliction and replace it with something better than that</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Inna lil-lahi wa inna ‘ilayhi raji’oona, ‘allahumma’jurnee fee museebatee, wa ákhliflee khayran minha</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Except that Allaah compensates him in what he has been afflicted with, and gives him that which is better than the previous thing.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">40 – ‘Alee <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shall I not teach you words that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> taught me that even if you have an equivalent of a mountain of debt upon you that Allaah will pay it off on you behalf? Say: –</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">َ اللَّهُمَّ اكْفِنِي بِحَلَالِكَ عَنْ حَرَامِكَ وَأَغْنِنِي بِفَضْلِكَ عَمَّنْ سِوَاكَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah make what You have made lawful sufficient for me, as opposed to what You have made unlawful, and spare me by Your grace, from the need of others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allahumma ikfeenee bihalalieeka ‘an harameeka wa ‘aghninee bifadhlieeka ‘amman siwaka</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">41 – Uthmaan bin Abee al-Aaas complained to the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> about a pain he had in his body since he had become Muslim, so the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>said to him: place your hand on the part of your body that pains you and then say: &#8211;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">بِاسْمِ اللَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the name of Allaah, – three times,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and say seven times : –</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَعُوذُ بِاللَّهِ وَقُدْرَتِهِ مِنْ شَرِّ مَا أَجِدُ وَأُحَاذِرُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I seek refuge with Allaah and with His Capability from the evil that I feel and wary of</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Aouthu bi’izzatil-lahi waqudratihi min sharri ma ‘ajidu wa’uhathiru</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">42 -The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who ever visits a sick person who has not reached his appointed time, then says for him seven times: –</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَسْأَلُ اللَّهَ الْعَظِيمَ رَبَّ الْعَرْشِ الْعَظِيمِ أَنْ يَشْفِيَكَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah The ‘Atheem (The Supreme), Lord of the magnificent ‘Arsh to cure you &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Except that Allaah cures him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As’alul-laha ‘al-atheema, rabbal ‘arshil átheemi an yashfika</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">43 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who ever stops at a place on his journey and then says: &#8211;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">أَعُوذُ بِكَلِمَاتِ اللَّهِ التَّامَّاتِ مِنْ شَرِّ مَا خَلَقَ</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allaah from the evil of what He has created –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A’outhu bikalimatil-lahi ‘at-tammati min sharri ma khalaqa</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">nothing will harm him until he leaves from that place.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">44 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever eats some food and then says: &#8211;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِي أَطْعَمَنِي هَذَا وَرَزَقَنِيهِ مِنْ غَيْرِ حَوْلٍ مِنِّي وَلَا قُوَّةٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allaah Who fed me this food and provided it for me without any ability from my self nor any strength from my self –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-hamdu lil-lahi ‘al-lathee at-‘amanee hatha, wa razaqaneehi min ghayri hawlin minnee wa la quwwatin</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">except that his previous sins are forgiven.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">46 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You will not enter Paradise until you believe, and you will not believe until you love one another, shall I not show you something that by doing it, will cause you to love one another, spread salaams between yourselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">47 – Imran bin Hussain said: that a man came to the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and said: Peace be to you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah said: ten.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then another man came and said: Peace be to you and the mercy of Allaah, the Messenger of Allaah said: twenty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then another man came and said : Peace be to you and the mercy of Allaah and His blessings, the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>said: thirty.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">47 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one of you wants to have relations with his wife and says: &#8211;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">بِاسْمِ اللَّهِ اللَّهُمَّ جَنِّبْنَا الشَّيْطَانَ وَجَنِّبِ الشَّيْطَانَ مَا رَزَقْتَنَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the name of Allaah, O Allaah keep shaytaan away from us and keep shaytaan away from that which You provide for us –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillahi allaahumma jannibna ash-shaytana, wajannib ásh-shaytana ma razaqtana</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">so if a child is born from them then shaytaan will never be able to harm him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">48 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever sits in a gathering and speaks a lot, then he says before he gets up from his sitting place –</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">سُبْحَانَكَ اللَّهُمَّ وَبِحَمْدِكَ أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ أَسْتَغْفِرُكَ وَأَتُوبُ إِلَيْكَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You are far from imperfection O Allaah, and praise is to You, I testify that there is none worthy of worship in truth except You, I seek Your forgiveness, and I repent to You –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Subhanaka allahumma wa bihamdika, ash-hadu alla ilaha illa anta, astaghfiruka wa atoobu ilayka</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">except that Allaah covers up for him what he said in that gathering.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">49 – Sulaymaan bin Suradin said : I was sitting with the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and two men were cursing, and one of them his face became red, and he became furious, the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: indeed I know a statement if he says it then his anger will go away, if he says: –</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَعُوذُ بِاللَّهِ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I seek refuge in Allaah from the accursed shaytaan –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">then his anger will go away.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">50 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever sees some one who has been tried and then says: &#8211;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِي عَافَانِي مِمَّا ابْتَلَاكَ بِهِ وَفَضَّلَنِي عَلَى كَثِيرٍ مِمَّنْ خَلَقَ تَفْضِيلًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allaah Who has saved me from what He has trialed you with and chosen me above much of the creation –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Alhamdu lil-lahi allathee afanee mimma ibtalaka bihi, wa fadh-dhalanee ala katheerin mimman khalaqa tafdheelan</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">then that trial will not afflict him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">51 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever enters the market place and says –</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ ، لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ يُحْيِي وَيُمِيتُ وَهُوَ حَيٌّ لَا يَمُوتُ بِيَدِهِ الْخَيْرُ وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah Alone, He has no partners, He has the Dominion and for Him is all praise, He gives life and He takes life and He is the Ever living and does not die, in His Hand is goodness and He is capable of all things.’ –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">La ilaha ‘illa Allaahu wahdahu la shareeka lahu, lahul mulku wa lahul hamdu yuhyee wa youmeet wa huwa hayun la yamoot biyadihi alkhair wa huwa ala kulli shayin qadeer</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">then Allaah writes a thousand thousand good deeds for him, and erases a thousand thousand bad deeds for him, and He raises him up a thousand thousand grades.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

Chapter 248<br />
Remembrance of Allah in the Morning and in the Evening</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَاذْكُر رَّبَّكَ فِي نَفْسِكَ تَضَرُّعًا وَخِيفَةً وَدُونَ الْجَهْرِ مِنَ الْقَوْلِ بِالْغُدُوِّ وَالْآصَالِ وَلَا تَكُن مِّنَ الْغَافِلِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;</b><b>And remember your <em>Rubb</em> by your tongue and within yourself, humbly and with fear and without loudness in words in the mornings, and in the afternoons and be not of those who are neglectful.</b></span><b><span style="color:#008000;">&#8221;</span> (7:205)</b></p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ قَبْلَ طُلُوعِ الشَّمْسِ وَقَبْلَ غُرُوبِهَا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;</b><b>And declare the perfectness of your <em>Rubb</em> before the rising of the sun, and before its setting</b></span><b><span style="color:#008000;">.&#8221;</span> (20:130)</b></p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ بِالْعَشِيِّ وَالْإِبْكَارِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;</b><b>And declare the perfectness of your <em>Rubb</em> and praise Him in the `<em>Ashi</em> (i.e., the time period after the midnoon till sunset) and in the <em>Ibkar</em></b>(i.e., the time period from early morning or sunrise till before midnoon)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;">.&#8221;</span> (40:55)</b></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فِي بُيُوتٍ أَذِنَ اللَّهُ أَن تُرْفَعَ وَيُذْكَرَ فِيهَا اسْمُهُ يُسَبِّحُ لَهُ فِيهَا بِالْغُدُوِّ وَالْآصَالِ </span><span style="color:#000000;">رِجَالٌ لَّا تُلْهِيهِمْ تِجَارَةٌ وَلَا بَيْعٌ عَن ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ وَإِقَامِ الصَّلَاةِ وَإِيتَاءِ الزَّكَاةِ ۙ يَخَافُونَ يَوْمًا تَتَقَلَّبُ فِيهِ الْقُلُوبُ وَالْأَبْصَارُ</span></h2>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1453.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) used to say in the morning:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allahumma bika asbahna, wa bika amsaina, wa bika nahya, wa bika namutu, wa ilaikan-nushur </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">(O Allah! With Your Power we have come to the morning, with Your Power we come to the evening, with Your Power we live, and we die, and to You will we return</span>).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the evening he would say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allahumma bika amsaina, wa bika nahya, wa bika namutu, wa ilaikan-nushur </span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[At-Tirmidhi and Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1454.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Abu Bakr asked, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Teach me some words so that I may recite them in the morning and in the evening.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Recite these words: `Allahumma fatiras-samawati wal-ardi, `alimal-ghaibi wash-shahadati, Rabba kulli shai&#8217;in wa malikahu. Ash-hadu an la ilaha illa Anta, a`udhu bika min sharri nafsi</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">,</span><span style="color:#0000ff;"> wa sharrish-Shaitani wa shirkihi </span></p>

I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped but You. I seek Your Protection from the evil of my own self from the evil of Satan and from the evil of Shirk to which he calls)</span>.&#8221;&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) added: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Recite these words in the morning and the evening and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">when you go to bed</span></span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1455.</b> `Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: When it was evening, the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) used to supplicate:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Amsaina wa amsal-mulku lillah, wal-hamdu lillah. La `ilaha illallahu wahdahu la sharika lahu </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">(We have entered upon evening and the whole kingdom of Allah, too, has entered upon evening. Praise is due to Allah. There is none who has the right to be worshiped but Allah, the One who has no partner with Him)</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (the narrator) said: I think that he (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) used to follow the recitation with these words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Lahul-mulku, wa lahul-hamdu, wa Huwa `ala kulli shi&#8217;in Qadir. Rabbi as&#8217;aluka khaira ma fi hadhihil-lailati, wa khaira ma ba`daha; wa a`udhu bika min sharri ma fi hadhihil-lailati, wa sharri ma ba`daha; Rabbi a`udhu bika minal-kasali, wa su</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">&#8216;</span><span style="color:#0000ff;">il-kibari; Rabbi a`udhu bika min `adhabin fin-nari, wa `adhabin fil-qabri </span></p>

My Rubb, I beg of you good that lies in this night and good that follows it, and I seek refuge in You from the evil that lies in this night and from the evil of that which follows it. My Rubb! I seek refuge in You from lethargy and the misery of old age. O Allah! I seek Your Protection from the torment of Hell-fire and the punishment of the grave)</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When it was morning, he (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) would recite the same, replacing the words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">We have entered upon evening and the whole kingdom of Allah, too, has entered upon evening&#8221; with &#8220;We have entered upon morning and the whole kingdom of Allah entered upon morning</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Replace the words &#8220;Amsaina, amsa, hadhihil-lailati, ma ba`daha with Asbahna, asbaha, hadhal-yaumi, ma ba`dahu, respectively.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1456.</b> `Abdullah bin Khubaib (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to me, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Recite Surat Al-Ikhlas and Al-Mu`awwidhatain (Surat Al-Falaq and Surat An-Nas) three times at dawn and dusk. It will suffice you in all respects</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1457.</b> `Uthman bin `Affan (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who recites three times every morning and evening:</span></p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">بِسْمِ اللهِ الَّذِي لَا يَضُرُّ مَعَ اسْمِهِ شَيْءٌ فِي الأَرْضِ وَلَا فِي السَّمَاءِ وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ</span></h2>

Chapter 247<br />
The Excellence of Gathering in which Allah is Remembered</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>And keep yourself (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) patiently with those who call on their Rubb (i.e., your companions who remember their Rubb with glorification, praising in prayers, and other righteous deeds) morning and afternoon, seeking His Face; and let not your eyes overlook them.</b></span><b>&#8221; (18:28)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1447.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allah, the Exalted, has teams of angels who go about on the roads seeking those who remember Allah. When they find some people remembering Allah they call to one another and say, `Come to what you are looking for;&#8217; and they surround them with their wings till the space between them and the lowest sky is fully covered. Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, asks them (although He is best informed about every thing): `What are my slave saying?&#8217; They say: `They are glorifying Your Tasbih, Tahmid, Takbir, Tamjid, (i.e., they were declaring Your Perfectness, praising, remembering the Greatness and Majesty of Allah).&#8217; He asks: `Have they seen Me?&#8217; They reply, `No, indeed, they have not seen You.&#8217; He asks: `How would they act if they were to see Me?&#8217; Thereupon they reply: `If they were to see You, they would engage more earnestly in worshipping and glorifying You and would extol You more.&#8217; He would say: `What do they beg of Me?&#8217; They say, `They beg You for Your Jannah.&#8217; Allah says, `Have they seen My Jannah?&#8217; They say, `No, our Rubb.&#8217; He says: `How would they act if they were to see My Jannah?&#8217; They reply, `Were they to see it, they would more intensely eager for it.&#8217; They (the angels) say, `They seek Your Protection.&#8217; He asks, `Against what do they seek My Protection?&#8217; They (the angels) say, `Our Rubb, from the fire of Hell.&#8217; (He, the Rubb) says, `Have they seen the fire of Hell?&#8217; They say, `No. By Your Honour, they have not seen it.&#8217; He says: `How would they act if they were to see My Fire?&#8217; They say: `If they were to see it, they would more earnest in being away from it and fearing it. They beg of Your forgiveness.&#8217; He says: `I call you to witness that I hereby grant pardon to them and confer upon them what they ask for; and grant them protection against what they seek protection from.&#8217; One of the angels says: `Our Rubb, there is amongst them such and such slave who does not belong to the assembly of those who are participating in Your remembrance. He passed by them and sat down with them.&#8217; He says: `I also grant him pardon because they are the people by virtue of whom their associates will not be unfortunate</span>&#8216;.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#800000;">The narration in Muslim is also the same with minor changes in wordings</span>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1<b>448.</b> Abu Hurairah and Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">When a group of people assemble for the remembrance of Allah, the angels surround them (with their wings), (Allah&#8217;s) mercy envelops them, Sakinah, or tranquillity descends upon them and Allah makes a mention of them before those who are near Him</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1449.</b> Abu Waqid Al-Harith bin `Auf (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was sitting in the mosque with his Companions when three people came to him. Two of them stepped forward to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and the third went away. Those two men stood by the side of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). One of them found a space in the circle and he filled it, while the other one sat behind him. When the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) finished, he said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Shall I not inform you about these three people? One of them sought refuge with Allah and Allah gave him refuge; the second one felt shy and Allah showed kindness to his shyness (and so he was accommodated in that meeting), and the last one averted, and so Allah turned away His Attention from him</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1450.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Mu`awiyah (May Allah be pleased with him) came to an assembly in the mosque and asked them: &#8220;What has made you sit together?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;We are sitting here to remember Allah.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I adjure you by Allah to tell me whether nothing else has made you to sit together.&#8221; They replied: &#8220;By Allah! We are sitting only to remember Allah.&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;I did not adjure you because I suspected you. No one of my rank in the eyes of the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) is the narrator of so few traditions as I am. The fact is that the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) went out to a circle of his Companions and said, `<span style="color:#0000ff;">What has made you sit there?</span>&#8216; When they replied that they are sitting together to remember Allah and to praise Him for guiding them to Islam and bestowing favours on them, he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, `<span style="color:#0000ff;">I adjure you by Allah to tell me that nothing else has made you sit together</span>.&#8217; On their reply that there was certainly no other purpose, he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, `<span style="color:#0000ff;">I did not adjure you because I suspected you, but Jibril (Gabriel) came to me and told me that Allah was talking proudly of you to the angels</span>.&#8221;&#8217;</p>

And he who utters: `Subhan-Allahi wa bihamdihi (Allah is free from imperfection and His is the praise)&#8217; one hundred times a day, his sins will be obliterated even if they are equal to the extent of the foam of the ocean</span>.&#8221;<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>878.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah likes sneezing and dislikes yawning. When any one of you sneezes and says `Al-hamdu lillah (praise be to Allah)&#8217;, it becomes obligatory upon every Muslim who hears him to respond with `Yarhamuk-Allah (may Allah have mercy on you)&#8217;. Yawning is from the devil. When one of you feels like yawning, he should restrain it as much as possible, for the devil laughs when one of you yawns.&#8221;</span><br />

[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>880.</b> Abu Musa (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;When one of you sneezes and praises Allah (i.e., says Al-hamdu lillah), you should invoke Allah&#8217;s Mercy upon him (i.e., say Yarhamuk-Allah); but if he does not praise Allah, you should not make a response.&#8221;</span> [Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>881</b>. Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: When two men sneezed in the presence of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), he responded to one with<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Yarhamuk-Allah (may Allah have mercy on you)&#8221;</span> and did not respond to the other. The latter said to him: &#8220;You invoked a blessing on this man but did not do so in my case.&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He praised Allah (i.e., he said `Al-hamdu lillah&#8217;) but you did not.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>

[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>883.</b> Abu Musa (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Jews used to intentionally sneeze in the presence of the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) hoping that he would say to them: `Yarhamukum-ullah (may Allah have mercy on you),&#8217; but he would respond with:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Yahdikum-ullahu wa yuslihu balakum (may Allah guide you and render sound your state of affairs).&#8221;</span><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>  <em><a style="text-decoration:none;" href="#">    </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 35: </font></p>
<p></a></em>    </p>
<h3 align="center"><font><em>The Book Pertaining to the Remembrance  of Allah, Supplication, Repentance and Seeking Forgiveness (Kitab Al-Dhikr) </em></font>    </h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><br /></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Supplication is in fact not only the spontaneous  outpourings of man&#8217;s heart before his Lord, but it is an expression of his sense of  nearness to Him, of His Might and Power, of his confidence in His mercy, grace and  blessings. If one were to know how much a man supplicates, and what he supplicates about,  and how he supplicates, one would be able to see how much spirituality is there in his  soul. When a man without any witness speaks with Allah, the soul stands unveiled before  its Creator. The higher the note he strikes in his outpouring, the higher is the quality  of the faith that is imprinted upon his soul, and serves as a background to all his  thought and activity. Thus to understand the spirit of any religion and appraise its value  to life and society, supplications serve as the key. The Prophet (may peace be upon him)  was a great believer in supplication and prayer. He made supplications to his Lord with  zeal and fervour, rarely to be found in the religious literature of the world. One who  cares to read them cannot but be overwhelmed with the depth of feelings with which the  Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) approaches his Lord, his intense love for the Great  Master, his deep faith in His unbounded Favours, his unshakeable confidence in His Divine  Mercy and unflinching faith in His Might and Power, and his sense of deep humility before  Him. These are in fact the multi-coloured threads with which is woven the delicate pattern  of the Prophet&#8217;s (may peace be upon him) supplications. In Islam the supplication which a  Muslim has been instructed to make whether singly or in congregation, whether at the  appointed hour of ritual prayer or at any sudden call or urge to His Lord, reflects the  one single attitude of submission, humility and closeness to God. Whatever is the state of  spiritual elevation of the supplication he is made to keep this fact constantly in his  mind that he is a humble servant of the Lord. That is the reason why most of the  supplications in Islam open with an invocation of the Divine Being; either the personal  name of God, i. e. Allah, is used or the descriptive title of His Attributes are called  out in order to make the worshipper conscious of his own weak and dependent self before  his Master. In Islam man seeks to move God to help and grant him what he desires, and at  the same time he seeks unconsciously to work upon himself through the realisation of what  God means to him, to strengthen, to renew and to refresh his own inner life. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While the expression of dependence and trust is in reality  a prerequisite of supplication in Islam, it covers the whole range of human life with all  its needs, longings and problems. Supplication finds expression in a deep and urgent  longing for self preservation and deliverance from the oppressive situation, forgiveness  of sins, elevation of the soul, goodness of the worldly life and that of the Hereafter.  This consciousness of one&#8217;s absolute dependence upon Him, which pervades the entire stock  of the Prophet&#8217;s (may peace be upon him) supplications, shows man&#8217;s attitude of perfect  resignation before the Mighty Will of the Master, but this resignation has nothing of the  spirit of despondence and despair in it; it rather illuminates hope out of conviction that  the Being Who is the Lord of man&#8217;s fate can also help him and save him even in the most  trying circumstances. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The supplications of Muhammad (may peace be upon him)  eminently combine in themselves the mystical and the religious traits. While the Muslim  supplicates, he, like a mystic, beholds undisturbed with concentrated gaze one Supreme  Spiritual Reality Who is the Embodiment and Repository of all values. But, unlike mystics,  he, in the hour of contemplation in supplication, does not lose himself but realises  himself to be a humble servant of God and therein lies his spiritual strength and  unwavering confidence in God. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The one more distinguishing feature of the supplications  taught by Muhammad (may peace be upon him) is that these are all permeated with the spirit  of social fellowship. They do not urge man to stand face to face with God in absolute  loneliness, isolated from all other human beings. Herein the suppliant begs his Lord with  the full consciousness of human brotherhood and with a feeling that the distress which  vexes him is not his only, it is that of his brethren. The graces of God and the salvation  for which he longs are also the longings of all believers, nay, of the entire humanity.  There is no doubt a deep touch of intimate personal and individual contact with God in  these supplications, but this contact is not of the nature of a non-Muslim mystic in which  the soul is supposed to be unified with God losing all its individual identity. Here the  soul has a communion with Allah with full consciousness of man&#8217;s own self, his social  surroundings and responsibilities. That is why most of the supplications have been  expressed in the form&#8221; We&#8221; and Us&#8221;. </font></p>

And if he    remembers Me in his heart, I also remember him in My Heart, and if he remembers Me in    assembly I remember him in assembly, better than his (remembrance), and if he draws near    Me by the span of a palm, I draw near him by the cubit, and if he draws near Me by the    cubit I draw near him by the space (covered by) two hands.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808080;">[Below is a portion from the book &#8220;Miracles of the Messenger (Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam)&#8221; regarding the remembrance of Allah. This miracle occurred when Rasulallah moved from the tree trunk to the newly made pulpit to give the Khutbah. Rasulallah used to lean against the tree trunk but when he left for the pulpit it cried out loud like a child for it would no longer be in the company of the Prophet and hear the remembrance of Allah (azzawajal). You can read the detailed story and hadith in chapter 6 page 105 in the book &#8220;Miracles of the Messenger (Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam)&#8221;]</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was also another reason for the weeping of the tree trunk and this was made clear by the Prophet when he said to his Companions: &#8220;It wept because of the remembrance of Allah (Dhikr) which it used to hear.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the tree trunk also used to hear remembrance of Allah from the mouth of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam) and Allah, the Most Blessed, the Most High says regarding remembrance of Him: <i>&#8220;Those who believed (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism), and whose hearts find rest in the remembrance of Allah verily, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest. &#8220;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is not surprising that the tree trunk cried for that which brought tranquility to it. Haply, we may learn from this lifeless thing to love the remembrance of Allah and to accustom ourselves to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word Dhikr means to remember something through constant verbal repetition of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a person were to constantly repeat the Names of Allah for example he would be remembering Allah; and due to the great need of man for remembrance of Allah, He has encouraged us to do it, in His Words: <i>&#8220;He said: &#8216;O my Lord! Make a sign for me.&#8217; (Allah) said: &#8216;Your sign is that you shall not speak to mankind for three days except with signals. And remember your Lord much (by praising Him again and again), and glorify (Him) in the afternoon and in the morning.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says: <i>&#8220;O you who believe! Remember Allah with much remembrance.&#8221; </i>In remembrance of Allah there is great virtue, including:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Reminding Others to Remember Allah:</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Most Glorified, the Most High says: &#8220;Therefore remember Me (by praying, glorifying). I will remember you, and be grateful to Me (for My countless Favors on you) and never be ungrateful to Me. &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He inspired the Prophet (Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam) to say: <i>&#8220;Shall I not inform you about the best of your deeds with Allah and the purest of them with your King and the highest of them in status for you, which are better for you than spending gold and silver in charity and better than meeting your enemy and cutting off their heads, while they also cut off yours?&#8221; They said &#8220;Certainly, oh, Messenger of Allah!&#8221; He said: &#8220;It is remembrance of Allah, the All-Mighty, the All Powerful.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam) also said: <i>&#8220;The likeness of one who remembers Allah and one who does not remember Allah is as the likeness of the living and the dead.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It repels Satan and pleases the Most Gracious, according to the Words of the Prophet (Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam): <i>&#8220;Whenever a people sit in a meeting-place and remember Allah, they are surrounded by angels and enveloped in mercy, and tranquility descends upon them as they remember Allah; and Allah makes mention of them to those with Him.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It removes Anxiety and Sadness and enlightens the Heart and brings Peace and Tranquility to it, according to the Words of Allah, the Most High: <i>&#8220;Those who believed (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism), and whose hearts find rest in the remembrance of Allah verily, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It strengthens the Heart and the Body, according to the Words of the Prophet (Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam) to His Daughter, Fatimah and &#8216;Ali (R). He told them to glorify Allah (i.e., say Subhan Allah) thirty-three times, to praise and thank Allah (i.e., to say Al-Hamdu Lilldh) thirty-three times and to extol Allah (i.e., to say Allahu Akbar) thirty-four times. This was when she (i.e., Fatimah ) asked him for a servant which would help her in her work.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Remembrance of Allah also attracts Sustenance, according to the Words of Allah, the Most High: <i>&#8220;Ask forgiveness from your Lord, verily, He is Oft Forgiving; He will send rain to you in abundance, and give you increase in wealth and children, and bestow on you gardens and bestow on you rivers. &#8220;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Through remembrance of Allah, the hearts live, according to the Saying of Ibn Taimiyyah: Remembrance of Allah for the heart is like water to the fish; and what would the situation of the fish be if it left the water?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Remembrance of Allah causes the One Who remembers Him to be with Him, according to the Hadith Qudsi: <i>&#8220;I am with My slave whenever he remembers me and moves his lips to pronounce My Names.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he spoke the truth who said: &#8220;The heart becomes diseased due to two things: negligence and sin; and it becomes clear due to two things: seeking forgiveness from Allah and remembrance of Allah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By Remembrance of Allah, the Slave earns Allah&#8217;s Love, according to the Words of Ibn &#8216;Abbas (R): &#8220;When Moses t went to Mount Sinai, he said: &#8216;Oh, my Lord! Which of Your slaves is most beloved to You?&#8217; He said: &#8220;The one who remembers me and does not forget me.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Remembrance of Allah also opens up the door to knowledge for the slave and protects the tongue from backbiting and tale-bearing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has also been said that it causes the slave to be conscious of Allah&#8217;s Observation of him, which admits him to the door of <i>Ihsan,</i> so that he worships Allah as if he could see Him. It also gives rise to<i> Inabah</i>, which is to return to Allah, the All-Mighty, the All-Powerful. So when a person returns frequently to Allah by remembrance of Him, it will cause him to return to Allah in all circumstances.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Remembrance of Allah is the Easiest Act of Worship:</b> It is easy for a person in every place, in every situation and at all times to remember Allah and in spite of this, it is one of the best acts of worship for the movement of the tongue is lighter and easier than the movement of any other part of the body. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the Muslim to take care to accustom his tongue to remembrance of Allah and keep it moist thereby and he should do so in all circumstances, according to the Hadith of &#8216;Aishah : &#8220;The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam), used to remember Allah, the Most High in all circumstances.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, we must observe his Sunnah, for there is a supplication and a remembrance of Allah (Dhikr) legislated for every time and every action.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">In the Shade of this Miracle</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It might appear that the weeping of an inanimate object is something strange, but it was a subjugation from Allah in order that the tree trunk should deliver a Message not only for the Companions (R) rather, it was for all mankind, in every time and place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was a message delivered by the tree trunk through Allah&#8217;s Ability to do all things and it announced it in a resounding manner, which echoed: &#8220;La ilaha illallah (none is worthy of worship except Allah).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tree trunk addressed mankind, with a message of complete faith, in that language which purifies the hearts and washes the senses and when humanity understands it, its soul which is wandering in the wilderness will return to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Its message will remain to soften hard hearts, to remind forgetful hearts and to awaken sleeping feelings and to give life to sensations which have died and it will remain to shout out to mankind: The dry, lifeless object cried out for the intimacy and delight which it lost, when the Prophet (Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam) passed by it in favor of the new pulpit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The dry, lifeless object was distressed at being far from the Prophet (Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam) and alarmed at being parted from him and wished that it should continue. It was as if this dry, lifeless object was declaring to us that we should seek that delight which comes from following the guidance of Al-Mustafa e; and adhering to his Sunnah. And (that it was declaring also) that we should feel distress at being far from it, that we beware of transgress in it, that we should hold fast to it and cling to it by our molar teeth, in order that we might attain closeness to the Prophet and companionship with him, and that the Miracle should remove from us all traces of doubt which might remain present in the hearts of some, regarding the Messenger (Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Al Hamdulillah<br />
</strong><strong>(All Praise and Thanks be to Allah)</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Meaning of Al-Hamd</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Ja`far bin Jarir said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>The meaning of (Al-Hamdu Lillah) (all praise and thanks be to Allah)</strong> is: all thanks are due purely to Allah, alone, not any of the objects that are being worshipped instead of Him, nor any of His creation. These thanks are due to Allah&#8217;s innumerable favors and bounties, that only He knows the amount of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s bounties include creating the tools that help the creation worship Him, the physical bodies with which they are able to implement His commands, the sustenance that He provides them in this life, and the comfortable life He has granted them, without anything or anyone compelling Him to do so. Allah also warned His creation and alerted them about the means and methods with which they can earn eternal dwelling in the residence of everlasting happiness. All thanks and praise are due to Allah for these favors from beginning to end.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further, Ibn Jarir commented on the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Al-Hamdu Lillah)</strong>, that it means, &#8220;A praise that Allah praised Himself with, indicating to His servants that they too should praise Him, as if Allah had said, `Say: All thanks and praise is due to Allah.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was said that the statement, <strong>(All praise and thanks be to Allah)</strong>, entails praising Allah by mentioning His most beautiful Names and most honorable Attributes. When one proclaims, `All thanks are due to Allah,&#8217; he will be thanking Him for His favors and bounties.&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Difference between Praise and Thanks</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hamd is more general, in that it is a statement of praise for one&#8217;s characteristics, or for what he has done. Thanks are given for what was done, not merely for characteristics.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Statements of the Salaf about Al-Hamd</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hafs mentioned that `Umar said to `Ali, &#8220;We know La ilaha illallah, Subhan Allah and Allahu Akbar. What about Al-Hamdu Lillah&#8221; `Ali said, &#8220;<strong>A statement that Allah liked for Himself, was pleased with for Himself and He likes that it be repeated</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Ibn `Abbas said, <strong>&#8220;Al-Hamdu Lillah is the statement of appreciation. When the servant says Al-Hamdu Lillah, Allah says, `My servant has praised Me.&#8221;</strong> Ibn Abi Hatim recorded this Hadith.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Virtues of Al-Hamd</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal recorded that Al-Aswad bin Sari` said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I said, `O Messenger of Allah! Should I recite to you words of praise for My Lord, the Exalted, that I have collected&#8217; He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Verily, your Lord likes Al-Hamd.)</strong>&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nasa&#8217;i also recorded this Hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, Abu `Isa At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa&#8217;i and Ibn Majah recorded that Musa bin Ibrahim bin Kathir related that Talhah bin Khirash said that Jabir bin `Abdullah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(The best Dhikr (remembering Allah) is La ilaha illallah and the best supplication is Al-Hamdu Lillah.)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At-Tirmidhi said that this Hadith is Hasan Gharib.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Ibn Majah recorded that Anas bin Malik said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(No servant is blessed by Allah and says,`Al-Hamdu Lillah&#8217;, except that what he was given is better than that which he has himself acquired.)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further, in his Sunan, Ibn Majah recorded that Ibn `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(A servant of Allah once said, `O Allah! Yours is the Hamd that is suitable for the grace of Your Face and the greatness of Your Supreme Authority.&#8217; The two angels were confused as to how to write these words. They ascended to Allah and said, `O our Lord! A servant has just uttered a statement and we are unsure how to record it for him.&#8217; Allah said while having more knowledge in what His servant has said, &#8216;What did My servant say&#8217; They said, `He said, `<strong>O Allah! Yours is the Hamd that is suitable for the grace of Your Face and the greatness of Your Supreme Authority</strong>.&#8217; Allah said to them, <strong>`Write it as My servant has said it, until he meets Me and then I shall reward him for it</strong>.)</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Al before Hamd encompasses all Types of Thanks and Appreciation for Allah</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The letters Alif and Lam before the word Hamd serve to encompass all types of thanks and appreciation for Allah, the Exalted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Hadith stated,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(O Allah! All of Al-Hamd is due to You, You own all the ownership, all types of good are in Your Hand and all affairs belong to You.)</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah (d.751 H), rahimahullaah 1<br />
From al-Istiqaamah magazine Shawwal 1418H/ February 1998</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O you who believe! Remember Allaah and remember Him a lot.&#8221; [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:4I]. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Those men and women who remember Allaah a lot.&#8221; [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:35]. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;So when you have finished the rights of your Pilgrimage, then remember Allaah as you remember your fore-father, or with more intense remembrance.&#8221; [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:200]. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These verses contain a command to remember Allaah intensely and abundantly, since the worshipper is in dire need of [remembering Allaah] and cannot do without it even for a twinkling of an eye. This is because every moment that a person does not spend in the dhikr (remembrance) of Allaah will not be of any benefit to him. Rather, the harm entailed in being neglectful of the dhikr of Allaah is far greater than any benefits that can be gained. One of the &#8216;aarifeen (those who are knowledgeable about Allaah) said:&#8221;If a person were to spend such and such number of years engaged [in the dhikr of Allaah], then he turns away from it for just a moment, what he will lose is far greater than whatever he has already gained.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bayhaqee relates from &#8216;Aaishah radiallaahu &#8216;anhaa that the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said: &#8220;There is no time in which the son of Aadam does not remember AIIaah in it, except that it will be a source of regret for him on the Day of Judgement&#8221; 2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mu&#8217;aadh ibn jabal radiallaahu &#8216;anhu relates that the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said: &#8220;The people of Paradise will not have any regrets except for those moments in which they were not engaged in the dhikr (remembrance) of Allaah.&#8221; 3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mu&#8217;aadh ibn Jabal also relates that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam was asked: What action is the most beloved to Allaah? So he replied: &#8220;That you continue to keep your tongue moist with the dhikr of Allaah, until you die.&#8221; 4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>POLISHING THE HEART</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Dardaa radiallaahu &#8216;anhu said:&#8221;For everything there is a polish and the polish for the heart is the dhikr of Allaah&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bayhaqee relates from Ibn &#8216;Umar radiallaahu &#8216;anhu that AlIaah&#8217;s Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said: &#8220;For everything there is a polish, and the polish for the hearts is the dhikr (remembrance) of Allaah. There is nothing more potent in saving a person from the punishment of Allaah than the dhikr of Allaah.&#8221; It was said: Not even Jihaad in the path of Allaah. So he replied: &#8220;Not even if you were to continue striking with your sword until it breaks.&#8221;5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that hearts becomes rusty just as copper and silver coins become rusty. The polish for [this rust] is the dhikr of AIlaah. This is because [dhikr] is like a polish [which polishes the heart] like a shiny mirror. When dhikr is left, the rust returns. But when dhikr resumes, then the heart is [again] polished. And hearts become rusty due to two things:-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) neglecting remembering Allaah, and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) committing sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The polish for these two things is:-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) seeking Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) dhikr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>CONFUSING TRUTH WITH FALSEHOOD</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever neglects [remembering Allaah] most of the time, then his heart will become rusty in accordance with how neglectful the person is. And when this [filthy] rust accumulates on the heart, then it no longer recognises things as they really are. Thus, it views falsehood as if it is the truth, and truth as if it is falsehood. This is because this rust darkens and confuses the heart&#8217;s perception, and so it is unable to truly recognise things for what they really are. So as the rust accumulates, the heart gets blackened, and as this happens the heart becomes stained with this filthy rust, and when this occurs it corrupts the heart&#8217;s perception and recognition of things. The heart [then] does not accept the truth nor does it reject falsehood, and this is the greatest calamity that can strike the heart. Being neglectful [of dhikr] and following of whims and desires is a direct consequence of such a heart, which [further] extinguish the heart&#8217;s light and blinds its vision. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:<br />
<strong>&#8220;And do not obey him whose heart We have made to be neglectful of Our remembrance, one who follows his own whims and desires and whose affairs are furat [have gone beyond bounds and whose deeds have been lost].&#8221; [Soorah al-Kahf 18:28]. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>QUALITIES OF A GUIDE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when a worshipper desires to follow another person, then let him see: Is this person from the people of dhikr, or from the people who are negligent [about remembering Allaah]? Does this person judge in accordance with his whims and desires, or by the Revelation? So, if he judges by whims and desires then he is actually from those people who are negligent; those whose affairs have gone beyond bounds and whose deeds are lost.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The term furat [which occurs in the above verse] has been explained in many ways. It has been explained to mean:- (i) losing the rewards of that type of action which is essential to do, and in which lies success and happiness; (ii) exceeding the limits of something; (iii) being destroyed; and (iv) opposing the truth. Each of these sayings are very close in meaning to each other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point is that Allaah &#8211; the One free from all imperfections, the Most High &#8211; has prohibited following all those who possess such attributes. So it is absolutely essential that a person considers whether such attributes are found in his shaykh, or the person who&#8217;s example he follows, or the person that he obeys. If they are, then he should distance himself from such a person. However, if it is found that the person is, in most cases, pre-occupied with the dhikr of Allaah and with following the Sunnah, and his affairs do not exceed the limits, but rather he is judicious and resolute in his affairs, then he should cling to him very firmly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, there is no difference between the living and the dead, except with the dhikr of Allaah; since [the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam] said: &#8220;The example of one who remembers Allaah and someone who does not, is like the example between the living and the dead.&#8221;6</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Tafseer Ibn Kathir &#8211; Surah Fatihah</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[1]</strong><strong> Why the Devil is called Shaytan ?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Arabic language, Shaytan is derived from Shatana, which means the far thing. Hence, the Shaytan has a different nature than mankind, and his sinful ways are far away from every type of righteousness. It was also said that Shaytan is derived from Shata, (literally `burned&#8217;), because it was created from fire. Some scholars said that both meanings are correct, although they state that the first meaning is more plausible. Further, Siybawayh (the renowned Arab linguistic) said, &#8220;The Arabs say, `So-and-so has Tashaytan,&#8217; when he commits the act of the devils. If Shaytan was derived from Shata, they would have said, Tashayyata (rather than Tashaytan).&#8221; Hence, Shaytan is derived from the word that means, far away. This is why they call those who are rebellious (or mischievous) from among the Jinns and mankind a `Shaytan&#8217;. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And so We have appointed for every Prophet enemies ـ Shayatin (devils) among mankind and Jinn, inspiring one another with adorned speech as a delusion (or by way of deception)) (6:112).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, the Musnad by Imam Ahmad records that Abu Dharr said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Abu Dharr! Seek refuge with Allah from the devils of mankind and the Jinns.) Abu Dharr said, &#8220;I asked him , `Are there human devils&#8217; He said, (Yes.)&#8221; Furthermore, it is recorded in Sahih Muslim that Abu Dharr said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The woman, the donkey and the black dog interrupt the prayer (if they pass in front of those who do not pray behind a Sutrah, i.e. a barrier).) Abu Dharr said, &#8220;I said, `What is the difference between the black dog and the red or yellow dog&#8217; He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The black dog is a devil.).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Ibn Jarir At-Tabari recorded that `Umar bin Al-Khattab once rode a Berthawn (huge camel) which started to proceed arrogantly. `Umar kept striking the animal, but the animal kept walking in an arrogant manner. `Umar dismounted the animal and said, &#8220;By Allah! You have carried me on a Shaytan. I did not come down from it until after I had felt something strange in my heart.&#8221; This Hadith has an authentic chain of narrators.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[2] What does Isti`adhah mean</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Isti`adhah means, &#8220;I seek refuge with Allah from the cursed Satan so that he is prevented from affecting my religious or worldly affairs, or hindering me from adhering to what I was commanded, or luring me into what I was prohibited from.&#8221; Indeed, only Allah is able to prevent the evil of Satan from touching the son of Adam. This is why Allah allowed us to be lenient and kind with the human devil, so that his soft nature might cause him to refrain from the evil he is indulging in. However, Allah required us to seek refuge with Him from the evil of Satan, because he neither accepts bribes nor does kindness affect him, for he is pure evil. Thus, only He Who created Satan is able to stop his evil. This meaning is reiterated in only three Ayat in the Qur&#8217;an. Allah said in Surat Al-A`raf,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the foolish (i.e. don&#8217;t punish them).) (7:199)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is about dealing with human beings. He then said in the same Surah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And if an evil whisper comes to you from Shaytan, then seek refuge with Allah. Verily, He is Hearing, Knowing (7: 200).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah also said in Surat Al-Mu&#8217;minun,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Repel evil with that which is better. We are Best-Acquainted with the things they utter. And say: &#8220;My Lord! I seek refuge with You from the whisperings (suggestions) of the Shayatin (devils). And I seek refuge with You, My Lord! lest they should come near me.&#8221; (23:96-98).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further, Allah said in Surat As-Sajdah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal. Repel (the evil) with one which is better, then verily he, between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend. But none is granted it (the above quality) except those who are patient ـ and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion (of happiness in the Hereafter, i.e. Paradise and of a high moral character) in this world. And if an evil whisper from Shaytan tries to turn you away (from doing good), then seek refuge in Allah. Verily, He is the Hearing, the Knowing) (41:34-36).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[3] The Tafsir of Isti`adhah (seeking Refuge)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and stay away from the foolish (i.e. don&#8217;t punish them). And if an evil whisper comes to you from Shaytan (Satan), then seek refuge with Allah. Verily, He is Hearing, Knowing) (7:199-200),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Repel evil with that which is better. We are Best-Acquainted with things they utter. And say: &#8220;My Lord! I seek refuge with You from the whisperings (suggestions) of the Shayatin (devils). And I seek refuge with You, My Lord! lest they should come near me.&#8221;) (23:96-98) and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Repel (an evil) with one which is better, then verily he with whom there was enmity between you, (will become) as though he was a close friend. But none is granted it except those who are patient ـ and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion (of happiness in the Hereafter, i.e. Paradise and of a high moral character) in this world. And if an evil whisper from Shaytan tries to turn you away (O Muhammad ) (from doing good), then seek refuge in Allah. Verily, He is the Hearing, the Knowing.) (41:34-36) These are the only three Ayat that carry this meaning. Allah commanded that we be lenient human enemy, so that his soft nature might make him an ally and a supporter. He also commanded that we seek refuge from the satanic enemy, because the devil does not relent in his enmity if we treat him with kindness and leniency. The devil only seeks the destruction of the Son of Adam due to the vicious enmity and hatred he has always had towards man&#8217;s father, Adam. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Children of Adam! Let not Shaytan deceive you, as he got your parents ﴿Adam and Hawwa&#8217; (Eve)﴾ out of Paradise) (7:27),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surely, Shaytan is an enemy to you, so take (treat) him as an enemy. He only invites his Hizb (followers) that they may become the dwellers of the blazing Fire) (35:6) and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Will you then take him (Iblis) and his offspring as protectors and helpers rather than Me while they are enemies to you What an evil is the exchange for the Zalimun (polytheists, and wrongdoers, etc)) (18:50).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The devil assured Adam that he wanted to advise him, but he was lying. Hence, how would he treat us after he had vowed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;By Your might, then I will surely, mislead them all. Except Your chosen servants among them (i.e. faithful, obedient, true believers of Islamic Monotheism).&#8221;) (38:82-83)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So when you ﴿want to﴾ recite the Qur&#8217;an, seek refuge with Allah from Shaytan, the outcast (the cursed one). Verily, he has no power over those who believe and put their trust only in their Lord (Allah). His power is only over those who obey and follow him (Satan), and those who join partners with Him.) (16:98-100).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[4] The Meaning of Ar-Rajim</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ar-Rajim means, being expelled from all types of righteousness. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And indeed We have adorned the nearest heaven with lamps, and We have made such lamps Rujuman (as missiles) to drive away the Shayatin (devils)) (67:5).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah also said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, We have adorned the near heaven with the stars (for beauty). And to guard against every rebellious devil. They cannot listen to the higher group (angels) for they are pelted from every side. Outcast, and theirs is a constant (or painful) torment. Except such as snatch away something by stealing, and they are pursued by a flaming fire of piercing brightness) (37:6-10).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And indeed, We have put the big stars in the heaven and We beautified it for the beholders. And We have guarded it (near heaven) from every Shaytan Rajim (outcast Shaytan). Except him (devil) who steals the hearing then he is pursued by a clear flaming fire.) (15:16-18).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are several similar Ayat. It was also said that Rajim means, the person who throws or bombards things, because the devil throws doubts and evil thoughts in people&#8217;s hearts. The first meaning is more popular and accurate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[5] Virtues of the Isti`adhah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Isti`adhah cleanses the mouth from the foul speech that it has indulged in. It also purifies the mouth and prepares it to recite the speech of Allah. Further, the Isti`adhah entails seeking Allah&#8217;s help and acknowledging His ability to do everything. The Isti`adhah also affirms the servant&#8217;s meekness, weakness and inability to face the enemy of his inner evil, whom Allah alone, Who created this enemy, is able to repel and defeat. This enemy does not accept kindness, unlike the human enemy. There are three Ayat in the Qur&#8217;an that affirm this fact. Also, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, My servants (i.e. the true believers of Islamic Monotheism) ـ you have no authority over them. And sufficient is your Lord as a Guardian.) (17:65).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We should state here that the believers, whom the human enemies kill, become martyrs, while those who fall victim to the inner enemy &#8211; Satan &#8211; become bandits. Further, the believers who are defeated by the apparent enemy &#8211; disbelievers &#8211; gain a reward, while those defeated by the inner enemy earn a sin and become misguided. Since Satan sees man where man cannot see him, it is befitting that the believers seek refuge from Satan with Whom Satan cannot see. The Isti`adhah is a form of drawing closer to Allah and seeking refuge with Him from the evil of every evil creature.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[6] Is the Isti`adhah (seeking Refuge) required</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The majority of the scholars state that reciting the Isti`adhah (in the prayer and when reciting the Qur&#8217;an) is recommended and not required, and therefore, not reciting it does not constitute a sin. However, Ar-Razi recorded that `Ata&#8217; bin Abi Rabah said that the Isti`adhah is required in the prayer and when one reads the Qur&#8217;an. In support of `Ata&#8217;s statement, Ar-Razi relied upon the apparent meaning of the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then seek refuge.) He said that the Ayah contains a command that requires implementation. Also, the Prophet always said the Isti`adhah. In addition, the Isti`adhah wards off the evil of Satan, which is neccessary, the rule is that the means needed to implement a requirement of the religion is itself also required. And when one says, &#8220;I seek refuge with Allah from the cursed devil.&#8221; Then this will suffice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[7] Seeking Refuge before reciting the Qur&#8217;an</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So when you ﴿want to﴾ recite the Qur&#8217;an, seek refuge with Allah from Shaytan, the outcast (the cursed one).) meaning, before you recite the Qur&#8217;an. Similarly, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When you intend to offer As-Salah (the prayer), wash your faces and your hands (forearms)) (5:6) meaning, before you stand in prayer, as evident by the Hadiths that we mentioned. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, &#8220;When the Messenger of Allah would stand up in prayer at night, he would start his prayer with the Takbir (saying &#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8221;; Allah is Greater) and would then supplicate,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(All praise is due to You, O Allah, and also the thanks. Blessed be Your Name, Exalted be Your sovereignty, and there is no deity worthy of worship except You.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would then say thrice,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah,).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would then say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(I seek refuge with Allah, the Hearing, the Knowing, from the cursed Satan, from his coercion, lures to arrogance and poems.).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The four collectors of the Sunan recorded this Hadith, which At-Tirmidhi considered the most famous Hadith on this subject.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah recorded that Jubayr bin Mut`im said that his father said, &#8220;When the Messenger of Allah started the prayer, he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah is the Greater, truly the Greatest (thrice); all praise is due to Allah always (thrice); and all praise is due to Allah day and night (thrice). O Allah! I seek refuge with You from the cursed Satan, from his Hamz, Nafkh and Nafth.).&#8221; `Amr said, &#8220;The Hamz means asphyxiation, the Nafkh means arrogance, and the Nafth means poetry.&#8221; Also, Ibn Majah recorded that `Ali bin Al-Mundhir said that Ibn Fudayl narrated that `Ata&#8217; bin As-Sa&#8217;ib said that Abu `Abdur-Rahman As-Sulami said that Ibn Mas`ud said that the Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Allah! I seek refuge with You from the cursed devil, from his Hamz, Nafkh and Nafth.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8220;The Hamz means death, the Nafkh means arrogance, and the Nafth means poetry.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] Seeking Refuge with Allah when One is Angry</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his Musnad, Al-Hafiz Abu Ya`la Ahmad bin `Ali bin Al-Muthanna Al-Mawsili reported that Ubayy bin Ka`b said, &#8220;Two men disputed with each other in the presence of the Messenger of Allah and the nose of one of them became swollen because of extreme anger. The Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(I know of some words that if he said them, what he feels will go away, &#8216;I seek refuge with Allah from the cursed Satan.&#8217;)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nasa&#8217;i also recorded this Hadith in his book, Al-Yawm wal-Laylah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari recorded that Sulayman bin Surad said, &#8220;Two men disputed in the presence of the Prophet while we were sitting with him. One of them was cursing the other fellow and his face turned red due to anger. The Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(I know of a statement which if he said it, will make what he feels disappear, `I seek refuge with Allah from the cursed Satan.&#8217;) They said to the man, `Do you not hear what the Messenger of Allah is saying&#8217; He said, `I am not insane.&#8221;&#8217; Also, Muslim, Abu Dawud and An-Nasa&#8217;i recorded this Hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many other Hadiths about seeking refuge with Allah. One can find this subject in the books on supplication and the virtues of righteous, good deeds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-2a6" target="_blank"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>The bequest of Nooh – alayhi as-Sallam</strong></span></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">134 &#8211; &#8220;When death was approaching the Prophet of Allaah Nooh -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – he said to his son: I will narrate to you my bequest; I command you with two things and prohibit you from two things. I command you with <strong>&#8216;La ilaha ‘illa Allaah&#8217;</strong> (‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah) if the seven heavens and the seven earths were placed upon a scale and &#8216;La ilaha ‘illa Allaah&#8217; was placed on the other, then &#8216;La ilaha ‘illa Allaah&#8217; would be heavier.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">If the seven heavens and the seven earths were a closed off circle then &#8216;La ilaha ‘illa Allaah&#8217; would be able to break it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The second thing I command you with is <strong>Subhana Allaahi wa bihamdihi</strong> (Far is Allaah from imperfection and praise is for Him), since it is a supplication for everything, and by it the creation is given its provision. I prohibit you from shirk and pride.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8211;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">( the narrator said: I asked or someone asked) : O Messenger of Allaah as for shirk then we know about it, but what is pride? Is it that one of us has sandals with two good straps?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Messenger answered: No.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">He asked again: is it that one of us has companions and they sit with him?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Messenger again answered: No.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Someone asked: O Messenger of Allaah, what is pride?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">He said: <strong>ridiculing the truth and belittling the people and reviling them</strong>.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Silsilah Saheehah: 134</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>From the benefits of the hadeeth</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: there are many benefits from this hadeeth; I will suffice by indicating to some of them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- The permissibility of <strong>writing a bequest</strong> at the time of death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- The excellence of saying <strong>&#8216;La ilaha ‘illa Allaah&#8217;</strong> and saying <strong>Subhana Allaah</strong> and that they are a cause for the creation to receive provision from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- <strong>The scales</strong> on the Day of Judgment are true and real, and they have two pans. This is from the belief of the ahl-ul Sunnah, opposing that of the Mu&#8217;tazilah and their followers in the modern times. Who do not believe that which has been affirmed regarding &#8216;Aqeedah in the authentic Ahadeeth, with the claim that these are Ahkbaar al-Ahad (singular narrations) which do not convey certainty. I have exposed this claim in my book &#8216;with ustaadh at-Tantawee&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 &#8211; <strong>The seven earths are like the seven heavens</strong>. There are many Ahadeeth regarding this in Bukharee and Muslim and in other books. Perhaps one day we will have time to follow up these Ahadeeth and research them. What supports these Ahadeeth is the saying of Allaah Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217; aala : &lt;&lt; <em><span style="color:#008000;">I</span><span style="color:#008000;">t is Allaah Who has created seven heavens and of the earth the like thereof (i.e. seven).</span></em> &gt;&gt; I.e. they are similar in creation and in number.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, you should not pay any attention to the one who explains it away, there by it ends up as a negation of similarity as well as in numbers, being deceived by the Europeans and where their knowledge has reached to, from having gone up in to space however they do not know of seven earths, along with that they do not know about seven heavens. Will we reject the speech of Allaah and the speech of His Messenger due to the ignorance of the Europeans and others along with them, declaring that the more they increase their knowledge of the universe, the more they increase in their ignorance of it. Allaah the Most Great has spoken the truth when He said : &lt;&lt; <em><span style="color:#008000;">And of knowledge, you (mankind) have been given only a little</span></em>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 &#8211; <strong>That beautification with good clothing</strong> has nothing to do with pride what so ever. Rather, it is a matter which is permissible, because Allaah is Beautiful and He loves beauty, like the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – said regarding this issue, as is narrated by Muslim in his &#8216;Saheeh&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6- <strong>Pride</strong> which has been equated with Shirk will not allow entrance in to Paradise for the one who has an equivalent of an atoms worth. <span style="color:#ff6600;">That is the pride, which is rejecting the truth after it has been made clear, and defaming innocent people without truth</span>. So, the Muslim should be extremely cautious from being characterized with this type of pride, just like he should be extremely cautious from being characterized with the Shirk which places its companion in the Hell-fire for eternity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance</p>

<strong>Abu Muhammad al-Maghribee</strong><br />

<a href="http://followthesalaf.com/friday-khutbah-remember-me-i-will-remember-yo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://followthesalaf.com</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">فَاذْكُرُونِي أَذْكُرْكُمْ وَاشْكُرُواْ لِي وَلاَ تَكْفُرُونِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Therefore remember Me (by praying, glorifying, etc.). I will remember you, and be grateful to Me (for My countless Favours on you) and never be ungrateful to Me.</span> (Al-Baqarah 2:152)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a topic of utmost importance&#8230; Dhikr (remembrance) of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam as-Sa&#8217;adee, rahimahullah, said that the Dhikr of Allah is one of the GREATEST means to attain success!</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And look at how easy it is.  It doesn&#8217;t cost money.  It doesn&#8217;t make you tired or hungry.  It doesn&#8217;t take you away from your business.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet how many of us are negligent in this.  We should not simply reserve the time of prayer for the Remembrance of Allah.  Rather we should remember Him in all of our affairs; while buying and selling, working, walking here and there, while doing household duties, and more&#8230;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And may Allah make us all from those mentioned in Surat al-Ahzaab:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">وَالذَّاكِرِينَ اللَّهَ كَثِيراً وَالذَّاكِرَاتِ أَعَدَّ اللَّهُ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةً وَأَجْرًا عَظِيمًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;.And the men and the women who remember Allâh much with their hearts and tongues (while sitting, standing, lying, etc.), Allâh has prepared for them forgiveness and a great reward (i.e. Paradise).</span> (Al-Ahzab 33:35)</p>

</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This lecture was given on Saturday, May 5, 2012 at Masjid at-Tawheed in Stone Mountain, GA.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This talk is based on the book Fiqh al-Ad&#8217;iyyah wal-Adhkaar by our noble <strong>Sheikh Abdur-Razzaaq ibn Abdil-Muhsin al-Badr,</strong> and may Allah preserve them both.  This book was actually a set of classes given by the Sheikh on a Quran Radio Station in Saudi Arabia.  However, many of the students and scholars alike saw the tremendous benefit in these classes and requested him to compile them into a book.  He did this and then sent it to the noble <strong>Sheikh ibn Baaz</strong>, rahimahullah, who read it and praised it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You can also find this book as an ebook on the website of the Sheikh here :<br />
<a href="http://www.al-badr.net/web/download/ebook/muallafat3.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.al-badr.net/web/download/ebook/muallafat3.html</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And perhaps this will be an incentive for some to study the arabic language, in shaa Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the highlights of the talk is the mention of ibn Abbaas,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The shaytaan is sitting on the heart of the Son of Adam in wait.  Once that heart becomes heedless, he begins to whisper.  And when the person begins to remember Allah, he flees and is humiliated.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Allah&#8217;s Name Al-Latif being repeated 129 times</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: In some of the Masjids (mosques) here in the district of Bashshar, people repeat Al-Latif (i.e. The Kindest), one of Allah&#8217;s Most Beautiful Names, every Friday after finishing the study circle before the Adhan (call to Prayer) and the two sermons of Friday Salah. They repeat this Name 129 times. I asked the Imam about this practice and he told me that they do so for Allah to save them from His Wrath. What is your view and explanation of this practice?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Recitation of Allah&#8217;s Name (Al-Latif) 129 times before the Adhan of Friday Salah has nothing to do with the guidance of the Prophet (peace be upon him) nor his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) nor the Salaf (righteous predecessors). In fact this is one of the Bid`ah (innovation in religion) introduced to religion. It is authentically reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he said: <span style="color:#008000;">He who innovates things in our affairs for which there is no valid (reason) (commits sin) and these are to be rejected <span style="color:#000000;">[1]</span>.</span> i.e. Allah will not accept it from the person who does it. With regards to sitting in circles for lessons before the Adhan (call to Prayer) of the Friday Salah and the two sermons, it is forbidden according to the Hadith that is narrated by Al-Nasa&#8217;y from `Amr ibn Shu`ayb from his father from his grandfather: <span style="color:#000000;"><span style="color:#008000;">That the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade sitting in study circles in mosques before the Jumu`ah (Friday) Prayer</span> [2]</span></p>
<p>May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Naqshabandiyyah</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the ruling, in your understanding, on the Sufi Tariqahs (orders) in general, and the Naqshabandi Tariqah in particular?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">A: There is a lot of Bid`ah (rejected innovation in religion) practiced among the Sufi Tariqahs, such as holding Dhikr (Remembrance of Allah) circles and gatherings in rows, in which they all repeat the Name of Allah together, saying, &#8220;Allah, Allah,&#8221; one of His Attributes saying, &#8220;Hayy (Ever-Living), Hayy,&#8221; or &#8220;Qayyum (Self-Subsisting), Qayyum,&#8221; referring to Him through the pronoun &#8220;Huwa (He), Huwa,&#8221; or repeating meaningless sounds, such as &#8220;Ah, Ah.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">They also repeat other formulas of Dhikr, in which they beseech help from other than Allah, seek support of the dead, such as Al-Badawy, Al-Shadhily, Al-Jilany, and others.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Their books contain a lot of Bid`ah and scattered evil, especially Al-Naqshabandiyyah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">In their daily Wird (sayings recited with consistency), they repeat the Name of Allah in their hearts, without moving their lips. The Murids (students) evoke their shaykh and his Wird, believing that this will be a means of saving them on the Day of Resurrection. These practices are all abominable acts of Bi`dah; none of these forms of Dhikr were reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) in what was sent to him in the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is, however, authentically narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;Anyone who does something that we have not ordered (in worship) it will be rejected.&#8221; The Prophet also said, &#8220;Anyone who introduces something in this matter of our (the religion) that is not from it, it will be rejected.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

And verily, they hinder them from the path, but they think that they are guided aright!. Till, when (such a one) comes to Us, he says, &#8220;Would that between me and you were the distance of the two easts (or the east and west) a worst companion (indeed)!&#8221;</strong></span> (Surah Zukhruf 43:36-38)</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(And whosoever Ya`shu (turns away blindly))</strong></span> means, whoever willfully ignores and turns away</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(from the remembrance of the Most Gracious,)</strong></span> Al-`Asha (the root of Ya`sh) refers to weakness of vision; what is meant here is weakness of insight.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">(We appoint for him Shaytan to be a Qarin (a companion) to him.)</span></strong> This is like the Ayat:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#339966;">(And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been shown clearly to him)</span> (4:115),</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#339966;">(So when they turned away, Allah turned their hearts away)</span> (61:5), and</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#339966;">(And We have assigned for them intimate companions, who have made fair seeming to them, what was before them and what was behind them)</span> (41:25). Allah says here:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">(And verily, they hinder them from the path, but they think that they are guided aright! Until, when he comes to Us,)</span></strong> meaning, for this person who willfully neglects true guidance, We send to him a Shaytan to lead him astray and show him the path to Hell. When he comes before Allah on the Day of Resurrection, he will complain about the Shaytan who was appointed to accompany him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">(he says, &#8220;Would that between me and you were the distance of the two easts &#8211; a worst companion (indeed)!&#8221;)</span></strong> Some of them recited it; (حَتْى إِذَا جَاءَانَا)<strong><span style="color:#000000;"> (Till, when they both come to Us.)</span></strong> referring to the companion Shaytan and the one whom he accompanies.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahya was commanded by Allaah with Tawheed, singling out Allaah with all worship, without ascribing partners to Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imam Ahmad</strong> narrated that Al-Harith Al-Ash&#8217;ari said that the Prophet of Allaah <em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah commanded Yahya bin [son of] Zakariya to implement <strong>five commands</strong> and to order the Children of Israel to implement them, but Yahya was slow in carrying out these commands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Isa (Jesus, son of Mary) said to Yahya, &#8216;<em>You were ordered to implement five commands and to order the Children of Israel to implement them. So either order, or I will do it</em>.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahya said, &#8216;<em>My brother! I fear that if you do it before me, I will be punished or the earth will be shaken under my feet</em>.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, Yahya bin Zakariya called the Children of Israel to <em><strong>Bayt Al-Maqdis</strong></em> (Jerusalem), until they filled the Masjid. He sat on the balcony, thanked Allaah and praised him and then said, &#8216;A<em>llaah ordered me to implement five commandments and that I should order you to adhere to them</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">The first</span></strong> is that you <strong>worship Allaah alone</strong> and not associate any with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The example of this command is the example of a man who bought a servant from his money with paper or gold. The servant started to work for the master, but was paying the profits to another person. Who among you would like his servant to do that? Allaah created you and sustains you. Therefore, worship Him alone and do not associate anything with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also command you to <strong>pray</strong>, for Allaah directs His Face towards His servant&#8217;s face, as long as the servant does not turn away. So when you pray, do not turn your heads to and fro.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also command you to <strong>fast</strong>. The example of it is the example of a man in a group of men and he has some musk wrapped in a piece of cloth, and consequently, all of the group smells the scent of the wrapped musk. Verily, the odor of the mouth of a fasting person is better before Allaah than the scent of musk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also command you to give <strong>charity</strong>. The example of this is the example of a man who was captured by the enemy. They tied his hands to his neck and brought him forth to cut off his neck. He said to them, &#8216;Can I pay a ransom for myself?&#8217; He kept ransoming himself with small and large amounts until he liberated himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>I also command you to always remember Allaah. The example of this deed is that of a man who the enemy is tirelessly pursuing. He takes refuge in a fortified fort. When the servant remembers Allaah, he will be resorting to the best refuge from Satan.</strong></span></p>

<span style="color:#808080;">al-Shaykh ‘Abd al- ‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz, Vol. 11, pp. 188-190 &#8211; <a style="color:#808080;" href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;PageID=1804&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=14" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">alifta.net</a></span></p>
<p>From ‘Abdul ‘Aziz Bin ‘Abdullah Ibn Baz to those who receive this among Muslims. May Allah guide all Muslims and increase their knowledge and faith, amen!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-salamu ‘alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!) It gives me pleasure to remind my Muslim brothers that &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is of the Sunnah for a Muslim to say after each obligatory Salah, whether one is the Imam (the one who leads the congregational Salah), Ma&#8217;mum (a person being led by an Imam in Prayer) or Mufarid (a person who performs prayer alone) to say, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>three times</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>أَسْـتَغْفِرُ الله </strong><span style="color:#808000;"><strong><br />
&#8220;Astagfir Allah&#8221; </strong></span>[#1]<br />
(I ask Allah forgiveness)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> and then say,</p>
<p><strong>اللّهُـمَّ أَنْـتَ السَّلامُ ، وَمِـنْكَ السَّلام ، تَبارَكْتَ يا ذا الجَـلالِ وَالإِكْـرام</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>&#8220;Allahumma Anta Al-Salam Wa Minka Al-Salam, Tabarakta Wa Ta’alayta Ya-dhal-Jalali Wal-Ikram&#8221; </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;">[#1]</span><strong><br />
</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">(O Allah, You are Al-Salam [the One Who is free from all defects and deficiencies] and from You is all peace, blessed are You, Possessor of majesty and honor!)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one is Imam, one should turn facing the people. The Imam, those praying behind him, or a person offering Salah individually should say,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>لَا إِلهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>لَا حَوْلَ وَلَا قُوَّةَ إِلَّا بِاللهِ، لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ، وَلَا نَعْبُدُ إِلَّا إِيَّاهُ، لَه النِّعْمَةُ وَلَهُ الْفَضْلُ وَلَهُ الثَّنَاءُ الْحَسَنُ، لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ الدِّينَ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ الْكَافِرُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> اللَّهُمَّ لَا مَانِعَ لِمَا أَعْطَيْتَ، وَلَا مُعْطِيَ لِمَا مَنَعْتَ، وَلَا يَنْفَعُ ذَا الْجَدِّ مِنْكَ الْجَدُّ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Laa &#8216;ilaaha &#8216;illallaahu wahdahu laa shareeka lahu, lahul-mulku, wa lahul-hamdu wa Huwa &#8216;alaa kulli shay &#8216;in Qadeer. Laa hawla wa laa quwwata &#8216;illaa billaahi, laa &#8216;ilaaha &#8216;illallaahu, wa laa na&#8217;budu &#8216;illaa &#8216;iyyaahu, lahun-ni&#8217;matu wa lahul-fadhlu wa lahuth-thanaa&#8217;ul-hasanu, laa &#8216;ilaaha &#8216;illallaahu mukhliseena lahud-deena wa law karihal-kaafiroon. Allaahumma laa mani&#8217;a limaa &#8216;a&#8217;tayta, wa laa mu&#8217;tiya limaa mana&#8217;ta, wa laa yanfa&#8217;u thal-jaddi minkal-jadd.</strong></span> [#2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, alone, without any partner. To Allah belong all sovereignty and praise. He is Omnipotent over all things. There is no might nor power except with Allah. None has the right to be worshipped except Him. We worship none but Him. To Allah all favor, grace, and praise are due. None has the right to be worshipped except Allah and we are sincere in faith and devotion to Him although disbelievers detest it. Oh Allah! Oh Allah! None can prevent what You willed to give and none can grant what You have willed to prevent, and no wealth or majesty can benefit anyone, as from You is all wealth and majesty).</p>
<p>After offering Maghrib (Sunset) Prayer and Fajr (Dawn) Prayer one should say along with what is mentioned previously,</p>
<p>After completing the prayer:</p>
<p><strong>لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَحَدْهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ يُحْيِي وَيُمِيتُ، وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Laa &#8216;ilaaha &#8216;illallaahu wahdahu laa shareeka lahu, lahul-mulku wa lahul-hamdu yuhyee wa yumeetu wa Huwa &#8216;alaa kulli shay&#8217;in Qadeer</strong></span></p>
<p>[None has the right to be worshipped but Allah alone, Who has no partner. His is the dominion and His is the praise . He brings life and He causes death , and He is Able to do all things.]</p>
<p>After that, one is to say each of the following supplications <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>thirty three times</strong></span>;</p>
<p><strong>(a)</strong> <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>&#8220;Subhana Allah&#8221; </strong></span>(Glory is to Allah),</p>
<p><strong>(b) &#8220;</strong><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Al-Hamdu Lillah&#8221; </strong></span>(praise is due to Allah) and</p>
<p><strong>(c) </strong><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>&#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8221; </strong></span>(Allah is the Great),</p>
<p>and then <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>complete the hundred</strong></span> by saying,</p>
<p><strong>لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَحَدْهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ يُحْيِي وَيُمِيتُ، وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Laa &#8216;ilaaha &#8216;illallaahu wahdahu laa shareeka lahu, lahul-mulku wa lahul-hamdu yuhyee wa yumeetu wa Huwa &#8216;alaa kulli shay&#8217;in Qadeer</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is recommended for the Imam, Ma&#8217;mum, and Munfarid to recite these supplications <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>audibly</strong> </span>after each obligatory Salah in a low voice without disturbing others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is authentically reported in the two Sahih on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them) <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>that raising one&#8217;s voice in supplication after concluding the obligatory Salah was during the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him). Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them) said, &#8220;I used to know when they finished the Salah by this (supplications as they were said aloud) if I heard them.&#8221; </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;">[Al-Bukhari, Sahih, Book on Adhan, no. 841; Muslim, Sahih, Book on Masjids and places for Salah, no. 583; Al-Nasaa&#8217;y, Sunan, Book on Sujud-ul-Sahw, no. 1335; Abu Dawud, Sunan, Book on Salah, no. 1003; and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 1, p. 367.&#8217;]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, it is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not permissible to say these supplications collectively</span>. Each worshipper should recite them individually without observing the voice of others, because reciting supplications collectively is Bid’ah and has no basis in the divine Shari’ah (law) of Allah.</p>
<p>It is recommended for Imam, Ma&#8217;mum, and Munfarid to recite</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Ayat-ul-Kursy</strong></span> (the Qur’anic Verse of Allah’s Foot stool, Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:255<strong>)  </strong>[#3]  <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>inaudibly</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After that,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Surah-Al-Iklas </strong></span>(the Qur&#8217;an, Surah 112),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Surah-Al-Falaq </strong></span>(the Qur&#8217;an, Surah 113), and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Surah-Al-Nas </strong></span>(the Qur&#8217;an, Surah 114)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">inaudibly</span> </strong>after each obligatory Salah and <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>repeat them three times</strong> after the Maghrib (Sunset) and Fajr (Dawn) Salahs</span>. [#4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is preferable, for the authenticity of what we have mentioned above.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, His companions, and those who follow him rightfully till the Day of Judgment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">All Major Innovations and Deviations Begin Small and Insignificant Beware of small innovations because they grow until they become large.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the case with every innovation introduced in this Ummah. It began as something small, bearing resemblance to the truth which is why those who entered it were mislead and then were unable to leave it. So it grew and became the religion which they followed and thus deviated from the Straight Path and left Islaam.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] A striking example of how small innovations lead a  person into committing major innovations is found in the narration reported by ad-Daarimee in his Sunan (1/79)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Hakam bin al-Mubaarak informed us that Amr ibn Yahyaa said my father related from his father who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;We used to sit by the door of &#8216;Abdullah ibn Mas&#8217;ood before the Salaatul Ghadaat (morning prayer), so that when he came out we would walk with him to the masjid. (One day) Aboo Moosaa al-Ash&#8217;aree came to us and said, &#8220;Has Aboo &#8216;Abdur-Rahmaan come out yet?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; Therefore, he sat down with us until he came out. When he came out, we all stood along with him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">so Abu Moosaa said to him, &#8220;O Aboo &#8216;Abdur-Rahmaan I have just seen something in the masjid which I deemed to be evil, but all praise is for Allaah, I did not see anything except good!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He inquired, &#8220;Then what is it?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Aboo Moosaa) replied, &#8220;If you live you will see it. I saw in the masjid people sitting in circles awaiting the Prayer. In each circle they had pebbles in their hands and a man would say &#8216;repeat Allaahu Akbar a hundred times.&#8217; So they would repeat it a hundred times. Then he would say, &#8216;say Laa ilaaha illallaah a hundred times.&#8217; So they would say it a hundred times. Then he would say, &#8216;say Subhaanallaah a hundred times.&#8217; So they would say it a hundred times.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Ibn Mas&#8217;ood) asked, &#8220;What did you say to them?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Aboo Moosaa) said, &#8220;I did not say anything to them. Instead I waited to hear you view or what you declared.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Ibn Mas&#8217;ood) replied, &#8220;Would that you had ordered them to count up the evil deeds they acquired and assured them that their good deeds would not be lost!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then we went along with him (Ibn Mas&#8217;ood) until he came to one of these circles and stood and said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;What is this which I see you doing?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They replied, &#8220;O Aboo &#8216;Abdur-Rahmaan! These are pebbles upon which we are counting takbeer, tahleel and tasbeeh.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8220;(You should) count your evil deeds and I will assure you that none of your good deeds will be lost. Woe to you, O Ummah of Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)! How quickly you are rushing to your destruction! These are the Companions of your Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) and who are widespread (and numerous). There are his clothes which have not yet decayed and his eating utensils which are unbroken. By Him in Whose Hand is my soul! Either you are upon a deen better guided than the Deen of Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) or that you are opening the door of misguidance (from this bid&#8217;ah).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said, &#8220;O Aboo Abdur-Rahmaan! By Allaah, we only intended good.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8220;How many there are who intend good but do not achieve it. Indeed Allaah&#8217;s Messenger said to us &#8216;A people will recite the Qur&#8217;aan but it will not pass beyond their throats.&#8217; By Allaah! I do not know, perhaps most of them are from you.&#8221; Then he left them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar ibn Salamah (the sub-narrator) said: &#8220;We saw most of those people fighting against us on the day of Nahrawaan, along with the Khawaarij.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the introduction of ad-Daarimee, volume one, page 73 with an authentic chain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] The scholars differentiate between those innovations which take  a person outside the fold of Islaam (al-Bid&#8217;atul-Mukaffirah) and those which do not. So this is not to be understood unrestrictedly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: I hear some people reciting Takbir (saying: &#8220;Allahu Akbar [Allah is the Greatest]&#8221;) after each Salah (Prayer) during the Days of Tashriq (11th, 12th and 13th of Dhul-Hijjah) until the ‘Asr (Afternoon) Prayer of the third day. Is this correct or not?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is prescribed to recite an unrestricted [in terms of time. Ed] or a restricted Takbir during ‘Eid-ul-Adha (the Festival of the Sacrifice).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The unrestricted Takbir can be recited at any time from the beginning of Dhul-Hijjah until the last Day of Tashriq</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">The restricted Takbir should be recited after the Obligatory Daily Prayers starting from the Fajr (Dawn) Prayer of the Day of ‘Arafah until the ‘Asr Prayer on the last Day of Tashriq.</span> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The evidence for the permissibility of doing this is the Ijma‘ (consensus of scholars) and the practice of the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet, may Allah be pleased with them).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A Precious Gem: The Reward of Being Busy in the Service of Allah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the servant of Allah begins the day and the evening, without having any other concern except Allah, the Almighty, He will fulfill all his needs and relieve all his worries. He will empty the servant&#8217;s heart for the sake of His Love, his tongue will constantly remember Him and he will have the strength to perform religious duties for His sake.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if he begins the day and the evening, without having any other concern except the life of this world, Allah, the Almighty will cast worry and grief into his heart. He, the Almighty will leave him to himself, and keep his heart busy with things other than His Love. His tongue will not remember Allah but will only be concerned with the creation. He will use all his strength in things other than the sake of Allah, and he will remain busy in the service of creation. He will work very hard in the service of others. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Just like a bellows that pumps itself up and then squeezes itself to the utmost in the service of others. Therefore, whoever refuses to submit to Allah, to obey and love Him, will be afflicted with the servitude, love and service of creation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Almighty says in the Qur&#8217;an which means,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And whosoever turns away (blinds himself) from the remembrance of the Most Beneficent (Allah) (i.e. this Qur&#8217;an and worship of Allah), We appoint for him Shaitan (Satan devil) to be a Qarin (an intimate companion) to him&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(Az-Zukhruf, 43:36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sufyan bin &#8216;Uyaynah said, &#8220;You will never bring forward any famous proverb but I will bring the likeness of it from the Qur&#8217;an,&#8221; Thereupon someone said to him, &#8220;So where is in the Qur&#8217;an<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> &#8220;Give your fellow brother a date, and if he does not accept it then give him a firebrand.&#8221;</strong></span> He then recited the previous Qur&#8217;anic verse.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Among those who remember Allah are those who begin remembering with the tongue even if he is negligent. He continues to do so until his heart is involved too.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Others do not agree with that and do not start while in a state of negligence, but instead wait until the heart is ready. He begins with his heart and then involves his tongue in remembrance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first supplication goes from his tongue to his heart and the second from his heart to his tongue without emptying any of the contents of his heart. He just waits until he feels that the utterance is ready to be verbalized. When he feels that his heart will utter! then the heart&#8217;s utterance would pass to verbal utterance. Then he would engross himself in that until he finds that every part of his being is supplicating Allah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The best and more useful kind of supplication is what the heart and tongue are involved in, to be from among the prophetic supplications, and whoever is reciting it feels its meaning and aims.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatawaa noor &#8216;ala adarb tape no321</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">May Allah extend your life! This is the questioner, Abu Abdullah, he says in the first question, If a person sees what amazes him, does he say Maashaa Allah Tabaarak Allah (As Allah wills, blessed is Allah!), or Maashaa Allah Tabaarak Allah Laa Quwwata illah billah (As Allah wills, blessed is Allah, there is no strength except with Allah) and are they all correct?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praises are due to Allah, Lord of the worlds and prayer and salutation upon our prophet, Muhammad, his family, his companions and those who follow them in goodness until the Day of Judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a person sees that which amazes (pleases) him, pertaining to his wealth, then he should say <strong>Maashaa Allah Laa Quwwata illa billah</strong>, just as in the story of the companion of the two gardens, when his companion said to him: It was better for you to say, when you entered your garden: That which Allah wills there is no power except with Allah. This is if he sees something amazing (pleasing) with his wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he sees it in other than himself then he should say <strong>Barakallahu Alaihi </strong>(May Allah bless it for him) or a statement similar to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if he sees something that amazes (pleases) him from the matters of the Dunya (world) he should say: <strong>Labbaik, Innal Aish, Aishul Aakhirah</strong>, as the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam ) used to say. So he says Labbaik meaning an answer to you then he said verily the (real) life is the life of the hereafter. He makes it firm within himself at the same instance that the Dunya and whatever is within it does not remain and there is not any life in it but verily the real life is the life of the hereafter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tafseer Ibn Katheer &#8211; Suratul Baqarah [Surah No.2]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;">(155. And certainly, We shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits, but give glad tidings to As-Sabirin (the patient).)</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966;"> (156. Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: &#8220;Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.&#8221;)</span><br />
<span style="color:#339966;"> (157. They are those on whom are the Salawat (i.e., who are blessed and will be forgiven) from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His mercy, and it is they who are the guided ones.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah informs us that He tests and tries His servants, just as He said in another Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And surely, We shall try you till We test those who strive hard (for the cause of Allah) and As-Sabirin (the patient), and We shall test your facts (i.e., the one who is a liar, and the one who is truthful).)</strong> (47:31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, He tests them with the bounty sometimes and sometimes with the afflictions of fear and hunger. Allah said in another Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So Allah made it taste extreme of hunger (famine) and fear.) (16:112)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The frightened and the hungry persons show the effects of the affliction outwardly and this is why Allah has used here the word `Libas&#8217; (cover or clothes) of fear and hunger. In the Ayat above, Allah used the words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(with something of fear, hunger,) meaning, a little of each. Then (Allah said),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(loss of wealth,) meaning, some of the wealth will be destroyed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(lives) meaning, losing friends, relatives and loved ones to death,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and fruits,) meaning, the gardens and the farms will not produce the usual or expected amounts. This is why Allah said next:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(but give glad tidings to As-Sabirin (the patient).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then explained whom He meant by `the patient&#8217; whom He praised:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: &#8220;Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.&#8221;)</strong> meaning, those who recite this statement to comfort themselves in the face of their loss, know that they belong to Allah and that He does what He wills with His servants. They also know that nothing and no deed, even if it was the weight of an atom, will be lost with Allah on the Day of Resurrection. These facts thus compel them to admit that they are Allah&#8217;s servants and that their return will be to Him in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(They are those on whom are the Salawat (i. e., who are blessed and will be forgiven)</strong> from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His mercy,) meaning, Allah&#8217;s praise and mercy will be with them. Sa`id bin Jubayr added, &#8220;Meaning, safety from the torment.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(and it is they who are the guided ones.)</strong> `Umar bin Al-Khattab commented: &#8220;What righteous things, and what a great heights.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(They are those on whom are the Salawat from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His mercy) are the two righteous things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and it is they who are the guided ones) are the heights.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The heights means more rewards, and these people will be awarded their rewards and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are several Ahadith that mention the <strong>rewards of admitting</strong> that the return is to Allah by saying:(&#8220;Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.&#8221;) when afflictions strike.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For instance, Imam Ahmad reported that Umm Salamah narrated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once, Abu Salamah came back after he was with Allah&#8217;s Messenger and said: I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger recite a statement that made me delighted. He said:(No Muslim is struck with an affliction and then says Istirja` when the affliction strikes, and then says: `O Allah! Reward me for my loss and give me what is better than it,&#8217; but Allah will do just that.) Umm Salamah said: So I memorized these words. When Abu Salamah died I said Istirja` and said: &#8220;O Allah! Compensate me for my loss and give me what is better than it.&#8221; I then thought about it and said, &#8220;Who is better than Abu Salamah&#8221; When my `Iddah (the period of time before the widow or divorced woman can remarry) finished, Allah&#8217;s Messenger asked for permission to see me while I was dyeing a skin that I had. I washed my hands, gave him permission to enter and handed him a pillow, and he sat on it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then asked me for marriage and when he finished his speech, I said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! It is not because I do not want you, but I am very jealous and I fear that you might experience some wrong mannerism from me for which Allah would punish me. I am old and have children.&#8221; He said: (As for the jealousy that you mentioned, Allah the Exalted will remove it from you. As for your being old as you mentioned, I have suffered what you have suffered. And for your having children, they are my children too.) She said, &#8220;I have surrendered to Allah&#8217;s Messenger.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Messenger married her and Umm Salamah said later, &#8220;Allah compensated me with who is better than Abu Salamah: Allah&#8217;s Messenger .&#8217; [ Muslim reported a shorter version of this Hadith]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p>&#8220;A statement that does not begin with praise of Allah and blessing upon me, remains deficient and bereft of blessings.&#8221; <strong>(Abu Dawud, 13/184)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same has been narrated about <em>Bismillah</em> also.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabic letter <em>Baa</em> in <em>Bismillah </em>stands for seeking help. From a syntactical point of view it relates to a noun or verb dropped by aphasia. The Quran contains examples of its relationship with both verb and noun. The example of verb is <em>Iqra bism-e-rabbika</em> (Read: &#8220;In the Name of your Lord&#8230;&#8221;) and the example of noun is <em>Bismillah-e-majreha</em> (In the Name of Allah will be its moving course).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Hamd</em> means praising orally a grace regardless of being benefited by it, be it a favour or anything else, such as a statement that &#8216;I did <em>Hamd</em> of a certain person in connection with the prize he had been awarded or for his feat of boldness.&#8217; <em>Shukr</em> (thanking) is that praise which is done orally or emotionally or by any other organ of the body in lieu of some favour. This shows that the word <em>Hamd</em> is commonly used in one situation and the <em>Shukr </em>in another situation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Describing the mutual difference between<em> Hamd </em>and <em>Madh</em> (praise) Ibn Al-Qaiyim writes that<em> Hamd</em> denotes stating qualities with love and respect; and <em>Madh</em> denotes only declaration of the quality, it does not necessarily imply love and respect. That is why the connotation of<em> Hamd</em> is of a special nature and that of <em>Madh</em> a general.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the word<em> Al-Hamdu</em>, the prefix <em>Al </em>has been used comprehensiveness meaning that it includes all forms of <em>Hamd. </em>Some people have described it as a generic noun and have maintained that perfect <em>Hamd</em> is affirmed only for Allah. This word shows that Allah has all the Attributes of perfection and beauty.</p>
