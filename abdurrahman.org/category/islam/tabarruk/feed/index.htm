<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Kitāb-ut-Tawheed : Chapter 9:<br />
</strong><strong>Whoever seeks Blessing through a tree,a Stone, or the like</strong></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>عن أبي واقد الليثي، قال: خرجنا مع رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم إلى حنين ونحن حدثاء عهد بكفر، وللمشركين سدرة يعكفون عندها وينوطون بها أسلحتهم، يقال لها: ذات أنواط، فمررنا بسدرة فقلنا: يا رسول الله أجعل لنا ذات أنواط كما لهم ذات أنواط فقال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم: (الله أكبر! إنها السنن، قلتم ـ والذي نفسي بيده ـ كما قالت بنو إسرائيل لموسى: (<span style="color:#008000;">اجعل لنا إلهاً كما لهم آلهة قال إنكم قوم تجهلون</span>)  (لتركبن سنن من كان قبلكم</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(رواه الترمذي وصححه )</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Abū Wāqid al-Laythī said: &#8220;We went with Allah&#8217;s Messenger to Ḥunayn while we had just recently left disbelief. The mushrikīn had a lote tree which they used to frequent and hang their swords upon. They called it <em>thāt al-anwāt </em></strong>(possessor of the medals of honor)<strong>. Afterward, we passed by </strong>(another)<strong> lote tree, so we said: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8216;O Messenger of Allah, make a <em>thāt al-anwāt</em> for us like their <em>thāt al-anwāt</em>.&#8217; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>«Allahu Akbar! This way that you have mentioned, by the One in whose Hand my soul is, is just like what the children of Isrā&#8217;īl asked Mūsā:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O Mūsā! Make for us an ilahān (a god) as they have āliha (gods). He said: &#8216;Verily, you are a people who are behaving ignorantly</strong></span>.&#8217;» [Sūrah al-A&#8217;rāf (7):138]</p>
<p><strong>You will follow the way of those before you.»</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[Hadith Reported by at-Tirmithī no. 2181 and he graded it ḥasan ṣaḥīḥ. It is also recorded by others. Shaykh Al-Albānī graded it ṣaḥīḥ in Ṣaḥīḥ al-Jāmī&#8217; no. 3601.]</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">It was authentically reported from Amir Al-Mu’minin (Commander of the Believers)</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> `Umar ibn Al-Khattab </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be pleased with him) that he <strong>condemned pursuing the monuments of prophets</strong> and ordered that the tree under which the Bay`ah of</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Hudaybiyah </span><span style="color:#000000;">took place be cut, when he learned that some people began going there. This was meant to protect Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah) and eliminate the means leading to Shirk, Bid`ah and superstitions related to Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic time of ignorance).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Below is some of what was mentioned by some scholars in this regard, so that you will be well informed about this matter.</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imam Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Al-Walid Al-Tartushy</strong> </span><span style="color:#000000;">said in his book &#8216;<strong>Al-Hawadith wal-Bida</strong>`&#8217;, a chapter entitled &#8216;A Chapter on Forms of Bid`ah&#8217;, p. 135,</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> &#8220;Al-Ma`rur ibn Suwayd </span><span style="color:#000000;">said, &#8216;When we went to perform Hajj with</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> `Umar ibn Al-Khattab </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be pleased with him), we saw a Masjid (mosque) on the way, so people began offering Salah (Prayer) in it.&#8217;</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> `Umar </span><span style="color:#000000;">said, &#8220;O, people! Those who were before you perished because of honoring such sites, until they took them as places of worship. If one arrives there at the time of Salah, one should offer Salah there; otherwise they should leave.'&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#000000;">On p. 141, he said on the authority of</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Muhammad ibn Waddah </span><span style="color:#000000;">that</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> `Umar ibn Al-Khattab </span><span style="color:#000000;">ordered that the tree under which the Prophet (peace be upon him) was given the Bay`ah be cut, because people began to visit it and</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> `Umar </span><span style="color:#000000;">feared that they might be misled.</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Ibn Waddah</span><span style="color:#000000;">said:</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> &#8220;Malik </span><span style="color:#000000;">and other scholars of</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Madinah </span><span style="color:#000000;">hated going to the Masjids and Islamic monuments in Al-Madinah except</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Quba&#8217; </span><span style="color:#000000;">and</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Uhud. </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Sufyan </span><span style="color:#000000;">entered</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Aqsa Mosque </span><span style="color:#000000;">and offered Salah there, but he did not inquire about those monuments or offer Salah there; and others who imitated him did the same.&#8221;</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Ibn Waddah </span><span style="color:#000000;">then said: &#8220;How many matters are now considered acceptable by many people that were once considered Munkar. People try to get closer to Allah through means that drive them further from Allah.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Shaykh-ul-Islam</span></strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"><strong> Ibn Taymiyyah</strong> </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be merciful to him) said in his book &#8216;<strong>Majmu` Al-Fatawa</strong>&#8216;, Vol. 26, P. 133:</span><a style="color:#000000;" name="AsforclimbingMountAl-Rahmah"></a></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;">&#8220;As for climbing Mount Al-Rahmah (at<span id="ContentParagraph"> `Arafah) </span>it is neither an act of Sunnah (supererogatory act of worship following the example of the Prophet) nor Mustahab (desirable).</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;">Nor is it Mustahab to enter the dome above it, called the Dome of Adam, to offer Salah there, or circumambulate it, as this is one of the major sins.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;">It is neither Mustahab to enter the Masjids at the place of Jamarat (stone pillars at which pebbles are thrown during Hajj) or offer Salah there. Circumambulation around them, the Stone, the room of the Prophet (peace be upon him) or anything other than the Ka`bah is a grave Bid`ah.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">He also said on p. 144 of the same section, </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;As for visiting the Masjids that were built in</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Makkah </span><span style="color:#000000;">other than</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Masjid Al-Haram </span><span style="color:#000000;">(the Sacred Mosque in Makkah), such as the one by the foot of</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Safa, </span><span style="color:#000000;">the one by the</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> foot of Abu Qubays,</span><span style="color:#000000;">and such Masjids that were built at the sites of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his Sahabah, such as Masjid Al-Mawlid (the Prophet&#8217;s birthday) and others, it is neither a Sunnah to visit these places, nor was it preferable by any of the Imams. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#000000;">It is only permissible to visit</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Masjid Al-Haram </span><span style="color:#000000;">in particular, and the sacred ritual places, such as</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> `Arafah, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Muzdalifah, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Mina, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Al-Safa and Al-Marwah. </span><span style="color:#000000;">However, visiting the mountains and areas around</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Makkah </span><span style="color:#000000;">other than</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> `Arafah, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Muzdalifah </span><span style="color:#000000;">and</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Mina, </span><span style="color:#000000;">such as</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Hira&#8217; Mountain, </span><span style="color:#000000;">the mountain at</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Mina </span><span style="color:#000000;">where it is claimed that there was the sacrifice dome and such places. It is not a Sunnah related to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), but rather a Bid`ah. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#000000;">The same applies to the Masjids built at the sites said to be monuments. The Prophet (peace be upon him) did not permit visiting any of these.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">In vol. 27, p. 134, of the same book, he also said:</span><a style="color:#000000;" name="Somepeoplemightaskwhetherit"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#333300;">&#8220;Some people might ask whether it is permissible to glorify a place where there is worn-out things and saffron as the Prophet (peace be upon him) was seen there. Glorification of such places and turning them into Masjids is an imitation of the People of the Book whom we are prohibited to imitate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#333300;">It was authentically reported that<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Umar ibn Al-Khattab </span>(may Allah be pleased with him) was traveling when he saw a group of people hurrying to a place. He asked, &#8216;What is this?&#8217; People replied, &#8216;It is a place where the Prophet (peace be upon him) offered Salah.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Do you want to turn the sites of your prophet into Masjids? If the time of Salah comes while a person is there, they can offer Salah there; otherwise they should leave.&#8217;<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Umar </span>said this in the presence of a number of Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them). It is known that the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to offer Salah in many places while traveling, and the people would see him in their sleep in different places. However, the Salaf did not turn any of these into Masjids or tourist sites. If this door is opened, many of the Muslim lands will be turned into Masjids and tourist sites, as people still dream that the Prophet (peace be upon him) visits them at home. Establishing such tourist sites is a loathed Bid`ah. Allah has not ordered that the places of prophets be turned into a Musalla (a place for Prayer) except Maqam Ibrahim (the Station of Ibrahim) in His statement: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 125" target="_blank" name="And(remember)whenWemadethe"></a>And take you (people) the Maqâm (place) of Ibrâhîm (Abraham) [or the stone on which Ibrâhîm (Abraham) عليه السلام stood while he was building the Ka‘bah] as a place of prayer (for some of your prayers, e.g. Two Rak‘at after the Tawâf of the Ka‘bahat Makkah)<img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#000000;">He has neither ordered that a stone be touched and kissed except Al-Hajar Al-Aswad (the Black Stone in a corner of the Ka`bah), or Salah be directed to a building other than</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Bayt-ul-Haram </span><span style="color:#000000;">(the Sacred House, another name for the Ka`bah). According to the Ijma` (consensus) of the Muslims, it is impermissible to make analogies in this matter. It is tantamount to asking the people to perform Hajj to a place other than</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Bayt-ul-`Atiq </span><span style="color:#000000;">or observe Sawm (fasting) in a month other than Ramadan, and so on.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">He then said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;The rest of the issues have been definitely answered. If a person offers Salah or recites Du`a&#8217; (supplication) intentionally at the place of a prophet&#8217;s footprints or site; the grave of a Sahaby (Companion of the Prophet), a sheikh, or one of Ahl-ul-Bayt (members of the Prophet&#8217;s extended Muslim family), a tower or a cave, this is a rejected Bid`ah in Islam, as neither the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) nor the early generation of Muslims or those who followed them in righteousness did so. Not one of the Muslim Imams preferred it; rather, it is a means leading to Shirk.&#8221; There is elaboration on this elsewhere. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">He then said on p. 500 in the same section,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#000000;"> &#8220;After Islam, none of the Sahabah used to go to Hira&#8217; Cave on purpose. It is impermissible for us to seek the caves of mountains or sit in seclusion there&#8230;As for sitting in seclusion in caves and traveling for a mountain to seek blessings, such as</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Tur Mountain, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Mount Hira&#8217;, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Mount Thawr </span><span style="color:#000000;">and others, it is impermissible for us. The Prophet (peace be upon him) stated: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;" name="Donotsetoutonajourneyexcept"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="18171" class="tip"></span>Do not set out on a journey except to three Masjids: Al-Masjid Al-Haram, this mosque of mine (the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque), and Al-Aqsa Mosque (in Jerusalem).</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">End of quote.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ibn Al-Qayyim</strong> </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be merciful to him) wrote on p. 204 of his book <strong>Ighathat Al-Lahfan min Masa&#8217;id Al-Shaytan</strong>, after warning against visiting graves to seek blessings in them and recite Du`a&#8217; there:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><a style="color:#000000;" name="TheSahabahdisapprovedofthings"></a><span style="color:#333300;">&#8220;The Sahabah disapproved of things much more trivial than this. Many people narrated from<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Ma&#8217;rur ibn Suwayd </span>that he offered Fajr (Dawn) Prayer with<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Umar ibn Al-Khattab </span>(may Allah be pleased with him) on the way to<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Makkah, </span>and then people began spreading everywhere. He asked, &#8216;Where are these people going?&#8217; It was said, &#8216;O Amir Al-Mu&#8217;minin, they go to offer Salah in a Masjid where the Prophet (peace be upon him) offered Salah.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Those who were before you perished because of this; they used to follow the traces of their prophets and turn them into places of `Ibadah. If the time of Salah comes while you are in such places, offer Salah there; otherwise you should leave, and do not go there intentionally.&#8217;<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Umar </span>(may Allah be pleased with him) also uprooted the tree under which the Sahabah made the Bay`ah to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him).&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">End of quote.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Scholars stated much about this issue. We hope that what we have already mentioned is enough and convincing for those who seek the truth. Having known the previously mentioned pieces of evidence from Shari`ah and the opinions of scholars on this issue, you would know that the call of the writer for glorifying Islamic monuments, such as</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Thawr Cave, </span><span style="color:#000000;">the place where Al-Rudwan Bay`ah took place and others; reconstructing what was demolished of them; paving roads leading to them; making elevators or cable cars for high places such as the two mentioned caves; turning them into tourist sites; erecting signs to them; and appointing tourist guides for the visitors is all contrary to Islamic Shari`ah, which provides for achieving and boosting interests, and preventing and curbing evil, as well as blocking the means leading to Shirk and Bid`ah. You would also know that we should prevent Bid`ah and the means leading to Shirk, even if those who call for them have good intentions, as they lead to great evil, change the rites of Islam, and create new places and forms of `Ibadah that were not prescribed by Allah or His Messenger (peace be upon him). Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5: 3" target="_blank" name="Forbiddentoyou(forfood)are:"></a><span style="color:#008000;">This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islâm as your religion.</span></span><span style="color:#008000;"><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Anything that was not prescribed in the era of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) cannot be made permissible later. If this door is opened, Islam will be misrepresented and innovated ideas will enter it. Muslims will thus become like</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> the Jews </span><span style="color:#000000;">and</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> the Christians </span><span style="color:#000000;">in their manipulating their faiths and changing them according to their whims and desires. That is why Imam</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Malik ibn Anas, </span><span style="color:#000000;">the Imam of Madinah (may Allah be merciful to him), made a great statement that all the scholars agreed upon, saying: &#8220;The last generations of this Ummah (nation) will not succeeded except when they resort to what made the former followers succeed.&#8221; He meant that what brought success to the first generation was adherence to the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), following their rules and avoiding what contradicts them. The last generations of this Ummah will not succeed unless they resort to what made the former generations succeed. He (may Allah be merciful to him) has spoken the truth. When people corrupted their faith, created Bid`ah and founded new ways, they divided into different sects, became confused with every sect rejoicing in what they had. Their enemies attacked them, taking advantage of discrepancy among them, weakness of faith, difference in intentions, and fanaticism of every sect to their misleading ways and Bid`ah, until the conditions of the Muslims have reached the current weakness and many nations have attacked them. All Muslims should return to their correct faith adhering to its just rules, learning from the original sources of the Qur&#8217;an and the authentic Sunnah, and advising each other accordingly. We must cooperate to achieve this in all fields, whether legislative, economic, political, social or others; and avoid anything that contradicts it or leads to ambiguity. In this manner Muslims will restore their lost dignity and their previous glory, and Allah will make them triumph over their enemies and rule the world</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwas &gt; Sha`ban Fatwas &gt; Visits made during Sha‘ban to the grave of Prophet Hud</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Source : alifta.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">Q: A brother from Hadramawt asks: During the month of Sha‘ban, people come to out town Hadramawt to visit the grave of Prophet Hud (Peace be upon him), whose grave is thought to be located in Al-Ahqaf, near Hadramawt. The journey there takes five hours by car. With this false belief, from our viewpoint, a great number of people, i.e. thousands of people, drive to this place, where they ascend a mountain to a room at the top of it that contains two or three graves. They lean against these graves, touch them, weep over them, call upon them and seek their blessings. When they have finished doing this they descend. They do this for about four days. They liken this practice to Sa‘y (going between Safa and Marwah during Hajj). They appointed certain places incarnating the body of Prophet Hud (peace be upon him): There is a pebble they call the nose of Prophet Hud; there is another smooth one that has the trace of his foot, which is called Al-Dahqah and its length is about three cubits; and a third one is claimed to be his feet wherein women hoping for husbands put some pebbles in the hope that they will find what they aspire to and similarly this is practiced by wives hoping to have babies. They claim that it is advised that one should pay this visit and that the predecessors among the Awliya’ (pious people) established this visit and called people to make it, like for example, the Faqih (Jurisprudent) immigrating to Allah, Ahmad ibn ‘Isa, and so on. They continue in this way describing this practice. O Shaykh ‘Abdul-‘Aziz finally, we seek your instruction and advice. What should they do?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: First: The location of the grave of Allah’s Prophet, Hud (Peace be upon him), is not known. Their claim that this grave belongs to Prophet Hud in Al-Ahqaf is baseless. The only known graves among those attributed to the Prophets are that of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and that of Ibrahim Al-Khalil (Abraham, peace be upon him) in the well-known cave in Al-Khalil, the Levant, Palestine. The graves of Prophets Hud, Salih, Nuh, and the other prophets are not known. Likewise, the claim that the grave of Prophet Hud lies in Al-Ahqaf and that it is in the room mentioned by the inquirer, is all baseless and false. No graves are known among the graves of the Prophets other than that of our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and that of Al-Khalil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What these people are doing is Munkar (unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect) and is not permissible. Rather, it is one of the forbidden acts tantamount to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). Supplicating to Allah’s Prophet Hud and Tabarruk (seeking blessings) through the pebbles claimed to belong to his grave and his body are acts tantamount to major Shirk. Seeking blessings through this; seeking husbands or offspring are all Munkar and among the forbidden acts that are tantamount to Shirk. Children are to be sought only from Allah, Who (may He be Glorified and Exalted) gives progeny. The same applies to hoping for a husband as this is to be sought from Allah, not from stones attributed to Hud or a grave attributed to Hud. One’s needs cannot be demanded from Hud himself (peace be upon him). One cannot say: “O Hud, grant us children or bless them for us.” This is to be directed to Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted) Alone. All that is practiced by the ignorant people in this regard is Munkar that must be condemned. Muslims of sound intellect have to forbid them from this and scholars have to warn them against this. They should not be misled by the practice of ignorant people or acts introduced by some Sufis or some idolaters in this regard; all this is wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Ibadah (worship) is an exclusive Right of Allah (may He be Exalted):Surah Al-Fatihah, 1: 5 You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything). It is Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted) Who confers blessings that cannot be sought from neither stones, nor graves, nor trees, nor from Allah’s Prophet, Hud, nor from anyone else. When the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) saw a tree (called Dhat Anwat) that was loved by the Kafirs (disbelievers) who would hang their weapons on it hoping for its blessing, they asked the Prophet (peace be upon him), saying: “O Messenger of Allah! Make for us a Dhat Anwat as they have a Dhat Anwat.” He (peace be upon him) said, “Allahu Akbar (Allah is the Greatest)! Verily these are the ways of earlier nations. By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, you have said exactly as the Children of Israel had said to Musa (Moses): Make for us an ilah (a god) as they have alihah (gods).” The Prophet (peace be upon him) likened their saying: &#8220;Make for us a Dhat Anwat…&#8221; to the saying of the Children of Israel: &#8220;Make for us an ilah (a god)&#8230;&#8221; It is well-known that associating another god with Allah is major Kufr (disbelief). Accordingly, it is not permissible to associate any other god with Allah, neither from idols, nor from trees, nor from angels, nor from the Messengers, nor from any human beings or Jinn. Rather, ‘Ibadah is due only to Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted). The Right of Allah over His Slaves is that they should worship Him and not associate anything with Him. It is Allah (may He be Glorified) Who says:Surah Al-Baiyyinah, 98: 5 And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allâh, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him) And:Surah Al-Isra&#8217;, 17: 23 And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And:<br />
Surah Ghafir, 40: 14 So, call you (O Muhammad peace be upon him and the believers) upon (or invoke) Allâh making (your) worship pure for Him (Alone) (by worshipping none but Him and by doing religious deeds sincerely for Allâh’s sake only and not to show off and not to set up rivals with Him in worship), however much the disbelievers (in the Oneness of Allâh) may hate (it). And:Surah Al-Zumar, 39: 2 So worship Allâh (Alone) by doing religious deeds sincerely for Allâh’s sake only. The Prophet (peace be upon him) after asking Mu‘adh about the Right of Allah over His Slaves to which Mu‘adh answered, &#8220;Allah and His Messenger know best&#8221;, taught him saying, The Right of Allah over His Slaves is that they should worship Him and not associate anything with Him. Thus, the Right of Allah over His Slaves is that they should worship Him Alone in their making Du‘a’ (supplication), asking help, Salah (Prayer), Sawm (Fasting), sacrificing animals, vowing and seeking blessings. All this must be dedicated to Allah Alone (may He be Glorified and Exalted):Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 163 And your Ilâh (God) is One Ilâh (God &#8211; Allâh), Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (there is none who has the right to be worshipped but He), the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: If you ask, ask Allah; and if you seek help, seek help from Allah. The same ruling applies to what is practiced by some ignorant people by the grave of the Prophet (peace be upon him) regarding supplicating to him or seeking his help or support. All these are forbidden acts that are tantamount to Shirk. The same applies to what is practiced by some people by the grave of Al-Badawy, Al-Husayn ibn ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), or by the grave of Ibn ‘Araby in Syria or by the grave of Shaykh ‘Abdul-Qadir Al-Jilany in Iraq. With regard to the practices of ignorant people who call upon deceased people and seek their help, all this is tantamount to Kufr and Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory: to dedicate all ‘Ibadah (worship) to Allah Alone, to call upon none but Him (may He be Glorified and Exalted), and not to seek victory, support or remedy neither from the deceased, nor from trees or stones. All this is to be sought from Allah Alone (may He be Glorified and Exalted). Human beings are to be asked for what is within their ability to do, provided that they are alive and present, not dead or absent; the dead should not be sought out for anything. Rather, one can seek the help of those who are alive and present, if this is within their capacity. One can say: O brother, help me to do such and such a thing, if this is within their capacity; loan us such and such a thing; or help me repair my house or my car. There is nothing wrong to say this verbally, by sending a letter, or by phoning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the deceased, the trees, stones, idols, or stars, are not to be asked for anything because this is tantamount to major Shirk, may Allah protect us! In fact, this is tantamount to worshipping them besides or instead of Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted). Thus, Muslims should beware of what Allah forbade them from. They should have sound knowledge of their religion and address their questions to qualified scholars who are well-known for adhering to the Sunnah and have correct ‘Aqidah (creed). People should ask them about the Religion of Allah and about what is ambiguous for them. They should not blindly follow the customs and practices that are only done by ignorant people. Allah (may He be Glorified) says:Surah Al-An`am, 6: 163 He has no partner. And of this I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims. And:Surah Al-Kawthar, 108: 1 Verily, We have granted you (O Muhammad peace be upon him) Al-Kauthar (a river in Paradise). Surah Al-Kawthar, 108: 2 Therefore turn in prayer to your Lord and sacrifice (to Him only). Thus, Salah (Prayer) and sacrifice are to be made to Allah Alone. The same applies to Du‘a’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (May He be Glorified) says:Surah Al-Jinn, 72: 18 And the mosques are for Allâh (Alone); so invoke not anyone along with Allâh. Thus, it is Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted) Alone Who is to be supplicated and hoped in. It is He Who is to be drawn nearer to by vows, sacrifices, Salah, and Sawm. May Allah help Muslims be enlightened in their religion! May He set right the affairs of Muslim scholars and guide them to enlighten their brothers and teach them what confuses them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhârî reports that ‘Umar – Allâh be pleased with him – came to the Black Stone (performing tawâf, circumambulation), kissed it, and said, “I know that you are a stone, you do not cause benefit or harm; and if it were not that I had seen Allâh’s Messenger – peace and blessings of Allâh be upon him – kiss you, I would never have kissed you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhârî, <em>Al-Sahîh, </em>Chapter on what has been said about the Black Stone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Points to note</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">· The illustrious Companion and Caliph ‘Umar reminded us in this narration of the pure belief that benefit and harm are not caused by created objects and thus should not be sought from them. Only Allâh has control over these things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">· We are reminded that acts of worship are taken from Allâh’s Messenger, and a person is not supposed to make up his own way of worship, he must follow the manner of worship that the Prophet taught and practiced.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">· We also learn that once an action is confirmed in the Sunnah, the believer submits and complies and practices it because it is confirmed that Allâh’s Messenger did it, even if we don’t know the wisdom behind it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">· This narration is also an example of how a responsible person tries to clarify and do away with any misunderstandings that people may have about matters of faith. The people had recently left their unbelief and polytheism, so ‘Umar wanted to make it clear that kissing the Black Stone is by no means done as an act of devotion to it, as people used to do with their stone idols.</p>
