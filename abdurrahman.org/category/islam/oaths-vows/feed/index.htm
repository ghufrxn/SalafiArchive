<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Ruling on swearing by the Prophet (peace be upon him)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">A questioner sent us a message that reads: Some people are used to swear by the Prophet (peace be upon him) and this has become customary for them, yet they do not take that as a belief. What is the ruling on this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ans by Imam Ibn Baz:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Swearing by the Prophet (peace be upon him) or any other part of creation is a grave <strong>Munkar</strong> (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect) and a form of <strong>Shirk</strong> (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). Thus, it is not permissible for anyone to swear but by Allah Alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported from Imam Ibn `Abdul­Bar (may Allah be merciful with him) that it is not permissible to swear by other than Allah. Besides, authentic Hadith are related in which the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade this and declared it to be an act of Shirk. One of these Hadith is the one related in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al­Bukhari and Muslim) from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Verily! Allah forbids you to swear by your fathers. If one has to take an oath, they should swear by Allah or else keep silent.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another wording reads:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">.<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>..they should swear by Allah or say nothing.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, Abu Dawud and Al­Tirmidhy related through an authentic Sanad (chain of narrators) from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Anyone who swears by other than Allah has become a Kafir (disbeliever) or Mushrik (one who associates others with Allah in His Divinity or worship).&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Anyone who swears by Amanah (trust) is not one of us.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are numerous Hadith on this issue, and it is obligatory for all Muslims not to swear by other than Allah. Again, it is not permissible to swear by any creature, no matter who it may be, according to the Hadith mentioned above as well as other Hadith. Hence, the one who is used to do so should be warned against that and his family members, companions and acquaintances should be warned against that as well. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Anyone among you who sees (an act of) Munkar should change it with his hand; if he could not (do it), he should do so with his tongue; and if he could not, (even) then he should abhor it from his heart, and that is the least (form) of Iman (Faith).</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Related by Muslim in his Sahih Book of Hadith)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, swearing by other than Allah is a form of <strong>minor Shirk</strong> (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship), based on the above quoted Hadith. It could even be a form of <strong>major shirk</strong> if the one taking oath has it in his heart that the one by whom he swears deserves glorification just as Allah deserves it or that he could be worshipped along with Allah, or any other similar disbelieving objectives.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah to endow all the Muslims with protection against that and to grant them understanding of His Religion and safety from all things that could bring about His Wrath; indeed He is All­Hearing, Ever­Near.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q 7: I have a relative who frequently swears by Allah whether he is truthful or not. What is the religious ruling on such an act?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Ans by Imam Ibn Baz (<em>rahimahullaah)</em>:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He should be advised and told to abstain from swearing frequently, even if he is truthful, for Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;. And protect your oaths (i.e. do not swear much)</strong></span>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Three persons whom Allah shall neither speak to on the Day of Resurrection, nor look at, nor purify, and they shall have a painful torment: a white-haired adulterer, an arrogant poor person, and a man who made Allah as his merchandise: he does not buy except by swearing (by Allah) and he does not sell except by swearing.”</strong></span> &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The Arabs used to be praised for taking oaths rarely. A poet said about them:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Whoever does not swear so much, can keep his oath</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>If he takes an oath he will fulfills it</strong></span></p>
<p>Aliyah in Arabic means oath.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>It is prescribed for a Mu’min (believer) to swear rarely even if they are truthful</strong>. Swearing frequently may lead them to tell lies. It is well known that telling lies is Haram (prohibited); but it is much more prohibited when it is combined with swearing oaths.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nevertheless, if there is a demanding situation or a probable benefit calling a Muslim to swear untruthfully, it will be permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been authentically reported from the Hadith of Umm Kulthum bint Uqbah ibn Abu Mu&#8217;it (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Not a liar the one who tries to reconcile between people and so narrates something good or says something good</strong></span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umm Kulthum bint‘ Uqbah (may Allah be pleased with her) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“I have never heard him (the Prophet, peace be upon him) permit anything of what people call ‘lying’, except in three cases: war, reconciliation between people, and man’s talk to his wife and woman’s talk to her husband.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Related by Muslim in the Sahih [Authentic Hadith Book])</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a Muslim, in an attempt to reconcile between people, says, &#8220;I swear by Allah that your companions desire reconciliation with you, they like to be on good terms with you and want such and such&#8221;, then he goes to the other party and tells them the same words, intending good and hoping to achieve reconciliation, this is permissible according to the above-mentioned Hadith. The same is when a Muslim sees that a person wants to kill another one unjustly or wants to commit an unjust act against him. So, he says: &#8220;By Allah, he is my brother&#8221; in order to save him from such an oppressor who wants to kill him or beat him without any right, and he is sure that by saying: &#8220;this is my brother&#8221; the oppressor will leave the other person out of respect for him. In such a case, a Muslim should do this for the sake of saving his brother from oppression.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The basic ruling concerning false oaths is that they are forbidden and prohibited, unless they are meant for a serious benefit graver than lying, such as the three examples mentioned in the previous Hadith.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>They fulfill their vows and they fear a Day whose evil will be widespread</b></span> [76:7] <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>26</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">26</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>An-Nadhr </em>(making a vow): it is that a person makes something binding upon himself which was not originally binding upon him in the legislation, such as his making a vow that he will perform a fast, or his making a vow that he will give such and such in charity – then it becomes binding upon him to carry out his vow, because of the saying of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">من نذر أن يطيع الله فليطعه</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<span style="color:#000000;">Whoever makes a vow that he will obey Allaah, then let him obey Him</span>”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[Reported by al-Bukhaaree (6696 &amp; 6700) from a <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> of Aa’ishah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhaa</em>.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And making a vow is a type from the types of worship, it is not permissible to do it except for Allaah. So whoever makes a vow for a grave or for an idol or for other than that, then he has committed <em>shirk</em> with Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and it will be a vow of sin and shirk. And the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ومن نذر أن يعصي الله فلا يعصه</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<span style="color:#000000;">And whoever makes a vow that he will commit an act of disobedience to Allaah, then let him not disobey Him</span>”.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Dislike of Making a vow</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">478 &#8211; &#8220;<strong>Allaah Azza wa jal said: Making a vow does not earn anything for the son of Adam except that which I have destined for him. Rather, making a vow is something which makes a miserly person give. He comes to Me with that which he would not offer due to his miserliness</strong>. &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration: &#8216;<strong>He offers that which he never offered before</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>From The Fiqh of the hadeeth</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth, with all its different wordings, indicates that it is not legislated to make a vow, rather it is disliked.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The apparent meaning of this prohibition in some of its narrations is that making a vow is haram as some of the scholars have said. However, the saying of Allaah Ta&#8217;ala: &#8220;<strong>Rather, making a vow is something which makes a miserly person give</strong>.&#8221; One feels that this dislike or prohibition is specific to making a vow which is offered to Allaah as a recompense or which is done in exchange for a reward rather than a vow which, from the onset, is done out of obedience to Allaah. This (second type of) vow is purely a means of coming closer to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because the one who is making the (second type of) vow has the correct intent with it, i.e. that he wants to receive an obligatory reward, which is better than the optional reward. This is the vow which is intended &#8211; and Allaah knows best &#8211; with the saying of Allaah Ta&#8217;ala: &lt;&lt;<strong>They fulfil their vows</strong>&gt;&gt; rather than the meaning of the vow which is offered as a recompense to Allaah or which is done in exchange for a reward.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafidh said in &#8216;al- Fath (11/ 5000) that at -Tabari narrated an athar with an authentic chain on the authority of Qatadah who said regarding the saying of Allaah Ta&#8217;ala: &lt;&lt;<strong>They fulfil their vows</strong>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;They would make vows in obedience to Allaah in their prayer and their Fasting, Zakaat, Hajj, Umra and in those things that Allaah had made obligatory upon them. Allaah labelled them as righteous people. It is clear that this praise is not for the making a vow which is offered as a recompense to Allaah.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Before this he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;That Qurtubi mentioned in his book &#8216;al- Mufhim&#8217;, that the prohibition in the hadeeth regarding the vow was that vow offered as a reward to Allaah, and he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>An example of this prohibition is to say for instance, “If Allaah cures me from my illness then I will give such and such in charity.” The point of objection here is when the goal of coming closer to Allaah is given a condition, this then makes it clear that the action was not done with the pure intention of coming closer to Allaah Ta&#8217;ala rather he did it in exchange for recompense.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>What shows us this is that if he was not cured -from his illness- then he would not give charity. So he attached the act of giving charity to (Allaah) curing him. This is the condition of the miserly person. Surely he does not give anything from his wealth unless he has a quick, increased return on what he gave.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the meaning which is referred to in the hadeeth when the Messenger of Allaah said &#8220;Making a vow is something which extracts from a miserly person, that which a miserly person would not give&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Sometimes what is added to this ignorant belief is the idea that a vow means that the goal will be achieved or that Allaah gives him this goal due to this vow.</strong></span> This is also indicated in the hadeeth: &#8220;Without doubt, a vow cannot repel whatever Allaah has destined&#8221;. The first situation is close to disbelief and the second is a clear mistake.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al- Hafidh said: &#8220;I say: rather that the second type is also close to disbelief.&#8221; Then he brings a quote from al-Qurtubi in which the scholars regarded the prohibition mentioned in the narration is understood to be of disapproval. Then he says: &#8220;what is apparent to me is that, it is held to be prohibited for the one whom you fear has corrupt belief. Therefore it would be haram for this person to make this vow, and it would be regarded as disapproval for the one who does not have that corrupted belief.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a good explanation and what supports this is the story of Ibn Umar, who is the narrator of the hadeeth regarding the prohibition of vows, since they are vows offered as recompense.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: what he intends by this <strong>story</strong> is what has been narrated by Hakim (4/304) by way of Faleeh bin Sulayman on the authority of Sa&#8217;eed bin Harith that he heard Abdullaah bin Umar when he was asked by a man called Mas&#8217;ood bin &#8216;Amr, from the tribe of Bani Ka&#8217;b, say: o Abu Abdur Rahman my son was in the lands of the Persians, from those who were with Umar bin UbaydAllaah in Basra. There fell a severe plague, so when this reached me I made a vow that if Allaah brought my son to me I would walk to the ka&#8217;ba. My son came, but he was sick and died, so what do you think? &#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Umar said: Were we not prohibited from making vows?! Certainly the Messenger of Allaah -alayhis-sallat wa sallam- said; &#8220;A vow doesn&#8217;t bring anything forward nor does it delay anything, rather it takes something out of a miserly person.&#8221; Fulfil your vow.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>So, summing up, there is a warning in this hadeeth for the Muslim not to approach a vow which is offered as a reward. Therefore it is for the people to know this so that they do not fall into this prohibition whilst they thought that they were acquiring good by their deeds!</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his Family, his Companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 – 1175 – From Hudayfah that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Do not say: whatever Allaah wills and whatever so and so wills, but you should say: whatever Allaah wills then whatever so and so wills.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 137</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- 1176 – From Sahl bin Haneef that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>narrated to him, where he said: the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said to me:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘You are my messenger to Makkah; so convey my <em>Salam</em> to them, and tell them: that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> orders you with three things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Do not swear by your fathers –[and in another narration: with other than Allaah]– and if you relieve yourselves then do not face the <em>Qiblah</em> nor face your back to it, and do not clean yourselves using bones, nor with dung.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 3953</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – 1178 – From Abdullaah bin Buraidah from his father who said the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever swears by a trust then he is not from us, and whoever causes a wife to hate her husband or a slave to hate his master then he is not from us.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 325</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 – 1180 – From Abu Umamah bin Thalabah who said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah<em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever acquires wealth of a Muslim by swearing a false oath; then it will be a black speck on his heart, and nothing will change it until the Day of Judgement.’</p>

I took an oath that if Allaah saved me/delivered me upon this, then I would eat from its liver and its hump!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘What a wretched reward you have given it, this is not an oath, indeed an oath is what is done desiring the Face of Allaah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said this about the wife of Abu Dharr who had taken an oath, that if she was saved from the kuffar upon the ride of the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> then she would slaughter it.’</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">6 – 1184 – From Thabit bin ad-Dhihaak who said: a man at the time of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> took an oath that he would slaughter an animal at<em>Boowana</em> (a certain place), when the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>came he said: I have taken an oath that I would slaughter at <em>Boowana</em>, so the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Was there an idol from the idols of <em>Jahileeyah</em> worshipped there?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘No.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger asked: ‘Was there an <em>Eid</em> (a day of celebration) from the days of celebration at that place?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘No.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Fulfil your oath, indeed an oath is not fulfilled in sinning against Allaah, nor in breaking relations, nor in that which the son of Adam does not possess.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2872</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7 – 1185 – From Ibn Abbas <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> from the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There are two types of vows, firstly, that which was for Allaah, so its expiation is fulfilling it. Secondly that which was for Shaytaan then there is no fulfilment of that but the expiation is the penalty of the unfulfilled vow.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 479</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8 – 1186 – From Abu Hurairah from the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Allaah -Azza wa Jal- said: Making a vow does not earn anything for the son of Adam except that which I have destined for him.  Rather, making a vow is something which makes a miserly person give.  He comes to Me with that which he would not offer due to his miserliness.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 478</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9 – 1187 – From Uqbah bin ‘Aamir al-Jahnee who said: my sister made an oath that she would walk to the <em>Ka’aba</em> barefooted, and with her head uncovered, when the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> saw her he asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘What is wrong with her?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They answered that she took an oath that she would walk to the <em>Ka’aba</em> barefooted, and with her head uncovered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Order her to get a ride, and cover herself, perform the <em>Hajj</em> and slaughter a sacrificial animal.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 2930</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10 – From Ibn Abbas: that a man came to the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and said: last night I saw in a dream, shaded clouds trickling with clarified butter and honey, and I saw people taking handfuls from it, there were those who were taking a lot and there were those who were taking a little and there was a rope connected from the earth to the sky.  I saw you take it and ascend with it, then another man took it and ascended with it, then another man took it and ascended with it, then a man took it and it was cut off, then connected.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr said O Messenger of Allaah! May my father be sacrificed for you, I swear by Allaah if you allow me I will interpret it for you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said to him: ‘Go ahead interpret it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘As for the shaded clouds then that is Islaam, as for the trickling of clarified butter and honey, then that is the Qur’aan and its sweetness trickles for the one who reads a lot of Qur’aan and for the one who reads a little of the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the connected rope from the sky to the earth, then that is the truth which you are upon so you take it then Allaah caused you to ascend, then another man held on and ascended, then another man took it and ascended, then another man took it then it cuts off, then it connects and ascended with it, so tell me O Messenger of Allaah – may my father be sacrificed for you – was I right or wrong?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said: ‘You were right in some of it and wrong in some.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Abu Bakr said: ‘I swear by Allaah that you will narrate to me of that which I made a mistake in.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said: ‘Do not take an oath.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No.121</p>

Illegality of Swearing Falsely</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1712.</b> Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who takes oath to acquire the property of a Muslim unjustly will meet Allah and He will be angry with him</span>&#8221; then he recited:<br />
&#8220;<span style="color:#ff0000;">Verily, those who purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah&#8217;s Covenant and their oaths, they shall have no portion in the Hereafter. Neither will Allah speak to them nor look at them on the Day of Resurrection nor will He purify them, and they shall have a painful torment.</span>&#8221; (3:77)<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1713.</b> Abu Umamah Iyas bin Tha`labah Al-Harithi (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who misappropriates the right of a Muslim by taking a false oath, Allah will condemn him to the fire of Hell and will forbid Jannah for him.</span>&#8221; A person asked: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, even if it is something insignificant?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Yes, even if it is the twig of the Arak tree</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1714.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-As (May Allah be pleased with them) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Of the major sins are: Associating anything in worship with Allah, disobedience to the parents, killing without justification and taking a false oath (intentionally).</span>&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is: A bedouin came to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and asked him: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, what are the cardinal sins?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Associating anything with Allah in worship</span>.&#8221; The man asked: &#8220;(What is) next?&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Al-Yamin Al-Ghamus.</span>&#8221; He asked: &#8220;What do you mean by Al-Yamin Al-Ghamus?&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Swearing falsely to usurp the property of a Muslim.</span>&#8221;</p>

Chapter 314<br />
Prohibition of Swearing in the name of anything besides Allah</h5>

Expiation of Oaths</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Allah will not punish you for what is unintentional in your oaths, but He will punish you for your deliberate oaths; for its expiation (a deliberate oath) feed ten Masakin (poor persons), on a scale of the average of that with which you feed your own families, or clothe them or manumit a slave. But whosoever cannot afford (that), then he should observe fast for three days. That is the expiation for the oaths when you have sworn. And protect your oaths (i.e., do not swear much).</b></span><b>&#8221; (5:89)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1719.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: The Ayah: &#8220;<span style="color:#ff0000;">Allah will not punish you for what is unintentional in your oaths &#8230;</span>&#8221; was revealed in respect of those persons who are in the habit of repeating: `No, by Allah&#8217;; and `Yes, by Allah.&#8217;<br />

I little knew of it, so I came back with a heavy heart on account of the refusal of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), and the fear that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) might have some feelings against me. I returned to my friends and informed them about what Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had said. I had hardly stayed for a little that I heard Bilal calling: &#8216;Abdullah b. Qais.

He said: Hasten to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), he is calling you, When I came to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) he said: Take this pair, this pair, and this pair (i. e. six camels which he had bought from Sa&#8217;d), and take them to y, our friends and say: Verily Allah (or he said: Verily Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has provided you with these animals. So ride upon them. Abu Musa said: I went along with them to my friends and said: Verily Allah&#8217;s messenger (may peace be upon him) has provided you with these animals for riding; but by Allah, I shall not leave you until some of you go along with me to him who had heard the talk of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) then I asked him for you, and his refusal for the first time, and then his granting them to me subsequently; so you should not think that I narrated to you something which he did not say. They said to me: By Allah, in our opinion you are certainly truthful, and we would do as you like. So Abu Musa went along withsome of the menfrom them until they came to those who had heard the words of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may, peace be upon him) and his refusal to (provide) them with (animals) ; and subsequently his granting (the animals) to them; and they narrated to them exactly as Abu Masa had narrated to them.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ayyub said: We were sitting in the company of Abu Musa that he called for food and it consisted of flesh of fowl. It was then that a person from Banu Tamim visited him. His complexion was red having the resemblance of a slave. He said to him: Come and (join me in food). He showed reluctance. He (Abu Masa) said: Come on, for I saw Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) eating it (fowl&#8217;s meat), whereupon that person said: I saw it eating something (of filth and rubbish) and I found it repugnant and took an oath that I would never eat that. He (Abu Muds) said: Come, so that I would narrate to you about that (the incident pertaining to vow). (And he narrated thus): I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) along with a group of people belonging to the tribe of Ash&#8217;ari, asking him to provide us with riding camels. He (the Holy Prophet) said: By Allah, I cannot provide you with riding animals. And there is nothing with me with which I can provide you a mount. We stayed (for some time) there as Allah willed, and there was brought to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) booty of camels. He called us and commanded that we should be given five white humped camels. As we were about to go back, some of us said to the other: As we made Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) forget oath, there would be no blessing for us (in his gift). We went back to him and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, we came to you to provide us with riding animals and you took an oath that you would never equip us with mounts and then you have provided us with the riding beasts Allali&#8217;s Messenger, have you forgotten? Thereupon he said: I swear by Allah that if Allah so wills, I shall not swear an oath, and then consider something else to be better than it without making atonement for my oath and doing the thing that is better. So you go; Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, has given you riding animals.</p>

Khattab asked the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) as he was at ji&#8217;rana (a town near Mecca) on his way back from Ta&#8217;if: Messenger of Allah, I had taken a vow during the days of Ignorance that I would observe I&#8217;tikaf for one day in the Sacred Mosque. So what is your opinion? He said: Go and observe I&#8217;tikaf for a day. And Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) gave him a slave girl out of the one-fifth (of the spoils of war meant for the Holy Prophet). And when Allah&#8217;s Messenger (inay peace be upon him) set the war prisoners free. &#8216;Umar b.

They said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has set free the prisoners of war (which had fallen to the lot of people). Thereupon he (Hadrat &#8216;Umar) said: Abdullah, go to that slave-girl and set her free.</p>

He then came to his people, and made mention of that to them. Then came he and his brother Huwayyisa, and he was older than he, and &#8216;Abd al-Rahman b. Sahl. Then Muhayyisa went to speak, and it was he who had accompanied (&#8216;Abdullah) to Khaibar, whereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to Muhayyisa: Observe greatness of the great (he meant the seniority of age). Then Huwayyisa spoke and then Muhayyisa also spoke. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: They should either pay blood-wit for your companion, or be prepared for war. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) wrote about it to them (to the Jews). They wrote: Verily, by Allah, we have not killed him. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to Huwayyisa and Muhayyisa and Abd al-Rahman: Are you prepared to take oath in order to entitle yourselves for the blood-wit of your companion? They said: No. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Then the Jews will take oath (of their innocence). They said: They are not Muslims. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), however, himself paid the blood-wit to them and sent to them one hundred camels until they entered into their houses, Sahl said: One red she-camel among them kicked me.</p>

Thereupon he said: Your blood, your property (Muhammad, one of the narrators, said: I think, he also said this) and your honour are sacred to you like the sacredness of this day of yours, in this city of yours, and in this month of yours. You will soon meet your Lord and He will ask you about your deeds. So do not turn after me unbelievers (or misguided), some of you striking the necks of the others. Behold I let him who is present convey to him who is absent, for many a one whom a message is conveyed has a more retentive memory than one who hears.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Imran b. Husain reported that the tribe of Thaqif was the ally of Banu &#8216;Uqail. Thaqif took two persons from amongst the Companiobs of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as prisoners. The Campanions of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) took one person at Banu Uqail as prisoner, and captured al-&#8216;Adbi (the she-camel of the Holy Prophet) along with him. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to him and he was tied with ropes. He said: Muhammad. He came near him and said: What is the matter with you? Thereupon he (the prisoner) said: Why have you taken me as prisoner and why have you caught hold of one proceeding the pilgrims (the she-camel as she carried the Holy Prophet on her back and walked ahead of the multitude)? He (the Holy Prophet) said: (Yours is a great fault). I (my men) have caught hold of you for the crime of your allies, Banu Thaqif. He (the Holy Prophet) then turned away. He again called him and said: Muhammad, Muhammad, and since Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was very compassionate, and tenderhearted, he returned to him, and said: What is the matter with you? He said: I am a Muslim, whereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Had you said this when you had been the master of yourself, you would have gained every success. He then turned away. He (the prisoner) called him again saying: Muhammad, Muhammad. He came to him and said: What is the matter with you? He said: I am hungry, feed me, and I am thirsty, so provide me with drink. He (the Holy Prophet) said: That is (to satisfy) your want. He was then ransomed for two persons (who had been taken prisoner by Thaqif). He (the narrator) said: A woman of the Ansar had been taken prisoner and also al-Adbi&#8217; was caught. The woman had been tied with ropes. The people were giving rest to their animals before their houses. She escaped one night from the bondage and came to the camels. As she drew near the camels, they fretted and fumed and so she left them until she came to al-, Adbi&#8217;. It did not fret and fume; it was docile She rode upon its back and drove it away and she went off. When they (the enemies of Islam) were warned of this, they went in search of it, but it (the she-camel) exhausted them. She (the woman) took vow for Allah, that in case He would save her through it, she would offer that as a sacrifice. As she reached Medina, the people saw her and they said: Here is al-Adbi, the she-camel of Allah&#8217;s Messanger (may peace be upon him). She (the woman) said that she had taken a vow that if Allah would save her on its back, she would sacrifice it. They (the Prophet&#8217;s Companions) came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and made a mention of that to him, whereupon he said: Hallowed be Allah, how ill she rewarded it that she took vow to Allah that if He saves her on its back, she would sacrifice it! There is no fulfilment of the vow in an act of disobedience, nor in an act over which a person has no control. In the version of Ibn Hujr (the words are):&#8221; There is no vow in disobedience to Allah.&#8221;</p>

Indeed, there is nobody between its (i.e., Medina&#8217;s) two mountains who is poorer than we.&#8221; The Prophet then said, &#8220;Take it and feed your family with it.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Sa&#8217;ib bin Yazid said, &#8220;The Sa&#8217; at the time of the Prophet was equal to one Mudd plus one-third of a Mudd of your time, and then it was increased in the time of Caliph &#8216;Umar bin &#8216;Abdul Aziz.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Umar used to give the Zakat of Ramadan (Zakat-al-Fitr) according to the Mudd of the Prophet, the first Mudd, and he also used to give things for expiation for oaths according to the Mudd of the Prophet. Abu Qutaiba said, &#8220;Malik said to us, &#8216;Our Mudd (i.e., of Medina) is better than yours and we do not see any superiority except in the Mudd of the Prophet!&#8217; Malik further said, to me, &#8216;If a ruler came to you and fixed a Mudd smaller than the one of the Prophet, by what Mudd would you measure what you give (for expiation or Zakat-al-Fitr?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;We would give it according to the Mudd of the Prophet&#8217; On that, Malik said, &#8216;Then, don&#8217;t you see that we have to revert to the Mudd of the Prophet ultimately?'&#8221;</p>
<hr />

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ash&#8217;ari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle along with a group of people from (the tribe of) Al-Ash&#8217;ari, asking for mounts. The Prophet said, &#8220;By Allah, I will not give you anything to ride, and I have nothing to mount you on.&#8221; We stayed there as long as Allah wished, and after that, some camels were brought to the Prophet and he ordered that we be given three camels. When we set out, some of us said to others, &#8220;Allah will not bless us, as we all went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle asking him for mounts, and although he had sworn that he would not give us mounts, he did give us.&#8221; So we returned to the Prophet; and mentioned that to him. He said, &#8220;I have not provided you with mounts, but Allah has. By Allah, Allah willing, if I ever take an oath, and then see that another is better than the first, I make expiration for my (dissolved) oath, and do what is better and make expiration.&#8221;</p>
<hr />

<p style="text-align:justify;">the same narration above (i.e. 709), &#8220;I make expiation for my dissolved oath, and I do what is better, or do what is better and make expiation.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 711:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Prophet) Solomon said, &#8220;Tonight I will sleep with (my) ninety wives, each of whom will get a male child who will fight for Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221; On that, his companion (Sufyan said that his companion was an angel) said to him, &#8220;Say, &#8220;If Allah will (Allah willing).&#8221; But Solomon forgot (to say it). He slept with all his wives, but none of the women gave birth to a child, except one who gave birth to a halfboy. Abu Huraira added: The Prophet said, &#8220;If Solomon had said, &#8220;If Allah will&#8221; (Allah willing), he would not have been unsuccessful in his action, and would have attained what he had desired.&#8221; Once Abu Huraira added: Allah apostle said, &#8220;If he had accepted.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 712:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zahdam al-Jarmi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were sitting with Abu Musa Al-Ash&#8217;sari, and as there were ties of friendship and mutual favors between us and his tribe. His meal was presented before him and there was chicken meat in it. Among those who were present there was a man from Bani Taimillah having a red complexion as a non-Arab freed slave, and that man did not approach the meal. Abu Musa said to him, &#8220;Come along! I have seen Allah&#8217;s Apostle eating of that (i.e., chicken).&#8221; The man said, &#8220;I have seen it (chickens) eating something I regarded as dirty, and so I have taken an oath that I shall not eat (its meat) chicken.&#8221; Abu Musa said, &#8220;Come along! I will inform you about it (i.e., your oath).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once we went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle in company with a group of Ash&#8217;airiyin, asking him for mounts while he was distributing some camels from the camels of Zakat. (Aiyub said, &#8220;I think he said that the Prophet was in an angry mood at the time.&#8221;) The Prophet said, &#8216;By Allah! I will not give you mounts, and I have nothing to mount you on.&#8217; After we had left, some camels of booty were brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and he said, &#8220;Where are those Ash&#8217;ariyin? Where are those Ash&#8217;ariyin?&#8221; So we went (to him) and he gave us five very fat good-looking camels. We mounted them and went away, and then I said to my companions, &#8216;We went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to give us mounts, but he took an oath that he would not give us mounts, and then later on he sent for us and gave us mounts, perhaps Allah&#8217;s Apostle forgot his oath. By Allah, we will never be successful, for we have taken advantage of the fact that Allah&#8217;s Apostle forgot to fulfill his oath. So let us return to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to remind him of his oath.&#8217; We returned and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We came to you and asked you for mounts, but you took an oath that you would not give us mounts) but later on you gave us mounts, and we thought or considered that you have forgotten your oath.&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;Depart, for Allah has given you Mounts. By Allah, Allah willing, if I take an oath and then later find another thing better than that, I do what is better, and make expiation for the oath.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

Do not seek to be a ruler, for, if you are given the authority of ruling without your asking for it, then Allah will help you; but if you are given it by your asking, then you will be held responsible for it (i.e. Allah will not help you ) . And if you take an oath to do something and later on find another thing, better than that, then do what is better and make expiation for (the dissolution of) your oath.&#8221;</p>

<h3 align="center">Oaths and Vows</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.078.618"></a>Volume 8, Book 78, Number 618:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr As-Siddiq had never broken his oaths till Allah revealed the expiation for the oaths. Then he said, &#8220;If I take an oath to do something and later on I find something else better than the first one, then I do what is better and make expiation for my oath.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 619:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Samura:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Samura! Do not seek to be a ruler, because if you are given authority for it, then you will be held responsible for it, but if you are given it without asking for it, then you will be helped in it (by Allah): and whenever you take an oath to do something and later you find that something else is better than the first, then do the better one and make expiation for your oath.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 620:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I went to the Prophet along with a group of Al-Ash&#8217;ariyin in order to request him to provide us with mounts. He said, &#8220;By Allah, I will not provide you with mounts and I haven&#8217;t got anything to mount you on.&#8221; Then we stayed there as long as Allah wished us to stay, and then three very nice looking she-camels were brought to him and he made us ride them. When we left, we, or some of us, said, &#8220;By Allah, we will not be blessed, as we came to the Prophet asking him for mounts, and he swore that he would not give us any mounts but then he did give us. So let us go back to the Prophet and remind him (of his oath).&#8221; When we returned to him (and reminded him of the fact), he said, &#8220;I did not give you mounts, but it is Allah Who gave you. By Allah, Allah willing, if I ever take an oath to do something and then I find something else than the first, I will make expiation for my oath and do the thing which is better (or do something which is better and give the expiation for my oath).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 621:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;We (Muslims) are the last in the world, but will be foremost on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle also said, &#8220;By Allah, if anyone of you insists on fulfilling an oath by which he may harm his family, he commits a greater sin in Allah&#8217;s sight than that of dissolving his oath and making expiation for it.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 622:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Anyone who takes an oath through which his family may be harmed, and insists on keeping it, he surely commits a sin greater (than that of dissolving his oath). He should rather compensate for that oath by making expiation.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 623:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent an army detachment and made Usama bin Zaid its commander. Some people criticized (spoke badly of) Usama&#8217;s leadership. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up saying, &#8220;If you people are criticizing Usama&#8217;s leadership, you have already criticized the leadership of his father before. But Wa-aimullah (i.e., By Allah), he (i.e. Zaid) deserved the leadership, and he was one of the most beloved persons to me; and now this (his son Usama) is one of the dearest persons to me after him.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 745, Vol. 5)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin Samura:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;If Caesar is ruined, there will be no Caesar after him; and if Khosrau is ruined, there will be no Khosrau, after him; and, by Him in Whose Hand my soul is, surely you will spend their treasures in Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 626:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;If Khosrau is ruined, there will be no Khosrau after him; and if Caesar is ruined, there will be no Caesar after him. By Him in Whose Hand Muhammad&#8217;s soul is, surely you will spend their treasures in Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 627:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Hisham:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were with the Prophet and he was holding the hand of &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab. &#8216;Umar said to Him, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! You are dearer to me than everything except my own self.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;No, by Him in Whose Hand my soul is, (you will not have complete faith) till I am dearer to you than your own self.&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar said to him, &#8220;However, now, by Allah, you are dearer to me than my own self.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Now, O &#8216;Umar, (now you are a believer).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 629:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira and Zaid bin Khalid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Two men had a dispute in the presence of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. One of them said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Judge between us according to Allah&#8217;s Laws.&#8221; The other who was wiser, said, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Judge between us according to Allah&#8217;s Laws and allow me to speak. The Prophet said, &#8220;Speak.&#8221; He said, &#8220;My son was a laborer serving this (person) and he committed illegal sexual intercourse with his wife, The people said that my son is to be stoned to death, but I ransomed him with one-hundred sheep and a slave girl. Then I asked the learned people, who informed me that my son should receive one hundred lashes and will be exiled for one year, and stoning will be the lot for the man&#8217;s wife.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Indeed, by Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I will judge between you according to Allah&#8217;s Laws: As for your sheep and slave girl, they are to be returned to you.&#8221; Then he scourged his son one hundred lashes and exiled him for one year. Then Unais Al-Aslami was ordered to go to the wife of the second man, and if she confessed (the crime), then stone her to death. She did confess, so he stoned her to death.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 630:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Do you think if the tribes of Aslam, Ghifar, Muzaina and Juhaina are better than the tribes of Tamim, &#8216;Amir bin Sa&#8217;sa&#8217;a, Ghatfan and Asad, they (the second group) are despairing and losing?&#8221; They (the Prophet&#8217;s companions) said, &#8220;Yes, (they are).&#8221; He said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, they (the first group) are better than them (the second group).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 631:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Humaid As-Sa&#8217;idi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle employed an employee (to collect Zakat). The employee returned after completing his job and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! This (amount of Zakat) is for you, and this (other amount) was given to me as a present.&#8221; The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you stay at your father&#8217;s or mother&#8217;s house and see if you would be given presents or not?&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up in the evening after the prayer, and having testified that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and praised and glorified Allah as He deserved, he said, &#8220;Now then ! What about an employee whom we employ and then he comes and says, &#8216;This amount (of Zakat) is for you, and this (amount) was given to me as a present&#8217;? Why didn&#8217;t he stay at the house of his father and mother to see if he would be given presents or not? By Him in Whose Hand Muhammad&#8217;s soul is, none of you will steal anything of it (i.e. Zakat) but will bring it by carrying it over his neck on the Day of Resurrection. If it has been a camel, he will bring it (over his neck) while it will be grunting, and if it has been a cow, he will bring it (over his neck), while it will be mooing; and if it has been a sheep, he will bring it (over his neck) while it will be bleeding.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;I have preached you (Allah&#8217;s Message).&#8221; Abu Humaid said, &#8220;Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle raised his hands so high that we saw the whiteness of his armpits.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu-l-Qasim (the Prophet) said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand Muhammad&#8217;s soul is, if you know that which I know, you would weep much and laugh little.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 633:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Dhar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I reached him (the Prophet ) while in the shade of the Ka&#8217;ba; he was saying, &#8220;They are the losers, by the Lord of the Ka&#8217;ba! They are the losers, by the Lord of the Ka&#8217;ba!&#8221; I said (to myself ), &#8220;What is wrong with me? Is anything improper detected in me? What is wrong with me? Then I sat beside him and he kept on saying his statement. I could not remain quiet, and Allah knows in what sorrowful state I was at that time. So I said, &#8216; Who are they (the losers)? Let My father and mother be sacrificed for you, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; He said, &#8220;They are the wealthy people, except the one who does like this and like this and like this (i.e., spends of his wealth in Allah&#8217;s Cause).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 634:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;(The Prophet) Solomon once said, &#8216;Tonight I will sleep with ninety women, each of whom will bring forth a (would-be) cavalier who will fight in Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221; On this, his companion said to him, &#8220;Say: Allah willing!&#8221; But he did not say Allah willing. Solomon then slept with all the women, but none of them became pregnant but one woman who later delivered a half-man. By Him in Whose Hand Muhammad&#8217;s soul is, if he (Solomon) had said, &#8216;Allah willing&#8217; (all his wives would have brought forth boys) and they would have fought in Allah&#8217;s Cause as cavaliers. &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zahdam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a relation of love and brotherhood between this tribe of Jarm and Al-Ash&#8217;ariyin. Once we were with Abu Musa Al-Ash&#8217;ari, and then a meal containing chicken was brought to Abu Musa, and there was present, a man from the tribe of Taimillah who was of red complexion as if he were from non-Arab freed slaves. Abu Musa invited him to the meal. He said, &#8220;I have seen chickens eating dirty things, so I deemed it filthy and took an oath that I would never eat chicken.&#8221; On that, Abu Musa said, &#8220;Get up, I will narrate to you about that. Once a group of the Ash&#8217;ariyin and I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and asked him to provide us with mounts; he said, &#8216;By Allah, I will never give you any mounts nor do I have anything to mount you on.&#8217; Then a few camels of war booty were brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle , and he asked about us, saying, &#8216;Where are the Ash-&#8216;ariyin?&#8217; He then ordered five nice camels to be given to us, and when we had departed, we said, &#8216;What have we done? Allah&#8217;s Apostle had taken the oath not to give us any mounts, and that he had nothing to mount us on, and later he gave us that we might ride? Did we take advantage of the fact that Allah&#8217;s Apostle had forgotten his oath? By Allah, we will never succeed.&#8217; So we went back to him and said to him, &#8216;We came to you to give us mounts, and you took an oath that you would not give us any mounts and that you had nothing to mount us on.&#8217; On that he said, &#8216;I did not provide you with mounts, but Allah did. By Allah, if I take an oath to do something, and then find something else better than it, I do that which is better and make expiation for the dissolution of the oath.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

When he sat there (at the house of his daughter), the child was brought to him, and he took him into his lap while the child&#8217;s breath was disturbed in his chest. The eyes of Allah&#8217;s Apostle started shedding tears.

<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard &#8216;Urwa bin Az-Zubair, Said bin Al-Musaiyab, &#8216;Alqama bin Waqqas and &#8216;Ubaidullah bin &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Uqba relating from &#8216;Aisha, the wife of the Prophet the narration of the people (i.e. the liars) who spread the slander against her and they said what they said, and how Allah revealed her innocence. Each of them related to me a portion of that narration. (They said that &#8216;Aisha said), &#8221;Then Allah revealed the ten Verses starting with:&#8211;&#8216;Verily! Those who spread the slander..&#8217; (24.11-21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All these verses were in proof of my innocence. Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah some financial aid because of his relation to him, said, &#8220;By Allah, I will never give anything (in charity) to Mistah, after what he has said about &#8216;Aisha&#8221; Then Allah revealed:&#8211; &#8216;And let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (any sort of help) to their kins men&#8230;.&#8217; (24.22) On that, Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Yes, by Allah, I like that Allah should forgive me.&#8221; and then resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him and said, &#8220;By Allah! I will never withhold it from him.&#8221;</p>

We asked him to provide us with mounts, but he swore that he would not give us any. Later on he said, &#8220;By Allah, Allah willing, if ever I take an oath (to do something) and later on I find something else better than the first, then I do the better one and give expiation for the dissolution of my oath.&#8221;</p>

Have you anything (to present to the Prophet)?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then she took out a few loaves of barley bread and took a veil of hers and wrapped the bread with a part of it and sent me to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. I went and found Allah&#8217;s Apostle sitting in the mosque with some people. I stood up before him. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to me, &#8220;Has Abu Talha sent you?&#8221; I said, &#8216; Yes. Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to those who were with him. &#8220;Get up and proceed.&#8221; I went ahead of them (as their forerunner) and came to Abu Talha and informed him about it. Abu Talha said, &#8220;O Um Sulaim! Allah&#8217;s Apostle has come and we have no food to feed them.&#8221; Um Sulaim said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know best.&#8221; So Abu Talha went out (to receive them) till he met Allah&#8217;s Apostle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle came in company with Abu Talha and they entered the house. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Um Sulaim!

<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;The (reward of) deeds, depend upon the intentions and every person will get the reward according to what he has intended. So whoever emigrated for the sake of Allah and His Apostle, then his emigration will be considered to be for Allah and His Apostle, and whoever emigrated for the sake of worldly gain or for a woman to marry, then his emigration will be considered to be for what he emigrated for.&#8221;</p>

Have you eaten Maghafir?&#8221; When he entered upon one of us, she said that to him. He replied (to her), &#8220;No, but I have drunk honey in the house of Zainab bint Jahsh, and I will never drink it again.&#8221; Then the following verse was revealed: &#8216;O Prophet ! Why do you ban (for you) that which Allah has made lawful for you?. ..(up to) If you two (wives of the Prophet turn in repentance to Allah.&#8217; (66.1-4) The two were &#8216;Aisha and Hafsa And also the Statement of Allah: &#8216;And (Remember) when the Prophet disclosed a matter in confidence to one of his wives!&#8217; (66.3) i.e., his saying, &#8220;But I have drunk honey.&#8221; Hisham said: It also meant his saying, &#8220;I will not drink anymore, and I have taken an oath, so do not inform anybody of that &#8216;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From Buraydah (radiyAllaahu ‘anhu) who said that the Messenger of Allaah ( peace be upon him) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>((Whoever takes an oath by al-Amaanah (the trust), then he is not from us)).</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Aboo Daawud, no. 3253 with an authentic chain, authenticated by ash-Shaykh al-Albaanee in as-Saheehah, no. 94, and also authenticated by ash-Shaykh Muqbil in al-Jaami’ as-Saheeh 1/291.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the third hadeeth of Buraydah, Shaykh Ahmed mentioned that this great test and tribulation has affected the general people in the lands of the Muslims, such that they have become accustomed to this (i.e. swearing by al-Amaanah), and it has become widespread on their tongues to swear by al-Amaanah. And the trust (al-Amaanah) is a great thing to them, and they use as a proof for their action of this the statement of Allaah (subhaana wa ta’aalaa):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Truly, We did offer AlAmaanah (the trust or moral responsibility or honesty and all the duties which Allaah has ordained) to the heavens and the earth, and the mountains, but they declined to bear it and were afraid of it (i.e. afraid of Allaah&#8217;s Torment). But man bore it. Verily, he was unjust (to himself) and ignorant (of itsresults).</span></em> (Al-Ahzaab 33:72)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Shaykh Ahmed mentioned that in this verse is the affirmation that al-Amaanah, the trust, isa great thing. A great thing which Allaah (subhaana wa ta’aalaa) has sent down upon the creation. A thing which mankind took and bore it. But if the person who swears by al-Amaanah is asked what is greater than al-Amaanah, he would say: ‘Allaah (subhaana wa ta’aalaa).’ So why not swear by Allaah (subhaana wa ta’aalaa), who is greater than all things, and he is the One who is entitled to glorification. And the promise of punishment that the Prophet ( peace be upon him) mentioned for the one who swears by al-Amaanah is that ‘he is not from us,’ which means that he is not from our path, our clear path and Manhaj (way /methodology).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is upon the person who due to accustom and habitual habits finds himself swearing by al-Amaanah, it is upon him to take note and to be careful of what comes out of his tongue, and that he must be truthful in his swearing, and that he must swear only by Allaah (subhaana wa ta’aalaa).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in regards to being truthful when swearing, the shaykh mentioned the hadeeth of Ibn Mas’ood (radiyAllaahu ‘anhu): The Prophet ( peace be upon him ) said, <em><span style="color:#008000;">“Whoever swears falsely in order to grab the property of a Muslim (or of his brother), Allaah will be angry with him when he meets Him.”</span> </em>Reported by al-Bukhaaree, no. 6238.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ahmed Wasabi then read to us from the book of Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, al- Qawl ul-Mufeed Sharh Kitaab ut-Tawheed, Beneficial Speech in Explaining the Book of Tawheed, which is an explanation of Kitaab ut-Tawheed of Shaykhul-Islaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul Wahhaab an- Najdee (rahimahullaah). He read to us from the chapter ‘Swearing by Allaah (subhaana wa ta’aalaa)’:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The meaning of this is the <strong>glorification</strong> of the one that is being sweared by. And the reason of doing this action of swearing is to certify an issue by the remembrance of the one that is glorified. And it has specific terminology that is used in the Arabic language, certain words and phrases that are used to swear by, and they are known as <strong>Huroof al-Qasam</strong>, which consists of the harf <strong>baa, waav, and taa</strong> (<strong>billaahi</strong>, <strong>wallaahi</strong>, and <strong>tallaahi</strong>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And a person who numerously swears by Allaah (subhaana wa ta’aalaa), and is consistently and in all times found swearing by Allaah (subhaana wa ta’aalaa), then this is a proof that his glorification of Allaah is weak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the reason for mentioning these chapters in Kitaab ut-Tawheed is that from the perfection and completion of Tawheed is that a person glorifies Allaah (subhaana wa ta’aalaa). And the fact that a person swears by Allaah numerously, without taking heed of what he is swearing about, then this is a proof that shows the weakness in his glorification of Allaah (subhaana wa ta’aalaa).”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From ‘Abdullaah ibn ‘Umar ibnul-Khattaab (radiyAllaahu ‘anhumaa) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) met ‘Umar ibnul-Khattaab (radiyAllaahu ‘anhu) while the latter was going with a group of camel-riders, and he was swearing by his father. So Allaah’s Messenger ( Peace be upon him) said, <strong>((Behold! Allaah (‘azza wa jall) forbids you to swear by your fathers, so whoever has to take an oath, he should swear by Allaah or keep quiet))</strong>. Reported by al- Bukhaaree, no. 6270 and Muslim, no. 1646. Also from him [‘Abdullaah ibn ‘Umar] (radiyAllaahu ‘anhumaa), who said, Allaah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) said, <strong>((Whosoever wishes to take an oath then he should not take an oath except by Allaah)).</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">In this hadeeth is the proof that it is not allowable to swear by other than Allaah, and that it is forbidden to swear by the created things.</span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-align:justify;color:#993300;">And the thing that is sweared by, this is in actuality glorification of that which is sweared by, so the one who swears by the creation is glorifying it, and Allaah (subhaana wa ta’aalaa) is greater than everything and He deserves glorification more than anything else that is in existence. </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-align:justify;color:#993300;">And the one who swears by other than Allaah (subhaana wa ta’aalaa) has committed an act of shirk (association).</span></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Abee Hurayrah (radiyAllaahu ‘anhu) who said, Allaah’s Messenger ( peace be upon him) said, <strong>((Whoever amongst you swears, (saying by error) in his oath “By al-Laat and al-‘Uzzaa,” then he should say, “Laa Ilaaha illaAllaah (None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah).” And whoever says to his companions, “Come let me gamble with you,” then he must give something in charity (as an expiation for such a sin).))</strong> Reported by al-Bukhaaree, no. 4579 and Muslim, no. 1647.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The one who swears by other than Allaah without intentionally intending this, and the ones who become accustomed to this due to the fact that they have been brought up in Jaahiliyyah, then the Prophet (peace be upon him) has made clear to them the atonement of doing this act (i.e. swearing by other than Allaah in error), and it is by saying the statement of Laa Ilaaha illaAllaah.</span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The atonement for the one who swears by other than Allaah (i.e. in error) by saying the statement of Laa Ilaaha illaAllaah is the affirmation of worship to Allaah (subhaana wa ta’aalaa) and its negation to other than Allaah (subhaana wa ta’aalaa).</span></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Buraydah (radiyAllaahu ‘anhu) who said that the Messenger of Allaah ( peace be upon him) said, <strong>((Whoever takes an oath by al-Amaanah (the trust), then he is not from us)).</strong> Reported by Aboo Daawud, no. 3253 with an authentic chain, authenticated by ash-Shaykh al-Albaanee in as-Saheehah, no. 94, and also authenticated by ash-Shaykh Muqbil in al-Jaami’ as-Saheeh 1/291.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Read <a title="&quot;Whoever takes an oath by al-Amaanah (the trust), then he is not from us&quot;" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2013/11/04/whoever-takes-an-oath-by-al-amaanah-the-trust-then-he-is-not-from-us/">Here </a>for more details</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Qutaylah, the woman from Juhaynah, (radiyAllaahu ‘anhaa) that a Jew came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and said: “Verily you make equal and verily you associate, you say: ‘What Allaah Wills and what you will,’ and you swear: ‘By al-Ka’bah.’ So the Prophet () ordered them: (If they want to swear, they should say: ‘By the Lord of al-Ka’bah,’ and they should say: ‘What Allaah Wills then what you will.’).” Narrated by an-Nisaa’ee 7/6, and authenticated by ash-Shaykh al-Albaanee in as-Saheehah: 1166, and also by ash-Shaykh Muqbil in the book as-Saheeh al-Musnad Mimmaa Laysa Fee as-Saheehayn 2/515.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">It is allowable to swear by the attributes of Allaah (subhaana wa ta’aalaa). </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Therefore, it is allowable for someone to swear by the Qur’aan, the Qur’aan being the speech of Allaah (jalla wa ‘alaa), and speech is an attribute of Allaah (subhaana wa ta’aalaa). </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">As for al- Ka’bah, then it is not from the attributes of Allaah (subhaana wa ta’aalaa), and therefore it is not allowable for a person to swear by al-Ka’bah. So it is upon us to say as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, ‘By the Lord of al-Ka’bah.’</span></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center">The Ahadeeth of Tawheed from the <strong>Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah</strong> of  <strong>Shaykh Al-Albaani</strong></p>
<p align="center">Translated by <strong>Abbas Abu Yahya</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1168- “The person who was most severely trialed in the world will be brought forward from the people of Paradise. Allaah will say: immerse him deep into Paradise, so they will dip him into Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah Azza wa Jal will ask: O son of Adam did you ever see any suffering or anything that you disliked?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He will answer: No, I swear by Your (Izzah) honour I never ever saw anything that I disliked.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the most blessed person in the world will be brought forward from the people of the Hell-fire. Allaah will say: dip him into Hell-fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah will ask: O son of Adam did you ever see any good, or ever see anything pleasing to the eyes?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He will answer: No, I swear by Your (Izzah) honour I never ever saw any good, nor anything pleasing to the eyes.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Benefit:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth shows the permissibility of swearing by a <em>Sifah</em> (characteristic) from the <em>Sifaat</em> of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>, and from what al-Bayhaaqi mentioned in a chapter heading in ‘Sunaan al-kubra’ (10/41) ‘Chapter : What is mentioned regarding swearing by the <em>Sifaat</em> of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> like <em>al-Izzah</em>(Honour)<em>, al-Qudrah </em>(Capability)<em>, al-Jalaal </em>(Magnificence)<em>, al-Kubreeyah </em>(Pride)<em>, al-Uthma </em>(Greatness)<em>, al-Kalam </em>(Speech) and <em>as-Sam</em>a’ (Hearing) and those similar to it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he mentioned some <em>Ahadeeth</em> under this chapter, and he pointed to this hadeeth. He also used, for evidence, some narrations on the authority of Ibn Mas’ood and other than him. Then he mentioned: “this narration is evidence that swearing by the Qur’aan is considered taking an oath……’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he narrated with an authentic chain on the trustworthy <em>Tabi’ee</em> (successor) Amroo bin Dinaar who said; ‘I met people for 70 years saying: Allaah is the Creator, everything other than Him is created and the <em>Qur’aan</em> is the speech of Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em>.’</p>
