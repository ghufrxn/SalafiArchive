<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>1- Definition of Islam</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Please, illustrate to me the meaning of Islam.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <strong>Islam</strong> means <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>total submission to Allah (Exalted be He) through belief in His Oneness, and showing subservient and servile obedience to Him</strong></span>. This is the meaning of Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabic root word ‘<strong>Aslama</strong>&#8216; means to show submission and surrender to someone and obey his commands. Accordingly, Islam means surrender and submission to Allah&#8217;s Will by means of believing in His Oneness, being devoted to Him, obeying His commandments and abandoning what He has prohibited. Such is Islam, about which Allah (Exalted be He) says: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Truly, the religion with Allah is Islam</strong></span>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Besides, a Muslims are thus called as they show complete submission to Allah and obey Him, abiding by His Commandments and refraining from what He has prohibited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam is also a name for <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>all the Commandments of Allah (Exalted be He) and His Messenger (peace be upon him)</strong></span>, including Salah (Prayer), Sawm (fast), Zakah (obligatory charity), Hajj (pilgrimage), faith and so on. Such categories fall under Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this regard, Allah (Exalted be He) says: (<span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favor upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion</b></span></span>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) also says: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers</strong></span>, )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, a Muslim is a person who submits himself to Allah (Exalted be He) as far as words, practical behavior and belief are concerned. In other words, Islam stands for total submission to and abidance by His Commandments in all aspects of life.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">In this episode <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/audio/audio-saleh-as-saleh"><strong>Dr. Saleh Al-Saleh</strong></a> <em>rahimahullaah</em> explained on the topic of <strong>&#8220;Who We Must Worship?&#8221;</strong> Human beings are in need to worship, but Who to worship? And What are his attributes? And how he will be worshiped? The lectures provide a good explanation to such hard questions.</p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Some Excerpts from the Video:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The submission and obedience of man to His Creator is the essence of Islam. The Name “Islam” is chosen by God (Allaah) and not by man. It is the same message revealed to all the prophets and Messengers by Allaah and which they spread amongst their respective nations. In its final and universal form it was revealed to Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم: may Allaah exalt his mention and save him and his message from all kinds of evil).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is the identifying name or title of the Majestic, sole and True God. This noun which is the name of Allaah applies to none other than Him. He, Most Majestic and Most High, has other names all of which follow on from His name Allaah. The meaning of the name Allaah is the ma’looh (that which is worshipped out of love, magnification, deification, and longing). He is the Creator: to Him belongs the Commandment. No worship is worthy of being given to a stone, statue, a cross, a triangle, Khomeini, Farakhan, Elijas, Malcom’s X or Y, Ghandi, Krishna, Gurus, Buddha, Mahatma, Emperor, Joseph Smith, Sun, Moon (not to that from Korea too), Diana, light fire, rivers, cows, Rama, Temples, Prophets, Messengers (Yes! Muslims do not worship Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم), Saints, Priests, Monks, Haile Selassie, Movie Stars, Sheiks, etc.!! All are created beings or things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The name Allaah is not chosen by man and it is not named after a prophet, saint or any famous man. The name “Allaah” was referred to by all prophets including Adam, Jesus, Moses, and by the last and final Prophet, Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم), as the One true God who deserves to be worshipped alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The innate nature in man (fitrah) recognizes what is good and bad, what is true and false. It recognizes that the Attributes of Allaah must be True, Unique, and All-Perfect. It does not feel comfortable towards any kind of degradation of His Attributes nor does it relax towards associating human qualities to the Creator. Many who became “discontent with God” did so because of the practices of the Church in medieval Europe and because of the claims of “god dwelling in a son”, and that “everyone is born with an original sin”. They “escaped” into worshipping a new theory called “mother nature” as well as the “material world”. With the advancement of materialistic technology others from different religions adopted the concept of “forgetting about God” and “let us live this life and enjoy it!” not realizing that they have chosen the worship of the “origin god” of Rome: The god of desire!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Today we can see that all of this materialistic progress produced a spiritual vacuum that led to complex social, economical, political, and psychological problems. Many of those who “fled” their “religions” are in search again. Some try to “escape” the complexity of their daily lives via various means. Those who had the chance to examine the Qur’an and Islam, proceed with a complete code for life which requires man to fulfill the purpose for his presence on earth. Allaah does not want for man to be enslaved to any false deity: nature, drugs, lust, money, other men, desire, or sex. He provides the proofs that he is the One who can deliver man from the slavery to any form of creation and to turn to his Creator alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Creator has Perfect Attributes. He is the First, nothing is before Him. He is the Last, everything ends except Him; the Most High, nothing is above Him; the Most Near, nothing is beyond His reach and his compassing, and He is the Most High in His nearness. He is the Ever-Living, to Him we shall all return, where everyone will be dealt with in the Most Perfect and Just way. He does not beget nor is He begotten. Those who attribute Divinity to Jesus forget or ignore the fact that Jesus was in a mother’s womb. He needed nutrition; he was born and grew up to be a man. He was trusted with the Gospel (Injeel) as a message to the Children of Israel. A man-messenger calling his nation not to worship him. A man who needs to eat, walk, sleep, rest, etc. cannot have Divine Attributes because he is in need, but Allaah, the God of Jesus, is far above any imperfection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With respect to Buddhism, Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Rastafarianism, etc., all are forms of worship to created beings/things in one form or another. Jews had attributed a nationalistic belonging to Allaah: “The Tribal God” of Israel. Men and women following these religions were born with the natural inclination of worshipping their Creator, Allaah. It is their parents who had driven them into their respective traditions. Once they are exposed to the Signs of Allaah around them, or in the Qur’an, or to someone who triggers their Fitrah (natural inclination to worship Allaah alone), the reverting process begins, and that is why we see a universal spreading of Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many distortions of Islam in the media, worldwide. However, Despite the wrong practices of some Muslims (rulers and ruled) in some countries, those who seek the truth are judging Islam according to its doctrines. That is why we continue to witness a global growth in the number of people accepting this true religion of Allaah. The opposition to Islam will intensify with the spread of this truth in the world. This is not a conflict of “civilizations”, but rather the real struggle between the truths presented in the creed and principles of Islam and false doctrines and ways of worship. This is a real challenge for those who seek the Truth. Man is created for a purpose: to live a life in accordance with Allaah’s way. Why Not? Do we posses the air we breathe? Did we create ourselves or others? Or were we ourselves the Creators? So is it our right to ignore our Creator when we are all need of Him? Allaah is All-Just and All-Wise. He does not intend confusion for His Creation. The religion accepted to Him is the one chosen by Him. Its essence must be One, because He is One and only one True God. It is the religion of submission to the Will and Commandment of the One Who brought us to life, the Ever Living who will never die. It is the complete way of life for all mankind. All these qualities are chosen by Allaah in His only religion: Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I hope that you will come with an open heart to read the Noble Qur’aan, because none can expose the truth better than the Word of Allaah. The Qur’an was revealed to Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) in Arabic and it is not authored by him for he was unlettered. The translations of its meanings into many languages are available in bookstores or in an Islamic Center close to you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You may want to know how does one become a Muslim. In order to become a Muslim one must openly recite ash-shahaadah (the profession of faith): La ilaaha illallaah, Muhammad Rasoolullaah which means that there is no true god except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah. This means that there is no god worthy of being worshipped but Allaah, and that He must be worshipped only according to the teaching of His Messenger Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم). Those teachings are best understood by the Prophet’s companions, and those who rightfully follow their path until the Day of Resurrection. They are called as-salaf as-saalih (the Righteous Predecessors). May Allaah, the Most High, guide us all to this path.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Belief that Allaah created us and gave us provision and did not leave us without purpose.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first matter is that Allaah created us and gave us provision and did not leave us without purpose.<sup>3</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>The first: that Allaah created us</strong>”: meaning, He produced us from non-existence, so before we were created we were nothing, just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">هَلْ أَتَىٰ عَلَى الْإِنسَانِ حِينٌ مِّنَ الدَّهْرِ لَمْ يَكُن شَيْئًا مَّذْكُورًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Has there not come upon man a time-period when he was nothing worthy of mention</strong>.</span> [76:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the One free of all imperfections said:<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قَالَ كَذَٰلِكَ قَالَ رَبُّكَ هُوَ عَلَيَّ هَيِّنٌ وَقَدْ خَلَقْتُكَ مِن قَبْلُ وَلَمْ تَكُ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He said: that is the case, however your Lord has said, “It is easy for Me and I have already created you before, when you were nothing.” </strong></span>[19:9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Man, before he was created was nothing, and the One who brought him into existence and created him is Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَمْ خُلِقُوا مِنْ غَيْرِ شَيْءٍ أَمْ هُمُ الْخَالِقُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Were they brought into existence without any creator, or are they themselves their own creators? </strong></span>[52:35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>and He gave us provision</strong>”: since we need provision, we need food and drink and clothing and habitations and transport and requirements then He the Perfect, He knew our needs, so therefore He made subservient for us whatever is in the heavens and the earth all of it for our welfare in order for us to be able to remain alive, and in order for us to use that to help us upon the purpose for which we were created – which is the worship of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>and He did not leave us without purpose</strong>”: <em>Al-Haml</em> it means something which is neglected and abandoned which no-one cares about. So Allaah created us and gave us provision for a wise purpose, He did not create us in vain, nor without purpose. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَفَحَسِبْتُمْ أَنَّمَا خَلَقْنَاكُمْ عَبَثًا وَأَنَّكُمْ إِلَيْنَا لَا تُرْجَعُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do you think that you were created uselessly and that you will not be returned to us? </strong></span>[23:115]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Perfect said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَيَحْسَبُ الْإِنسَانُ أَن يُتْرَكَ سُدًى</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَلَمْ يَكُ نُطْفَةً مِّن مَّنِيٍّ يُمْنَىٰ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ كَانَ عَلَقَةً فَخَلَقَ فَسَوَّىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Does man think that he will be left without any duties? Was he not previously a drop of semen emitted, then he became a clot, then Allaah created and fashioned him as a human in due proportion? </strong></span>[75:36-38]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا خَلَقْنَا السَّمَاءَ وَالْأَرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا بَاطِلًا ۚ ذَٰلِكَ ظَنُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا ۚ فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا مِنَ النَّارِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We did not create the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them without purpose. That is the assumption of those who disbelieve, so woe to those who disbelieve from the Fire!</strong></span> [38:27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah only created us and created these provisions for us and these faculties for a tremendous wisdom and a tremendous purpose and it is that we should worship Him, He the Perfect and Most High.  And He did not create us like cattle, which were created for the welfare of the servants, then they will die and pass away because they are not duty-bound, they were not commanded and they were not forbidden. Rather He created us for His worship, just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَا أُرِيدُ مِنْهُم مِّن رِّزْقٍ وَمَا أُرِيدُ أَن يُطْعِمُونِ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الرَّزَّاقُ ذُو الْقُوَّةِ الْمَتِينُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And I did not create <em>jinn</em> and mankind except to worship Me alone. I do not desire from them any provision and I do not want that they should feed Me. Indeed Allaah, He is the Great Provider, the Possessor of Tremendous Power, the Strong.</strong></span> [51:56-58]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He did not create us just for the life of this world that we should live in it and roam  around freely and make merry and eat and drink and make ourselves at home in it and that there is nothing after it. Rather life is a planting-ground and a market place for the next life so that we should equip ourselves in it with righteous deeds. Then we will die and move on from it, then we will be resurrected, then we will be taken account of, then we will be recompensed in accordance with our deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the purpose behind the creation of the <em>jinn</em> and mankind. And the proof for that is many <em>aayahs </em>which prove <em>al-Ba‘ath</em> (the raising to life after death) and <em>an-Nushoor</em> (the resurrection) and <em>al-Jazaa’</em> (the recompensing) and <em>al-<u>H</u>isaab</em> (the reckoning). And the intellect proves this, because it would not befit the Wisdom of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, that He should create this amazing creation, and that he should subject this creation to the descendents of Aadam, and then just leave them to die and pass away without any result, this would be futile play, so the results of these deeds must certainly appear in the next abode.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore, there can be from the people those who spend their whole lives in the worship of Allaah and in obedience to Him, and yet he is in poverty and is needy and maybe he is one who is oppressed and hard-pressed and who suffers difficulty and he does not attain anything from the reward of his actions in this world. And vice versa, that from the people there can be a person who is an unbeliever, an evil atheist who roams around as he wishes and makes merry in this life. He enjoys a life of luxury and he is given whatever he desires, and he commits that which Allaah has made forbidden, and he oppresses the people, and he transgresses against them and he devours their wealth and he kills people without any right, and he overcomes and he behaves tyrannically, and then he dies upon that condition, he has not been struck with anything from punishment. Does it befit the Justice of Allaah the Perfect and Most High and His Wisdom that He should leave this obedient person without any reward and that he should leave this unbeliever without any recompense? This does not befit His Justice, the Perfect and Most High, and therefore He has made the next abode to recompense this doer of good for the good which he did, and this doer of evil for the evil which he did. So in it the fruits of deeds will become apparent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this world is the an abode of action, but as for the hereafter then it is an abode of recompense, either paradise or the fire, and he did not leave us without purpose as is thought by the atheists and the <strong><em>Duhriyyoon</em> </strong>(those who think that death is the end of us). He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَالُوا مَا هِيَ إِلَّا حَيَاتُنَا الدُّنْيَا نَمُوتُ وَنَحْيَا وَمَا يُهْلِكُنَا إِلَّا الدَّهْرُ ۚ وَمَا لَهُم بِذَٰلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ ۖ إِنْ هُمْ إِلَّا يَظُنُّونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they say, “There is no life except our life in this world, we die and our children live, and nothing brings an end to us except Time.” And they do not have certain knowledge, rather they just surmise.</span> </strong>[45:24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the saying of the atheists those who do not believe in the return to life and resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah the Mighty and Majestic rebutted them, so He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَفَنَجْعَلُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ كَالْمُجْرِمِينَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَا لَكُمْ كَيْفَ تَحْكُمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Shall we make the Muslims like the criminals just the same? What is wrong with you how do you judge?</span> </strong>[68:35-36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَمْ حَسِبَ الَّذِينَ اجْتَرَحُوا السَّيِّئَاتِ أَن نَّجْعَلَهُمْ كَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ سَوَاءً مَّحْيَاهُمْ وَمَمَاتُهُمْ ۚ سَاءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do those who commit evil deeds think that We will treat them just the same as those who truly believe and work righteous deeds, the same in their life and after their deaths? What an evil judgement they make. </strong></span>[45:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَمْ نَجْعَلُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ كَالْمُفْسِدِينَ فِي الْأَرْضِ أَمْ نَجْعَلُ الْمُتَّقِينَ كَالْفُجَّارِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Or shall We make those who truly believe and work righteous deeds like those who cause corruption upon the earth, or shall We treat those who are dutiful to Allaah just like the wicked unbelievers? </strong></span>[38:28]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is not possible and this will never be the case.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The closest thing to man is himself. How many of us really know about ourselves before even thinking about the environment surrounding us? There are many great things in ourselves that we are either heedless regarding their magnificence or that we take for granted. Let us take the following journey back to the days when each one of us was an “embryo” inside the womb of his mother:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Who took care of me with utmost care and graciousness when I was a tiny seed settled on the wall of the uterine with three layers of darkness surrounding me?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who made my mother’s blood bring me food I need until I grew up to a stage in which my body was able to stand the air, the light, and the hands of people who turn me around?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, when the contractions pushed me, and I was “squeezed” out and to the world of tests and trials I came out!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who shielded you inside as a “fertilized egg”? Then who made your residence enlarge as you grew up? Who opened the way for you when you came out naked without belongings or wealth?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There you came so poor and needy. Two “containers” of milk hanging on your mother’s chest came to the rescue! Who commanded the milk to develop and then to stand ready for your lips to come and suck it out? A milk so agreeable to you, neither cold nor hot; neither salty nor bitter. You were so thirsty and so hungry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who turned the hearing of your mother and filled it with mercy, love and attachment? The moment she hears you crying she comes forth led by her mercy and love. She would prefer to see herself in pain not you! You enlighten her life. Who put all of that in her heart?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When your body got stronger and your belly size became bigger, you needed another kind of food. Who put in your mouth the cutting and grinding “tools”? Who held your teeth from growing during the period of your breastfeeding? It was a mercy for your mother when they were held and a mercy for you when they came out! And the stronger you became, the more you got from these “tools” of your mouth! Thereupon you used a new set of “tools”: the molars working on meat, bread and all kinds of solid food. Who provided you with these “instruments” and made them easy for you to utilize.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When we came out we knew nothing. What a burden it would have been if we were born in a state possessing the intelligence of an adult wrapped in diapers? What kind of living it would be? Would we receive the care and kindness you normally get as developing newborns?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our intelligence developed gradually and we were able to slowly but surely familiarize ourselves with our surroundings. Who is the One Who is All-Wise and Most Merciful, the One Who is ever watching over us and providing us with the means we need in due proportions and exact measurements?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then who is the One Who fashioned our heads with hair as a beauty and protection from cold and heat? Who adorned the face of the growing man with the distinctive beauty of the beard and kept the woman’s face soft, radiant and hairless?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many are turning away from the one who created us and increasingly becoming heedless regarding the true objective behind our existence. They are misled by a concept and a “theory”. That is it! A “theory” that practically denies the existence of the true God (Allaah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Darwin [1], presented a &#8220;theory&#8221; that denies the creation of man as well as creation itself. The theory was announced in the second half of the nineteenth century. Although it is an &#8220;assumption,&#8221; there are those who consider it scientific evidence to support their arguments against the reality of creation. The theory claims that the origin of life lies in a single small animal that was &#8220;developed&#8221; on its own from water. The &#8220;environment&#8221;, according to the theory, imposed specific structural changes on this organism producing new features in it. These changes were then inherited in the offspring and further transformed with time to produce more advanced creatures of which man is the highest form. This is the theory of Darwin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many critical aspects of the lives of people are still affected, knowingly or unknowingly, by some basic elements of Darwin&#8217;s theory, mainly the idea of &#8220;development&#8221; and its link to the &#8220;environment.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The objectives of this book are to:</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah (God) to enlighten the hearts of those men and women who will read this book, and to guide them to worship Him alone by submitting their wills to His will. The submission and obedience to Allaah&#8217;s Will and Commands as detailed in the last Revelation to mankind, the Qur&#8217;an, is the meaning of Islam.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>From A Small Animal to Man!</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>A Theory With A Broken Chain</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Background and Basics of The Theory:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) The theory depends on what was observed in archeological discoveries at the time of Darwin: old and new geological layers contained different remains from different forms of creation. The &#8220;old&#8221; layers contained &#8220;primitive&#8221; forms of creation while more recent layers contained more &#8220;advanced&#8221; forms. Darwin concluded that the &#8220;more advanced&#8221; creatures originated (evolved) from the &#8220;lower primitive” ones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) The theory also depends upon an idea that was prevailing at the time of Darwin in which it was thought that all animal embryos were similar at their early stages of development. This brought a conclusion that &#8220;the origin of all beings is one&#8221; and that &#8220;evolution&#8221; on earth occurred in the same way it occurred inside the wombs of living beings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) Furthermore, the theory cites &#8220;differences in the roles&#8221; of the appendix in man in comparison to that in monkey. Since it is assumed that it &#8220;does not have a role&#8221; to play in the function of the human body while it can digest plants in monkeys, the theory suggested that the appendix in man is an underdeveloped form that was a left over from monkeys.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(4) The theory assumes the presence of a &#8220;Natural Selection&#8221; process in which there are &#8220;elimination factors&#8221; that can abolish the weak living beings while the strong ones are kept, and that their characteristics are to be inherited in their offspring. With time these characteristics will accumulate in the new beings producing new characteristics. According to Darwin, this represents the &#8220;evolutionary&#8221; process that makes of these new characteristics &#8220;higher&#8221; forms of life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(5) The theory suggests a &#8220;Sexual Selection&#8221; process by which there is a tendency of the male and female to mate with the strong and best members of both sexes. The characteristics of the &#8220;best&#8221; will be &#8220;inherited&#8221; and those associated with weak animals would be &#8220;eliminated&#8221; because of the lack of tendency and/or interest to mate the weak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(6) Whenever a new characteristic is evolved it is inherited in the offspring.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">REALITY VS THEORY</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(1) The Points about Archeology</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The science of archeology is far from being complete and no one can claim that the search has been completed under the earth or sea layers. The door is still open for more discoveries that may contradict the theory. Assuming, however, that the findings of this science are completed, this does not establish that &#8220;higher&#8221; forms of life are developed from &#8220;lower&#8221; ones. This is only evidence for organized existence of these beings (in any form) at times when the environment is suitable for that. On the other hand, the archeological studies at the time of Darwin estimated that man&#8217;s life on earth was 600,000 years whereas new archaeological discoveries give an estimate figure of 10 Million years. This is a reflection of the incompleteness of these studies and that this science is still variable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also important to note that there are many &#8220;missing links&#8221; in the so-called &#8220;evolutionary chain&#8221; of Darwin&#8217;s theory. For example there are no archeological data to link animals of &#8220;single cells&#8221; and those of “multiple cells” nor between invertebrate animals and fish or amphibians. The same is true between amphibians and reptiles and between amphibians and birds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(2) The Point About Embryos</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was a wrong conclusion made by some scientists because of the less sophisticated microscopy present at Darwin&#8217;s time. Today&#8217;s technology demonstrates that there are fine differences between the structure, build up and organization of animal embryos.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(3) The Point About The Appendix</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The presence of this organ in man does not represent a concrete evidence for the development of man from a &#8220;monkey&#8221;. Rather its presence is inherited from the grand-man who depended upon vegetation as a source of food to help him digest it. In addition, there could be other important functions for the appendix that are not discovered yet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(4) The Point About Natural Selectivity</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>(a) Elimination &#8220;Factors&#8221; &amp; Life &#8220;Factors&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Surely there is a law and discipline that work to eliminate the living creatures, weak as well as strong. Allaah ordained death on every living being. The elimination factors are not the only factors that affect life on this planet. There are &#8220;life factors&#8221; as well, and that there is a discipline of mutual dependency and relationship between the living being and its environment. These &#8220;factors&#8221; represent the true means which Allaah has provided: sun, seas, wind, rain, plants, gravity, etc. All of these means are coordinated to provide survival for man, animals and plants. Considering the &#8220;elimination factors&#8221; alone and disregarding the &#8220;life factors&#8221; is confusion on the part of Darwin&#8217;s theory. When scientists try to formulate theories to explain certain matters in the outside world, they take into account all factors of influence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>(b) Natural Selectivity or &#8220;Mother Nature&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Surely those in support of the theory of evolution like to refer to &#8220;Mother Nature&#8221; as the &#8220;source&#8221; that provides and supports the &#8220;natural selectivity.&#8221; &#8220;Mother Nature&#8221;, however, lacks wisdom, power, self-coordination, will, and knowledge. Natural things such as wind, lightning, water, storms, warmth, severe cold, etc. can cause destruction or deformation. How could these conditions explain the beauty of the creation and its fine course of establishment and coordination? How could the minute elements in the egg of a bird &#8220;know&#8221; that the egg must appear in the form of a bird and thus it has to break its own shell to survive? The One Who had created nature provided all the means for its course of existence and activity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now we see that many who arrogantly deny Allaah&#8217;s existence try to divert the attention of the people to worship this &#8220;new&#8221; deity called &#8220;Mother Nature&#8221;! In many conversations some people are reluctant to say &#8220;God&#8221; when they want to refer to &#8220;supernatural&#8221; phenomena. Instead, they say: &#8220;Mother Nature&#8221; did such and such. They like to look &#8220;normal and advanced&#8221; and not &#8220;strange and backward&#8221; in front of others. The idea of &#8220;how people will look at me,&#8221; overshadows that God (Allaah) is more important than people. It is a reflection of psychological defeat in front of secularism, which itself is the major fruit of Darwin’s theory. It is lack of true faith in the true God, Allaah. A believer in Allaah would not fear saying the Name of his Creator, the Most Merciful, and the Most Compassionate. He knows that those around him will one day die, but Allaah is the Everliving. So, who must count first? He knows that Allaah is the Sustainer and Provider and not the “Chairman of the Boards” nor the “Chief Executives,” managers, or any other boss! This is the benefit of worship of Allaah: A liberation from slavery to anything and (or) anyone but Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>(c) &#8220;Mother Nature&#8221; Is Not The &#8220;Creator&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A simple comparison between man and nature illustrates that man can see, hear, know, learn, reason, etc. whereas nature has none of these qualities. How could man then be &#8220;more advanced&#8221; than a &#8220;creator&#8221; known as “Mother Nature?&#8221; This proves the falsehood of the idea of god-Mother Nature. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Say (O Muhammad) [صلى الله عليه وسلم [2] to mankind): How do you worship besides Allaah something which has no power either to harm or benefit you? But it is Allaah, Who is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 5:76).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In many aspects, nature is under man’s service, and its resource is under his disposal, as Allaah had decreed in the Final Revelation to mankind, the Qur&#8217;an:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“See you not (O men) that Allaah has subjected for you whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth, and has perfected His graces upon you (both) apparent [3] and hidden [4]? Yet of mankind is he who disputes about Allaah without knowledge or guidance or a Book giving light.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 31: 20).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With the progress of technology some people became even more arrogant. Not only do they refer to &#8220;Mother Nature&#8221; as the &#8220;founder or creator,&#8221; but aim to control nature itself. It is a strange conclusion! Allaah has made it very clear that there will be this type of people:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“The likeness of (this) worldly life is as the rain which We send down from the sky, so by it arises the intermingled produce of the earth of which men and cattle eat until when the earth is clad with its adornments and is beautified, and its people think that they have all powers of disposal over it. Our Command reaches it by night or by day and We make it like a clean-mown harvest, as if it had not flourished yesterday! Thus do We explain the Signs (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, laws, etc.) in detail for people who reflect.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 10: 24).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>(d) The &#8220;Laws&#8221; of Nature</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some consider that &#8220;Nature&#8221; represents the &#8220;Laws&#8221; that govern the universe. They try to explain how things occur, but do not answer questions like: Who created this universe? Who put the &#8220;Laws&#8221; into effect? This leaves them separated by an artificial barrier into two &#8220;personalities&#8221;: one that best &#8220;fit&#8221; the society (i.e. the outside) and tries to give &#8220;interpretations&#8221; for what occurs in the universe; and one kept within themselves confessing that God (Allaah) is the One commanding these &#8220;supernatural&#8221; phenomena. But under dangerous circumstances, you hear them calling: “Oh my God!” or “God help me!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the old ages, man knew that rain came down from the sky. Today we know a lot about this process, from the evaporation of water up to the formation of raindrops, there is a reflection of real actions. In their references, scientists do not tell us how did these realities become laws. For example: why are these laws coordinated in ways allowing birds to fly in the air, fishes to live in the water, and man to live on the earth? &#8220;Nature&#8217;s&#8221; qualities are not its own. It has been given the attributes we feel and see around us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The true Creating Power has all the Perfect Attributes and All-Perfect Actions. He is Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Say (O Muhammad (peace be upon him)): Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth? Say: &#8220;(It is) Allaah.&#8221; Say: &#8220;Have you then taken (for worship) Auliyâ&#8217; (protectors) other than Him, such as have no power either for benefit or for harm to themselves?&#8221; Say: &#8220;Is the blind equal to the one who sees? Or darkness equal to light? Or do they assign to Allaah partners who created the like of His creation, so that the creation (which they made and His creation) seemed alike to them.&#8221; Say: &#8220;Allâh is the Creator of all things; He is the One, the Irresistible.</span> (Qur’aan 13: 6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The One Who has created (everything), and fashioned it in due order and proportion; Who has measured and granted guidance. </span>(Qur’aan 87: 2-3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“The One who has created the seven heavens one above another, you can see no fault in the creation of the One (Allaah) Whose Mercy encompasses everything. Then look again: “Can you see any rifts?” “Then look again and yet again, your sight will return to you in a state of humiliation and worn out.” </span>(Qur’an 67: 3-4).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Allaah is He Who raised the heavens without any pillars that you see. Then He ascended the ‘Arsh (the Throne in a manner that suits His Majesty). He has subjected the sun and the moon (to continue going round)! Each running (its course) for a term appointed. He regulates all affairs, explaining the Aayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) in detail, that you may believe with certainty in the meeting with your Rabb.</span> (Qur’an 13: 2).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“He has created the heavens without any pillars, that you see, and has set on the earth firm mountains, lest it shake with you. And He has scattered therein animals of all kinds. And We send down water (rain) from the sky, and We cause (plants) of every goodly kind you grow therein.”</span> (Qur’an 31: 10).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And indeed We [5] created the heavens and the earth and all between them in six Days and nothing of fatigue touched us [6].”</span> (Qur’an 50: 38).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>(e) A God Other Than Allaah!?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In an Address to man, Allaah sends clear and vivid verifications as well as challenges for man and for these &#8220;gods&#8221; that some invoke and worship:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Is not He (better than your gods) Who has made the earth as a fixed abode, and has placed rivers in its midst, and has placed firm mountains therein, and has set a barrier between the two seas (of salt and sweet water). Is there any god with Allaah? Nay, but most of them know not.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 27: 61).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Is not He (better than your gods) Who created the heavens and the earth, and sends down for you water (rain) from the sky whereby We cause to grow gardens full of beauty and delight. It is not in your power to cause the growth of their trees. Is there any god with Allaah? Nay, but they are a people who ascribe equals (to Him)!”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 27: 60).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Is not He (better than your gods) Who guides you in the darkness of the land and sea, and Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His Mercy (Rain)? Is there any god with Allaah? High Exalted be Allaah from all that they ascribe as partner (to Him)!”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 27: 63).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Is not He (better than your gods) Who originates creation, then repeats it, and Who gives you sustenance from heaven and earth? Is there any god with Allaah? Say, &#8220;Bring forth your proofs, if you are truthful.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 27: 64).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Say (to the disbelievers): &#8220;Tell me, if Allaah took away your hearing and your sight, and sealed up your hearts, who is there-an &#8220;ilah&#8221; (a god) other than Allaah could restore them to you? Look, how variously We explain the Signs, yet they turn aside.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 6: 46).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many in this world have turned to worship many created things or beings. Divine attributes has been given to Buddha, ‘Eesa (Jesus), Saints, Monks, Musa (Moses), Prophets, Places, Rivers, Cows, Temples, etc., Do these &#8220;gods&#8221; benefit or harm?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And they worship besides Allaah things that hurt them not, nor profit them and they say: &#8220;These are our intercessors with Allaah.&#8221; Say: &#8220;Do you indeed inform Allaah with that which He knows not, in the heavens or on earth? Far is He removed from every imperfection! And far is He above all that which they associate as partners with Him!”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 10: 18).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Where did they find &#8220;Names&#8221; for them?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“You do not worship besides Him but only names which you have forged, you and your fathers, for which Allaah has sent down no authority. The command is for none but Allaah. He has commanded that you worship none but Him, that is the (true) straight religion, but most men know not.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 12: 40).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Where are the things they have created?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“This is the creation of Allaah. So show me that which those (whom you worship) beside Him have created. Nay but the wrong-doers (and those who do not submit to Allaah) are in plain error.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 31: 11).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8216;Tell me or inform me (what) do you think about your (so-called) partner-gods to whom you call upon besides Allaah, show me, what they have created of the earth? Or have they any share in the heavens? Or have We given them a Book, so that they act on clear proof therefrom?&#8217; Nay, the wrong-doers (and those who do not believe in Allaah) promise one another nothing but delusions.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 35: 40).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In fact they are unable to create even a fly:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Verily! Those on whom you call besides Allaah, cannot create (even) a fly, even though they combine together for the purpose. And if the fly snatched away a thing from them, they would have no power to release it from the fly. So weak are (both) the seeker and the sought.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 22: 73).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>They themselves are created, aren&#8217;t they?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Attribute they as partners to Allaah those who created nothing? But they themselves are created.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 7: 191).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>They cannot even help themselves!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“No help can they give them, nor can they help themselves.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 7: 192).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ‘Have you then taken (for worship) protectors other than Him, such as no power either for benef) it or for harm to themselves?’ Say: ‘Is the blind equal with the one who sees? Or darkness equal with light? Or do they assign to Allaah partners who created the like of His creation, so that the creation (which they made and His creation) seemed alike to them.’ Say: Allaah is the Creator of All things. He is the One, the Irresistible.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 13: 16).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>They cannot answer those who invoke upon them!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“So call upon them and let them answer you if you are truthful.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 7: 194).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above proofs are sent down from Allaah to bring people to their senses. This is a Mercy and Kindness from Allaah for mankind. He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Allaah Is the One Who sends down manifest Aayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations etc.) to His slave (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) that He may bring you out from darkness into light. And verily, Allaah is to you Full of Kindness, Most Merciful.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 57: 9).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(6) The Point About &#8220;Sexual Selection&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The survival of the strongest is not evidence for selective developmental evolution. The only thing that can be understood about the mating tendencies is that they will maintain continuity in the same strong kind and an end to the weak kind. Thus:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) The muscles of a strong athlete will not be inherited in his offspring.<br />
(ii) The mind of a high quality scholar will not be transferred to his children by inheritance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The saying that newly acquired characteristics can be inherited is rejected by modern genetic studies as well as known facts. Any quality that is not an intrinsic part of the genome is &#8220;temporal&#8221; and is not transmitted to the offspring by inheritance: Muslims circumcise their babies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their children are not born circumcised!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(7) &#8220;Under-developed Theory&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have not seen (or heard about) certain types of animals coming to existence through the process of developmental transformation. There was no monkey transformed into a man even after hundred years or so!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The nose of a dog is more sensitive in its smelling function than that of man. Is the nose of the dog more &#8220;advanced&#8221; than that of man? Or are the birds (with flying abilities) and frogs (with amphibian abilities) more &#8220;developed&#8221; than man? The eye of the camel and that of the horse or donkey can see during day and night, is it true then that these animals represent more &#8220;advanced&#8221; forms than man?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The male man, like the male elephant, has breast marks while horses and male donkeys do not (except some resemblance to whatever their respective mothers were). So, why does the male man continue to possess this feature while it was not present in some &#8220;lower&#8221; beings?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Scientists have called Darwin&#8217;s study a &#8220;Theory&#8221; and clearly there is always a difference between theory and reality. A theory by definition is falsifiable.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCES</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The idea of &#8220;selection for the strong&#8221; had a tremendous influence on humanity. It made it easy for some strong men and strong nations to think and feel that they are strong and superior because of an &#8220;evolutionary selective process.&#8221; They feel that they are entitled to certain practices of domination according to the idea &#8220;survival is for the best!&#8221; This is well manifested in the colonial expansions, racism, and in many practices by many of the so-called &#8220;democratic nations&#8221; who practice the principle of supremacy: &#8220;Might is Right.&#8221; The idea of &#8220;development&#8221; interprets life as a &#8220;constant struggle between living beings and that the survival is only for the one that best fits the environment around it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In reality this environment is a materialistic one and it dictates the type of development, its size, and its direction in an imposed way leaving no role for the living being. This idea is very well used in our times to support the materialistic life of the modern world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Materialism is imposed in a way as an integral part for &#8220;development.&#8221; In the name of &#8220;development&#8221; today&#8217;s &#8220;secondary&#8221; things for your home are becoming the &#8220;necessary&#8221; items of tomorrow and if you don&#8217;t buy them you are going to &#8220;look different,&#8221; &#8220;rejected&#8221; and a &#8220;drop out&#8221; because you do not &#8220;fit&#8221; the environment around you. Just look around and see the many thousands of things that were &#8220;secondary&#8221; a year ago and became &#8220;essential&#8221; a year later! Open a woman’s dresser today and see the latest &#8220;fashion&#8221; dresses and shoes. Come next month and you find &#8220;new&#8221; ones. She has to &#8220;fit&#8221; into the &#8220;environment&#8221; around her. Men are also influenced with this &#8220;fit the environment&#8221; concept. Who is doing this to the World? Many are those who contribute to this problem. They come from “big businesses”, media sectors, politicians, military establishments, academia, ‘the world of fashions’, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the name of progress, many people are influenced by the materialistic environment and are driven away from Allaah, their Creator. On the other hand, many are discovering the truth regarding the very essence of the purpose of existence. They are finding true, satisfactory and beneficial life in the code of life which their Creator has described in the final revelation to man: the Noble Qur’an. They came to know the beauty and reality of the following verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Say: (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): “Truly, my prayer, my sacrifice, my living, and my dying are for Allaah, the Rabb [the Creator, the Owner, and the One Who Commands and Administers everything] of the ‘Aalameen [all that exists].”</span> (Qur’an 6: 162).</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Why Did The &#8220;Theory” Spread?</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The theory came at a critical moment in the conflict between the church and many of its corrupted doctrines on one hand and the secular sector (especially scientists) in the 19th century Europe, on the other hand. During this conflict many scientists were killed and/or persecuted. This theory was one of the weapons that were raised by the scientists in their fight with the religious authorities in and outside Europe. It was presented as &#8220;The Scientific&#8221; reference of the mind. It was introduced in the education programs of most of the colonized countries as &#8220;Scientific Knowledge&#8221; to support its acceptance. Many colonized Muslim countries were targeted and this caused a great deal of negative influence on many generations, especially with the victory of the secular-scientific thoughts in Europe over the church-made laws. This played a role in the spread of secular thoughts in many parts of the world. For many it helped promote a stand against church oppression, and when it served its purpose it was transformed to serve the purpose of influence and secularism.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most people had no idea about the theory itself and/or the its concept of &#8220;selectivity&#8221; that was used as a “pretext of justification” for colonization, reflecting the prejudice of “being better” than those “weak ones” from the “other” world communities.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>THE QUR&#8217;AN AND THE &#8220;THEORY&#8221;</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allaah, the Most High, tells us about any matter, it comes from the One Who is All-Knowing. Whatever man knows is nothing compared to what Allaah, the Exalted, Knows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Allaah knows and you know not.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 216).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Should He not Know, what He created? And He is the Most Kind and Courteous (to His slaves) All-Aware (of everything).”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 67: 14)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why do people question their origin when they did not witness its creation? This is result of secular reasoning. Without the reality of creation, there is no purpose for man&#8217;s existence:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“I called them not to witness (nor took their help in) the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor (even) their own creation.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 18: 51).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whatever Allaah decrees in relevance to man&#8217;s creation is different from &#8220;theories&#8221;! Allaah, the AllKnowing, tells us that He informed the Angels about the creation of Adam before it happened:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And (remember) when your Rabb said to the angels: Verily, I am going to place (mankind) generations after generations on earth.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 30).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, Most High, told us about the kind of material from which Adam was created: dust and water, and the offspring of Adam from sperm:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“O mankind! If you are in doubt about the Resurrection, then verily! We have created you from dust (i.e. Adam) then from a Nutfah (mixed drops of male and female sexual discharges i.e. offspring of Adam) then from a clot (a piece of thick coagulated blood) then from a little lump of flesh, some formed and some unformed (miscarriage) that We may make (it) clear for you (to show our Power and Ability to do what We will). And We cause whom We will to remain in the wombs for an appointed term, then we bring you out as infants [7], then (give you growth) that you may reach your age of full strength. And among you there is he who dies (young), and among you there is he who is brought back to the miserable old age, so that he knows nothing after having known.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 22: 5).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“He is the One Who has created you from clay and then decreed a stated term (for you to die).”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 6: 2).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah shaped Adam by His own Hands [8]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Allaah said:&#8221;O! Iblees (Devil) what prevents you from prostrating yourself to one whom I have created with both My Hands.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 38: 75).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (Muhammad-صلى الله عليه وسلم) also informed us that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“When Allaah created Adam from a Handful from all of the earth (material), the children of Adam came just like the earth: amongst them the red, the white and the black and those who are in between; the easy and the sad; the evil ones and the good ones.&#8221;</span> [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah then changed this clay into “sounding clay:”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“He created man (Adam) from a sounding clay like the clay of pottery.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 55: 14).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Exalted and Magnificent, breathed into this clay a created and honored soul and life came into Adam and he became Adam that can hear, see, talk and think:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“So, when I have fashioned him (in due proportion) and breathed into him his soul created by Me, then you (angels) fall down prostrating to him.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 15: 29).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Right after Adam&#8217;s creation he started to speak:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And He taught Adam the names (of everything); then He showed them to the angels and said &#8216;Tell Me the names of these if you are truthful.&#8217; They (angels) said: &#8216;Far is You (Allaah) removed from every imperfection, we have no knowledge except what you have taught us. Verily, it is You, the AllKnower, the All-Wise. He said: O Adam! Inform them of their names&#8230;”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 31-32).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even the first woman was created from the first man, Adam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“O mankind! Be dutiful to your Rabb, Who created you from a single soul (Adam) and from him (Adam) He created his wife, and from them both He created many men and women..”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 4: 1).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the creation of Adam, Allaah commanded angels to prostrate to Adam; all of them obeyed. This is a great Honor to Adam. Iblees (the Devil) refused out of arrogance:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And (remember) when We said to the angels: &#8220;Prostrate to Adam.&#8221; So they prostrated except Iblees (the Devil). He was of the Jinns10; he disobeyed the Command of His Rabb.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 18: 50).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah expelled him from His Mercy, and warned Adam against him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Will you then take him (Iblees) and his offspring as protectors and helpers rather than Me while they are enemies to you? What an evil is the exchange for the wrong-doers (and polytheists).”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 18: 50).</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>THE TEST</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Both Adam and his wife were tested in Paradise. They were allowed to eat from all the fruits of Paradise. They were ordered, however, to stay away from a particular tree:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And We said: O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the Paradise and eat both of you freely with pleasure and delight of things therein as wherever you will, but come not near this tree or you both will be of the wrong-doers.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 35).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They disobeyed Allaah by eating from it and Allaah sent them down to earth to live with their posterity, that He may test their obedience and submission to Him. Certainly they repented and Allaah, Oftforgiving, accepted their repentance. The status of the children of Adam is above that of monkeys or lizards:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And indeed We have honored the children of Adam, and We have carried them on land and sea and have provided them with At-Tayyibat (lawful good things), and have preferred them above many of those whom We have created with a marked preference.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 17: 70).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the true origin of man: an honored being above that of a cockroach or a mouse! The response of man must be that of thanks to his Creator, Allaah, manifesting itself in true submission and obedience to Him. This is the meaning of Islam. It is the religion of man since Adam, peace be upon him and it is the same religion of Noah, Ibraaheem (Abraham), Musa (Moses), ‘Eesa (Jesus) peace be upon them all. It is manifested in its final, completed, and preserved form in the Qur&#8217;an that was revealed to Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم. It calls man to dissociate himself from any form of worship to other than his Creator, Allaah<a href="http://AbdurRahman.org/">.</a></p>

<span style="color:#808080;"> Saleh As-Saleh</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]Charles Robert Darwin (1809-1882).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] The Arabic inscript صلى الله عليه وسلم is an invocation recited after the name of the Prophet Muhammad is stated. It reads: Sallaa Allaahu ‘Aleihi Wasallam, which means: May Allaah Praise his mention and safeguard him from every imperfection and from all kinds of evil.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] i.e. Islamic Monotheism, the lawful pleasures of this world, including health, good looks, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] i.e. One&#8217;s faith in Allaah, knowledge, wisdom, guidance for doing righteous deeds, and also the pleasures and delights of the Hereafter in Paradise, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]The “We” refers to Allaah Himself. It is common with Semitic languages for any monarch to use the “We” and “Us” when referring to himself. And to Allaah belongs the best example. He Glorifies Himself as suits His Majesty. When Allaah says: “We” or “Us,” no one who is familiar with the Arabic lexicology understands that this refers to “more than one God united in one!” Allaah is One and Unique and all of His Attributes describe His Essence, not qualities of separate “gods”! He is the Most Merciful, the Provider, the Creator, the Oft-Forgiving, the Originator, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] The authenticity of the contents of any book, which describes Allaah with imperfect Attributes, is questionable. Allaah acts, originates, creates, and does what He wants such that neither tiredness nor slumber or sleep overtakes Him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Neither slumber, nor sleep overtakes Him. (Qur’an 2:255)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] Prophet Muhammad, may Allaah exalt his mention and render him safe from every imperfection, said: &#8220;(As regards your creation), every one of you is collected in the womb of his mother for the first forty days, and then he becomes a clot for another forty days, and then a piece of flesh for another forty days. Then Allaah sends an angel to write four words: He writes his deeds, time of his death, means of his livelihood, and whether he will be wretched or blessed (in the Hereafter). Then the soul is breathed into his body&#8230;&#8221;(Collected in Saheeh Al-Bukhari which contains the most authentic traditions of the Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم (vol. 4, hadeeth # 549). The texts are published by Dar-Arabia (Beirut, Lebanon) in English and Arabic. This narration came from Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم who was un-lettered. These early stages of growth of the human body were known only approx.1400 years after the Prophet&#8217;s explanation. These statements, together with other prophecies by the Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم is a testimony that a) he was a true messenger of Allaah and b) the Qur&#8217;an he was trusted with is a true Revelation from Allaah. Those searching for the truth can find in the Qur&#8217;an their objective if they are sincere in their strive.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] All of the Attributes of Allaah are real and true. He informed us about Himself and about His Attributes. He speaks only the truth. In all of His Attributes He is perfect and distinct from His creation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And nothing is like unto Him. He is the All-Hearer AllSeer.” ( Qur&#8217;an 42: 11).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] Related by the scholars of Hadeeth: Al-Tirmithee and Abu Dawood and Al-Hakim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] Jinns are beings created with free will, living on earth in a world parallel to that of man, and are invisible to human eyes in their normal state. The term &#8220;Jinnee&#8221; (English: Genie) is equivalent to Jinn, and Jaann may be used as its plural or as another singular form. In Islamic literature, Shaytaan (English: Satan, Devil) is a name given to disbelieving Jinns. Amongst them are the believers and non-believers.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. I begin to write</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THE innate nature (<em>Fitrah</em>)</strong> in man recognizes what is good and bad, what is true and false. It recognises that the attributes of God (Allah) must be true, unique, and all-perfect. It does not feel comfortable towards any kind of degradation of His Attributes, nor does it relax towards attributing human-like qualities to the Creator. Many who became &#8220;<em>discontent with God</em>&#8221; did so because of the practices of the Church in medieval Europe and because of claims such as &#8220;<em>God dwells in a son</em>&#8221; and that &#8220;<em>everyone is born with an original sin</em>&#8220;. They “<em>escaped</em>&#8221; into worshipping a new thing called &#8220;<em>mother nature</em>.” With the advancement of materialistic technology others from different &#8220;religions&#8221; adopted the concept of &#8220;<em>forget God</em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em>let us live this life and enjoy it</em>.&#8221; They revived the old “god&#8221; of Rome, the &#8220;<em>god of desire</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Today</strong> we can see that all of this materialistic progress produced a spiritual vacuum that led to complex social, economical, political, and psychological problems. Many of those who &#8216;<em>fled</em>&#8221; their religions  are in search again. Some try to &#8220;<em>escape</em>&#8221; the complexity of their daily lives through various means. Those who examined the Qur&#8217;an and Islam found a complete code for life that requires man to fulfil the purpose of his existence on earth. Allah does not want man to be enslaved to any false deity: nature, drugs, lust, money, other men or women, desire, or sex. This holds true for Muslims and non-Muslims as well. He gives the proofs that He Alone is the One Who can deliver man to free himself from the slavery to any form of creation and to turn to his Creator Alone. He is the <strong>First</strong>, nothing before Him. He is the <strong>Last</strong>, everything ends except Him. He is <strong>Most High</strong>, nothing above Him. He is <strong>Most Near</strong>, nothing is beyond His reach. <strong>He does not beget</strong>, <strong>nor is He begotten</strong>. He is the Lord of Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad, the Praise and Mercy of Allah be upon them all.  To Him Alone man must submit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Mankind</strong> must know about the purpose of their existence on earth; their responsibility towards their Creator and what they must do in preparation for the Day on which they will return to Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Saleh As-Saleh</em></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE PURPOSE AND THE RETURN</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>ALLAH</strong> created man and man belongs to Him. He (سبحانه و تعالى) ordained that one day man shall die and return to Him. This world is a transitional period. Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) wanted man to shape his life according to what He (سبحانه و تعالى) had decreed. This is the meaning of worship. Worship requires absolute obedience, humility and love for Allah, Who promised an Eternal life in Paradise for those who obey and worship Him alone, and an Eternal abode in Hell for those who reject Him and His orders:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“So those who believed (in the Oneness of Allah) and did righteous deeds will be in Gardens of Delight (al-Jannah, Paradise).”</strong></span> (Qur’an 22: 56)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“But those who disbelieve and belie Our Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, signs, revelations, etc.) such are the dwellers of the Fire, they shall abide therein forever.”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 39)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Man&#8217;s life at home, as a farmer, a car-dealer, an electrician, a computer consultant, a president, a company’s C.E., a spouse, etc., has to abide by a way of life according to the guidelines Revealed by Allah. He is the one who defined what is good and what is bad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He stated that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Whoever works righteousness, whether male or female, while he (or she) is a true believer (in the Oneness &amp; Uniqueness of Allah), verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e., AlJannah).”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 16: 97)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Revelation contains all the details about what is good and bad. It is not left for the limited nature of man to define what is good and what is bad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And We have sent down to you the Book (the Qur&#8217;an) as an exposition of every thing and a guidance, Mercy, and glad tidings for those who have surrendered (to Allah as Muslims).”</strong></span> (Qur’an 16: 89)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The command is for none but Allah. He has commanded that you worship none but Him (i.e. Pure Monotheism), that is the (true) straight religion, but most men know not.”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 12: 40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah made it clear that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Whosoever does righteous good deed it is for (the benefit of) his own self, and whosoever does evil, it is against his own self, and Your Rabb (Lord) is not at all unjust to (His) slaves.”</strong> </span>(Qur&#8217;an 41: 46)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Greatest good is achieved when the believer fulfils the role prescribed for him by his Creator, Allah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“And I (Allah) created not the Jinns and men except they should worship Me (Alone).”</span></strong> (Qur’an 51:56)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Message of Islam fits the Fitrah in man. Allah created man in the best form. He (سبحانه و تعالى) gave this Fitrah the ability to believe in the Unseen. The animal lives within the framework of his senses while man can relate to a broader scheme amongst which is the ability to believe in the Unseen. Thus man&#8217;s soul and its horizon are broader and more open than that of animals. Man knows that the electric current is composed of small particles known as electrons. While we are unable to see these particles, their effects could be seen on an instrument known as the oscilloscope in the form of electron waves. In Nature and in ourselves we can see the Signs of Allah everywhere and we must relate, therefore, to the Creator in the perfect way He has chosen. This is His right upon us: to worship Him Alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) asked his companion Mu‘adh ibn Jabal:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O Mu’adh! Do you know what is due to Allah from His lbaad (the created beings) and what is due them? I responded: &#8220;Allah and His messenger know best.” He continued: &#8220;What is due to Allah from His Ibaad is to worship Him alone and never associate any other being with Him. What is due to them is not to punish any person who does not associate anyone (or anything) with Him.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Man, through the faculties that Allah has bestowed upon him, can relate to the unseen atom with its unseen electronic &#8220;shells&#8221; that build up its characteristics. Man can also relate through his Fitrah to his Creator. The Fitrah recognizes the Attributes of the true God and His Signs in the creation although it is unable to see Allah in this life. One can then easily understand that the greatest reward Allah had given to the believers is the actual seeing of Himself on the Day of Judgement. Knowing Allah in His Names and His Attributes drives man to fulfil the purpose for his presence on earth as stated in the above verse and in Allah&#8217;s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The command is for none but Allah. He has commanded that you worship none but Him (i.e. Pure Monotheism), that is the (true) straight religion, but most men know not.”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 12: 40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Attributes and His Signs in His Creation testify for His Oneness and that He is the Only True God who deserves to be worshipped. The rejecting man underestimates His Lord. He may reject any worship to Allah or turn to worship other than Allah. Amongst the rejectionists, there are those who think that this Universe has founded itself or it came to exist by co-incidence. This necessitates that man &#8220;has no goal to fulfil,&#8221; because he came into being without a defined goal! Consequently, a moral or a value system becomes meaningless. Accordingly, man is just a responding &#8220;tool&#8221; for &#8220;mother nature&#8221; which, according to Darwin himself, &#8220;acts haphazardly&#8221;! This way of thinking is aimlessness, and it occurs when man does not recognize his relation with the One who has created life and death, the Universe and everything around man, all in due proportion:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things.”</strong></span> (Qur’an 65: 3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who reject man’s need to His Creator, Allah, are the aimless ones. Allah refers to them in the Qur&#8217;an:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“They have hearts (minds) wherewith they understand not, they have eyes wherewith they see not, and they have ears wherewith they hear not (the Truth). They, are like cattle, nay even more astray; those! They are the heedless ones.”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 7: 179)</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">CREATION IS IN NEED OF ALLAH</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Man always looks for what benefits him and what protects him from harm. However, to accomplish this, man must be able to realize what is harmful. He must then know whom he should need, trust, and love so that he can attain what is beneficial as well as feel good about his choice. He also must know the proper and good approach that would make him achieve this goal. This latter condition requires that man:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a) Know about harm<br />
b) What ways can be used to drive harm away</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Certainly, man can have no better guidance than that which comes from the One Who has perfected everything, and the One who Has No deficiency in Himself nor in His Attributes. The One Who is Ever-Living and who does not die. There can be no One better than the One Who Has no need for anything; the One Who is Rich; the Giver, the One Who, after all, controls man&#8217;s soul, and runs all affairs. Man is so poor to Him. He is Allah, the True and only God. Man can bring harm to himself if he seeks other than Allah for help. Allah is the One Who can help man drive away any harm for it cannot occur without His Will and His Power.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) sent down His Books and chose His Messengers to guide man to:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a) Know His Lord as He (سبحانه و تعالى) has explained about Himself, and<br />
b) Seek Him Alone while living in accordance with His plan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowing Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes liberates man from worshipping any form of creation because creation is weak and imperfect and is in need of the Creator, Allah. The knowledge about Allah leads man to know that he is created to live according to Allah&#8217;s way as revealed to the last Messenger, Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم). This Revelation contains a complete code of life. Everything that is beneficial or harmful is established so that man can focus his life around this Revelation. If man commits wrong and knows that Allah is Oft-Forgiving he would turn to Him and to Him Alone seeking His forgiveness:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Know, therefore, that there is no God who deserves to be worshipped except Allah; and ask forgiveness for your sins.”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 47:19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is wrong to think or believe that Allah created other “gods” besides Him so that man turns to them for help, loves them or fear them, etc. He is the same God of all nations. He does not order that people should make of stars, sun, fire, Jesus, Moses, etc. gods besides Him. He (Most Exalted) cannot be &#8220;contradictory.&#8221; He has one way (religion) that calls man to surrender his will only to Him. He (سبحانه و تعالى) warned that if man, even Muhammad-صلى الله عليه وسلم and any Prophet or Messenger, would take partners with Him, then his work will fail and he will be among the losers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And verily, it had been revealed to you (O Muhammad) as has been revealed to those before you: If you join others in worship with Allah (then) surely (all) your deeds will be in vain and you certainly be among the losers. Nay! But worship Allah and be among the grateful.”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 39: 65-66)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let us think what Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم), the man-Prophet, who knew Allah best, used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O Allah, I seek refuge in You for Your Pleasure and against Your Wrath, and in Your Forgiveness and against Your Punishment and in You from You, I cannot Praise You as You can Praise Yourself.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;I have surrendered myself to You, I have directed my face to You, I have entrusted my affairs to You, I have compelled my back to refuge in You, in want and in fright of You, there is no resort nor survival from You except (in turning) to You, I have faith in your Book (i.e., the Qur&#8217;an) which You brought down and in the Prophet (Muhammad) you have sent.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When we read in the Qur&#8217;an that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Whatever of Mercy (i.e., of good), Allah may grant to mankind, none can withhold it, and whatever He may withhold, none can grant it thereafter. And He is the All Mighty, the All-Wise”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 35:2),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and when we read:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;If Allah touches you with hurt, there is none who can remove it but He; and if He intends any good for you, there is none who can repel His favour which He causes it to reach whomsoever of His slaves He will, and He is the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221;</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 10: 107),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">we should be motivated to return to Him Alone at times of ease and at times of hardship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when we read that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“If Allah helps you none can overcome you, and if He forsakes you, who is there, after Him, that can help you? And in Allah (alone) let believers put their trust”</strong> </span>(Qur’an 3:160)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur&#8217;an, therefore, leads man to a true liberation from any false attachment. It brings peace to the heart. It helps the believer against hypocrisy and all forms of dishonesty. Imagine, for example, a believer facing a problem at work. He sees wrong and faces unlawful practices. He does not fear rejecting what is wrong. He knows that the job is only a mean to gain his sustenance. While he may be unable to correct what is wrong, he knows well that Allah is the One Who provides. If he leaves his job for the sake of Allah, Allah will give him a better one:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him. He will make a way for him to get out (from) every (difficulty), and He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine.”</strong></span> (Qur’an 65: 2-3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above necessitates that man must depend upon Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) asking Him Alone for assistance. It also requires that man must love Allah and worship Him alone to gain His pleasure and His help. Is it not true that the people who consider this life as the &#8220;Final Goal&#8221; end up worshipping many things in it? You see them so careful about &#8220;having it all.&#8221; They torture themselves: pain; difficulty; constant worry; keeping their hands in the banks for loan after loan to keep up with the &#8220;demands&#8221; of development.&#8221; They are under the constant threat of fore-closure. They constantly see poverty in front of their eyes. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) says: Son of Adam: fill your time with My worship and I will fill your heart with richness, and end off your poverty. But if you do not, I would make your hands fully busy (i.e., in worldly affairs) and I would not end off your poverty.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our purpose of existence on earth is more meaningful than being slaves to worldly gains. There can be no meaningful life better than that prescribed by our Creator Allah. Every act done according to Allah&#8217;s way is an act of worship. Man is the beneficiary and Allah is in no need:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“O mankind! It is you who stand in need of Allah, but Allah is Rich (Free of all wants and needs), Worthy of All Praise.”</strong></span> (Qur’an 35: 15)</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE MODERN CIVILIZATION</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“We can pray to God yet live life as we like”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people think that: to live an Islamic life is &#8216;restrictive&#8217;! Islam, however, is the medium code of life. It recognizes that within the Fitrah there are motivations that influence man&#8217;s role on earth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• a drive to eat,<br />
• a drive to drink,<br />
• a drive to have a home,<br />
• a drive for sex,<br />
• a drive for ownership,<br />
• a drive for success, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Without control, all of these legitimate motives could be very dangerous. What constitutes a perfect control is the discipline that gives an organised manifestation for these motivations without totally abolishing them or becoming enslaved to them. Islam deals with this Fitrah by providing a Divine Discipline that elevates man above animals. Man lacks perfect knowledge as well as perfect wisdom. Therefore, he is unable to provide a perfect way of life. Allah, Most Perfect in His Wisdom and Knowledge perfected a course of life and set limitations and rules all of which are beneficial to man:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“These are the limits (set) by Allah, so approach them not.”</strong> </span>(Qur’an 2: 187)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“These are the limits set by Allah, so do not transgress them.”</strong></span> (Qur’an 2: 229)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why Islam does not condone celibacy because it is against the Fitrah. The fo llowing incident describes the Islamic stand towards life:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that some of the companions of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) asked his (the Prophet&#8217;s) wives about the acts that he performed in private. Someone among them (among the companions) said: I will- not marry women; someone among them said&#8230; 1 will not eat meat (and fast all day); and someone among them said: 1 will not lie down in bed (and stand in prayer all night). He (the Prophet-صلى الله عليه وسلم) praised Allah and glorified him and said: What has happened to these people that they say so and so, whereas I observe prayer and sleep too; I observe fast and suspend observing them; I marry women also? And he who turns from my Sunnah (way), he has no relation with me.]&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam does not condone the surrender to lust as it is the case in this contemporary &#8220;civilization&#8221;! Islam recognises the natural inclination of man towards the love of women, children, gold, silver, possessions, etc. Such inclination is essential to drive man towards settlement and civilization:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;It Is He who had brought you forth from the earth and settled you therein.&#8221;</strong></span> (Qur’an 11: 61)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Beautified for men is the love of things they covet: women, children, much of gold and silver (wealth), branded beautiful horses, cattle and well-tilled land. This is the pleasure of the present world&#8217;s life; but Allah has the excellent Return (Paradise with flowing rivers. etc.)”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 3: 14)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These inclinations are not the objective! They are to be taken in a balanced way. The way to deal with them is real, and Allah gives a detailed description of the balanced approach that gives man a perfectly balanced pleasure in this life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The use of the word &#8220;restrictive&#8221; comes from those who think that they live a &#8220;free&#8221; life. They accept many man-made restrictive rules that affect every aspect of our lives, although these rules are not perfect because man is imperfect. Man accepts these rules thinking that they benefit him. If the reward is high and the Benefit is eternal, should not man accept what is high and leave what is low? There is no sense in accepting what is lower!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Would you exchange that which is better for that which is lower?”</strong> </span>(Qur’an 2: 61)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Seeking the perishable goods of the worldly life. There are much more profits and booties with Allah.”</strong></span> (Qur’an 4: 94)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“You desire the good of this world, but Allah desires (for you) the Hereafter. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.”</strong> </span>(Qur’an 8: 67)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This worldly life has good things in it. They are, however, perishable. Allah, The AllWise, organised the way to achieve what is good without transgressing and/or oppressing others. Capitalism allows ownership without limits. This produces political, social, and economical injustice, as is evident in Capitalist countries. On the other hand the failed communism suppressed the inclination of man towards private ownership.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam responds in a perfectly balanced way when it deals with the human soul. As stated in the above verse (Qur&#8217;an 3:14), it is normal for man to love money, gold and silver, women, etc. The challenge, however, is to take a medium and just course in dealing with this love.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam prohibits usury, monopoly, compulsion, theft, robbery, hoarding gold and silver, luxurious spending, conceitedness (if wealthy). On the other hand Allah ordained a fixed annual charity that limits inflation and provides a sharing process for the poor. Also He decreed a medium course of spending. All of these represent control mechanisms to prevent social, political and economical injustice. Have we thought about the fact that usury (in the form of interests on loans) holds people as well as nations under the siege of the banks and multinational financial institutions?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the name of “modern freedom,” men and women are easily driven by their lusts to &#8220;enjoy&#8221; a sexual &#8220;affair&#8221;. Nowadays, man knows that the consequences are harmful. Allah had provided man with a control mechanism for his sexual desires, in the form of legal marriage to more than one woman. He (سبحانه و تعالى) made of this mechanism a legal and a moral binding process to protect women. It is not an affair! It is a very real and medium course for those who are able to support more than one house, and for those who have strong sexual desires. It is very realistic. It is done in the open and not in motels, hotels, or private apartments such that when the woman gets pregnant the man takes a flight saying, “Bye, Bye honey!” The craze for lust is affecting the life of others! AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases are just some examples.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Man accepts the accountability principle laid down by his boss in a company. There are man-made restrictions on flights and on the use of many instruments. Man thinks they are there to protect him. In part this may be true, but how about the guidelines that are set by Allah to save the whole living of man? Such guidelines come from the One who is Perfect, not man who is imperfect! The “freedom” that leads a person to an eternal destruction in a Confined Place called Hell is the utmost restriction. The true freedom of man is that which builds a civilization that has a Divine value system and in which man submits to His Creator Alone. A civilization that reacts with the life of this world and links it to the Day of Return. On that Day everyone will be held accountable in front of the One Who is All-Just, All-Wise, All-Merciful, Sever in Punishment, and OftForgiving, Allah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“It is He Who has made the earth subservient to you (i.e., easy for you to walk to live and to do agriculture in it, so walk in the paths thereof and eat of His provision and to Him will be the Resurrection (of the dead).”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 67: 15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the above verse there is a reminder for man that, while searching for his sustenance, he must abide by what Allah had decreed. Consequently, there is accountability, either reward or punishment. This calls for responsibility and not “restriction”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another reminder on the road to build the responsible society:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“But seek, with that (wealth) which Allah has bestowed on you the Home of the Hereafter, and forget not your portion of legal enjoyment in this world and do good as Allah has been good to you and seek not mischief in the land. Verily Allah likes not the mischief-doers.”</strong></span> (Qur’an 28: 77)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Civilization is not only professional progress in materialistic forms. Although this is required, it has to comply with the moral system as prescribed by the Creator to have a meaningful outcome. Otherwise this progress will bring man&#8217;s own destruction by promoting an attachment to desires as well as a power struggle to control the world&#8217;s resources. This is best explained in the verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“O mankind! We have created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female and made you into nations and tribes that you may know one another. Verily, the most honourable of you in the sight of Allah is that (believer) who is best in religion and best in good deeds. Verily Allah is All-Knowing. All-Aware.”</strong></span> (Qur’an 49: 13)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who live according to Allah&#8217;s way will be the best in His sight. Those are the truly successful ones who can build a true civilization. The following Ayah illustrates some beautiful aspects of this civilization:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“O you who believe! Enter not houses other than your own, until you have asked permission and greeted those in them, that is better for you, in order that you may remember. And if you find no one therein, still, enter not until permission has been given. And if you are asked to go back, go back, for it is purer for you, and Allah is Knower of what you do. There is no sin for you that you enter (without taking permission) houses uninhabited (i.e., not possessed by anybody) (when) you have any interest in them. And Allah has knowledge of what you reveal and what you conceal. Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and protect their private parts from sins. That is purer for them. Verily Allah is aware of what they do. And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts, etc.)”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 24:27-31)</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">The Way Out</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The modern civilization has influenced many parts of the world. It attracted many people through its materialistic progress. In this civilization acts like dedication, honesty, honouring an appointment, respecting the rights of others, are not purely done for the sake of Allah, but for the sake of interest. Such features are limited within the frame work of social interactions. This mostly exists in the so called &#8220;pragmatic&#8221; or the &#8220;freeworld civilization&#8221;. When carefully examined, it is a narrow-minded, self-oriented, and eventually self-destructive approach. In the modem civilization, one hand is extended to shake with, while the other is ready to intervene when there are &#8220;conflicting&#8221; interests. Because of the actual worship of self-interests, people of this &#8220;civilization&#8221; must deal &#8220;nicely&#8221; with each other so as to minimise &#8220;friction.&#8221; There is a continuous &#8220;lubrication&#8221; of this system to keep it running with the least possible friction. But when it comes to people who are not part of the &#8220;free-world,&#8221; intervention, rather than &#8220;lubrication,&#8221; takes place under the banner of &#8220;Global Interests,&#8221; &#8220;Humanitarian Aid,&#8221; or &#8220;World Order&#8221;! The recent position towards systematic killings of Muslims in Bosnia is a vivid manifestation of this real nature of modem civilization. Compare the position towards Bosnia with the quick response and intervention for the sake of &#8220;interests&#8221; in other parts of the World. When it comes to politics, there is rarely any moral binding. Lying, cheating, and dishonouring the rights of others are practiced in the name of National Interests!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the economical front, the usury (interest system) is an open rip off that unlawfully uses people&#8217;s money making some rich and others poor. Every possible mean is used to advertize products regardless of their benefit. On the issue of sex, there is chaos never like it in history. The family structure is in disarray. Divorce rates are soaring. Teenagers are depressed. Many take antidepressant drugs on the job! The wide-spread psychology clinics on street corners of “effluent” suburbs is an evidence of complex social living. Suicide amongst the youth is alarming. Many people resort to take dogs or cats as &#8220;honest friends.&#8221; The market of drugs is depleting people&#8217;s money and health. AIDS is a direct response to arrogance against the natural and morally abiding decrees regarding sexual needs as set by the Creator. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Sins didn’t spread in any particular nation until they openly conduct it and as a result plague and other illnesses that were not present among their predecessors became widespread amongst them.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Cancer could have been a sufficient warning to reflect upon our estimate of Allah and His Attributes. However, the arrogance and disregard of Allah produced a &#8220;worship&#8221; of lust and brought what is worse than cancer. Could people stop neglecting to think about the purpose of life before more evil appears?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Evil (sins and disobedience of Allah, etc.) has appeared on land and sea because of what the hands of man have earned (by oppression and evil deeds, etc.), that (Allah) may make them taste a part of that which they have done, in order that they may return (by repenting to Allah, and begging His Pardon).”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 30: 41)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when man forgets Allah and His reminders:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“So, when they forgot that (the warning) which they had been reminded, We opened to them the gates of every (pleasant) thing, until in the midst of their enjoyment in that which they were given, all of a sudden, We took them to punishment, and lo! they were plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows.”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 6: 44).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For those who &#8216;worship&#8217; technology and who arrogantly think that they are building all powers of disposal over the earth, a reminder from Allah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>”Verily, the likeness of (this) worldly life is as the rain which We send down from the sky, so by it arises the intermingled produce of the earth of which men and cattle eat until when the earth is clad with its adornments and is beautified, and its people think that they have all powers of disposal over it, Our command, reached it by night or by day and We make it like a clean-mown harvest, as if it had not flourished yesterday! Thus do We explain the Signs (proofs, revelation laws, etc.) in detail for people who reflect”</strong></span> (Qur’an 10: 24)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many civilizations vanished before and were destroyed when they stood against the way of Allah. We do not have a special relationship with Allah that may save us when we ignore Him and follow our desires! The only true way of salvation is to submit to Him and His way as Revealed in the Qur&#8217;an and as explained by the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. This is the true way of Salvation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">A Final Word to Those Who Submitted to Allah in Islam</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam is the perfect way of life. Muslims vary in terms of their adherence to the Faith. There are those whose beliefs and practices adhere well to the way of Allah. Some commit sins but repent and regret. Others disobey and think they will be forgiven just because they are Muslims. Many resort in their worship to other than Allah. They call upon righteous men, dead or alive, and love them like they love Allah. This is the only sin that Allah does not forgive. Any Muslim who sets up rivals with Allah exits the fold of Islam. What matters is the pure submission to Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslims are called to liberate themselves from any worship to other than Allah. Following deviated sects that call for Sufism (mystic ways), Shee’ism (which gives Divine Attributes to men like Khumeini, and to certain Imams), Ismaa’eelism (another mystic sect that, like Sheeism, gives Divinity to ‘Ali Bin Abee Talib, the honourable companion of the Prophet Muhammad-صلى الله عليه وسلم), and all other ways that lead Muslims out of Islam, must be avoided.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the state, family, and individual levels, Muslims must apply the Law (Sharee’ah) of Allah in all of its aspects as detailed by Allah in the Qur’an and by the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم). This is the true way of Justice on earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The duty of the true Muslims is to call for the correction of beliefs and practices that contradict the purpose of man&#8217;s existence on earth. In the course of their duty, they can only depend upon Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) Alone, seeking His Guidance, Help and refuge in Him Alone.</p>
