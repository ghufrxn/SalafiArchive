<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">31-Ruling on making Du&#8217;a&#8217; the dead</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: What is the ruling on those who make Du&#8217;a&#8217; (supplication) to the dead?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ans by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who make Du`a&#8217; (supplication) to the dead are Mushriks (those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). If they make Du&#8217;a&#8217; to the dead, idols, trees, stones, angels or jinn, they will be regarded as Kafirs (disbelievers) as making Du&#8217;a&#8217; to all these leads to one thing; namely, Kufr (disbelief that takes the Muslim out of Islam),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One thing that can be excluded from this ruling which is seeking help from his fellow Muslim brother or non-Muslim like buying a commodity from a non-Muslim, asking him to build a shop or mend a car while the person while he is alive. This case is considered to be exceptional and is not a kind of Shirk. It is similar to what Allah (Exalted be He) mentions in the story of Musa (Moses): <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(The man of his own) party asked him for help against his foe)</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one asks his fellow Muslim brother or the non-Muslim, who is present, to do something for him like building a house, mending the car, or plowing the land in return for something, or they agree upon doing something that is legally permitted, there will be nothing wrong as all these things are normal and can be done by human beings who are alive and present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But what is Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect) is making Du&#8217;a&#8217; to those who are not present and cannot hear him, the dead or a living person whom he thinks to be supernatural and has a mysterious power. This understanding leads him to think that if he makes Du&#8217;a&#8217; to this person for forgiveness and admittance to paradise, he will be able to do this because of something secret about this person. This is Munkar even if the person who is invoked besides Allah (Exalted be He) is living.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Sufis who worship their Shaykhs and their senior and prestigious persons who are dead. They ask them for help and make Du&#8217;a&#8217; to them to cure the sick. All these things are considered to be major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) <strong>even if the person whom they make Du`a&#8217; to is alive because they ask him something beyond his abilities</strong>. This behavior differs from asking a person to lend you something, build a house for you, cultivate some land, mend a car, bring your belongings from the car, and so on. All these things are normal and contain there is nothing wrong in them.</p>

<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ إِذ ظَّلَمُوا أَنفُسَهُمْ جَاءُوكَ فَاسْتَغْفَرُوا اللَّهَ وَاسْتَغْفَرَ لَهُمُ الرَّسُولُ لَوَجَدُوا اللَّهَ تَوَّابًا رَّحِيمًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>If, when they had wronged themselves, they had come to you &#8211; O Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) – and had sought Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness, and the Messenger had asked for Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness for them, then they would have found that Allaah would have accepted their repentance and had mercy upon them. </strong></span><span style="text-align:center;">[Sooratun-Nisaa (4): 64]</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Ibnul-Qayyim (<em>rahimahullaah</em>)</strong> said:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Since Allaah – the One free of all imperfections – knew that those to whom the Messenger was sent would certainly wrong themselves and follow their desires, He guided them to that which would repel the evil of that wrong and remove its causes. This lay in two things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>, there was something that they themselves were to do, which was to seek forgiveness of their Lord – the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>, there was something for someone else to do, and this was that the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) should ask forgiveness for them when they came to him, submitted obediently to him and acknowledged their wrong-doing. So, if they were to do these two things, they would find that Allaah would accept their repentance and forgive them. He would accept their repentance, thus wiping away the effect of their sins and protecting them from their evils. In addition to this, He would grant them His Mercy, His favourable and fine treatment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, what share of this Aayah is there for a person who wrongs himself after the death of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ? Does the use of the Aayah support those people who claim that the person should go to his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) grave; ask for forgiveness there, and for his intercession?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reply is that, as for the share of the person who wrongs himself after the death of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) with regard to this Aayah, he should ask for Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness, with sincere repentance and this applies in every time and place. It is not a condition for the correctness of his repentance that he should go to his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) grave, and ask for forgiveness there. (By consensus- Ijmaa&#8221;).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">As for going to his grave and seeking forgiveness there and seeking his intercession, using this Aayah as an evidence, then the Aayah does not indicate this in any sense at all. It only refers to going to him (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ; not going to his grave; nor does it state that he will seek forgiveness for them if they seek intercession from him after his death.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is thus shown to be a false and futile argument which is further clarified by the fact that the Companions, those who of all people knew best about the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) , did not understand the Aayah in this way. So it is known that this is an innovation. That which is most frequently used as evidence by those who permit it, is the narration of al-`Utabee from an unknown Bedouin, even though we do not know any chain of narration for it. If this disconnected report, or it&#8217;s like, were a hadeeth or a report from a Companion, then it would not be permissible to use it as a proof, and its ruling would not be binding upon us because of its lack of authenticity. How then can it be permissible to use as proof for this a story that is not authentic, concerning a Bedouin who is unknown!? [1]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaikh ‘Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Naasir as-Sa`dee</strong> (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Meaning: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If, when they had wronged themselves, they had come to you &#8211; O Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">i.e. acknowledging their sins, and fully confessing them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>…and had sought Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness, and the Messenger had asked for Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness for them, then they would have found that Allaah would have accepted their repentance and had mercy upon them</strong></span>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">i.e. He would have turned to them, forgiven their wrongdoing, and been Merciful to them; by accepting their repentance, guiding them to it and granting it to them, and rewarding them for it. This coming to the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was something specific to his lifetime.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>This is what the context indicates, because seeking forgiveness from the Messenger cannot occur except in his lifetime. As for after his death, then nothing can be sought from him; rather that would be shirk.&#8221;</strong></span> [2]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 56:</strong> What is the correct and false Tawassul ?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong> At-Tawassul is the infinitive of <em>Tawassala</em>, <em>Yatawassal</em>–meaning to take a means that will make the person reach his intended goal. So, its original meaning is: Seeking to attain the intended objective.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is divided into two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Correct: And this is the Tawassul through the correct means leading to the intended goal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Incorrect: And this is the Tawassul by a way that does not lead to the intended objective.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to the first type, and which is the Tawassul by the means that lead to the intended objective, then it is of several types, including:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>1-Tawassul (seeking a means of nearness to Allaah) by means of His Attributes</strong></span>, regardless whether it is done in the general or specific sense.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example on the <strong>general way</strong> is the statements mentioned in the hadeeth reported by ‘Abdullaah bin Mas’oud (radhi Allaahu anhu) concerning the invocation said to relief from distress and grief:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O Allaah! I am Your slave, son of Your male slave and female slave. My forelock is in Your Hand. Your judgment concerning me is continuously executed. Your Decree over me is Just. I ask You by every Name which is Yours, with which You Named Yourself, Taught to anyone from Your Creation, or sent down in Your Book, or which You kept to Your Self in the Knowledge of the Hidden with You, that You make the Qur’aan the nurturer (the life of) of my heart, the light of my chest, the removal of my sadness and of my anxiety.&#8221; </span></em>[77]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This case is a Tawassul by means of Allaah’s Names in the general sense, as in his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) saying: <em>&#8220;I ask You by every Name which is Yours, with which You Named Yourself.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to the specific aspect, then it is <strong>to make Tawassul by means of one particular Name for a specific request befitting this Name</strong>, like what was reported in the hadeeth of Abu Bakr (radhi Allaahu anhu) when he asked the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to inform him of a supplication that he may use in his prayer. So the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;Say: O Allaah, I have done great injustice to myself, and none can forgive sin except You, so forgive me a forgiveness from You, and be merciful to me, as You are The Most Forgiving, The Most Merciful&#8221; </em></span>[78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he sought Forgiveness and Mercy and made Tawasssul to Allaah, The Most High, by means of two of His Names befitting what is being requested. So he said: &#8220;You are The Most-Forgiving, The Most-Merciful.&#8221; This type of Tawassul falls under the Saying of The Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allaah, so call on Him by them&#8221;.</em></span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-A’raaf (7): 180].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Supplication here comprises two types: Supplication when a request is made (du’aaul mas’alah), and invocation through worship (du’aaul ‘Ibaadah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regards to the Tawassul to Allaah by means of His Attributes, then it is like the Tawssul by means of His Names in the sense that it could be general and specific. As to the general way, then it is like your saying: &#8220;O Allaah, I ask you by Your Beautiful Names and Most Supreme Attributes,&#8221; then you mention your request. And with respect to the specific way, then it is to perform Tawassul to Allaah, The Most High, by means of a particular Attribute that is specifically related to a particular request, like that which was mentioned in the hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O Allaah by Your Knowledge of the Hidden and Unseen, and Your Power over the Creation, grant me life for as long as You Know that life is good for me, and grant me death when death is good for me.&#8221;</span></em> [79]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here Tawassul to Allaah, The Most High, is by means of the Attributes of ‘Ilm (Knowledge), and Qudrah (Power): &#8220;By Your Knowledge of the Hidden and Unseen, and Your Power over the Creation.&#8221; …This comprises the one type of Tawassul.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Second Type:</strong></span> A person seeks means of Nearness to Allaah <strong>by means of His belief in Him and in His Messenger</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, he says: &#8220;O Allaah I have believed in You and in Your Messenger, so forgive me, or grant me success and rectitude.&#8221; Or that he says: &#8220;O Allaah by my faith in You and in Your Messenger I ask you such and such.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from this is the Saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;Verily! In the Creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alteration of night and day, there are indeed signs for men of understanding. Those who remember Allaah [always, and in prayers] standing, sitting, and lying down&#8221;…to His saying: &#8220;Our Rabb! Verily, we have heard the call of one (Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) calling to Faith saying: ‘Believe in your Rabb,’ and we have believed. Our Rabb! Forgive us our sins and expiate from us our evil deeds, and make us die [in the state of righteousness] along with the Abraar&#8221; [the pious and righteous believers].&#8221;</em></span> [Qur’aan, soorat aal- ‘Imraan (3): 190-191].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they sought nearness to Allaah by their Eemaan in Him that He Forgive them their sins, expiate from them their evil deeds, and make them die along with the Abraar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Third Type is to make Tawassul to Allaah by means of righteous deeds.</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from this is the story of the three people who entered into a cave to sleep in it. They were trapped in the cave when a boulder [rolled down from the mountain] and blocked the entrance of the cave and they could not remove it away. So each one of them sought a means of nearness (Tawassul) to Allaah by means of a righteous deed that he had done. So the first one of them used his kindness to his parents as Tawassul, and the second used as Tawassul his perfect abstention from fornicating [with his uncle’s daughter]. As to the third one, he used as Tawassul his preserving the right of his employee. Each one of them said: &#8220;O Allaah if I did that seeking Your Face, then release us from our situation.&#8221; So the rock moved. This is Tawassul to Allaah (Azza wa Jal) by means of a righteous deed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Fourth Type is to use as Tawassul the conditions of a person</strong></span>, meaning that the supplicant seeks a means of nearness to Allaah by mentioning his circumstances and his state of need. And From this is the saying of Moosaa (alaihis salam):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;O My Rabb! I am in need of whatever good that You bestow on me.&#8221;</em></span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-Qasas (28): 24].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In doing so, he is using Tawassul to Allaah by mentioning his condition, asking Allaah to bestow whatever good on him. A related case is in the saying of Zakhariyyaah (alaihis salam):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;My Rabb! My bones have grown feeble, and grey hair has spread on my head.&#8221;</span></em> [Qur’aan, soorat Maryam (19): 4].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are some of the types of Tawassul, and all of them are allowed since they are good means to use as Tawassul to attain what is being intended.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>A Fifth Kind of Tawassul</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 57:</strong> Are there any other types of Tawassul in addition to the four that you have mentioned?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Answer: Yes, there is an additional type of Tawassul and it is the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>seeking of nearness to Allaah by means of the supplication of a righteous man</strong></span> and whom it is hoped that his invocation will be answered, because the companions (radhi Allaahu anhum) used to ask the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to invoke Allaah for them, generally and specifically.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed it is reported in the saheehayen (al-Bukhaaree and Muslim collections of hadeeth) from the transmission of Anas bin Maalik ((radhi Allaahu anhu)) that a man entered the Mosque on the day of Jumu’ah and the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was giving the Khutbah and said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah, the livestock are dying and the roads are cut off so supplicate to Allaah for us that He should give us rain.&#8221; So the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) raised up his hands and supplicated and said: ‘O Allaah bless us with rain,’-three times…and he did not descend from the minbar (pulpit) until the rain was dripping from his beard. The rain continued for a whole week. And on the next day of Juma’ah the same man or someone else came while the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was standing giving Khutbah…and said: ‘Buildings are being destroyed and livestock are being drowned, so supplicate to Allaah to withhold it for us.’ So the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) raised his hands and said: ‘O Allaah, around us and not upon us…’ so he did not point with his hands in any direction except that the clouds cleared away…and we went out walking in sunshine.&#8221; [80]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there are several incidences on which the companions asked the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to supplicate to Allaah specifically for them. And from this is the case when the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) mentioned that seventy thousand of his Ummah shall enter Paradise without reckoning nor punishment, and that they are those who do not treat themselves with Ruqya,[81] nor do they believe in good or bad omen nor do they get themselves branded (cauterized), but the put their trust in Allaah; thereupon ‘Ukaashah bin Muhsin stood up and said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah, supplicate to Allaah to make me from amongst them.&#8221; So he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: &#8220;You are one of them.&#8221; [82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is also from the kind of permissible Tawassul: that a person asks someone to supplicate to Allaah, The Most High, for him, if it is hoped for that this person’s supplication will be answered. However, it should be that the person requesting someone to supplicate Allaah for him intends to benefit himself and his brother, the one from whom he asked the supplication, so that the request is not solely for his own interest. Since if you want to benefit your friend as well as yourself, then this will end up as something good for him. This is because when a man supplicates to Allaah for his brother in his absence, the angel says: &#8220;Aameen, and for you the same.&#8221; Similarly when someone supplicates Allaah for his brother, then he is from those who do good by virtue of this supplication, and Allaah loves those who do good.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim (بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The Incorrect and Futile Tawassul and its Types</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 58:</strong> Having known the Correct <em>Tawassul</em> and its Types, then it is inevitable for us to know the Incorrect <strong>Tawassul</strong> and its Types.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong> The incorrect and futile Tawassul is to use an unprescribed way, something which is not affirmed as a legal way by Sharee’ah, as a means of nearness to Allaah, The Most High. Since Tawassul in this manner is from nonsense and falsehood that contradicts the intellectual and textual proofs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from this is that a person uses the<span style="color:#000000;"> <strong>supplication of a deceased man as Tawassul to Allaah</strong></span> (عز و جل). He asks this deceased person to supplicate to Allaah for him. Then this is not a correct and prescribed means. Rather it is foolishness on the part of the one who asks this deceased man to supplicate to Allaah for him. Since once he dies, the actions of the deceased cease to exist, and it is impossible for him to supplicate to Allaah for anyone. Even the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), it is not possible that he supplicates to Allaah for anyone after his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) death. For this reason, the companions (Radi Allahu Anhum) did not use as Tawassul to Allaah by asking the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to invoke Allaah for them after his death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In fact, when the people suffered a drought at the time of ‘Umar Ibn al-Khattaab (رضي الله عنه), he said: “<em><span style="color:#008000;">O Allaah we used to ask Your Prophet to supplicate on our behalf to You and You would bless us with rain, and now we ask the uncle of our Prophet [i.e. al-‘Abbaas (رضي الله عنه)] to supplicate to You on our behalf, so bless us with rain</span></em>.” So al-‘Abbaas (رضي الله عنه) stood up and supplicated to Allaah (عز و جل). Had the matter of asking the deceased’s supplication to Allah been a permissible and correct way, then ‘Umar and those with him from the companions would have asked that from Allaah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم). Since the response to his supplication is more likely to take place than that of ‘al-‘Abbaas ibn ‘Abdul-Muttalib (رضي الله عنه). What is important, therefore, is that Tawassul to Allaah by means of asking supplication from the deceased is false and impermissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the incorrect type of Tawassul is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>to seek nearness to Allaah by means of the status of the Prophet</strong></span> (صلى الله عليه و سلم), saying: “<em><span style="color:#008000;">O Allaah, I ask you by the rank of Your Prophet [to grant me] such and such.</span></em>” This is since the status of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is not something of benefit to you. It is only beneficial to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), but as regard to you then it is of no benefit to you that you use as Tawassul to Allaah, The Most High. And as we have mentioned, Tawassul is seeking the correct means that is fruitful. So, what is of benefit to you in that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) has an honourable status with Allaah? And if you want to make correct Tawassul to Allaah, then say: <em><span style="color:#008000;">“O Allaah, I ask You by my Eemaan in Your Prophet, or by my love of Your Prophet”</span></em> or the like, then this is from the correct and beneficial means.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The questioner asks O shaykh regarding at-tawassul ( a means of seeking nearness to Allaah with certain actions), it&#8217;s types and that is with the supplication of the righteous. </span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At-tawassul is of <strong>two types</strong>; the type that is legislated (allowed) and the type that is forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tawassul which is legislated is</p>
<ol>
<li>tawassul to Allaah by (using) His Names and Qualities or</li>
<li>tawassul by way of righteous actions or</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">tawassul in requesting supplication from a living person (who) is present, that he supplicates for you regarding your affairs; All this is permissible.</li>
</ol>
<p>The tawassul which is forbidden is</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">the tawassul done by the honor the creation, or by his right or by his personality or his uprightness.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the tawaasul which is forbidden. If the one who does so directs anything from worship to the one the tawaasul is made towards, then this is major shirk, just as that which the people of jaahiliyah were upon ( Allaah says) <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;they worship other than Allaah things that will not harm nor benefit them, they say these are our intercessors with Allaah&#8221;</span> (10:18) (also) Just as most of the grave worshippers are upon; those who seek nearness (to Allaah) by way of the deceased with different forms of worship and they say &#8220;these will intercede for us with Allaah&#8221; and this is major shirk!</p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the difference between Tawassul and Wasilah?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Tawassul (supplicating to Allah in the name of …/by virtue of the status of…) is the supplications recited by a person. It is a kind of supplication. One can say, &#8220;I invoke You by Your Names.&#8221; This is a sort of Tawassul. Also, one may say, &#8220;I invoke You by my faith in You.&#8221; This is also a way of Tawassul. Here the Wasilah (the means of approach to Allah) is faith, piety and Allah&#8217;s Most Beautiful Names. You are the person practicing Tawassul. <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Tawassul itself is your supplications.  Wasilah refers to the words used in your supplications</strong></span>. When you say, &#8220;O Allah! I invoke You by Your Most Beautiful Names and Sublime Attributes to forgive me,&#8221; you are the person practicing Tawassul through this supplication. The Wasilah or the means of approach to Allah here is His Names and Attributes. Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes are called Wasilah. This means that supplicating to Allah by His Names and Attributes is a sort of Wasilah. The wording of supplication is called Tawassul. It is a sort of supplicating to Allah by faith, by Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes, or by one&#8217;s good deeds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imams Bukhari and Muslim</strong> reported that the Messenger sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Three persons of a people before you, were on a journey when they were overtaken by a storm and therefore they took shelter in a cave. A rock slipped down from the mountain and blocked the exit from cave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of them said: &#8220;The only way for deliverance left is to beseech Allah in the name of some virtuous deed.&#8221; Thereupon one of them supplicated, &#8220;O Lord, my parents were very old, I used to offer them their nightly drink of milk before my children and the other members of the family. One day I went astray far away in search of green trees and could return only after my parent had gone to sleep. When I had milked the animals and brought their nightly drink to them, They were fast asleep, but I did not like to disturb them, nor would give any part of the milk to my children and other members of the family till after my parents had their drink. Thus, with the vessel in hand, I awaited their awakening till the flush of dawn, While the children cried out of hunger at my feet. When they woke up, they had their drink. O Lord, if I did this thing seeking only your pleasure, then do relieve us of the distress wrought upon us by this rock.&#8221; Thereupon, The rock moved a little but that not enough to let them pass out.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the second man supplicated: &#8220;O Lord, I had a cousin whom I loved her more passionately than any loves a woman. I tried to seduce her but she would have none of me, till in a season of great hardship due to famine, she approached me (for help) and I gave her one hundred and twenty Dinars on condition that she would have sexual intercourse with me. She agreed, and when we got together and I was just going to have intercourse with her, she pleaded: &#8216;Fear Allah, and do not break the seal unlawfully&#8217;; whereupon I moved away from her, despite the fact that I desired her most passionately; and I let her keep the money I had given her. O Lord, if I did this thing seeking only your pleasure, then do move the distress in which we find ourselves.&#8221; Again the rock moved a little but not enough to let them pass out.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the third supplicated: &#8220;O Lord, I hired some laborers and paid them their dues, but one of them left leaving behind what was due to him. I invested it in business and the business prospered greatly.&#8221; After a time the laborer came Back and said: &#8216;O servant of Allah, hand over to me my wages.&#8217; I said to him: &#8216;All that you see is yours &#8211; camels, cattle, goats and slaves.&#8217; He said: &#8216;Don&#8217;t play joke with me, O servant of Allah.&#8217; I assured him: &#8216;I am mot joking.&#8217; So he took all of it sparing nothing. O Lord, If I did this seeking only for your pleasure, do relieve us of our distress.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The rock then moved away, and all the three came out of the cave safe and sound.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>Sahih Bukhari</strong> and <strong>Sahih Muslim</strong> )</p>
