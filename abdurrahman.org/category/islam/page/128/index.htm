		<p style="text-align:left;">Translated by Abdullah MacPhee in Daarul-Hadeeth, Dammaaj</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the tape series &#8216;Al-Hudaa wa An-Noor&#8217; tape # 617, Al-Imaam Al-Albaanee was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;Residing in the lands of disbelief, like that is the question, the question is about this matter, and in addition to it the American people who are Muslims, the Americans who are originally Muslims, is it incumbent upon them to make hijrah from there?&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Imaam Al-Albaanee answered: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Is there any doubt about that? Because of these people He said: &#8216;Was not the earth of Allaah spacious enough for you to emigrate therein&#8217; (An-Nisaa: 97)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However before your last question, the first part, what is it? I don&#8217;t know do you still insist on asking it that we answer it?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The questioner): &#8220;I would be grateful if you were to answer.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): &#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The questioner): &#8220;I would be grateful if you were to answer.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): &#8220;I believe the first part of the question would be understood inclusively from answering the second part of it, however, perhaps from that which is best is to explain what has come in the Sunnah from the authentic hadeeths which warn the Muslim from taking the lands of disbelief as a homeland. There is in the science of Fiqh and Usool a Qiyaas called Al-Qiyaas Al-Awlawee. If the people of the land born and hereditarily (from there) when they embrace Islaam it is incumbent upon them to make hijrah to the lands of Islaam then more so the one who is on the opposite of that, being born in the lands of Islaam and raised and brought up, it is not permissible for him to travel, and I don&#8217;t say make hijrah, to the lands of disbelief. This is even more so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, with that I say the hadeeths have come one after the other prohibiting the Muslim from traveling to the lands of disbelief. From that is the hadeeth which Abu Dawud transmitted in his Sunan on the Prophet (peace be upon him); that he said with the best form of expression: &#8216;Whoever is close together with the polytheist then he is like him.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the being close together mentioned is mixing together, meaning living together. And other hadeeths have come emphasizing this meaning with the clearest wording. He (peace be upon him); says: &#8216;The Muslim and the polytheist, their fire is not to appear to one another.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslim and the polytheist, their fire is not to appear to one another. This is an expression meaning that it is incumbent upon the Muslim that his residence be far away from the residence of the polytheist, because the Arabs from their custom is that they light the fire in front of their abodes, in front of their tents, so the fire appears to the one approaching from a distance. So it is as if the Messenger (peace be upon him) is saying to the Muslim; stay far away, stay far away as much as you can from having the disbelieving polytheist see your fire. The Muslim and the polytheist, their fire is not to appear to one another. A third hadeeth also emphasizes this, and it is his (peace be upon him) statement: &#8216;I am free from every Muslim who resides amongst the polytheists.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are very clear texts that emphasize that it is not permissible for the Muslim to reside amongst the polytheists. And the wisdom in that is very clear. Not from the analogical stand point or the intellectual standpoint or experience wise, because this is a secondary matter with regards to the traditional texts. There are some hadeeths which it is possible to use as a basis to use as an answer to a question that could occur to some minds when they hear those hadeeths. What is the secret? What is the purpose? What is the wisdom of the prohibition from the Messenger (peace be upon him) of the Muslim from living together with the polytheist? There are two hadeeths suitable to mention as an answer to this question. The first is his (peace be upon him) statement: &#8216;The example of the righteous sitting companion is like the one who sells misk. Either he gives you some as a gift or you buy from him or you smell from him a good fragrance. And the example of the evil sitting companion is like the ironsmith. Either he is going to burn your clothes or you are going to smell from him an offensive smell.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) bringing forth an example for the sitting on a reduced scale. A reduced scale sitting, you sit with one person. So he is saying to you, if he is righteous then the example of him is like the one who sells misk, to the end of the hadeeth, or if he is evil then he is like the ironsmith. Either he is going to burn your clothes or you are going to smell from him an offensive smell. The second hadeeth which emphasizes the first hadeeth and the reality increases it in emphasis, it is what Al-Imaam Muslim transmitted and perhaps Al-Bukhaaree also in the Saheeh on the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he said: &#8216;A man from those before you killed ninety nine people then afterwards he wanted to make Tawbah (repentance) so he asked about the most knowledge of the people on earth, so he was directed to a Raahib. He then went to him and said to him, &#8216;I have killed ninety nine people so is there any Tawbah for me?&#8217; He said, &#8216;You killed ninety nine people and you ask is there any Tawbah for you! There is no Tawbah for you.&#8217; He then completed with him number one hundred. Then he continued to ask until he was directed to a person of knowledge.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Before hand he was directed to a Raahib, meaning an ignorant person engrossed in worship. So he gave a verdict with his ignorance so his outcome was that he added him to the murdered ones before him. The second time he was directed to a person of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;So he went to him and said to him, &#8216;I have killed one hundred people unjustly, is there any Tawbah for me?&#8217; He said, &#8216;What prevents you from Tawbah? However, you are in an evil land so leave it to such and such town which its people are righteous.&#8217; So he went to go to them, to the end of the hadeeth and it is well known inshaallaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The highlight is that this person of knowledge has an understanding of the Fiqh of this hadeeth or these hadeeths, and this does not declare impossible that these hadeeths the Messenger (peace be upon him) narrated them to us, this does not prevent this from being from the understanding of the Prophets beforehand (peace be upon him) because they all used to draw from one source of light (guidance). So therefore, this person of knowledge understands this reality, that the contaminated atmosphere it can infect the righteous person when he intermixes with it. This is an example from the stand point of diseases, the diseases that are contagious. And because of that it has come for this point the quarantine well known today and the Messenger (peace be upon him) has put in place his principle in the well known hadeeth: &#8216;If a plague occurs in a land and you are in it then don&#8217;t leave it, and if a plague occurs in a land and you are not in it then don&#8217;t enter it.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Like that. Therefore, the Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) when he prohibited the Muslims from taking the lands of disbelief as a homeland, that is only to protect their Aqeedah, their worship, their manners. So because of this he made it incumbent not upon the polytheists, this is an important matter also, rarely have I addressed it when I speak about the likes of this issue, the Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) or the wise legislator, not only made it incumbent upon the polytheists when they embrace Islaam that they make hijrah to the lands of Islaam, rather he made it incumbent upon the Bedouins to make hijrah from their nomadic life to their sedentary life. This, in it is a regard for the same meaning because the Messenger (peace be upon him) says in some of the hadeeths: &#8216;Whoever becomes a Bedouin he becomes harsh.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when the Bedouin lives after being taught Tawheed and learning what is incumbent upon him for correcting his faith and his Islaam then he goes back to his nomadic area and lives there, he could be influenced by the harshness which is from the normal way of the Bedouins. So if the Messenger (peace be upon him) encouraged the Bedouins firstly to return to sedentary life, then he tied into that a legislative ruling, and it is that they don&#8217;t have any right to the spoils of war that the Muslims capture from fighting the disbelievers, then more so and more so and more so he makes it incumbent upon the Muslims to remain in their lands and that they don&#8217;t move to the lands of disbelief and polytheism and misguidance. Especially in these days because you know that the Jews and the Christians, even if they are misguided because of their going astray firstly from Tawheed which has reached them from their Prophets and again because of their denial of our Prophet (peace be upon him) they with that used to be upon something of good manners and good character and so on. And he who is in my age group or close to it, he knows that the women of the Christians in the lands of Islaam, they used to cover with a covering better than many of the Muslim women today. The meaning of this statement is that the people of the book, sinfulness and immorality and nudity was not widespread amongst them the widespread way that the people of intellect, if there are people of intellect amongst them from the disbelievers, complain about in their lands. So because of that how can it be permissible for a Muslim to expose himself to this society contaminated by immorality and this decadence? This is what I have in response to that question.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Later on in the tape Al-Imaam Al-Albaanee said: &#8220;Here is a Shubhah that must be mentioned on this occasion and it is a deceptive Shubhah that many of the youths are deceived by. They say: &#8216;Yaa Sheikh, by Allaah, we here, religious freedom is more than that in our country.&#8217; This from some angles is correct. However, I take them by surprise with the reality that they live in. I say to them: &#8216;Are you able to raise your voices with the Adhaan?&#8217; He says: &#8216;No.&#8217; I say: &#8216;Where is the freedom that you claim?&#8217; Then I remind them of the long term. You, if you are fleeing with your deen, you cling, to the lands of disbelief, is it possible for you to conceive that you will be able to set up an Islamic state where you are in America, in France, and so on, except after centuries and long centuries? Which of the two affairs is more likely, that you return to your countries and work together with your brothers there to establish the Islamic society and the Islamic lifestyle from which springs the establishment of the Islamic state and ruling by Islaam, or is it more likely over there? No, by Allaah, they say, in the lands of Islaam it is more likely. Because changing those lands of disbelief to the likes of what the situation is in the Islamic lands requires centuries. Therefore you are living in delusions. You say: &#8216;We live in freedom greater than the lands of Islaam.&#8217; This is a delusion and this is a fantasy. Yes you pray and you fast and so on, however, most of your fasting, most of your prayer is not in the legislated manner. Furthermore, put this regard aside, you hear from there problems which the youths are exposed to regarding marriage to some of the women of the people of the book, they claim, and having children afterwards, and the disputing when the woman divorces him, he did not divorce her, then his son or daughter remains with her not him and so on; Problems that we are constantly asked about. These don&#8217;t occur in the lands of Islaam. Due to that the reality which there is no doubt about is that it is not permissible for the Muslim today to live in the lands of disbelief. So if he is exiled from his land where he was born, it is allowed for him to move to another land from the lands of Islaam. This is what I recall or what I saw necessary to mention pertaining to examining this issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(A questioner): Yaa Sheikh, concerning this issue they mention something close to what you mentioned, a Shubhah that the lands have become similar in sinfulness and immorality, the lands of Islaam and the lands of disbelief, and the (Islamic) rulings are not being enforced. So what is your opinion?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): We have said beforehand regarding sinfulness and immorality, it is not permissible to compare the lands of Islaam to those lands. As for regarding the rulings, correct, sadly, many of the Islamic rulings have been rendered void and have been abandoned. However, Qiyaas here is Qiyaas with the existence of the distinguishing factor because the lands of Islaam many of the rulings still exist in it upon Islaam and at the very least upon some of the Islamic madhhabs. As for there, only the Qaanoon (the man made law) exists there which has judicial power over all of them. So this also is a distortion. They want by it to justify what they are upon from the residing that opposes the Sharee&#8217;ah. Furthermore I also say, and as it is said: the speech is connected together, our Lord says in the Noble Qur&#8217;aan: &#8216;And whoever amongst you takes them as friends then verily he is one of them.&#8217; (Al-Maa&#8217;idah: 51)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What do you think, the one who lives in a land of disbelief, is he having Muwaalaah (befriending, showing loyalty, supporting etc.) for that land or showing enmity to it? I want to hear the answer from the doctor to loosen up the atmosphere a little bit…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whichever Muslim travels to a land of disbelief, is he having Muwaalaah for this land and its rulers or is he showing enmity?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The doctor): No he is not having Muwaalaah, the land and its rulers and its government he is not having Muwaalaah for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): He is not having Muwaalaah? Is he showing enmity?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The doctor): He is averse, not showing enmity, yes showing enmity, however he perhaps does not do any act of enmity, however he is averse to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): He is averse?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The doctor): Yes</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): Then why does he take it as residence?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The doctor): Because of this need as you have mention.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): Na&#8217;am, in that case we say in response why… (A cut in the tape)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The doctor): Because of the need to resided there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): However the need must prove to be true.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The doctor): No, No. I am saying because of what you mentioned. The answer to your question is what you previously mentioned. The answer to your question is the Muslim who resides in the lands of the disbelievers, is he having Muwaalaah for them or showing enmity to them. If you consider merely residing Muwaalaah this is another matter. If you are asking about the Muwaalaah of the heart, no the Muslim is not having Muwaalaah for them, normally, he resides but he is not having Muwaalaah for them. Meaning he does not love them, pardon me, he is averse to their ways.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): Pardon me, is Muwaalaah in the heart only or outwardly also?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The doctor): In the heart and outwardly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): You intended in the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The doctor): He is not having Muwaalaah for them. He is not pleased with what they are upon. He disapproves of that. He calls to the opposite of it. He does not implement it upon himself. Meaning Muwaalaah is not materialized. I don&#8217;t see it to be materialized. He remaining amongst them is forbidden. This is a matter. As for Muwaalaah, it is not clear that he is having Muwaalaah. It is possible that he reside amongst a people while he is averse to them, averse to what they are upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): Tayyib. He does not assist them, Yaa Ustaadh?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The doctor): Yes he assists in the general way of life in the dunyaa. Is this from Muwaalaah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): Isn&#8217;t he upon their Qawaaneen (man made laws)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The doctor): Yes they rule him by it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): Tayyib. How is Muwaalaah? Muwaalaah is forbidden. How is it done?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The doctor): Even in the lands of the Muslims we rule by un-Islamic laws.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): pardon me, now let us finish with over there then we can come back to the lands of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The doctor): He firstly is residing with them. They themselves have the ability with the rule of law. They implement it, he carries it out. He is not able to avoid it, even if some avoid some things however he carries out most of it. However the laws of disbelief being implemented upon him, it is forced upon him. Is this Muwaalaah? This is a question that applies even to the lands of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): No, No. It does not apply. Baarakallaah feek. However, I don&#8217;t know this jump, is it analogical, from the land of disbelief to the lands of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The doctor): No, it is a jump, the jump Yaa Sheikh is because of an answer to the question. Is merely their laws being applied on them, the laws are applied so he complies with them upon these laws. Is this Muwaalaah? The answer, yes their laws are applied on him. This is the answer to the question. Is this Muwaalaah? You mentioned that this is Muwaalaah. So I say if this is Muwaalaah then all of us in all lands, un-Islamic laws are applied on us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): They are not the same. Baarakallaah feek. I am going to say to you now as long as you continue to use Qiyaas. I say to you there is a very big difference. The Muslim he must have an abode, a place of shelter. He must have that. So he must have a land for this shelter, and this land it must either be a land, I don&#8217;t say Islamic now, let it be more specific than that beforehand, its residents are Muslims or another land its residents are disbelievers. So he chose to reside in the second land not the first, and another chose to reside in the first land. Is the example of the two the same?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The doctor): No they are not the same.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): Baarakallaah feek. That is what was thought. Because of that your Qiyaas of the land of disbelief with the Muslim land does not stand straight. Because the Muslim he must have as I have brought beforehand a place of shelter that he uses for shelter. Therefore, either this place of shelter of his is in a Muslim land or in a land of disbelief. So when he resides in a Muslim land, we say here going along with you, this one is forced to comply with this land in its rulings. However, I have said beforehand there is a difference between the rulings that are applied in the lands of Islaam and the rulings which are applied in the lands of disbelief even if it is five percent, ten percent whatever percentage. What is important is there is a difference. So this one who must have a place of residence and a residency, he is forced to live under these rulings. However, there is another difference. Now I bring forth for you an example for this land and that land. Regarding car insurance, in it as you know there are two types of insurance, compulsory insurance and voluntary insurance. Good, in some land he is forced to have the two types of insurance while in another land he is forced to have one type of insurance. The two lands in good and evil are similar, there is absolutely no difference, to bring the issue closer to comprehension. The Muslim chose the land in which the two types of insurance are forced on him. Is it said that this one is like the first one?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The doctor): No, he is not like that one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): Therefore, Baarakallaah feek, it is necessary that the Muslim always takes into consideration that there is a difference. Let me mention an example, Muwaalaah, there is a difference in Muwaalaah. Muwaalaah is a must, like the Muslim who resides in the lands of Islaam and he pays many, many taxes and sales taxes. This one is excused. Where is he to go? Here it is not said to him: &#8216;Was not the earth of Allaah spacious enough for you to emigrate therein&#8217; (An-Nisaa: 97)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for that person who rules with a Qaanoon from beginning to end, he is a Kaafir, and every day, without exaggeration, at every interval changes enter it because it is from that which man has produced. The Qaanoon in the lands of Islaam is not like this in farness from Islaam. There is a difference in it be it small or large, this is not our subject. Therefore, we go along with you, the Muslim in the land of Islaam is having Muwaalaah, however, he is not able to do anything except this. This Muwaalaah is outward and it is not in the heart. As for there, it is in the heart and outward because he is able to escape from that by living in the lands of Islaam being forced to the likes of this bodily Muwaalaah not Muwaalaah of the heart. I hope that these matters are taken into consideration because the reality helps us to make the Muslims understand the Islamic rulings and so that they return to increasing the masses of their nation inside their land instead of increasing the masses of the disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I put forth a very simple example. The Muslim in the lands of Islaam, Allaahu Akbar&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(I think there was a pause for the Adhaan)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps you recall with me a hadeeth in the Sunan of Abu Dawud and others. A man entered and said: &#8216;As-Salaamu Alaikum.&#8217; So he (peace be upon him) said: &#8216;Ten.&#8217; A second man entered: &#8216;As-Salaamu Alaikum wa Rahmatullah.&#8217; &#8216;Twenty.&#8217; A third man entered. He said: &#8216;As-Salaamu Alaikum wa Rahmatullah wa Barakaatuh.&#8217; He said: &#8216;Thirty.&#8217; They said: &#8216;O Messenger of Allaah, so and so entered so you said ten,&#8217; to the end. He said: &#8216;The first said As-Salaamu Alaikum so ten good deeds were recorded for him. The second added so twenty were recorded for him. The third, thirty. These good deeds that the Muslim acquires in the lands of Islaam, does he acquire them there? What do you think?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The doctor): No.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sheikh): This is a very small example. So now I say to you, another example very small. This example differs from one Muslim land to another Muslim land, rather, from a Muslim locality to another Muslim locality in the same land, from a Muslim locality to another Muslim locality, rather, from house to house. Is there something more reduced than this? Is there something smaller than this? There is not. How is this? A Muslim land, however, and from it is this land, you say to him: &#8216;As-Salaamu Alaikum.&#8217; He says to you: &#8216;Marhabaa.&#8217; &#8216;When you are greeted with a greeting, greet in return with what is better than it or return it…&#8217; (An-Nisaa: 86)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is not raised in an Islamic manner. I am coming closer home a little bit with some small examples. As-Salaamu Alaikum, wa Alaikum As-Salaam. However, in the smallest example he entered and said: &#8216;As-Salaamu Alaikum.&#8217; He left and said: &#8216;As-Salaamu Alaikum&#8217; going about and automatically good deeds are recorded one after another. Allaah knows best from twenty four hours how much the total of these good deeds is. Why? Because he lives in a Muslim Salafee atmosphere. He knows his (peace be upon him) statement: &#8216;When one of you enters a sitting then let him give Salaams, and when he leaves let him give Salaams, for the first does not have more right than the second.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This and other than it from the many examples that we have brought home to you the reality which we seek. It is not possible for you to see it in the lands of disbelief, never. And because of that we ask Allaah عز و جل to inspire our Muslim youths to return to the land of Islaam and that they learn the rulings of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah of the Messenger (peace be upon him) upon the methodology of As-Salaf As-Saalih and that they educate themselves and those they are close with upon this pure Islaam. And perhaps this much is enough inshaallaah. And all praise is due to Allaah Lord of all that exists.&#8221;</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam ash-Shanqiti [1] , Adwaa&#8217;ul-Bayaan (10/21-23)<br>
Al-Istiqaamah Magazine , Issue No.8 &#8211; Shawwal 1418H / February 1998</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And do not say about those who are killed fighting in the Path of Allaah that they are dead. Rather, they are alive!&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:154].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse is an apparent proof that the martyrs [those who are killed in the Path of Allaah] are not dead. Yet in another verse Allaah says, whilst addressing the Prophet Muhammad sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam; who is better than any and every martyr :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed you will die, and they will die.&#8221;</b> [Soorah az-Zumar 39:30].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reply to this [apparent contradiction] is: That the martyrs are dead from a worldly point of view, this is why they can be inherited from, and why their wives can remarry again &#8211; a point about which the Scholars have ijmaa&#8217; (consensus) upon. It is this death, the worldly death, that Allaah informed would occur to the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam. This is why Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq radiallaahu &#8216;anhu said, when the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam passed away: &#8220;May my mother and father be sacrificed for you O Prophet of Allaah! By Allaah! Allaah will never combine two deaths for you. You have died the death that Allaah decreed for you &#8230; Whosoever worships Muhammad, let him know that Muhammad is dead.&#8221; Then he deduced this by reciting the [above] verse, and the Companions of the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam accepted this.2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the life that Allaah affirmed in the Qur&#8217;aan for the martyrs, and the life that has been affirmed for the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam in which he is able to return the greetings of salaam to whosoever sends it upon him, then both of them refer to the life of the barzakh (a state of existence between the present life and the Hereafter); an existence which cannot be truly comprehended by the people of this world. So with regards to the martyrs there is a reference to this in Allaah &#8211; the Most High&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;Rather, they are alive, but you do not perceive it.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:154]. The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam explained this verse by saying: <i>&#8220;Their souls ore in the bellies of green birds, which hove lanterns suspended for them from Allaah&#8217;s Throne. They roam around in Paradise wherever they desire, then return to these lanterns &#8230;&#8221;</i>3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for [the life affirmed for] the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, then he said: &#8220;There is no one who sends the greetings of salaam upon me, except that Allaah returns my soul hock until I reply to their greeting.&#8221;4 And: &#8220;Indeed Allaah&#8217;s Angels roam around the earth conveying to me the greetings of salaams from my Ummah.&#8221;5 So this life also cannot truly be comprehended by the intellects of the people of this world. Since, along with this [fact], his sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s blessed soul resides in the loftiest part of Paradise with the companionship of the highest company; a company higher than the souls of the martyrs. Yet the reality of how his pure soul links itself to his noble body &#8216;alayhis-salaam &#8211; a body which the earth cannot consume &#8211; is a reality which no one knows, except Allaah alone. Thus, if this type of life was like the life that is understood by the people of this world, then why did Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq radiallaahu &#8216;anhu say that the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam was dead, and why was it permitted to bury him? [And if he sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam did not die] then why was there a need to appoint a khaleefah (succesor) after him. Also, those events; such as the [tragic] killing of &#8216;Uthmaan radiollaahu &#8216;anhu, or the differences which arose between the Companions, or that which occurred with &#8216;Aaishah radiallaahu &#8216;anhaa need not have happened if he sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam were still alive! Since if that were the case, they could have referred judgement back to him concerning those issues in which they differed [if he sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam were still alive and could fulfill such needs].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, just as the Qur&#8217;aan is explicitly clear that the martyrs are actually living; due to Allaah &#8211; the Most High&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;Rather, they are alive.&#8221;</b> Then likewise, the Qur&#8217;aan is just as explicitly clear that this state of living is one whose reality cannot be truly understood by the people of this world; due to Allaah&#8217;s saying: <b>&#8220;But you do not perceive it.&#8221;</b> Similarly, just as it is established that the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam is living in the grave; replying to the greetings of salaam, yet even though his Companions actually buried him, they were still unable to perceive this state of living. Thus, we know that this state of living is likewise a reality which cannot be truly understood by the people of this world. However, what could make this more clear is by considering the example of someone who is</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">asleep. The state of one who is asleep differs from that of one who is awake in many ways, including the fact that the one who sleeps experiences dreams which can be understood. And Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim (d.751H)- rahimahullaah &#8211; said: &#8220;It is known by necessity that the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s body is intact and has not decayed. The Companions asked him: How are we to send greetings of salaam upon you when your body has decayed! So he sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi we sallam replied: <i>&#8220;Indeed Allaah has prohibited the earth from consuming the bodies of the Prophets.&#8221; </i>So if his body was not in his grave, then why would he respond to this question! And it has been authentically established from him that he said: <i>&#8220;Indeed Allaah&#8217;s Angels roam around the earth conveying to me the greetings of salaams from my Ummah.&#8221;</i>7 It is authentic from him that he once came with Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar [into the mosque] and said: &#8220;We shall be raised up like this on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;8 It is also established that he sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam saw the Prophet Moosaa praying in his grave on the night of his Israa (Heavenly Ascension), and he also saw him [on that same night] in the sixth or seventh Heaven.9 So the soul is in one place and is connected to the body, which resides in the grave. Similarly, the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam is in his grave; replying to the greetings of salaam sent to him, along with the fact that his soul resides in the loftiest part of Paradise along with the highest companionship. So there is no contradiction between these two matters; since the affairs of the souls is one thing, whilst that of the bodies is another.&#8221;10</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in these words is a proof that the life of the barzakh, that was previously mentioned, is a life whose reality is not known to the people of this world. About this Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Rather, they are alive, but you do not perceive it.&#8221;</b> And complete and perfect knowledge is only with Allaah.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Q&amp;A Section of <i>Sharh Sitta Mawaadi&#8217; min as-Seerah</i> (pg. 67-68)<br>
Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Question: </b>Is Hijrah still applicable in this time of ours? And if it is, there must be a place of residence and provision for it. And it is not possible to achieve this…</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer: </b>Hijrah will remain in effect. The Messenger said: <b>“Hijrah will not cease until repentance ceases. And repentance will not cease until the sun rises from its place of setting (i.e. the west).”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hijrah is still in effect. So if a person is not able to establish his Religion in one area, he should go to another area where he will be able to establish his Religion along with the Muslims. And if he feels that he is not able to go to the lands of the Muslims, he should go to those lands in which he will be able to establish his Religion even if the country he goes to is a Land of Kufr (Disbelief). This is since some types of evil are less harmful than other types.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Companions migrated to Abyssinia – which consisted of Christians – since there they were able to establish their Religion and be safe from the harms of the pagan Arabs (of Makkah). Allaah says: <b>“So fear Allaah as much as you are able to.”</b> [Surah At-Taghaabun: 16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if there is a country in which there exists a Muslim minority or perhaps many Muslims, he should go there and be with them – even if it is a country of disbelievers. If he is not able to go to one of the lands of the Muslims, he should look to minimize evil (from himself) however much he is able to.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">His explanation of </span><i style="line-height:1.5em;">Thalathat-ul-Usool<br>
</i><i>Al-Ibaanah.com</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his explanation of <b>“The Three Fundamental Principles”</b> of Imaam Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab, Shaikh Ahmad An-Najmee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The definition of Hijrah is: To abandon the Land of Shirk, i.e. to leave it, and to come to a Land of Islaam. This is since the word Hijrah is derived from the root hajr which means to abandon or leave off. The Muslims were commanded to abandon the Land of Shirk and go to the Land of Islaam. The ruling on Hijrah is that it is obligatory for the one who is able to do it. This is why Allaah informs us that there will be a group of people whom the angels will take in death while they are wronging themselves due to their lack of migrating and their preferring the Land of Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says: <b>“Verily, as for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves (by not performing Hijrah), they (angels) will say (to them): ‘In what (condition) were you?’ They will reply: ‘We were weak and oppressed in the earth.’ They (angels) will say: ‘Was not the earth of Allaah spacious enough for you to migrate therein?’ Such men will find their abode in Hell – what an evil destination! Except the weak ones among men, women and children – who cannot devise a plan, nor are they able to direct their way. These are the ones whom Allaah is (most) likely to forgive, and Allaah is Ever Oft-Pardoning, Most Forgiving.”</b> [Surah An-Nisaa: 97-99]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says: <b>“O My servants who believe (in Me)! Verily, My earth is spacious so to Me alone, perform your worship.”</b> [Surah Al-‘Ankaboot: 56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Baghawee, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “The reason for the revelation of this ayah was due to some Muslims who had resided in Makkah and did not migrate (to Madeenah). Allaah called out to them using the title of Eemaan (for them).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We derive from these verses that Hijrah is obligatory on the one who is able to do it, which requires him to move from a Land of Disbelief to a Land of Islaam. This is since in a Land of Disbelief, the believer is exposed to harm and the government will be against him as opposed to in his favor. Even though he may be safe from harm, he will still not be safe from having to seek judgement in laws that are not from Allaah’s Legislation, such as man-made laws, which they use to govern the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, Hijrah in our present time must only be done with the permission from the country that one is migrating to. So if the country refuses to accept this emigrant, then he has no ability or power in the matter except by Allaah’s leave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Things used to be easy (in the old days). But as for today, there is difficulty in Hijrah either from the side of the country that one is migrating from or from the side of the country that one is migrating to. So whoever is able to make Hijrah, with ease and no difficulty, to a Land of Islaam, then such a person is obligated to do that. Furthermore, some of the Muslim countries today apply strict measures against those who adhere to the Religion of Allaah in everything that he brings and leaves behind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In summary, any Muslim that lives in a country, which the disbelievers rule based on man-made laws, must migrate from it if he is easily able to do it. And if it is not easy for him, then according to what is apparent (from the texts), he is excused due to Allaah’s saying: <b>“Allaah does not burden a soul with more than it can handle.”</b> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 286]. And with Allaah lies the success.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q1]: What, in your opinion, is the definition of al-ghazwa al-fikree (the ideological attack)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A1]: Ideological warfare is a modern term which refers to a set of efforts in which a nation engages in order to conquer or influence another nation, so that [the attacked nation] takes a particular course of direction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is far more serious than military warfare, since it aims at secrecy, seeking to achieve subtle objectives initially; so that the attacked nation does not perceive it, nor prepare to halt it, nor stand in its way &#8211; thereby falling victim to [such an attack]. The eventual result of this onslaught is that this nation becomes sick in mind and sense; loving what the enemy wants it to love and hating what they want it to hate. It is a chronic disease which attacks and destroys nations, doing away with its personality, removing such meanings as foundations and strength. The nation which is struck by this [ideological attack] does not even feel what has hit it, or what it even is! That is why curing it becomes somewhat difficult, and making [the attacked nation] understand the ways of righteousness becomes a struggle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This war takes place by means of school curriculums, general education, media, small and large size publications, and other such channels [that influence the thoughts of its people]. Through this the enemy hopes to deviate the nation from its beliefs; becoming attached to what the enemy throws at it. We ask Allaah for safety and protection from this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q2]: Are the Arabs generally subject to this type of warfare, in particular the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A2]: Yes, the Muslims in general, including the Arabs, the Kingdom, and other than them, are all subject to a great ideological warfare from the nations of kufr (unbelief); from both the east and the west. The severest and most serious of these [ideological] onslaughts is:- [1] <b>The war of the christian crusaders.</b> [2] <b>The zionist war.</b> [3] <b>The communist and atheistic war.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[THE CHRISTIAN CRUSADERS]</b> The war of the christian crusaders is today at its most intense. Since Salaahud-Deen al-Ayyoobee achieved victory over the christians crusading in the Muslim lands with their strength and weapons, the christians realised that even though they had achieved [some] victories, these victories</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">were temporary ones that did not last. That is why they started thinking about the most destructive alternatives. After numerous case studies and assemblies they arrived at [something] that was far more dangerous and destructive than military warfare; which was that the christian nations, both individually and collectively, should launch an ideological attack on those Muslims who were just beginning to grow and develop. This is because conquering the hearts and thoughts [of people] is far more permanent than conquering their lands! The Muslim whose mind has not been corrupted cannot bear to see the unbelievers wielding authority, and ordering and prohibiting in his own country. Therefore such a Muslim strives his utmost to expel and distance them &#8211; even if he has to sacrifice his own life, or or his most cherished possession, for this cause. And this is what happened after the major conquest of the crusaders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Muslim who is exposed to the [effects] of this filthy war, he becomes ill in thought and desensitised to this disease. He does not see any danger with the presence of christians in the lands of the Muslims. Indeed, he may even think that their presence is a source of goodness which aids and advances civilisation. So the christians have sufficed themselves with this ideological warfare, as opposed to the military one, because it is more effective and more permanent. What need do they have of deploying troops or spending huge sums of money, when there exists amongst the children of the Muslims those who can actually fulfill their wishes &#8211; intentionally or unintentionally, with a price or without one! This is why they do not resort to openly fighting the Muslims with weapons and arms, except in rare cases when necessity dictates this. They resort to this in situations where speed is sought; such as what happened in Uganda and Pakistan; or when there is a need to stabilise the advancement, or establish centres, or to establish bases which engage in destructive ideological warfare; such as what happened in Egypt, Syria, Iraaq, and other countries, before their expulsion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[THE ZIONIST JEWS]</b> The zionist war is just the same. The jews strive their utmost to corrupt the beliefs, morals and manners of the Muslims. The jews scheme and crave after possessing the Muslim lands, as well as the lands of others. They have fulfilled some of their plans and continue striving hard to implement the rest of them. Even though they they do engage the Muslims in warfare involving strength and arms and have occupied some of their lands, they also fight them through spreading</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and aiding the spread of] destructive thoughts, beliefs and ideologies; such as Freemasonry, Qadiaanisim, Bahaaism, Teejaanism, and others &#8211; seeking the support of the christians, and others, in order to fulfill their objects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong>THE COMMUNISTS AND ATHEISTS</strong>] As for the communist/atheist war, then presently it is spreading like wildfire across the Muslim lands.2 This happens as a consequence of their being an emptiness [with regards beliefs], weak eemaan (certainty of faith) in most people, wide spread ignorance, and the lack of a correct and healthy [Islaamic] cultivation and development. The communist parties from Russia and China, as well as others, have managed to ensnare [into this false ideology] every spiteful, malicious person; driven by those weak in faith, or having no faith at all! They selected these types of people as being their puppets and plants in that country; spreading through [such puppets] their filthy atheistic and communistic ideologies. They lured them with promises of high positions of power and status. Through them they tore apart the Muslim Ummah and they were made [to act as] the troops of Shaytaan. They were aided in this by the christians and the jews, who sometimes assisted in their preparation, whilst at other times they aided and supported them. Thus, even though they do have differences between them, yet they become a single hand against the Muslims. They view the Muslims as their worst enemy, that is why we see them co-operating with each other, as allies, against the Muslims. And Allaah&#8217;s aid is sought, and He suffices us and is the best of guardians.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q3]: What are the means which the west uses in order to spread their ideas and thoughts?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A3]: The means that the west employs in order to spread their thoughts and ideas are many, from them:-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: The attempt to conquer the minds of the Muslim children. They do this by infusing in them western values and concepts so that they then believe that the best way to adopt in any matter is that of the west &#8211; whether it is with regards to what religion or sect they believe, or with regards to the languages that they speak, or the manners, customs and values with which they clothe themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: Custody of a large group of the children of the Muslims in every country, concern for them and bringing them up, so that when they absorb western thoughts, they return to their countries with a halo of praise and compliment, until they acquire position and authority in their countries by which they circulate western ideologies and establish learning centres conforming to western curricula or are directly influenced by them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly</strong>: Their active drive towards promoting the learning of western languages in the Muslim lands, making them compete with the Muslims&#8217; languages, especially the Arabic language, which is language of the Qur&#8217;aan &#8211; by which this Book was sent and by which the Muslims worship their Lord;in their Salaah (Prayer), their rites of Hajj (Pilgrimage), their forms of remembrances and glorifications, etc. From this is the encouragement of destructive propaganda that fights against [the usage and learning] of [pure and classical] Arabic Language and attempt to weaken the conformity to it in the Muslim lands. They do this by calling to using colloquialism, and by arranging numerous studies that intend to &#8216;develop&#8217; grammar in order to corrupt it; as well as formalising folk literature and and matters of national heritage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourthly</strong>: Development of western universities and missionary schools in Muslim countries and also initiating the role of kindergarten and playschools, hospitals and clinics which they make as dens and nests for their evil aims. They encourage the higher classes to study in them (western and missionary schools and universities) and after them help in acquire leadership posts and great position until they become an aid for their masters in following their plots in the Muslim lands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifthly</strong>: The attempt to control education curricula in Muslim lands and drawing out their politics, either directly; as occurred in some Muslim countries when the priest Dunlop undertook that task there, or by indirect methods. When the task was undertaken, most of the successful students who studied in Dunlop&#8217;s schools and graduated in them, arose as a destructive pickaxe in their country, or as one of the enemies most lethal weapons. [Such students] strive hard to influence the educational curriculum and steer it towards secularism &#8211; an ideology which does not centre around having eemaan (faith) in Allaah and His Messenger; but rather steers in the direction of atheism, or towards immorality and corruption.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sixthly</strong>: The large number of individuals amongst the jews and christians who have undertaken the study of Islam, Arabic Language, compiling books, and taking positions of teaching in universities; until they created an ideological turmoil and confusion amongst the educated Muslims, which they hurl at those that they are teaching, or with which they fill their books &#8211; until some of those books became sources which writers and researchers refer to in matters of ideology or history. Many people who were responsible for creating some of these fitnahs (trials and turmoil) in the Muslim countries, were actually Muslims who graduated at the hands of the people. The praise and awe which surrounded such graduates helped them to achieve this, as well as achieve their post and positions; such as important posts in teaching and leadership. So they completed what their teachers had initiated [of corruption and destruction] and fulfilled what they couldn&#8217;t achieve, because they were of Muslim offspring and from the same skin, ascribing themselves to them and speaking their tongue &#8211; so we ask and seek Allaah&#8217;s help.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Seventhly</strong>: A large number of missionary workers calling to christianity have proceeded between the Muslims that they have performed their work on. [This missionary activity is done upon] well studied principles, and upon a large scale; employing hundreds of thousands of men and women. Huge financial budgets are put aside for this task, and [they are aided in such a way that] their task is made easier for them and obstacles are removed for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;They want to extinguish the Light (i.e, the Religion) of Allaah with their mouths, but Allaah will bring His Light to perfection and completion, even though the disbelievers hate it.&#8221;</b> [Soorah as-Saff 61:8].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as the efforts of the missionaries are set up and aimed mostly at the common levels; then the efforts of the orientalist are directed to the educated &#8211; as I previously mentioned. The missionaries take on huge hardships in their work in the African Countries, and in the remote villages of the far extreme Muslim lands; in eastern Asia. After that, every so often, they hold conferences in order to review their accounts and their plans; then they analyse, adjust and implement. They met in Cairo in 1906, in Edinburgh in 1910, in Lucknow (India) in 1911, and in Jerusalem in 1935, and they continue to hold such assemblies, seminars and conferences &#8211; so glory be to the One in Whose Hand is the sole sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, and to Him return all affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Eighthly</strong>: Spreading corruption in the Muslim societies; belittling the [status of women] with regards to their role in life, making her transgress the limits set by Allaah for her, creating in her a satisfaction in abstaining from the [correct] Path. They do this by spreading propaganda amongst the Muslims in various ways and manners, so that women freely mix with men, and so that women work in the places of men. By this, they aim to corrupt the Muslim society, and to put an end to the chastity and purity which is found therein. Additionally, by bringing up imaginary issues and false propaganda &#8211; [claiming] that Islaam oppresses women, and that Muslim women have very little rights &#8211; they want to take her out of her home, and put her wherever they may want; even though the limits that Allaah has set [in the Qur&#8217;aan] are clear; as are His commands [concerning these matters], and as is the Sunnah (Guidance) of His Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the Believing women to draw their jilbaabs (cloaks) over their entire body. That will be better, that they should be known (as free and respectable women), so as not to be harassed, And Allaah is Ever-Forgiving, Most-Merciful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:59].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And &#8211; the Most High &#8211; says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And let the Believing women draw their khimaars (head-scarves) over their faces, necks and chests, and not to display their beauty, except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husband&#8217;s fathers, or their sons, or their husband&#8217;s sons &#8230;&#8221; </b>[Soorah an-Noor 24:31].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And when you ask them for something, ask them from behind a screen; that is purer for your hearts and their hearts.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:53].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And stay in your houses, and do not display yourselves like that of the times of jaahiliyyah (pre-lslaamic ignorance).&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:33].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said:<br>
<i>&#8220;Beware of entering into the company of women.&#8221;</i> A man from the Ansaar said: O Messenger of Allaah, what about the husband&#8217;s brothers and relatives! He replied: <i>&#8220;The husband&#8217;s brothers and relatives are death!&#8221;</i>3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam also said:<br>
<i>&#8220;A man must not be alone in the company of a women, for indeed the third of them is shaytaan.&#8221;</i>4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ninthly</strong>: The Building of churches and temples in the Muslim lands and spending great amounts of wealth on them; beautifying them, making them very conspicuous and noticeable, and building them in the largest and best of places.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tenthly</strong>: Radio stations set up solely for the purpose of calling to christianity and communism, spreading their [false] objectives. They intend to misguide, through such false ideas, the children of the innocent and naive Muslims &#8211; who neither understand, nor did they receive a sufficient Islaamic education. This is the case, in particular, in Africa where the Bible is published and distributed in plenty of hotels, etc. [They also] send missionary publications and false preaching to many of the Muslim children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are some of the means utilised by the enemies of Islaam today &#8211; from east and the west &#8211; in waging war against the Muslim&#8217;s thought, [intending by this ideological attack] to put an end to correct righteous thought, so that they are replaced by [false and] foreign ideas; whether eastern or western. And &#8211; O noble reader &#8211; as you can see, these means involve tremendous efforts, enormous amounts of money and a multitude of soldiers. All of this is done in order to take the Muslims away from Islaam, even if they do not actually embrace christianity, judaism or marxism. Since their primary goal in doing this is to take the Muslims away from Islaam, so that when this stage is achieved, then whatever [misguidance] follows becomes far easier to implement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, despite all this we say: that Allaah will frustrate them in their hopes, and will nullify their plans &#8211; but only if the Muslims are sincere in their fight against them, cautious and alert to their plans, and obedient and upright upon their Religion; as Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;But if you remain patient and become pious and obedient to Allaah, their plots will not harm you in the least. Indeed, Allah encompasses all that they do.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-lmraan 3:120].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since they are spreaders of corruption, Allaah Will not give total facilitation to their actions. Rather Allaah &#8211; the Most High- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;They plot and plan, and Allaah plans, and indeed Allaah is the best of planners.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Anfaal 8:30].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed they are planning a plan, but I am planning a plan, but give a respite to the disbelievers; deal gently with them for a while.&#8221;</b> [Soorah at-Taariq 86:15-17].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;O you who Believe! If you help Allaah [by acting upon that which He has commanded you to do], He will help you against your enemies, and make your foothold firm.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Muhammad 47:7].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And indeed Allaah will help those who help His Cause. Truly, Allaah is Most-Powerful, Most-Mighty. Those who, if We give them power and authority in the land, establish the Salaah (Prayer), give the Zakaah, command the good and forbid the evil. And with Allaah rests the end of all affairs.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Hajj 22:40-41].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there are many verses carrying this same meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, without a doubt, the matter requires the Muslims to have some common sense and some contemplation, some study about the course of action that should be taken, about the most suitable stance they should take, and that they should be heedful and have some awareness which will make them capable of understanding the schemes of their enemies, and active upon rendering them futile and false. This shall not be accomplished for them except by adhering to Allaah, adherence to His guidance, returning to Him, repenting to Him and seeking His aid. Additionally, by bearing in mind His guidance in everything, especially with regard to the relation of the believers with the unbelievers, and by understanding Soorah <b>&#8220;Say, O Disbelievers&#8221;</b> and what Allaah the Most High &#8211; mentions in His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Never will the jews and the christians be pleased with you until you follow their religion and way of life.&#8221; </b>[Soorah al-Baqarah 2:120].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also [what He mentions in] His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And they will not stop fighting you, until they turn you back from your Religion; if they are able.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al- Baqarah 2:217]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; that He grants right guidance to this Ummah, with regards to their affairs, and that He grants protection to it from the plots of its enemies, and that He grants it firmness and obedience, both in speech and action &#8211; so that there can be for them might, strength and honour; as Allaah desires for them. Indeed He is the only One Who has the power to do so. And may Allaah extol, and send the blessings of peace upon our Prophet Muhammad, and upon his Family, his Companions, and followers.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed Allaah will help those who help Him. Indeed Allaah is Exalted in Might, All-Powerful.&#8221; [Soorah Hajj 22:40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ash-Shanqeetee (d.1393H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; explains in this noble <i>Aayah</i> that He has sworn to help and give victory to those who help Him. It is known that the help and victory of Allaah comes by following what He has prescribed, obeying His commend, avoiding His prohibitions, by helping His Messengers and their followers, aiding His Religion and fighting against His enemies and overpowering them &#8211; until the word of Allaah is made uppermost, whilst the word of His enemies is debased and mode low. Then Allaah &#8211; the Most High, the Most Magnificent &#8211; explains the charecteristics of those whom He has promised would receive His help and victory, distinguishing them from others. So He said &#8211; explaining those to whom He swore He would aid and give victory to &#8211; because He is the one to aid and give victory:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Those who, if We establish them in the earth, establish the prayer, give the Zakaat, enjoin the good and forbid the evil.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Hajj 22:41].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that which this noble <i>aayah</i> indicates is that whosoever aids Allaah, then Allaah will aid Him. This is clearly explained in other than this place, such as His &#8211; the Most High&#8217;s &#8211; sayings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;O you who Believe. If you help Allaah, Allaah will help you; and establish your feet firmly. But those who disbelieve, for them is destruction and Allaah will make their deeds vain.&#8221; </b>[Soorah Muhammad 47:7].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed, Our Word has gone forth of old for our slaves, the Messengers, that they will certainly be victorious; and that Our forces will certainly be triumphant.&#8221;</b> [Soorah as-Saafaat 37:171-173].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allaah has Decreed: It is My Messenger and I who will prevail.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Mujaadalah 58:21].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allaah has promised to those amongst you who believe and do righteous actions that He will grant you the khilaafah in the land.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Noor 24:55].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in His &#8211; the Most High &#8216;s &#8211; saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Those who, if We establish them in the earth, establish the prayer, give the Zakaat, enjoin the good and forbid the evil.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Hajj 22:41].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In it is a proof that there is no promise from Allaah of His help, except by establishing the Prayer, paying the Zakaah, enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil. So it is these whom Allaah will establish upon the earth and will strengthen His Word through them. However, those who do not establish the salaah, nor pay the Zakaah, nor enjoin the good nor forbid the evil, then there is no promise for them from Allaah that He will aid and grant them victory. They are not from His party, nor are they his friends -those who have the promise of His help and victory. Rather, they are the party of Shaytaan and his friends. So if they were to expect the help of Allaah and the fulfillment of His promise upon them, then their example is like that of a hired worker who refuses to do the labour that he was hired for, yet he expects to be rewarded. So whosoever is like this, then he has no intellect!&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the help that we so desperately await, and the victory that we so strongly desire will only come about by: &#8220;The Muslims returning and repenting to their Lord, correcting their &#8216;aqeedoh (beliefs) and cultivating themselves and their families upon the pure and correct Islaam; putting into effect Allaah &#8211; the Most High&#8217;s &#8211; saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Never will Allaah change the condition of a people, until they change themselves.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ar-Ra&#8217;d 13:11].&#8221;2</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">[From the &#8216;Invitation to Islam&#8217; Newsletter, Issue 5, October 1998]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A bomb goes off in a marketplace in Jerusalem. A suicide bomber launches himself into a bus full of women and children in Tel Aviv. Foreign tourists get massacred at a holiday resort in Luxor, Egypt. Villages upon villages get annihilated in Algeria. The list of events worldwide which have come to symbolise the &#8216;Islamic terror&#8217; are endless. From the times in the 70&#8217;s and 80&#8217;s when Pan Am and TWA aeroplanes would be highjacked, to the mid 80&#8217;s in war torn Lebanon where Americans and Europeans would be held as hostages for years; all such incidents have come to be identified with the religion of Islam. Such incidents from past and present have undoubtedly affected Muslims worldwide and more so in the West. Any Muslim, who wants to practice his/her religion and expresses the pious desire to live under the banner of Islam, is labelled a fundamentalist or extremist. Any Muslim man who walks down a busy street in London or Paris (and Paris moreso) with a beard and a scarf on his head, is looked upon as being a terrorist who&#8217;s probably got an AK47 stashed somewhere on his person. Muslim women who are veiled can&#8217;t go anywhere in the Western world without being taunted as being oppressed or being mad (for covering up). However, are such beliefs and opinions about Islam really justified?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Exploding the myth</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the many short comings which has arisen in the West, is judging Islam by the conduct of a minority of its people. By doing this, segments of Western society have deliberately played off the desperate actions of many Muslims, and have given it the name of Islam. Such behaviour is clearly not objective and seeks to distort the reality of Islam. For if such a thing was done Judge a religion by the conduct of its people) then we too could say that all Christianity is about is child molesting and homosexuality [1] whilst Hinduism was all about looting and breaking up mosques [2]. Generalising in such a manner is not seen as being objective, yet we find that the Western world is foremost in propagating this outlook on Islam. So what is the reality of Islam? How does one dispel the myths which have been created and spread so viciously? The only way to examine Islam is to simply examine its belief system. Look at its sources, the Qur&#8217;an and Sunna, and see what they have to say. This is the way to find the truth about what Islam says about terror, terrorism and terrorists. One who is sincerely searching for the truth, will do it no other way. The very name Islam comes from the Arabic root word &#8216;salama&#8217; which means peace. Islam is a religion which is based upon achieving peace through the submission to the will of Allaah. Thus, by this very simple linguistic definition, one can ascertain as to what the nature of this religion is. If such a religion is based on the notion of peace, then how is it that so many acts done by its adherents are contrary to peace? The answer is simple. Such actions, if not sanctioned by the religion, have no place with it. They are not Islamic and should not be thought of as Islamic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Jihad </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word jihad sends shivers down the spines of many Westerners. They readily equate this term with violence and oppression. However, it must be said that the meaning of jihad, as a &#8216;holy war&#8217;, is something which is totally foreign and not from Islam. If anything, such a description belongs more so to Christianity and its adherents. It was terms like this which were used to justify the slaughter and pillage of towns and cities during the crusades by the Christians. By simply looking into the sources of Islam, one is able to know that the true meaning of jihad is to <i>strive/make effort in the way of Allaah. </i>Thus striving in the way of Allaah can be both peaceful and physical. The Prophet Muhammed (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>&#8220;The best jihad is (by) the one who strives against his own self for Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic&#8221; [3]. </i>In the Qur&#8217;an, Allaah also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>So obey not the disbelievers, but make a great jihad </b>(effort)<b> against them </b>(by preaching)<b> with it</b> (the Qur&#8217;an)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Furqan 25:52).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By controlling and fighting against ones desires, the Muslims can then also physically exert themselves in the path of Allaah. It is this physical or combative jihad which receives so much criticism. Because of the sheer ignorance of this type of jihad Islam is regarded as terror, and Muslims are regarded as terrorists. However, the very purpose of this physical jihad is to raise the word of Allaah uppermost. By doing this, it liberates and emancipates all those who are crying out for freedom all over the world. If the likes of the pacifists of this world had their way, then the world would indeed be full of anarchy and mischief. The combative jihad seeks to correct this as Allaah says in the Qur&#8217;an:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>And if Allaah did not check one set of people by means of another, the Earth would be full of mischief. But Allaah is full of bounty to the worlds</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:251).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such would be the corruption on this Earth if there had never been a combative jihad that Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>For had it not been that Allaah checks one set of people by means of another, monasteries, churches, synagogues and mosques, wherein the name of Allaah is mentioned much, would surely have been pulled down. Indeed Allaah will help those who help His</b> (cause). <b>Truly Allaah is All strong, All mighty</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Hajj 22:40).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This combative jihad being both defensive and offensive, is something which is commanded by Allaah upon the Muslims. Through this command the oppressed and weak are rescued from the tyranny of the world:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>And what is the matter with you that you do not fight in the cause of Allaah and for those weak, ill treated and oppressed among men, women and children whose only cry is; &#8216;Our Lord, rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors and raise for us from you one who will protect and raise for us from you one who will help</b>&#8220;&#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah An-Nisa 4:75).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who knows the early history of Islam, will know that all those nations and empires which came under the fold of Islam were indeed previously oppressed. When the companions of the Prophet Muhammed (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) went out for the offensive jihad against the Egyptians, the Persians and the Romans, we find that the people did not resist against them at all. Rather, they accepted Islam on such a scale, that it is inconceivable that the jihad of Islam could be anything other then a liberation for these people; a liberation from centuries of tyranny. In fact, with the Byzantine Egyptians and the people of Spain, the Muslims were even beckoned to come and liberate these lands from the oppression of their kings. This is the glorious track record of the Muslim jihad Compare this with the brutal track record of warfare in the Western world over the centuries. From the crusades against the Muslims to the days of colonial warfare, the Western world has killed, destroyed and plundered everything which has come in its way. Even today this merciless killing goes on by the Western nations. While claiming to be about world peace and security, Western nations are ready to bomb innocent civilians at the drop of a hat. The classic example of this is the recent bombings of Sudan and Afghanistan. Whilst claiming that Sudan and Afghanistan were havens for Islamic terrorists, the bombings of these two nations could not have come at a better time for the American president Bill Clinton. The destruction of innocent lives which were a result of these bombings clearly seem to have been an attempt by Clinton to avert attention away from his sexual misdemeanours; [4] something which he so often gets caught up in. Without doubt this was the reason for such terror from the American military upon innocent people. This is the same American military which claims to enter the worlds trouble spots under the guise of being peace keepers. But</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>…</b> <b>when it is said to them; &#8216;Make not mischief on the Earth&#8217;, they say; &#8216;We are only peace makers&#8217;. Indeed they are the ones who make mischief, but they perceive it not</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:11-12)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The hypocrisy of the West is indeed astounding. </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By looking at the rules and regulations of this combative jihad it will be clear to any sincere person that this is indeed the religion of truth. When fighting an unjust enemy, no matter how unjust they are, it is forbidden by Islam that their retreating forces are mutilated, tortured or slaughtered. The treacherous violation of treaties and carrying out assassinations after a cease fire, are also prohibited. Allaah says in the Qur&#8217;an:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>And fight in the way of Allaah those who fight you. But do not transgress the limits. Truly Allaah loves not the transgressors</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:190).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Not transgressing the limits means not to kill women and children, for the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) <i>&#8220;forbade the killing of women and children</i>&#8221; [5]. Not transgressing the limits means that the elderly, the sick, monks, worshippers and hired labourers are not attacked. Not transgressing the limits means not killing animals wantonly, burning crops and vegetation, polluting waters and destroying homes, monasteries, churches and synagogues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>Allaah does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion, nor drove you out of your homes. Indeed, Allaah loves those who deal with equity</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Mumtahinah 60:8).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After reading such passages from the Qur&#8217;an and knowing about what Islam commands and prohibits in jihad, the rules of warfare are given a new meaning; a meaning of justice. How sad it is then, that whilst Islam is condemned for striking terror into the hearts of the people, the likes of the Serbs, the Indian army in Kashmir and the Israeli soldiers in Palestine are left untarnished for the atrocities they have committed in the name of warfare.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what about suicide bombing, is this too a part of jihad in Allaah&#8217;s path? From what has already been stated above, it can be deduced that this is not from the religion. However, unfortunately many Muslims have taken suicide bombing as being a virtuous act by which one receives reward. This could not be further from the truth. The Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>&#8220;Those who go to extremes are destroyed&#8221; </i>[6]. Suicide bombing is undoubtedly an extremity which has reached the ranks of the Muslims. In the rules of warfare, we find no sanction for such an act from the behaviour and words of the Prophet Muhammed (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) and his companions. Unfortunately, today (some misguided) Muslims believe that such acts are paving the way for an Islamic revival and a return to the rule of Islam&#8217;s glorious law. However, we fail to bear in mind that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>&#8220;Do not be delighted by the action of anyone, until you see how he ends up&#8221;</i> [7]. So, for example what is the end of a suicide bomber in Palestine?, a leg here, an arm there. Massive retaliation by the Israeli&#8217;s in the West Bank and Gaza. More Muslims killed and persecuted. How can we be delighted with such an end? What really hammers the final nail in the coffin of this act, is that it is suicide; something which is clearly forbidden in Islam. The Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>&#8220;He who kills himself with anything, Allaah will torment him with that in the fire of Hell&#8221; </i>[8]. Some are under the misconception that by killing oneself for an Islamic cause, one commits an act which deserves Paradise. Once when a man killed himself, the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>&#8220;He is a dweller of the Fire&#8221;. </i>When the people were surprised at this, the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>&#8220;A person performs the deeds which to the people appears to be the deeds befitting the dweller of Paradise, but he is in fact one of the dwellers of the Fire&#8221; </i>[9]. The taking of ones life which Allaah has given as a trust to the human, is a great sin. Likewise the taking of other lives (which is so often the case with suicide bombing) is also forbidden, as human life is indeed precious:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>&#8230;If anyone killed a person not in retaliation for murder or to spread mischief in the land, it would be as if he killed the whole of mankind. And (likewise) if anyone saved a life, it would be as if he saved the whole of mankind</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Maaida 5:32).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, all other types of extremities such as hostage taking, hijacking and planting bombs in public places, are clearly forbidden in Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Media</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By going through the teachings of Islam, it is clear that such a religion has only come to benefit mankind -not to destroy it. So why is there so much hatred for this noble religion in the West? The answer is simple, the media. It is the Jewish influenced media of the West which has portrayed Islam to be something that it is not. During the 70&#8217;s and 80&#8217;s when the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organisation) were carrying out daring highjacks on the worlds airways, the media in the West portrayed it as being Islamic. When the Shi&#8217;ite suicide bombers of the 80&#8217;s were causing so much havoc in the Lebanon and in the Gulf region, the media in the West portrayed it as a part of Islam. However, it is known by the heads of the media that the likes of the PLO were not an Islamic organisation, and that according to Islam, Shi&#8217;ites are outside the fold of Islam [10]. Yet such facts are never portrayed by a media which seeks to cover the truth of this religion. A number of years ago, when the Oklahoma City bomb went off, a headline in one of the newspapers, &#8216;The Today&#8217; [11], summed up this attitude. With a picture of a fire fighter holding a dead child in his arms, the headline read: <b>&#8220;In The Name of Islam&#8221; </b>Time has of course proven that this bigoted assumption was incorrect, as Timothy McVeigh, a right wing radical now faces the death penalty for the crime [12]. Likewise the bombs which went off in the Paris metro in 1995, were also blamed on Muslim fanatics. It has now emerged that the Algerian secret service who having routinely bribed many European journalists and MPs, were actually behind it. The desire to throw a veil over Islam is immense by these people:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>They intend to put out the light of Allaah with their mouths, but Allaah will complete His light even though the disbelievers hate</b> (it)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah As-Saff 61:8).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whilst trying to destroy Islam through this instrument of the media, the Jews clearly try to portray an image of themselves as being the oppressed people. Every year, we are reminded as to how many Jews perished under the Nazis in World War II. We are made to feel sorry for these same people who have gone on to commit so many crimes upon the Palestinian people. Some may say that this is a racist and biased viewpoint. But we say; If this media was not run and orchestrated by the Jews and was truly neutral, then why are Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir, two former Israeli prime ministers, not held aloft as being terrorists? Anyone who knows about the history of the Palestinian occupation will tell you that these two men were members of the Stem Gang and Irgun, two notorious Jewish terror groups who killed many innocent people [13]. If this media was truly impartial, then why does it not tell about the extent of the Israeli bombardment and illegal occupation of Southern Lebanon and its people? [14] And if this media really had nothing against the religion of Allaah, then why does it not inform the people that every day hundreds are entering the religion of Islam? Such things will never be highlighted in the Western media, simply because to do so would be against their very interests.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With such immense pressure against it, it is indeed a blessing from Allaah that Islam goes from strength to strength. It continues to grow faster then any other religion in the Western world, conquering the hearts and minds of thousands. All this should not even surprise us though, for Allaah has promised us that this religion will prevail:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>It is He who has sent His Messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth, so that He may make it victorious over all other religions, even though the disbelievers detest it</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah As-Saff 61:9).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a must that humanity comes towards the religion of Islam. Without it, we will continue to slip down the road of inequity and darkness. With it we can establish a society of justice and peace. Religion of terror? &#8230; no. The way forward? &#8230; yes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>There is no compulsion in religion. The right path has indeed become distinct from the wrong. So whoever rejects false worship and believes in Allaah, then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that will never break. And Allaah is All Hearing, All Knowing</b>&#8220;</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Ibaanah Magazine, Issue No.1 &#8211; Dhul-Qa’dah 1415H / April 1995</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<b>Allaah has promised to those of you who believe and do righteous actions, that He will certainly grant them succession</b><b> (<i>khilaafah</i>) upon the earth, as He granted it to those before them; and that He will grant them authority to practice their Religion, the one that He has chosen for them and He will change their state from one of fear in which they lived, to one of peace and security. They will worship Me alone, not associating any partner with Me.  But whosoever disbelieves after this, then they are the rebellious ones.</b>” [Soorah Noor 24:55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">’Ubayy Ibn Ka’b relates that the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: “Give glad-tidings to this <i>Ummah</i> of high position, establishment upon this earth, victory and a lofty status in this world and in the Hearafter.” [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Katheer (d.774H) – <i>rahimahullaah</i> – said: [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is a promise from Allaah – the Most High – to His Messenger, may the Prayers of Allaah and the peace be upon him, that he will make this <i>Ummah</i> the <i>khulafaa‘</i> (successors) upon the earth.  Meaning that they will be the leaders and rulers over mankind, by whom nations will be corrected and to whom mankind will submit.  And that He will replace their state of fear in which they lived, to one of security and dominion.  Allaah – the Blessed, the Most High – has fulfilled His promise, and to Him belongs all praise and thanks.  For the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) did not die until Allaah made him conquer Makkah, Khaybar, al-Bahrain, the remaining lands of the Arabian peninsula and the whole of Yemen.  He took <i>jizyah</i> (protection tax) from the Magians of Hajar and from the people of the surrounding areas of Syria.  The Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) received gifts from Heraclius – the king of Rome; the ruler of Egypt and Alexandria – the Mawqawqis; the kings of Oman; and Negus, the king of Ethiopia, who became king after Ashamah died – may Allaah have mercy upon him and grant him nobility.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) died, Allaah having chosen for him the reward that is with Him, Aboo Bakr as-Siddeeq was then established as his <i>Khaleefah</i> (successor), taking charge unwaveringly.  Aboo Bakr took the Arabian peninsula and put it in order.  He sent forth armies of Islaam to the lands of Persia, under the command of Khaalid Ibnul-Waleed (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhu</i>).  They conquered parts of these lands, slaying a number of it’s inhabitants.  A second army was sent to the lands of Syria, under the leadership of Aboo ’Ubaydah (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhu</i>) and those who followed him.  A third army was sent to Egypt under the leadership of ’Amr Ibnul-’Aas (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhu</i>).  It was during his time that the armies sent to Syria conquered the cities of Busra, Damascus and it’s environs from the land of Hawraan and it’s surroundings.  Allaah – the Mighty and Majestic – took the soul of Aboo Bakr – choosing for him the reward which is with Him.  Allaah blessed the people of Islaam by inspiring as-Siddeeq to chose ’Umar al-Faarooq as a successor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">’Umar then stood up, taking charge completely.  The heavens will not witness – after the Prophets – anyone like ’Umar, whether in the strength of his reign, or in the fulfillment of justice.  It was during his time that the conquest of Syria was completed; as was that of Egypt to it’s farthest reaches, as well as the province of Persia.  He destroyed Kisraa (Chosroes) and humiliated him to the utmost, forcing him to retreat back to the farthest reaches of his kingdom.  Similarly, ’Umar destroyed Qaysar (Caesar), wrestling from his hands the lands of Syria and bottling him up in Constantinople.  He spent the wealth (conquered from them) in the path of Allaah – as the Messenger of Allaah had informed and promised – may the most complete <i>salaam</i> and most purest <i>salaat</i> be bestowed upon the Messenger from his Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there was the rule of ’Uthmaan, under whom the possessions of Islaam extended to the furthest eastern and western reaches of the earth.  The lands of the west were conquered to the farthest reaches of what lies there – Andulus, Cyprus, the lands of Qayrawaan and the lands of Ceuta – which is next to the all encompassing ocean; and to the farthest lands of China.  Kisraa was killed and his kingdom totally vanquished.  The cities of al-’Iraaq, Khuraasaan and Ahwaaz were conquered and the Muslims slew a large number of Turks.  Allaah having humiliated the Turks and their great king Kha-Khaan.  The wealth of the east and the west was collected and brought to the <i>Ameerul-Mu‘mineen</i> (leader of the Believers) ’Uthmaan Ibn ’Affaan (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhu</i>).  All of this came about as a result of his recitation, study and gathering the <i>Ummah</i> upon the preservation of the <i>Qur‘aan</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is confirmed in the <i>Saheeh</i> that the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: “Indeed Allaah gathered up the earth for me, so that I saw it’s east and it’s west.  Indeed the dominion of my <i>Ummah</i> will reach what was gathered up for me, from it.” [3] We fluctuate in what Allaah has promised us with and in what His Messenger has promised.  Allaah and His Messenger have spoken the truth.  We ask Allaah to grant us <i>eemaan</i> (faith) in Him and His Messenger, and that we establish gratitude of what Allaah has given us, in the matter that He is please with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">’Umar related to us, that Sufyaan related to us from ’Abdul-Malik Ibn ’Umayr, from Jaabir Ibn Samurah who said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) say: “The affair of the people will continue to be upright whilst twelve men are in charge in of them.”  The Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) then said something which I could not make not.  So I asked my father: What did the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) say?  He replied: “They are all from <i>Quraysh</i>.”  This narration is also narrated by al-Bukhaaree. [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this narration there exists a clear evidence that all twelve of these man must be leaders from <i>Quraysh</i>.  They are not the twelve <i>imaams</i> claimed by the <i>Shaee’ah</i>, because many of them had no leadership over the Muslims.  As for these twelve, they will be from <i>Quraysh</i> and they will be just rulers.  The glad-tidings of their appearance have also occurred in the previous scriptures.  Furthermore, it is not necessary that they succeed one another.  Rather, their appearance in the <i>Ummah</i> could be successive or separate.  Four of them were in order, namely, Aboo Bakr, ’Umar, ’Uthmaan and ’Alee (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhum</i>).  After these four there was a gap.  Others amongst the twelve appeared as and when Allaah willed.  It is possible that some of them will appear during a time which only Allaah – the Most High – knows.  Amongst them will be the <i>Mahdee</i> whose name will be that of the Messenger (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>), and his <i>kunyaa</i> (nickname) that of his <i>kunyaa</i>.  He will fill the earth with justice as it is filled with tyranny and injustice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad, Aboo Daawood, at-Tirmidhee and an-Nisaa‘ee have all reported from the <i>hadeeth</i> of Sa’eed Ibn Juhmaan, from Safeenah – the <i>mawlaa</i> (master) of the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallalaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) that the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: “The <i>Khilaafah</i> (successorship) after me will last for thirty years.  Then kingship will appear.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed ar-Rabee’ Ibn Anas has said that Abul-’Aaliyah has remarked concerning this <i>aayah</i>: “The Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) and his Companions were in Makkah for ten years afraid, secretly calling to Allaah and His worship alone, He has no partner.  They remained in such a state that they were ordered to migrate to al-Madeenah.  They were ordered by Allaah to fight.  Whilst they were (in al-Madeenah) they were in constant fear (of attack).  They would go to sleep armed and awake armed.  They remained patient upon that state for as long as Allaah willed, until one day when one individual from amongst the Companions said: “O Messenger of Allaah!  Will we remain in a state of fear until the end of time?  Will there not come a time when we will be in a state of security, so that we may lay down our weapons?”  The Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) then said: “Be patient for a while, for there will come a time when any man from amongst you will sit in a crowd unharmed.”  Allaah sent down this <i>aayah</i> and made his Prophet victorious over the Arabian Peninsula.  The Companions of the Prophet were now safe and they could lay down their weapons.  Allaah – the Most High – then took the soul of His Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) and the Muslims remained in such a state during the leadership of Aboo Bakr, ’Umar and ’Uthmaan; until the Muslims fell into what they fell into from discord.  So fear entered into their hearts and they took armies and guards for protection.  For they had changed, so Allaah changed their state.  One of the <i>Salaf</i> has remarked that the <i>khilaafah</i> of both Aboo Bakr and ’Uthmaan was true.  He then recited this <i>aayah</i>, al-Baraa‘ Ibn ’Aazib has said: “This <i>aayah</i> was revealed whilst we were in a state of extreme fear.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This noble <i>aayah</i> is similar in meaning to His statement – the Most High – :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<b>And remember when you were few and were reckoned weak in the land and were afraid that men might kidnap you, but He </b> <b>(i.e. Allaah)provided a safe place for you, and strengthened you with His help and provided you good things so that you might be grateful.</b>” [Sooratul-Anfaal 8:26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the statement of Allaah – the Most High – : “<b>As he granted that to those before them.</b><b>”  This <i>aayah</i> is similar to what Allaah said about Moosaa </b> (<i>’alayhis-salaam</i>) <b> that he said to his people:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“It may be that your Lord will destroy your enemy and make you succeed </b>(the present rulers) <b>upon earth, so that He may see how you act.</b>” [Sooratul-A’raaf 7:129]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah – the Most High – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<b>And We wished to confer a favour upon those who were oppressed in the land; and to make them leaders and to make them heirs; and to establish them upon earth..</b>.” [Soorah Qasas 28:5-6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah’s statement: “<b>And that He will change their state after the fear in which they lived to one of security and peace.</b>”  This is similar to what the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said to ’Adee Ibn Haatim when ’Adee came as a delegation to the Messenger.  The Messenger (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: “Do you know Hira?”  ’Adee replied: ‘I have not seen it, but I have heard of it.”  The Messenger (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) then said: “By Him in Whose Hand is my soul!  Allaah will complete this matter (i.e. Islaam) until a woman will be able to travel from Hira, until she goes around the House not needing the protection of anyone.  And you will surely conquer the treasure of Kisraa Ibn Hurmuz.”  I (i.e. ’Adee) replied: “Kisraa Ibn Hurmuz!”  The Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) replied: “Yes!  Kisraa Ibn Hurmuz.  Money will be spent until no one will accept it.”  ’Adee Ibn Haatim said: “Now here is the woman leaving from Hira until she goes around the House.  And I was from amongst those who conquered the treasure of Kisraa.  And by Him in Whose Hand is my soul!  The third matter will come to pass because the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) has said so.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad reports upon ’Ubayy Ibn Ka’b who said that the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) has said: “Give glad tidings to this <i>Ummah</i> of ease of life, exalted stature, establishment of their Religion, and victory and leaderhsip upon the earth.  Whoever does acts of the Hereafter for this world, he will have no portion of the Hereafter.” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the statement of Allaah: “<b>They worship Me alone and do not associate anything with Me.</b>”  Ahmad reports upon Mu’aadh who said: ‘I was sitting behind the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) and I except the end of his saddle.  The Prophet said to me: “O Mu’aadh Ibn Jabal!”  I said: “Here I am O Messenger of Allaah in your service.”  The Prophet said: “Do you know what is the Right of Allaah upon His servants?”  I said: “Allaah and His Messenger know best.”  He said: “The Right of Allaah upon the servants is that they worship Him and do not associate anything with Him.”  The Prophet continued to ride on for some time and then he said to me: “O Mu’aadh Ibn Jabal!”  I said: “Here I am O Messenger of Allaah at your service.”  The Prophet said: “Do you know what is the right of the servants upon Allaah if they worship Him alone?”  I said: “Allaah and His Messenger know best.”  He said: “The right of the servants upon Allaah is that He does not punish whomsoever does not associate anything with Him.”  This narration is also narrated in the two <i>Saheehs</i>. [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the statement of Allaah: “<b>But whoever disbelieved after this, and they are the rebellious ones.</b>”  Meaning, whoever steps outside my obedience after that promise, has stepped outside the Command of His Lord, and sufficient is that as a sin.  Since the Companions of the Prophet (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhum</i>) were the most upright and obedient of the people after the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) in fulfilling the commands of Allaah – the Mighty and Majestic – their victory was accordingly.  The Companions of the Prophet made the Word of Allaah supreme, so Allaah Himself aided them in such a manner that He subdued for them the rest of mankind, as well as their lands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the people after the Prophet’s Companions fell short in adhering to some of Allaah’s Commands, their victory accordingly fell short.  It is, however, affirmed in both <i>Saheehs</i> (i.e. al-Bukhaaree and Muslim) in many ways from the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) that he said: “There shall not cease to be a group from my <i>Ummah</i>, victorious upon the truth, not being harmed by those who abandoned them or go against them, until Allaah’s favour comes, and they are like that.” [8] And in a narration: “Until the last of them fights the Anti-Christ (<i>Maseehud-Dajjaal</i>).” [9] All of these narrations are authentic and there is no contradiction between them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ’Abdur-Rahmaan Ibn Naasir as-Sa’dee (d.1376H) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is one of His true promises whose meaning and accomplishment has been witnessed.  He promised those who came with <i>eemaan</i> (faith) and <i>’amalus-saalih</i> (righteous and correct actions) from this <i>Ummah</i>, that He will cause them to be successors upon this earth, so that they are the ones in authority and in charge of the affairs.  Further, that He would establish their Religion – that which He was pleased with for them, which is the Religion of Islaam, which gained ascendancy over all other religions.  He was pleased with it for this <i>Ummah</i>, due to its excellence, nobility and favours upon it, in that He enabled them to establish it, and to establish it’s laws and prescriptions – relating both to manifest and non-manifest matters – upon themselves and upon others, so that the people of other religions and the rest of the disbelievers conquered and humbled.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that He would change their condition of fear to one of security, since it was previously the case that one of them would not be able to manifest his Religion, and they suffered harm and injury from the disbelievers.  The united body of Muslims was very small in number, in comparison to the rest of the people of the earth, who combined to attack them and hope for their downfall.  However, Allaah promised them these things when the <i>aayah</i> was sent down, at a time when they were not witnessing ascendancy and establishment upon this earth, nor the ability to fully establish the Religion of Islaam and full security – such as would enable them to worship Allaah, not associating anything with Him – in a state of not having to fear anyone besides Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the first and foremost of this <i>Ummah</i> combined <i>eemaan</i> and righteous and correct action to a degree surpassing everyone else, so He established them in the land and gave them authority over the people, and granted them the conquest of the east and the west.  They attained full security and complete authority and establishment – and this is one of the astounding signs of Allaah.  This applies until the Hour is established – that whenever the Muslims combine <i>eemaan</i> (faith) and righteous and correct action – then that which Allaah promises will certainly occur.  Indeed Allaah only grants that they be overcome by the unbelievers and the hypocrites, and that they suffer humiliation when the Muslims neglect <i>eemaan</i> and righteous and correct action.” [10]</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[Q.1]: How can we make <i>hijrah</i> (migration) for the sake of Allaah nowadays?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A.1]: </b>The praise is for Allaah.  <i>Hijrah</i> (migration) for the sake of Allaah means moving from the land of <i>Shirk </i>to the land of Islaam, as the Muslims moved from Makkah before its people became Muslim to al-Madeenah, because it had become the city of Islaam after its people had pledged their allegiance (<i>bay’ah</i>) to the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) and asked him to make <i>hijrah</i> to them. So <i>Hijrah</i> means migrating to join other Muslims. <i>Hijrah</i> may also take the form of moving from one land of <i>Shirk</i> to another land of <i>Shirk</i> where evil is less prevalent and there is less danger to the Muslims, as when some of the Muslims migrated from Makkah, at the command of the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>), to Abyssinia (Ethiopia).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah is the Source of Strength.  May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his Family and his Companions, and grant them peace. [1]<i></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">[Q.2]: What are the necessary qualities that must be present in a country for it to be regarded as <i>daarul-harb</i> (land of war) or <i>daarul-kufr</i> (land of disbelief)?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A.2]: </b>The Praise is for Allaah Every land or region in which the rulers and those in authority uphold the limits set by Allaah and they rule their people in accordance with Islaamic <i>Sharee’ah</i>, and the people are able to carry out what Islaam has enjoined upon them, is considered to be <i>Daarul-Islaam</i> (the land of Islaam).  The Muslims in such lands have to obey their rulers with regard to that which is right (<i>ma’roof</i>) and be sincere towards them, helping them to take care of the affairs of state and giving them moral and practical support. They should live there, and not go to live anywhere else except to another place which is under Islaamic rule where they may be better off. This is like the case of al-Madeenah after the <i>Hijrah</i> of the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>), when the Islaamic state was established there, and like Makkah after the Conquest, when the Muslims took power there and it became <i>Daarul-Islaam</i> after it had been <i>daarul-harb</i> and it had been obligatory for the Muslims there who were able to leave, to migrate from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every country or region in which the rulers and those in authority do not uphold the limits set by Allaah and do not govern those who are under their care by the rules of Islaam, and in which the Muslims are not able to establish the rituals of Islaam, is <i>daarul-kufr</i> (the land of kufr). This is like Makkatul-Mukarramah before the Conquest, when it was <i>daarul-kufr</i>.  The same applies to any land in which the people belong to the religion of Islaam, but those who are in authority govern by laws other than those revealed by Allaah, and the Muslims are not able to establish the rituals of their Religion.  They have to migrate from that place, fleeing so that their religious commitment will not be compromised, to a land which is ruled by Islaam and where they will be able to do that which is required of them by <i>Sharee’ah</i>. Whoever is unable to migrate men, women or children will be excused, but Muslims in other lands are obliged to save them and bring them from the <i>kaafir</i> lands to the Muslim land. Allaah the Exalted says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<b>Verily, as for those whom the angels take </b>(in death)<b> while they are wronging themselves </b>(as they stayed among the disbelievers even though emigration was obligatory for them)<b>, they </b>(angels)<b> say </b>(to them)<b>: In what </b>(condition)<b> were you? They reply: We were weak and oppressed on the earth. They </b>(angels)<b> say: Was not the earth of Allaah spacious enough for you to emigrate therein? Such men will find their abode in Hell what an evil destination! Except the weak ones among men, women and children who cannot devise a plan, nor are they able to direct their way. These are they whom Allaah is likely to forgive them, and Allaah is Ever Oft Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving.</b>” [Sooratun-Nisaa‘ 4:97-99]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<b>And what is wrong with you that you fight not in the Cause of Allaah, and for those weak, ill-treated and oppressed among men, women, and children, whose cry is: Our Lord! Rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors; and raise for us from You one who will protect, and raise for us from You one who will help.</b>” [Sooratun-Nisaa‘ 4:75]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But whoever is able to establish the rituals of Islam within his family and establish evidence against the rulers and people in authority, and bring about reform, making them change their ways, then it is prescribed for him to stay among them, because there is the hope that by staying there he may be able to convey the message and reform them so long as he is safe from temptation and <i>fitnah</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah is the source of strength. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">By the Noble Scholar, Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Saalih al-’<strong>Uthaymeen</strong> [1]<br>
<em>Majmoo’ul-Fataawaa war-Rasaa‘il</em> (no. 155)<br>
<strong>Al-Istiqaamah Magazine</strong>, Issue No.3 &#8211; Rabî&#8217;ul-Awwal 1417H / August 1996.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [Q]:</strong> ‘Allaah says: ‘‘<strong>And your Lord says: Call upon Me and I will, respond to your supplication.</strong>’’ [Soorah Ghaafir 40:60] So why is it that a person’s <em>du’aa</em> (supplication) is sometimes unanswered?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [A]:</strong> ‘‘All praise is due to Allaah, Lord of the worlds. May the Prayers and Peace be upon our Prophet Muhammad, and upon his Family and his Companions.  I ask Allaah for the ability to be correct in belief, speech and actions, for myself and for my brothers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘<strong>And your Lord says: Call upon Me and I will respond to your supplication. Verily those who are too arrogant to worship Me will, enter Hell in humiliation.</strong>’’ [Soorah Ghaafir 40:60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The questioner stated that he did indeed make <em>du’aa</em> (supplication) to Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; but it was not answered by Allaah. So he is in doubt with respect to this noble <em>aayah</em> (verse), in which Allaah promises to answer the one who supplicates to Him, and indeed Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; never breaks His promise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the clarification of this is that there are certain conditions that need to be fulfilled in order for a supplication to be answered.  These conditions are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Firstly:</strong> Sincerity to Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic. That is to say, one must be sincere in his <em>du’aa</em> (supplication), so he turns to Allaah &#8211; the One free from all imperfections with an attentive heart, being truthful in his turning to Him, knowing that Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect, the Most High &#8211; is capable of answering his <em>du’aa</em> (supplication) and hoping that the <em>du’aa</em> will be answered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Secondly:</strong> During <em>du’aa</em>, the caller should feel that he is in need of Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect, the Most High – in fact in dire need; and that only Allaah alone answers the supplication of the one in distress and the One who removes evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Thirdly:</strong> That the one making <em>du’aa</em> should refrain from <em>haraam</em> (unlawful) matters, as this acts as a barrier between the person and his <em>du’aa</em> (supplication) being answered &#8211; as has been established in the authentic <em>hadeeth</em>, from the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) who said: ‘‘Indeed Allaah &#8211; the Most High -is good and accepts only that which is good. Allaah has ordered the Believers to do that which He commanded the Messengers. Allaah &#8211; the Most High -has said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘<strong>O you Messengers! Eat of the good things and do righteous actions.</strong>’’ [Sooratul-Mu‘minoon 3:51 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> ‘‘O you who Believe! Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you.</strong> ’’ [Sooratul-Baqarah 2:172]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he mentioned (the case of) a man who, having journeyed far is dishevelled and dusty and who spreads out his bands to the sky (saying): ‘O Lord! O Lord,’ whilst his food is unlawful, his drink unlawful and he is nourished unlawfully. So how can he be answered!’ [2] So the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) explained the un-likelihood that this person’s <em>du’aa </em>would be answered, even after fulfilling the apparent factors which aid the <em>du’aa </em>being answered. The apparent factors being:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[i]: Raising ones’ hands towards the sky, meaning towards Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; since Allaah is above the heavens, above His <em>’Arsh</em> (Throne). Extending the hands out towards Allaah -the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; is amongst the causes of <em>du’aa</em> being responded to, as is shown in the narration from the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) that he said: ‘‘Indeed your Lord is Alive, Most generous. He feels shy that when his servant raises his bands towards Him, calling upon Him, that He should return him empty, having nothing.’’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ii]: This man called upon Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; using the name <em>Rabb</em> (Lord).  Seeking <em>tawassul </em>(the means of nearness to Allaah) with this name is also regarded as one of the causes for <em>du’aa</em> to be responded to, since the <em>Rabb</em> is the Creator, the Owner, the Governor of all affairs &#8211; and the reigns of the Heavens and the earth are in His Hands.  Due to this, you will find that most of the supplications made in the Noble <em>Qur‘aan</em> are by this name:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘<strong>Our Lord! We have heard the call of one calling us to faith: ‘Believe you in the Lord,’ and we have believed. Our Lord! Forgive us our sins, and remit from us our evil deeds, and take to Yourself our souls in the company of the righteous. Our Lord! Grant us what You did promise unto us through Your Messengers, and do not disgrace us on the Day of judgement, for You never break Your promise. And their Lord has accepted of them, and answered them: Never will I suffer to be lost the work of any of you, whether male or female.</strong>’’ [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:193-195]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>tawassul</em> (seeking the means of nearness to Allaah) by this name is one of the causes for the <em>du’aa</em> to be responded to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[iii]: This man was a traveller, and journeying is often a cause for <em>du’aa</em> to be responded to, because a person feels more in need of Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; when travelling, than when a person is resident with his family. He was dusty and dishevelled, seeming very insignificant in himself, as if the most important thing to him was to implore Allaah and to call upon Him &#8211; in any condition he may be &#8211; whether dusty and dishevelled, or in ease and oppulance. Being dusty and dishevelled is also instrumental, like in the <em>hadeeth</em> attributed to the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) in which he said: Indeed Allaah boasts to the people of the Heaven about the people standing at ’Arafah, saying: ‘‘Look at My servants who have come to Me dusty and dishevelled.’’ [4] However, these factors did not bring about anything, because his food, his nourishment and his clothing were all <em>haraam </em>(unlawful). So the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) remarked: ‘‘So how can he be answered!’’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, if these conditions are not satisfied, then the question concerning the <em>du’aa</em> (supplication) being answered will seem distant. However, if the conditions are satisfied and the one supplicating is still not answered, then this is due to a wisdom which Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; knows, and the one supplicating does not know what this wisdom is; and maybe that you like a thing and it is bad for you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when these conditions are fulfilled and the one supplicating is not answered, then either he has been protected from an evil which is greater than what he has asked for, or Allaah stores it for him until the Day of Resurrection, and he then gets a greater reward. This is so, because the one who makes <em>du’aa</em> &#8211; calling upon Allaah alone, fulfilling the conditions and not being answered, but rather being saved from a greater evil &#8211; is in the position of having carried out the causes yet has been prevented from being answered, and therefore has a two-fold reward. One reward for making <em>du’aa </em>(supplication), and another reward for bearing the trial of not being answered. So that which is greater and more complete is stored for him with Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also of importance is that the one supplicating should not express dissatisfaction if his <em>du’aa </em>is apparently not being answered, for this action in itself is a reason for the <em>du’aa</em> not being answered &#8211; as the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: ‘‘A servants <em>du’aa</em> continues to be answered as long as be does not ask for anything sinful or breaking the ties of relations, and as long as be does not become impatient.’’ It was said: How does one become impatient O Messenger of Allaah? He said: ‘‘He says: I have supplicated, I have supplicated, yet it has not been answered.’’ [5] He therefore becomes dispondant and abandons supplicating. So it is not befitting that the one supplicating should become impatient about being answered, then become disappointed and dispondant, and thereby abandon making <em>du’aa</em>. Rather, one should call upon Allaah, since every <em>du’aa</em> you make to Allaah is an act of worship, which brings you closer to Him and increases your reward.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So my brother, you should take to making <em>du’aa</em> (supplication) in all affairs, be it general or specific, in difficulty or in ease. And if it was that supplication was only a means of worshipping Allaah &#8211; the One free from all imperfections, the Most High &#8211; then that would be sufficient. So it is more befitting that a person strives in this &#8211; and with Allaah lies the success and the ability.’’</p>

<strong>Al-Istiqaamah Magazine</strong>, Issue No.4 &#8211; Jumâdal-Awwal 1417H / November 1996<br>
Taken from al-Asaalah magazine (11/84-87).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: What are the foundations that will enable the Islaamic world to arise again anew?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: That which I believe, is what has been reported in the authentic hadeeth &#8211; which is a clear answer to this question, and to those questions similar to it which are asked in our present time &#8211; and that is the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s</i> saying: <i>&#8220;When you deal in &#8216;eenah (a transaction involving usury), take hold of the tails of cows, become content with agriculture and abandon jihaad in the path of Allaah, then Allaah will permit your humiliation and He will not remove it from you, until you return to your Religion.&#8221;</i>2 Thus the foundation is to return to Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This very fact has been pointed out by Imaam Maalik (d.179H), <i>rahimahullaah</i>, in a statement transmitted from him, which is worthy of being written in gold ink: and that is his saying: &#8220;Whosoever introduces into Islaam an innovation, and holds it to be something good, has indeed alleged that Muharnrnad <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> has betrayed his message. Read the saying of Allaah &#8211; the Most Blessed &#8211; the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you and I have chosen for you Islaam as your religion.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:3].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So that which was not part of the religion at that time, cannot be part of the religion today. And the last part of this Ummah cannot be rectified, except by that which rectified its first part.&#8221;3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The last sentence is the essential part with regards to the answer to this question, since he said: &#8220;And the last part of this Ummah cannot be rectified, except by that which rectified its first part.&#8221; So, just as the affair of the Arabs in <i>jaahillyyah</i> (pre-Islaamic ignorance) was not rectified, except by the advent of the Prophet Muhammad <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> via Divine Revelation &#8211; which brought them happiness in this world and will bring them salvation in the Hereafter &#8211; then likewise, re-establishing a happy and successful Islaamic life cannot be based upon anything other than returning to the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah (the Prophetic guidance).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, this matter is in need of some clarification, due to the presence of a multitude of Islaamic groups and parties in our midst today, each of them claiming to have set out the correct <i>manhaj</i> (methodology) which will bring about the Islaamic society and the rule of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We know from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> that the path to be taken in order to realise this objective (of bringing about the Islaamic society and the rule of Islaam) is a single path, and that is the one which Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; mentions in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed this is My Straight Path, so follow it, and do not follow other paths that will separate you from His Path.&#8221; </b>[Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:152].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> explained this to his Companions, since: <i>One day he drew a straight line for them on the ground and then drew many short lines on both sides of it. He then recited the previous aayah (verse) whilst he was moving his noble finger over the straight line, and he said: &#8220;This is Allaah &#8216;s Path.&#8221; He then pointed to the other lines and said: &#8220;These are other paths, and at the head of each one their is a devil calling towards it.&#8221;</i>4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Lord &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; emphasised in another <i>aayah</i> this very same point which was mentioned in the previous <i>aayah</i>; along with the explanation of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallullaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> in the hadeeth. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And whosoever opposes the Messenger, even after the guidance has been clearly conveyed to him, and follows a path other than that of the Believers, we shall leave him in the path he has chosen and land him in Hell, what an evil destination.&#8221; </b>[Soorah an-Nisaa 4:115].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <i>aayah</i> (verse) contains a great wisdom, since He &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; placed the path of the Believers in conjunction with that which the Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> brought. And the fine point of this wisdom was also indicated by the Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> in the hadeeth of al-lftiraaq (the</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">authentic narration concerning the splitting-up of this Ummah into seventy-three sects), when he was asked about the Saved-Sect, so he replied: <i>&#8220;It is that which I and my Companions are upon today.&#8221;</i>5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is the wisdom in Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; mentioning the path of the Believers in the previous <i>aayah&#8217;</i> And what is the underlying point of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> mentioning his Companions straight after mentioning himself, in the previous hadeeth?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer to this is: that these noble Companions are the very people who received the two Revelations (the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah) from Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, who explained it to them directly &#8211; without an intermediary &#8211; and this is contrary to all those who came after them. And there is no doubt that the affair is as Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam </i>said: &#8220;Indeed, the one present sees that which the absent one does not.&#8221;6 This is why the <i>eemaan</i> (faith) of the Companions was greater than those who came after them, and this is what has been clearly indicated by the Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> in the authentic hadeeth: <i>&#8220;The best of mankind is my generation, then those who follow them, then those who follow them.&#8221;</i>7 <b>Therefore, it is not possible for any Muslim to independently understand the Book and the Sunnah. Rather one must seek aid in understanding them by returning to the understanding of the noble Companions, who took their understanding from the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>; via his statements, his actions and his tacit approvals.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, along with calling to the Book and the Sunnah, it is absolutely essential to attach to this the understanding and the practice of the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> (the Pious Predecessors: the first three generations of Muslims whose excellence has been testified to in the above hadeeth); acting upon the preceding verses and hadeeth, which order clinging to the path of the Believers, which has been explained to be the path upon which the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, his Companions and those who followed them in beliefs and actions, were upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And here, a very important question arises, which many of the Islaamic groups and parties neglect; and that is: How does one obtain knowledge of the understanding and the practical application of the Sunnah that the Companions adhered to?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer to this is: that there is no way in obtaining this knowledge, except by returning to <i>&#8216;ilmul-hadeeth</i> (the knowledge of hadeeth); <i>&#8216;ilm mustalahul-hadeeth</i> (the science of hadeeth) and the science of <i>al-jarh wat-ta&#8217;deel</i> (the science of verifying the condition of the narrators) &#8211; applying its principles and its terms such that the Scholars are able to distinguish that which is authentic from the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, from that which is not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in ending the answer to the question, we say in the the dearest possible manner, to those who desire to bring back to Islaam its honour, strength, supremacy and rule, that you must actualise two matters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Firstly: to bring back to the minds of the Muslims the knowledge of the Sharee&#8217;ah (Laws) of Islaam; purified from all the innovations that have entered into it, which was not part of it on the day when Allaah &#8211; the Most Blessed, the Most High &#8211; revealed His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you and I have chosen for you Islaam as your religion.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:3].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accomplishing this matter requires a huge and tremendous effort on the part of the Muslim Scholars in all parts of the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Secondly: It is a must that this purified knowledge is coupled with constant and steadfast action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, the day the Muslims return to understanding their religion as the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> understood it; and then act upon this purified Islaam in the correct manner, in all aspects of life, then that will be the day that the Muslims will rejoice at the help of Allaah and His victory. So this is what I am able to write in this short time. I ask Allaah that He grants us and all the Muslims the correct understanding of Islaam &#8211; in light of the Book, the authentic Sunnah (guidance) of His Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and that which the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> (Pious Predecessors) were upon &#8211; and that He grants us the ability to act in accordance with it. Indeed Allaah is the One who hears and responds.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">A Lengthy Explanation of the first three points from &#8220;Foundations of the Sunnah &#8221;<br>
Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal (d.241H)<br>
Source: Al-Ibaanah Magazine, Issue No.1 &#8211; Dhul-Qa’dah 1415H / April 1995</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillaahir-Rahmaanir-Raheem</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">THE TEXT:</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Aboo ’Abdullaah Yahyaa Ibn Abil-Hasan Ibnul-Bannaa narrated to us saying: My father Aboo ’Alee al-Hasan Ibn ’Umar Ibnul-Bannaa related to us saying: Abul-Husayn ’Alee Ibn Muhammad Ibn ’Abdullaah Ibn Bushraan al-Mu’addil related to us, saying: ’Uthmaan Ibn Ahmad Ibn as-Sammaak reported to us, saying: Aboo Muhammad al-Hasan Ibn ’Abdul-Wahhaab, Abun-Nabr narrated to us, reading it to him from his handwritten copy in the month of Rabee’ul-Awwal, in the year two-hundred and ninety three (293H) who said: Aboo Ja’far Muhammad Ibn Sulaymaan al-Munqaree, in Basrah related to us, saying: ’Abdoos Ibn Maalik al-’Attaar narrated to me, saying: [1] I heard Aboo ’Abdullaah Ahmad Ibn Hanbal [2] – rahimahullaah – say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Fundamental Principles of the Sunnah [3] with us [4] are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Clinging to that which the Companions [5] of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) were upon, taking them as our example to be followed, [6] avoiding innovation; [7] and every innovation is misguidance.” [8]</span></strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">COMMENTARY:</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]: This is the isnaad (chain of narration connected to the text) which &#8211; just as in the case of the hadeeth of the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) &#8211; helps ascertain whether or not the statement and the ascription is authentically related back to the one it is being reported from. As regards the importance of the isnaad, then a few narrations from the Scholars of the early generations will be mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyaan ath-Thawree (d.161H) – rahimahullaah – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The isnaad is the weapon of the Believer. So if he has no weapon, with what will he fight?”[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibnul-Mubaarak (d.181H) – rahimahullaah – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The isnaad with me is from the Religion. If there were no isnaad, then whosoever wanted would relate whatever they wanted. However, when it is said to him: Who narrated to you? He remains silent.” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards the ascription to Imaam Ahmad, then a number of Scholars have agreed to its ascription from ’Abdoos Ibn Maalik al-’Attaar &#8211; one of the close students of the Imaam &#8211; and from these verifying Scholars are: Ibn Abee Ya’laa in Tabaqaatul-Hanaabilah (1/241-246), al-Laalikaa‘ee in Sharh Usoolul-I’tiqaad Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah (1/158-164) and also Ibnul-Jawzee in Manaaqib Ahmad (p. 222-228).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The text of this brief ’aqeedah was first printed by Daarul-Manaar in al-Mujaahid magazine (no. 28-29, Sha’baan &#8211; Ramadaan 1411H); and the original is a manuscript copy, transcribed by the Shaykh and muhaddith, Muhammad Naasirud-Deen al-Albaanee, rahimahullaah, in the month of Sha’baan 1374H, from the manuscript copy (no. 68, Q. 10-15) which is housed at the Dhaahiriyyah library in Damascus, Syria. We ask Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; to grant us the ability to serialize the introduction of this valuable and concise tract, adding to it &#8211; for the benefit of the honourable readers &#8211; a brief commentary and explanation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]: He is Aboo ’Abdullaah Ahmad Ibn Muhammad Ibn Hanbal ash-Shaybaanee &#8211; the Imaam of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah in his time. Born in Baghdaad in Rabee’ul-Awwal, 164H, he attended the circles of al-Qaadee Aboo Yoosuf (the student of Abee Haneefah) &#8211; rahimahullaah – where he studied fiqh. He left this in favour of hadeeth, which he began to study at the age of thirteen &#8211; having already memorized the Qur‘aan at a young age. He traveled extensively acquiring and learning ahaadeeth from over two-hundred and eighty teachers. From them are: Wakee’ Ibnul-Jarraah, Yahyaa Ibn Sa’eed al-Qattaan, ’Abdur-Rahmaan Ibn Mahdee, Sufyaan Ibn ’Uyaynah, ash-Shaafi’ee, Yazeed Ibn Haaroon and others – rahimahullaah. He underwent severe torture and trial due to defending the correct ’aqeedah &#8211; the ’aqeedah of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah (the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam), his Companions and those who followed them in ’aqeedah and manhaj) &#8211; being from those who were foremost in clinging to their way, whilst shunning the innovations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo ’Umayr said: “May Allaah have mercy upon him. There was no one having more patience regarding this world than him, nor anyone more closely resembling those who cam before him, nor anyone more rightfully amongst the righteous. This world was presented to him, but he rejected it, and he expelled innovations.” In his time, he was the Imaam of the people of Hadeeth specifically, and the Muslims in general.” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ash-Shaafi’ee (d.204H) &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I left Baghdaad, and I did not leave behind me a man better, having more knowledge, or greater Fiqh (understanding), nor having greater taqwaa (piety) than Ahmad Ibn Hanbal.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ishaaq Ibn Raahawayh (d.238H) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I used to sit with Ahmad and Ibn Ma’een revising ahaadeeth; and I would say: What is the Fiqh (understanding) of it? What is its explanation? So they would remain silent, except for Ahmad.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Daawood (d.275H) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The lectures of Ahmad were sittings for the Hereafter. He would not mention in them any worldly affairs; and I never saw him mention this world.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">’Alee Ibnul-Madeenee (d.324H) – rahimahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Indeed Allaah aided this Religion through Aboo Bakr as-Siddeeq on the day of apostasy, and through Ahmad Ibn Hanbal on the day of the trial.” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to these qualities, he became a sign for Ahlus-Sunnah – as Qutaybah Ibn Sa’eed (d.240H) said, “If you see a man loving Ahmad, then know that he is a person of the Sunnah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Abul-Hasan al-Ash’aree (d.324H) – rahimahullaah – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Our statement which we hold and take as our Religion is: Clinging to the Book of Allaah, our Lord the Mighty and Majestic, and to the Sunnah of our Prophet, Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam), and what is narrated from the Companions, the Taabi’een and the Imaams of Hadeeth. This is what we cling to, and also that to which Aboo ’Abdullaah Ahmad Ibn Muhammad Ibn Hanbal – may Allaah enlighten his face, rais up his rank and grant him a magnificent reward – used to say, distancing ourselves from those who oppose his statement. Since he was the noble and complete Imaam, by whom Allaah made the truth clear, and removed the misguidance, and made the minhaaj (methodology) clear, and though whom Allaah annihilated the innovation of the innovators, the deviation of the deviant and the doubts of the doubters. So may Allaah have mercy upon him, the foremost Imaam.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taajud-Deen as-Subkee (d.770H) – rahimahullaah – said, “Abul-Hasan al-Ash’aree is the foremost of Ahlus-Sunnah and Ahmad Ibn Hanbal&#8230;” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibraaheem al-Harbee (d.285H) – rahimahullaah – said, “I saw Aboo ’Abdullaah, and it was as if Allaah had gathered for him the knowledge of the earlier people and the later people.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal died in the year 241H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]: The term ‘Sunnah’ here, refers to the principles and foundations of the correct Islaamic ’aqeedah (belief) and manhaj (methodology), since the Salafus-Saalih (pious predecessors) would apply this term to matters of ’aqeedah and manhaj – as can be seen from their books and writings – for example: [i] Kitaabus-Sunnah of Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal (d.241H); [ii] as-Sunnah of al-Athram (d.273H); [iii] Kitaabus-Sunnah of Aboo Daawood (d.275H) – being part of his Sunan. [iv] Kitaabus-Sunnah of Ibn Abee ’Aasim (d.287H); [v] Kitaabus-Sunnah of ’Abdullaah (d.290H), the son of Ahmad Ibn Hanbal; [vi] as-Sunnah of al-Marwazee (d.292H); [vii] Sareehus-Sunnah of Ibn Jareer at-Tabaree (d.310H); [viii] as-Sunnah of al-Khallaal (d.311H); [ix] Sharhus-Sunnah of al-Barbahaaree (d.329H); [x] as-Sunnah of al-’Asaal (d.349H) and [xi] as-Sunnah of at-Tabaraanee (d.360H).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The term ‘Sunnah’ was employed in this context to differentiate those matters of ’aqeedah and manhaj of the Salafus-Saalih were upon, from that which was innovated by the deviant and misguided sects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]: Meaning, with the Scholars of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah and at the head of them in his time was Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal. And in this regard, the way of the Salafus-Saalih was to point out to the people, the true followers and adherents to the Sunnah so that their ’aqeedah and manhaj (methodology) could be learnt and adhered to, as Imaam Ayyoob as-Sakhtiyaanee (d.131H) – rahimahullaah – said, “From the success of a youth, or a non-Arab is that Allaah guides him to a Scholar of the Sunnah.” [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And ’Amr Ibn Qays al-Mulaa‘ee (d.143H) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“If you see a youth when he begins to sprout, keeping company with Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah then have hope for him. If you see him keeping company with the people of Innovation, then fear for him, because the youth is according to his initial upbringing.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]: Companions: Arabic: Sahaabah, or Ashaab; singular: Sahaabee. As regards the Sharee’ah definition of ‘Sahaabee’ or ‘Companion,’ then:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Haafidh Ibn Hajar (d.825H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The most correct of what I have come across is that a Sahaabee (Companion) is one who met the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) whilst believing in him, and died as a Muslim. So that includes one who lived with him for a long or short time, and those who narrated from him and those who did not, and those who saw him but did not sit with him and those who could not see him due to blindness.” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam an-Nawawee (d.676H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The correct position is that whosoever accompanied the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam), even for an hour, then that person is from his Sahaabah.” [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad (d.241H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Every person who accompanied the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam), whether for a year, month, a day, or even for an hour, or even just saw him is from his Companions.”[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Bukhaaree (d.256H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“H who accompanied the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) or saw him – from the Muslims – then he is from his Companions.” [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Haafidh Ibn Hajar said in Fathul-Baaree (7/1),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“That which al-Bukhaaree states is the saying of Ahmad and the great majority of the Scholars of Hadeeth.” Some of the proofs that the Scholars have used for this are: The saying of the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam), “There will come upon the people a time when a group from amongst the people will go off to fight and it will be said to them: Is there any amongst you who has seen the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam)? So they will say: Yes. So victory will be granted to them. So a group will go off to fight and it will be said to them: Is there any amongst you who were the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam)? So they will say: Yes. So victory will be granted to them. Then a group will go off to fight and it will be said to them: Is there any amongst you who have seen the companions of the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam)? So they will say: Yes. So victory will be granted to them.” [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) also said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“You will not cease to be upon good as long as there amongst you those who accompanied me. By Allaah! You will not cease to be upon good as long as there are amongst you those who accompanied those who accompanied and saw me.” [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these narrations contain a clear proof that a Muslim seeing the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) is granted virtue and excellence and is established as being from amongst the Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer (d.774H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The fact that just seeing him (the Prophet) is enough for one to be called a Companion is clearly stated by al-Bukhaaree, Aboo Zur’ah and others who have written books regarding the names of the Companions – such as Ibn ’Abdul-Barr, Ibn Mandah, Aboo Moosaa al-Madanee, Ibnul-Atheer&#8230;” [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards the statement attributed to the taabi’ee and Imaam Sa’eed Ibnul-Musayyib – rahimahullaah – concerning the definition of a Companion, then this cannot be used as a proof at all. This is because al-Haafidh al-’Iraaqee – rahimahullaah – says, “The third saying is what is related from Sa’eed Ibnul-Musayyib, that he had not used to count someone as being a Companion, except one who accompanied the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) for a year or two and fought along with him in one or two battles. Ibnus-Salaah said, “What is meant by this if it is authentic from him – refers back to what the Scholars of Usool say (i.e. what is meant be companionship language wise). However, this definition contains restrictions, which will mean that we do not count as Companions those such as Jareer Ibn ’Abdullaah al-Bajalee – who obviously does not fulfill these conditions that are made – but such are people about whom we know of no difference of opinion with regards to them being Companions.” I say, this is not authentic from Ibnul-Musayyib, since the isnaad (chain of narration) from him contains Muhammad Ibn ’Umar al-Waaqidee – who is da’eef (weak) in hadeeth.” [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]: Here the Imaam – rahimahullaah – explains and lays down the signposts for the correct manhaj followed by Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, and that is the methodology of the best and most excellent of mankind, the Companions, then those who followed them (the taabi’een), then those who followed them (the atbaa’ut-taabi’een).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah cling to what the first three generations of Muslims were upon – the Salafus-Saalih – whose excellence has been testified to by the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) in his statement, “The most excellent of mankind is my generation, then those who follow them, then those who follow them.” [17] And he (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, “The most excellent Ummah is the generation which I have been sent in, then those who followed them, then those who followed them.” [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards to the following generations, then they have not been praised with any specific excellence. Rather, they have, in general, been spoken ill of by the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam). Indeed, in some authentic narrations, after mentioning the excellence of the first three generations, the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, “&#8230;then there will come a people amongst whom fatness will appear and who will testify without having been asked to do so.” [19] And in another narration, “&#8230;then there will come a people in whom you will not find any good.” [20] Also, there occurs in another authentic narration, the wording, “&#8230;then there will come a people who will testify without being asked to do so, who make promises but do not keep them, who are treacherous and not trustworthy and fatness will appear amongst them.” [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is the first three generations – the Salafus-Saalih – whose era has been praised with an excellence, whose path is to be followed and whose understanding of the Religion is to be accepted and affirmed. ’Aa‘ishah – radiyallaahu ’anhaa – said: A man came to the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and said, ‘Who is the most excellent of mankind?’ So the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, “The generation which I am in, then the second, then the third.” [22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is the first of these generations – the Companions – radiyallaahu ’anhum – who were the foremost in excellence from mankind; since they were: [i] those who learnt the Religion directly from the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and, “Being informed is not like seeing.” [23] [ii] those who knew best and understood the Religion – and this is the root of their excellence – as the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, “Whosoever Allaah intends to show excellence to, He gives him the understanding of the Religion.” [24] [iii] They were those who followed it the best, and [iv] They were the ones who were furthest away from and remained free from innovations. About the excellence of the Salafus-Saalih, and the excellence of those who follow them, and the obligation to follow their path, Allaah – the Mighty and Majestic says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Those foremost of those who first migrated and those that helped them and those who follow them in goodness, Allaah is well-pleased with them and they are well-pleased with Him. He has prepared for them gardens underneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme success.” [Sooratut-Tawbah 9:100]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah – the Most Perfect – says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Whosoever contends with the Messenger, even after guidance has been clearly conveyed to him, and follows a path other than that of the Believers; We shall leave him in the Path he has chosen and land him in Hell, what an evil destination.” [Sooratun-Nisaa‘ 4:115]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, “This is a clear definition and a decisive proof upon the worshipper, in making following the path of the Believers obligatory. And who were the Believers at the time this aayah was revealed, except the Companions (radiyallaahu ’anhum). Thus, Allaah has threatened those who leave their way and traverse other than their path, with lowliness and humiliation in this world; and a severe punishment in the Hereafter.” [25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What further adds to the above decisive proofs, and is considered to be the correct explanation of those aayaat, are the ahaadeeth of the Propht (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam), “Indeed my Ummah will split up into seventy-three. All of them are in the Fire except one.” It was said, ‘What is the one?’ He said, “The Jamaa’ah.” And in another narration, he said, “That which I and my Companions are upon.” [26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He – sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam – also said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Those of you who survive after me shall see many differences of opinion. So hold fast to my Sunnah and to the Sunnah of the rightly-guided Caliphs after me. Cling to it tightly and beware of newly-invented matters, for every newly-invented matter is an innovation and every innovation is a going astray.” [27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The stars are the custodians of the sky, when the stars pass away, that which has been decreed for the sky will come upon it. I am the custodian for my Companions, so when I pass away there will come upon my Companions that which is decreed for them. And my Companions are the custodians for my Ummah, so when my Companions pass away, that which has been decreed upon my Ummah will come upon it.” [28] Below is a summary of the aforementioned proofs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[i] That the iftiraaq (splitting-up) of the Ummah into various sects – on the basis of differences in ’aqeedah and manhaj – has been foretold.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ii] All of the various firaq (sects) have been threatened with Hellfire, except those who adhere to the ’aqeedah and the manhaj of the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and his Companions, and that is al-Firqatun-Naajiyah (the Saved-Sect) and the Jamaa’ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[iii] That the authentic hadeeth about iftiraaq (splitting-up) is an explanation of, and in full agreement with the aayah from Sooratun-Nisaa‘ [4:115] in that all those who, “follow a path other than that of the Believers (the Companions),” have been threatened with Hellfire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[iv] The obligation to follow the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and his Companions, and that is the way of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, cannot be fulfilled, except by avoiding and shunning innovation and its people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[v] When differences and innovations arise, it is obligatory to cling to the Sunnah, and also that which the Jamaa’ah have ijmaa’ (consensus and agreement) upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[vi] That the Companions were made examples to be followed and were for this Ummah, after the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam), the custodians of the correct knowledge, manhaj and ’aqeedah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[vii] The root of the Companions excellence is in their understanding of and clinging onto the correct ’aqeedah and manhaj and also in their defending it, preserving it, and in their conveying it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[viii] This is also the root cause for the excellence of those who followed the Companions in the next two generations. So it is binding upon the Muslims to follow the path taken by the Salafus-Saalih, those Muslims who – living in the first three generations – adhered to the ’aqeedah and manhaj, and have been praised with an excellence over and above the rest of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ix] Opposing the way of the Salafus-Saalih is considered iftiraaq (splitting-up) and opposing them in matters related to Islaamic manhaj is also considered iftiraaq. So whoever chooses to oppose their knowledge and understanding of the Revelation, has split from them; and has therefore split from the way of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, and has taken one of the forbidden and innovated paths.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, Ibn Mas’ood (radiyallaahu ’anhu) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Indeed, Allaah looked into the hearts of the servants and found the heart of Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) to be the best of the hearts of the servants. So He chose him for Himself and sent him as a Messenger. Then He looked into the hearts of the servants after Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and found the hearts of the Companions to be the best of the hearts of the servants. So He made them ministers of His Messenger, fighting for His Religion. So whatever the Muslims (i.e. the Companions) hold to be good, then it is good with Allaah, and whatever the Muslims hold to be evil, then it is evil with Allaah.” [29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Barabahaaree (d.329H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The foundations upon which the Jamaa’ah is made clear is the Companions of Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam). They are Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, so whoever does not take from them has gone astray and innovated; and every innovation is misguidance and misguidance and its people are in the Fire.” [30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, “The truth is that which comes from Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. Th Sunnah is that which the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) laid down, and the Jamaa’ah is that which the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) united upon, in the Caliphate of Aboo Bakr, ’Umar and ’Uthmaan. So he who limits himself to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and that which the Companions were upon, is successful and triumphs over all the people of innovation, is saved and his Religion is preserved – if Allaah wills. Since the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, “My Ummah will split up into seventy-three sects,” and he told us that which would be the saved sect, saying, “That which I and my Companions are upon.” So this is the cure, the explanation, the dear affair and the straight and distinct road.” [31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas’ood (radiyallaahu ’anhu) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) drew a line for us and said, “This is the Straight Path of Allaah.” Then he drew lines to its right and its left and said, “These are other paths; upon every one of them is a devil calling towards it.” Then he recited,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Indeed, this is My Straight Path, so follow it. And do not follow other paths, they will separate you from His Path.” [32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">About the statement of Allaah, “And do not follow other paths,” ad-Daarimee relates in his Sunan (1/68) and al-Bayhaqee relates in al-Madkhal ilas-Sunan (no. 200) that Mujaahid (d.204H) said explaining this aayah, “Innovations and doubts.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul-’Aaliyah (d.90H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Learn Islaam. Then when you have learnt Islaam, do not turn away from it to the right, nor the left. Rather, be upon the Straight Path and be upon the Sunnah of your Prophet and that which his Companions were upon&#8230;And beware of these innovations because they cause enmity and hatred amongst you. Rather, stick to the original state of affairs which was there before they divided.” [33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]: Arabic: Bida’ (singular: Bid’ah). Linguistically, bid’ah means: a newly invented matter. The Sharee’ah definition of bid’ah is: “A newly invented way (beliefs or actions) in the Religion, in imitation to the Sharee’ah (prescribed Law), by which nearness of Allaah is sought, not being supported by an authentic proof; neither in its foundations, nor the manner in which it is performed.” [34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ash-Shaatibee (d.777H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Everyone who follows the mutashaabihaat (those aayaat without a clear meaning), or twists the underlying meanings or gives a meaning to the aayaat not given to it by the Salafus-Saalih, or clings on to the very weak and unauthentic ahaadeeth, or takes that which is apparent as a proof – for every action, statement or belief in agreement with his objetives and intentions, not finding a fundamental proof for understanding it in that manner – then this is the method of deduction and derivation which gives rise to innovations and those who innovate.” [35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ’Abdul-Haadee (d.745H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It is not permissible to invent an interpretation about an aayah or a Sunnah which was not there in the time of the Salaf, nor did they have any knowledge of it, nor explain it to the Ummah. Since this would mean that the Salaf were ignorant of the truth in this matter and failed to reach it, whereas the late-coming opponent is somehow guided to the truth!” [36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibnul-Qayyim (d.756H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Inventing an explanation with regards to the Book of Allaah – to which the Salaf and the Scholars ar in opposition – necessitates one of two things; [i] either the explanation in itself a mistake, or [ii] that the sayings of the Salaf which run contrary to it are in error! And no one with an ounce of intellect would doubt that the one whose saying is in opposition to that of the Salaf is the one who is mistaken and in error.” [37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And avoiding bida’ (innovations) is one of the great usool (foundations) of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, and it involves: [i] keeping away from them; [ii] having hatred for them; [iii] warning the people about them; [iv] clarifying them to the people so that they do not fall into them; [v] refuting the innovators.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam as-Saaboonee (d.449H) said about Ahlus-Sunnah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“They follow the Salafus-Saalih – the Imaams and Scholars of the Muslims – and they cling to the firm Religion that they clung to and the firm truth. And they hate Ahlul-Bid’ah (people of innovation) who innovate into the Religion that which is not from it. They do not love them and they do not keep company with them. They do not listen to their sayings, nor sit with them, nor argue with them about the Religion, nor debate with them. Rather, they protect their ears from their futility – things which if they pass through the ears and settle in the hearts – will cause harm and will cause doubts and wicked ideas to appear. And concerning this, Allaah the Mighty and Majestic sent down:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And when you see people engaged in vain discourse, then turn away from them unless they turn to different theme.” [Sooratul-An’aam 6:68].” [38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ash-Shawakaanee (d.1255H) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And this aayah contains a severe reprimand for those who allow people to sit with the innovators, those who twist the Words of Allaah, play around with His Book, and the Sunnah of His Messenger (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam). And refer them back to their own misleading desires and wicked innovations. Since, if he is unable to reprimand them and change them from what they are upon, then at the very least, he should avoid sitting with them – and that is easy for him, not difficult. And the innovators may make use of his presence with them – even though he may be free from their mistakes – through a doubt by which they will beguile the common people, in which case his presence will cause an extra evil, in addition to just listening to their evil.” [39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, “Indeed, Allaah does not accept the repentance of an innovator, until he ceases from the innovation.” [40] And he (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, “Every innovation is misguidance and going astray.” [41] And he also said, “Whosoever innovates, or accommodates an innovator, then upon him is the curse of Allaah, the Angels and the whole of mankind.” [42]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyaan ath-Thawree – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Innovations are more beloved to Iblees than sin. Since a sin may be repented from, but innovation is not repented from.” [43] The following narrations will highlight – if Allaah wills – the manhaj (methodology) adopted by our Salafus-Saalih with regards to the mubtadi’een (innovators). A man said to ’Abdullaah Ibn ’Umar, ‘Najdah (a man from the Khawaarij) says such and such.’ So Ibn ’Umar prevented himself from listening for fear of that some of it should enter into his heart. [44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Hasan al-Basree (d.110H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Do not sit with the people of innovations and desires, nor argue with them, nor listen to them.” [45]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Asmaa‘ Bint ’Ubayd said: Two of the people of vain desires and innovations entered upon Ibn Seereen (d.110H), and said, “O Abaa Bakr, may we speak with you?” So he said, “No!” They said, “May we recite an aayah?” He from the Book of Allaah said, “No, indeed either you must get up and leave me, or I will get up and leave.” So said, “O Abaa Bakr, what harm would they left, so some of the people it have done to you, for them to recite an aayah from the Book of Allaah?” He said, “I feared that they would read an aayah to me and distort it, and that would remain in my heart.” [46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An innovator asked Ayyoob as-Sakhtiyaanee (d.131H), “O Abaa Bakr, may I ask you about a word?’ He turned away and indicated with his hand, “No, not even half of a word.” [47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibraaheem Ibn Maysirah (d.132H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“He who honours an innovator has assisted him in the demolition of Islaam.” [48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Qilaabah (d.140H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Do not sit with the people of innovation, because I do not feel secure that they will not drown you in their misguidance and make part of what you used to know unclear to you.”[49]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ’Awn (d.150H) – rahimahullaah – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Whosoever sits with an innovator is worse than him.” [50]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was said to Imaam al-Awzaa’ee (d.157H) – rahimahullaah, ‘A person says, ‘I sit with Ahlus-Sunnah and I sit with the innovators.’ So al-Awzaa’ee said, ‘This person desires to fluctuate between the truth and falsehood.” [51] Commenting upon this statement, Ibn Battah said, “Indeed, al-Awzaa’ee has spoken the truth. And I say, indeed this person does not know the truth from falsehood, nor faith from disbelief.” [51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyaan ath-Thawree (d.164H) – rahimahullaah – said, “Whosoever listens to an innovator has left the protection of Allaah and is entrusted to the innovation.” [52]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And al-Fudayl Ibn ’Iyaad (d.187H) – rahimahullaah – said, “Do not sit with an innovator, for I fear that curses will descend upon you.” [53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Maalik (d.197H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“How evil are the people of innovation, we do not give them salaam.” [54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ash-Shaafi’ee (d.197H) – rahimahullaah – said, “That a person meets Allaah with every sin except Shirk is better than meeting Him upon any one of the innovated beliefs.”[55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Daawood as-Sijjistaanee (d.275H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to Aboo ’Abdullaah Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, “If I see a man from the people of the Sunnah sitting with a man from the people of innovation, should I speak with him?” He said, “No, you should first inform him that the one whom you saw him with is a person of innovation. Either he will cease speaking to the innovator, so continue speaking with him, or if not, then consider him to be like him. Ibn Mas’ood said that a person is like his friend.” [56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, the people of knowledge throughout the ages continued warning the masses against the innovators and considered this matter important enough to dedicate chapters in their various books about this. For example:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Daawood placed a chapter in his Sunan (4/197), called: “Chapter: Turning away from the innovators and having hatred for them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh al-Mundhiree (d.656H) – rahimahullaah – placed a chapter in at-Targheeb wat-Tarheeb (3/14) called: “Deterrent against loving the people of innovation, since a person will be with those whom he loves.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam an-Nawawee (d.676H) – rahimahullaah – says in al-Adhkaar (p.323), “Chapter: Disassociating from the people of innovation and sin.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Bayhaqee (d.458H) – rahimahullaah – said in al-I’tiqaad (p.236), “Chapter: The prohibition from sitting with the people of innovation.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Laalikaa‘ee (d.418H) said in Sharh Usoolul-I’tiqaad Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah (1/128), “What is related from the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) with respect to the forbiddance of debating with the innovators.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Baghawee (d.516H) &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘Indeed the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) informed about the division in this Ummah, and the manifestation of desires and innovations in it. And he designated salvation for those who follow his Sunnah and the Sunnah of his Companions, may Allaah be pleased with them. So it is upon the Muslim, that if he sees a man having something from innovations and desires in belief, or something neglected from the Sunnah, that he makes Hijrah (migration) from him, and he frees himself from him, and abandons him in life and death. So he must not greet him if he meets him, and he must not answer him if he (i.e. the innovator) begins the greeting, until he abandons his innovation and returns to the truth…So verily the hijrah from the people of desires and innovation continues until they repent.’’ [57]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qaadee Aboo Ya’laa (d.333H) – rahimahullaah – said in Hajarul-Mubtadi’ (p. 32), “There is ijmaa’ (consensus) from the Companions and the taabi’een as regards disassociating and cutting-off from the innovators.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also necessary to mention here, the distinction that the Scholars make between a newly-invented matter being bid’ah (innovation) and passing a judgement upon the one who is involved in it that he is a mubtadi’ (innovator).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]: Just as the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said in his sermons, “&#8230;and every innovation is misguidance and all that misguides, misguides to the Fire.” [59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And ’Abdullaah Ibn ’Umar (radiyallaahu ’anhu) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Every innovation is misguidance, even if the people think it is good.” [60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Barbahaaree (d.329H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Beware of small innovations, because they will grow until they become large. This was the case with every innovation introduced into this Ummah. It began as something small, bearing resemblance to the truth, which is why those who entered into it were misled and then were unable to leave it. So it grew and became the religion that they followed, and thus deviated from the Straight Path and left Islaam. And may Allaah have mercy upon you! Examine carefully the speech of everyone you hear from in your time particularly. So do not act in haste, and do not enter into anything from it until you ask and see: Did any of the Companions of the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) speak about it, or any of the Scholars? So if you find a narration from them about it, cling to it, do not go beyond it for anything and do not give precedence to anything over it and thus fall into the Fire.”[61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Hasan al-Basree said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Sunnah is – by Him besides whom none has the right to be worshipped – between those who exceed the limits and those who fall short. So be patient upon it, may Allaah have mercy upon you. For indeed, Ahlus-Sunnah were a minority from those who preceded and shall be a minority from those to come. They did not accompany the people of excessiveness when they exceeded, nor the people of innovation when they innovated. Rather, they persevered upon the Sunnah, until they met their Lord.” [62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In summary, two major principles of manhaj – with regards to the ’aqeedah of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah – have been covered in the first part of this serialization: Firstly, “The source for the ’aqeedah is: the Book of Allaah, the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and the ijmaa’ (consensus) of the Salafus-Saalih.” Secondly, “Every newly invented matter in the Religion is an innovation, and every innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance is in the Fire.” [63]</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Printed and Published by : Presidency of Islamic research, Ifta propogation, and Guidance</strong><br>
Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Govt Publication – <a href="https://salafiaudio.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/indispensable-implication-of-sunnah-and-caution-against-innovation-ibn-baz.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>Download PDF</strong></a>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allâh who completed the religion for us, perfected the blessing on us and chose Islam as our religion. May the blessings and peace be upon His slave and Messenger, who called upon people to obey his Lord and cautioned against extravagance, innovation and disobedience; and may Allâh bless his posterity, his companions and those who follow his footsteps till the Day of Judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have been acquainted with the article published on the first page of the weekly magazine <em>Edarat</em> of Kanpur , an industrial city of Uttar Pardesh in India , which contains an implied campaign against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia , its adherence to the Islamic creed, and its opposition to innovations. The writer alleges that the creed of the <em>Salaf</em> (early adherents to Islam) which is held by Saudi Kingdom does not agree with the<em> Sunnah</em>. By this, the writer aims at creating division amongst the<em> Ahl-as-Sunnah</em> and encouraging the innovations and superstitions. This attitude, no doubt, is most abominable and dangerous and aims at offending the Religion of Islam and spreading innovations and deviations from the truth. Furthermore, the article concentrates clearly on the subject of celebrating the Prophet&#8217;s birthday as an excuse to discuss the creed of the Kingdom and its rulers. Therefore, I consider it necessary to enlighten the people on this subject. So seeking help of Allâh, I say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible to celebrate the birthday of the Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم or somebody else. In fact, it must be stopped, as it is an innovation in the religion. Allâh&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم neither celebrated it, nor commanded others to do this for himself; or for anyone who died before him amongst the Prophets, or for his daughters, or his wives, or his other relatives. The rightly-guided Caliphs, the Companions of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم or the Successors who rightly followed them did not celebrate this event, nor did anyone of the Muslim scholars in the centuries before.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They knew the <em>Sunnah </em>of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم best, they loved him more, and followed the <em>Shari&#8217;ah</em> better than those who came after them. If celebrating his birthday was a good deed, they would have done it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are commanded to follow and forbidden to innovate. This is because of the perfection of the Islamic religion and the sufficiency of what Allâh and His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم have given us and are accepted by <em>Ahl-as-Sunnah wal-Jama&#8217;ah.</em> The Muslim community of the Companions and those who followed them in the best way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is related to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; من أحدث في أمرنا هذا ما ليس منه فهو رد &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;He who innovates something in this matter of ours that is not of it, will have it rejected). (Transmitted by<em> Al-Bukhâri</em> and <em>Muslim)</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to Muslim who reported:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; من عمل عملا ليس عليه أمرنا فهو رد &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever does an act which is not in agreement with our matter, will have it rejected.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another tradition, the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; عليكم بسنتي وسنة الخلفاء الراشدين المهديين من بعدي, تمسكوا بها وعضوا عليها بالنواجذ, وإياكم ومحدثات الأمور, فإن كل محدثة بدعة وكل بدعة ضلالة &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;You must keep to my <em>Sunnah </em>and of the <em>Sunnah</em> of the rightly-guided Caliphs, cling to it firmly. Beware of newly invented matters, for every new matter is an innovation and every innovation is misleading&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He used to say in every Friday <em>Khutbah</em> (sermon, religious talk):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; فإن خير الحديث كتاب الله وخير الهدي هدي محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم وشر الأمور محدثاتها وكل بدعة ضلالة &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The best discourse is the Book of Allâh and the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad, the Messenger of Allâh, and the worst matter is that of innovation and every innovation is misleading&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, these<em> Ahâdith</em> (traditions) contain a strong caution against innovations and a warning that such an act is a deviation from the right course. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم warned the people of the gravity of these innovations and of their bad consequences. There are many traditions adduced in this connection. And the Almighty has said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَمَا آتَاكُمُ الرَّسُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَاكُمْ عَنْهُ فَانْتَهُوا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8230; And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم ) gives you, take it, and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it), &#8230;&#8221; (V.59:7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">فَلْيَحْذَرِ الَّذِينَ يُخَالِفُونَ عَنْ أَمْرِهِ أَنْ تُصِيبَهُمْ فِتْنَةٌ أَوْ يُصِيبَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8230; And let those who oppose the Messenger&#8217;s (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم ) commandment (i.e. his <em>Sunnah</em> &#8211; legal ways, orders, acts of worship, statements, etc.) (among the sects) beware, lest some <em>Fitnah </em>(disbelief, trials, afflictions, earthquakes, killing, overpowered by a tyrant, etc.) befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them.&#8221; (V.24:63).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh the Almighty said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏لَقَدْ كَانَ لَكُمْ فِي رَسُولِ اللَّهِ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ لِمَنْ كَانَ يَرْجُو اللَّهَ وَالْيَوْمَ الْآخِرَ وَذَكَرَ اللَّهَ كَثِيرًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed in the Messenger of Allâh (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes in (the Meeting with) Allâh and the Last Day and remembers Allâh much.&#8221; (V.33:21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allâh the Almighty said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏وَالسَّابِقُونَ الْأَوَّلُونَ مِنَ الْمُهَاجِرِينَ وَالْأَنْصَارِ وَالَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوهُمْ بِإِحْسَانٍ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُوا عَنْهُ وَأَعَدَّ لَهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي تَحْتَهَا الْأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا أَبَدًا ذَلِكَ الْفَوْزُ الْعَظِيمُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And the first to embrace Islam of the <em>Muhâjirun</em> (those who migrated from Makkah to Al-Madinah) and the <em>Ansâr</em> (the citizens of Al-Madinah who helped and gave aid to the <em>Muhâjirun</em>) and also those who followed them exactly (in Faith). Allâh is well-pleased with them as they are well- pleased with Him. He has prepared for them Gardens under which rivers flow ( Paradise ), to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme success.&#8221; (V.9:100).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allâh the Almighty said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">الْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِي وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ الْإِسْلَامَ دِينًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8230; This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion&#8230;&#8221; (V.5:3).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse decisively indicates that the Almighty Allâh has completed the religion for this <em>Ummah,</em> and has showered His blessings on them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم passed away only after he had imparted the complete Message of Allâh to the <em>Ummah </em>as well as his legislations concerning sayings and deeds. He also stressed that all things invented by people and then attributed to the religion of Islam are innovations and to be rejected, even if their inventors did so in good faith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is established that the Companions of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and the righteous Successors after them warned the people against innovations as they add to Islam and legislate what is not permitted by Allâh, in line with the enemies of Allâh such as the Jews and the Christians who added to their religion and innovated what was not allowed by Allâh. Moreover, to admit innovation in Islam is to admit that Islam is incomplete and imperfect. Such a belief is not only an evil but contradicts the following verse: &#8220;This day have I perfected your religion for you,&#8221; and the sayings of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم which warn us against innovations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To celebrate the anniversary of the birth of Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and the others, means that the religion is not perfected by Allâh (the Glorious, the Almighty) for this <em>Ummah,</em> and the Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم did not impart to the people what was necessary regarding their religious duties, till these late ones appeared and invented in the religion what is not permitted by Allâh, thinking that this would bring them nearer to Allâh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Undoubtedly, this is a great danger and is tantamount to criticizing Allâh the Almighty and the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم ; whereas Allâh the Almighty has already completed the religion and perfected His Grace, and the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم has conveyed the Message openly and informed the <em>Ummah</em> of all such ways that will lead them to the Paradise and save them from Hell-fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to an authentic<em> Hadith,</em> on the authority of Abdullah bin Amr bin Al-Aas, Allâh&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; ما بعث الله من نبي إلا كان حقا عليه أن يدل أمته على خير ما يعلمه لهم وينذرهم شر ما يعلمه لهم &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allâh تعالى (the Almighty) did not send a Prophet but obliged him to lead his people to the best way which is known to him, and warn them against the worst which is known to him.&#8221; (Transmitted by<em> Muslim)</em><br>
It is well-known that our Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم is the best of all the Prophets, the last and the most perfect of them regarding the way he conveyed the Message and advised his people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Had the celebration of <em>Milâd</em> been an act of religion chosen by Allâh for His slaves, the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم would have either explained that to his people and would have celebrated it during his life, or his Companions would have done it. As these did not happen, it becomes clear that Islam has no concern with <em>Milâd.</em> On the contrary, it is one of the innovations against which the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم has warned his people as mentioned earlier.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A host of scholars have not only rejected the celebration of <em>Milâd</em> but have warned against it in view of the evidences given above.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to the rule of the Islamic <em>Shari&#8217;ah</em> all matters regarding legalization or prohibition and all disputes among the people, should be referred to the Book of Allâh and the <em>Sunnah </em>of His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم in line with the saying of Allâh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَطِيعُوا اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُوا الرَّسُولَ وَأُولِي الْأَمْرِ مِنْكُمْ فَإِنْ تَنَازَعْتُمْ فِي شَيْءٍ فَرُدُّوهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَالرَّسُولِ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ تُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ ذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ وَأَحْسَنُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O you who believe! Obey Allâh and obey the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم ), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority. (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allâh and His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم , if you believe in Allâh and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination.&#8221; (V .4:59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allâh the Almighty said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَمَا اخْتَلَفْتُمْ فِيهِ مِنْ شَيْءٍ فَحُكْمُهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And in whatsoever you differ, the decision thereof is with Allâh (He is the ruling Judge). (42:10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Referring this issue back to the Book of Allâh, we find it ordaining upon us to follow Allâh&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم in his commandments and warns us against whatever he prohibits. Furthermore it tells us that Allâh has perfected the religion for the people. So, as long as <em>Milâd</em> is not among the teachings of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم , it cannot be a part of the religion which Allâh has perfected for us and asked us to adhere to by following the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Again when we refer this issue back to the <em>Sunnah</em> of Allâh&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم , we do not find either the Prophet or the Companions doing it by themselves or asking others to do it. So it becomes evident that<em> Milâd,</em> is not a part of religion, rather one of innovations and blind imitation of the people of the Scripture, i.e. the Jews and the Christians in their festivals. With this argument in mind, it becomes crystal clear for everyone having the least insight and inclination towards truth and justice, that celebrating any birthday has nothing to do with Islam. It is rather among the innovations which Allâh and His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم warned against emphatically.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A wise man must not be deceived by seeing a large number of people doing it throughout the world because the truth is known and recognized by the evidences of<em> Shari&#8217;ah</em> and not by the acts of a great number of people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh تعالى (the Almighty) says regarding the Jews and the Christians:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَقَالُوا لَنْ يَدْخُلَ الْجَنَّةَ إِلَّا مَنْ كَانَ هُودًا أَوْ نَصَارَى تِلْكَ أَمَانِيُّهُمْ قُلْ هَاتُوا بُرْهَانَكُمْ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And they say, `None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian.&#8217; These are their own desires. Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم ): `Produce your proof if you are truthful.&#8221;&#8217; (V.2:111).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Almighty also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏وَإِنْ تُطِعْ أَكْثَرَ مَنْ فِي الْأَرْضِ يُضِلُّوكَ عَنْ سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ إِنْ يَتَّبِعُونَ إِلَّا الظَّنَّ وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلَّا يَخْرُصُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And if you obey most of those on earth, they will mislead you far away from Allâh&#8217;s path. They follow nothing but conjectures, and they do nothing but lie.&#8221; (V.6:116).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most of these innovations, in addition to their innovatory nature, also do not usually escape from a number of other evils, such as mixed gatherings of men and women, songs accompanied by musical instruments. drinking intoxicants, narcotics and the like. They may also involve the worst thing i. e. the greatest <em>Shirk,</em> through showing exaggeration in Allâh&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم and other saints and through praying to him, invoking his help or believing that he knows what is hidden and all similar claims which render a believer as an infidel. It is authentically reported that the Messenger of Allâh has said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; وإياكم والغلو في الدين فإنما أهلك من كان قبلكم &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Beware of extravagance in the religion: It has caused the people before you to perish&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; لا تطروني كما أطرت النصارى ابن مريم, إنما أنا عبد فقولوا عبد الله ورسوله &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Do not lavish praise on me as the Christians did with the son of Maryam. I am just a slave. So simply say: The slave of Allâh and His Messenger&#8221;. (Transmitted by <em>Bukhâri)</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is curious to note that a great many people participate most actively in these celebrations and defend them vehemently, while they sit back from attending the obligatory forms of worship such as daily and Friday prayers. They are not even ashamed of this, nor do they realize that they are committing a great evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Undoubtedly, this shows the weakness of their Faith, their short-sightedness, and the deeply ingrained rust on their hearts because of sins and disobedience. We ask Allâh&#8217;s protection for us and for all the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is even more astonishing to note that some people believe that Allâh&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم is present at <em>Milâd.</em> Consequently they stand to greet and welcome him. That is not only a sheer lie but a worst form of ignorance, as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم shall neither come out of his grave before the Day of Resurrection, nor shall he meet the people or attend their meetings. Instead, he shall remain in his grave till the Day of Resurrection while his soul rests at the highest of the high with his Lord in the most exalted and highest place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh تعالى (the Almighty) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏ثُمَّ إِنَّكُمْ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ لَمَيِّتُونَ. ‏ثُمَّ إِنَّكُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ تُبْعَثُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;After that, surely, you will die. Then (again), surely, you will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221; (V.23:15, 16).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; أنا أول من يشق عنه القبر يوم القيامة وأنا أول شافع وأول مُشَفَّع &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I am the first one to rise from the grave on the Resurrection Day and I will be the first intercessor and the first one whose intercession is to be accepted.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The aforesaid evidences from the Qur&#8217;ân and <em>Hadith</em> prove beyond doubt that the dead people will come out of their graves only on the Day of Resurrection. All the scholars of Islam agree upon this. A Muslim should be aware of these things and must not be easily misled by the innovations and the superstitions created by the ignorant people with no authority from Allâh at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for offering the blessings and greetings (<em>Salât</em> and <em>Salâm</em>) to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم , they are among the most preferred and virtuous deeds in accordance with the Saying of Allâh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏إِنَّ اللَّهَ وَمَلَائِكَتَهُ يُصَلُّونَ عَلَى النَّبِيِّ يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا صَلُّوا عَلَيْهِ وَسَلِّمُوا تَسْلِيمًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allâh sends His<em> Salat</em> (Graces, Honours, Blessings, Mercy, etc.) on the Prophet (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم ) and also His angels too (ask Allâh to bless and forgive him). O you who believe! Send your <em>Salat</em> on (ask Allâh to bless) him (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم ), and (you should) greet (salute) him with the Islamic way of greeting (salutation i.e.<em> As- Salâm-o-Alaikum)</em>.&#8221; (V.33:56).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم has said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; من صلى عليَّ واحدة صلى الله عليه عشرا &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whosoever sends blessings on me one time, Allâh sends blessings on him ten times&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is prescribed on all times, particularly at the end of each prayer. It is held obligatory at the last <em>Tashahhud</em> of each <em>Salât </em>(prayer) by most of the scholars. It is strongly required at a number of occasions such as immediately after <em>Adhân,</em> at the mention of the name of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم , during the day of Friday and the night preceding it, according to a host of <em>Ahâdith.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what I wanted to emphasize regarding this issue. I hope it will satisfy everyone whom Allâh has shown the light.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How sad it is to see some devoted Muslims, known for their strength of Faith and love for the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم organizing such innovatory celebrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let us ask such people: Tell us, if you belong to<em>Ahl-as-Sunnah</em> and follow the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم , whether he himself or one of his Companions or their Successors did this or is it no more than a blind-following of the enemies of Islam from among the Jews and the Christians and the like ؟</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The love of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم is not reflected by the celebration on his birthday, but by obeying him, believing in his teachings, keeping away from what he prohibited and by worshipping Allâh in the way he prescribed for us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also reflected through offering<em> Salat</em> and <em>Salâm</em> to him from time to time, particularly at the mention of his name and during prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Wahhabiyya,</em> as the writer tends to put it, are not new in rejecting all such innovations. Their creed is to hold fast to the Book of Allâh and the<em> Sunnah</em> of His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم ; to follow his footsteps and those of his rightly- guided Successors; to believe and practise what was propounded by the virtuous Predecessors and the <em>Imâms </em>of learning and guidance who were capable to issue religious injunction concerning the knowledge of Allâh, and His Attributes of perfection and dignity as shown in the Glorious Book and the authentic <em>Ahâdith</em> (traditions) of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and as wholeheartedly accepted by his Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Wahhabiyya</em> believe in them, the way they are reported without any alteration, personification, exemplifying or negation of such attributes. They stick to the way of the Successors and their followers from among the people of learning, Faith and piety. They believe that the foundation of the Faith is to bear witness that there is none to be worshipped except Allâh and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allâh. To them, this is the root of Faith and one of its most exalted branches as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They know in accordance with the consensus of the Muslims, that this root requires knowledge, acknowledgement and practice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It implies that none is to be worshipped except Allâh the Almighty, Who has no associates at all. It further implies the negation of worshipping any other except Him. It shows why jinn and mankind were created; why the Messengers were sent and why the Books were revealed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, <em>Ibâdah</em> (worship) is not only complete submission and love but also complete obedience and veneration as well. Islam is the only religion prescribed by Allâh and disseminated by the Prophets and nothing, except it, is acceptable to Allâh whether in the past or the present. The one who submits his will to Allâh as well as to someone else beside Him, is a <em>Mushrik</em> (polytheist). The same is true for the one who prays to Allâh and someone else beside Him. As for the one who does not submit to Him, he is arrogant concerning his duties towards his Creator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh, the Almighty says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِي كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَسُولًا أَنِ اُعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُوا الطَّاغُوتَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And verily, We have sent among every <em>Ummah</em> (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): &#8220;Worship Allâh (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from)<em> Tâghût</em> (all false deities etc. i.e. do not worship <em>Tâghût</em> besides Allâh).&#8221; (V.16:36).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus the creed of the <em>Wahhabiyya</em> is based upon fulfillment of witnessing that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allâh and completely abandoning all innovations, superstitions and whatever goes against the <em>Shari&#8217;ah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what Sheikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab رحمه الله believed and invited others to believe. Whoever accredits to him anything contrary to it, does not only lie but commits a great sin and claims what is totally unfounded. He will, no doubt, receive what Allâh has promised to all the fabricators of lies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh has shown &#8211; through a series of his well-known treatises and scholarly books on the topic of the &#8220;Declaration of Oneness: <em>La ilaha illAllâh&#8221; &#8211;</em> that no one deserves worship except Allâh the Almighty, and that this type of worship should be devoid of all sorts of <em>Shirk</em> whether big or small. Anyone who is aware of these writings, his way of preaching and calling people to Allâh and of the way of his pupils and disciples, can easily find out that his approach was not different from that of our virtuous Predecessors, the great Imâms of learning and guidance. Indeed, he has propounded what they did throughout their lives concerning the worship of Allâh Alone and leaving all innovations and superstitions aside.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the foundation of the Saudi regime and this view is held by the scholars of Saudi Arabia . The hard attitude shown by the Saudi government is directed only against the superstitions and innovations in contradiction with Islam, or the extreme type of extravagance which is totally prohibited by the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم . All Muslims, scholars and rulers of Saudi Arabia hold great respect and love for every Muslim regardless of his affiliation to any group or country in the world. They do reject all types of celebrations or gatherings which are based on innovation, with no authority from Allâh or His Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم .<br>
They oppose them because every new matter in the religion is an innovation and because the Muslims are commanded to follow, not to innovate. Islam is perfect and complete by itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is in no need of any addition after what Allâh and His Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم have ordained and what the <em>Ahl-as-Sunnah wal-Jamâ&#8217;ah,</em> from among the Companions, the Successors and their followers have already received. To forbid celebrating the birthday of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم due to its innovative nature in addition to the signs of extravagance and <em>Shirk</em> normally associated with it, is not un-Islamic or derogatory to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم . Instead, it is an act of obedience as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم himself said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; إياكم والغلو في الدين فإنما أهلك من كان قبلكم الغلو في الدين &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Beware of the extravagance in matters of religion. Those before you have perished because of extravagance in the matters of religion&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Again he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; لا تطروني كما أطرت النصارى ابن مريم, إنما أنا عبد فقولوا عبد الله ورسوله &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Do not lavish praise on me as the Christians did with the son of Maryam. I am but a slave. So simply say: `Slave of Allâh and His Messenger.&#8221;&#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what I wanted to point out regarding the aforesaid article.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allâh help us and all the Muslims to understand His religion, to continually confirm us on it, stick to Sunnah and keep away from the innovation. Indeed He is Generous and Kind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And may Allâh shower His blessings and mercy upon our Prophet Muhammad, his posterity and his Companions.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">By Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Jameel Zaynoo [1]<br>
Minhâj al-Firqatun-Nâjiyah wat-Tâ‘ifat al-Manrûrah (pp.6-17)<br>
Al-Ibaanah Magazine, Issue No.3 &#8211; Dhul-Qa’dah 1416H / April 1996<strong>[1]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High – said,“<strong>And hold fast altogether to the Rope of Allaah and do not become divided.</strong>” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [2]</strong> Allaah &#8211; the Most High – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>And do not be of those who commit Shirk</strong> (associate partners with Allaah)<strong>, those who split-up their Religion and become sects; each sect rejoicing in what is with them.</strong>” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [3]</strong> The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) said, “I advise you to have<em> taqwaa </em>of Allaah and to hear and to obey, even if an Abyssinian slave becomes your leader. Those of you who live long after me will see a lot of differences, so hold fast to my <em>Sunnah </em>and to the <em>Sunnah </em>of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs after me. Cling to it tightly and beware of newly-invented matters, for every newly invented matter is an innovation, and every innovation is misguidance, and all misguidance is in the Fire.” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [4]</strong> He (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em> also said, “Indeed, the people of the Book before you split-up into seventy-two sects. And this nation will split-up into seventy-three sects, seventy two are in the Fire and one is in Paradise .” [5] And in another narration, “All of them are in the Fire except one.” It was asked, ‘Who is that one?’ He replied, “That which I and my Companions are upon.” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [5]</strong> Ibn Mas’ood &#8211; <em>radiyallaahu ’anhu</em> – said, [7] Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) drew a line for us and then said, “This is Allaah’s Path.” Then he drew lines to its right and its left, and said, “These are differing paths, upon each of them there is a <em>Shaytaan </em>(devil) calling to it.” Then he recited, “And verily this is My Path, so follow it, and do not follow other paths for they will separate you away from His Path.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [6]</strong> Shaykh ’Abdul-Qaadir al-Jeelaanee (d.561H) said, “As for <em>al-Firqatun-Naajiyah</em> (the Saved-Sect) it is <em>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah</em>, and there is no name for <em>Ahlus-Sunnah</em> except one &#8211; and that is <em>Ashaabul-Hadeeth</em> (the People of <em>Hadeeth</em>).” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [7]</strong> Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects, the Most High &#8211; orders us to hold fast altogether to the Noble Qur‘aan; and not to be of the <em>mushriks</em> (those who associate partners with Allaah in that which is particular to Him) who split-up their Religion and become <em>shee’an</em> (sects) and <em>hizbs</em> (parties). And the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) informed us that the Jews and the Christians will be divided into many sects and that the Muslims will split-up even more. And that these sects will be fitting for entry into the Fire, due to their deviations and their being far from the Book of their Lord and the <em>Sunnah</em> of their Messenger. And that only one sect will be saved from the Fire and enter Paradise &#8211; and that is the <em>Jamaa’ah</em>; those who cling to the Book and the authentic <em>Sunnah</em> and to the actions of the Companions of the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>. O Allaah! Make us from amongst the Saved-Sect; and grant the Muslims the guidance and ability to be from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Methodology of the Saved-Sect:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [1]</strong><em>al-Firqatun-Naajiyah</em> (the Saved-Sect) is that which adheres to the <em>manhaj</em> (methodology) of Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) during his lifetime, and to the <em>minhaaj</em> of his Companions after him: and that is the Noble Qur‘aan which Allaah revealed to His Messenger, and which he explained to his Companions in the authentic <em>Sunnah</em> &#8211; ordering the Muslims to cling to these two, saying, “I am leaving amongst you two things, you will never go astray as long as you cling to them: the Book of Allaah and my <em>Sunnah</em>. They will not separate from each other, until you meet me at the Lake .” [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [2]</strong> The Saved-Sect returns to the Word of Allaah and His Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) whenever there is disagreement or difference of opinion; acting upon the saying of Allaah &#8211; the Most High, “If you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allaah and His Messenger, if you do believe in Allaah and the Last Day. That is best and most suitable for final determination.” [11] And He &#8211; the Most High – said, “But no, by your Lord! They cannot have any faith until they make you (the Messenger) a judge in all disputes that they have between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decision, but accept them with full submission.” [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [3]</strong> The Saved-Sect does not give precedence to the word of anyone over the Word of Allaah and His Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>), acting upon His &#8211; the Most High – saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>O you who believe! Do not put yourselves forward before Allaah and His Messenger, and have taqwaa of Allaah. Indeed, Allaah is all-Hearing, all-Seeing.</strong>” [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ’Abbaas &#8211; <em>radiyallaahu ’anhu</em> – said, “I fear that stones will descend upon you from the sky, that I say to you that the Messenger of Allaah said; and you say to me that Aboo Bakr and ’Umar say something else!” [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [4]</strong> The Saved-Sect values <em>Tawheed</em>: and it is to single-out Allaah alone in worship, in supplication, in seeking aid and assistance, in seeking refuge in times of ease and hardship, in sacrificing and vow-making, in placing total reliance and trust in Him and in judging by what Allaah has revealed; and all other forms of worship. These are the foundations upon which the true Islaamic governance is based. It is therefore essential to remove <em>Shirk</em> (associating partners with Allaah in those matters that are particular to Him) and its manifestations &#8211; which is present in all the Muslim lands &#8211; since this is a requirement of <em>Tawheed</em>. And victory is not possible when <em>Tawheed</em> is neglected, nor can <em>Shirk</em> be fought with its like. We must &#8211; in this &#8211; follow the examples of the Prophets and in particular, the example of our noble Prophet &#8211; may the Peace of Allaah and His Prayers be upon them all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [5]</strong> The Saved-Sect revive the <strong>Sunnah </strong>of Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) in their <em>’ibaadah</em> (worship), <em>sulook</em> (behaviour) and in their lives, thus becoming strangers amongst the people &#8211; as Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) mentioned in his saying, “Islaam started as something strange and will return as something strange as it began, so Toobaa (a tree in Paradise) is for the Strangers.” [15] In another narration, “ &#8230; so Toobaa is for the Strangers. Those who correct and put right what the people have corrupted.” [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [6]</strong> The Saved-Sect does not have <em>ta’assub</em> (bigoted adherence) to the sayings of anyone, except the saying of Allaah and the saying of His infallible Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>), who does not speak from his own desires. As for every other person &#8211; however elevated his rank &#8211; then he errs and makes mistakes, according to his (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) saying, “All the children of Aadam err and commit mistakes, and the best of those who make mistakes are those who turn in repentance.” [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Maalik (d. 179H) &#8211; <em>rahimahullaah</em> – said, “There is no one after the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>), except that you can take his saying or leave it, with the exception of the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>).” [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [7]</strong> The Saved-Sect are <em>Ahlul-Hadeeth</em> (the People of Hadeeth), about whom the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) said, “There will not cease to be a group from my <em>Ummah</em> victorious and uppermost upon the truth, those who abandon them will not harm them, until the command of Allaah comes about.” [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A poet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em> “Ahlul-Hadeeth are the people of the Prophet, although;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em> They accompany him not, they are with his every movement.”</em> [20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [8]</strong> The Saved-Sect love and honour the <em>mujtahid</em> Imaams (those Scholars who are able to extract rulings from the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>). However, they do not have <em>ta’assub</em> (bigoted blind adherence) to any particular one of them. On the contrary, they take <em>fiqh</em> (rulings) from the <em>Qur‘aan</em> and the authentic <em>ahaadeeth</em>, upon the understanding, and the sayings, of all of the Scholars &#8211; if it is in agreement with the authentic <em>ahaadeeth</em>. Indeed, this agrees with their saying, that you should take it if it agrees with the authentic <em>hadeeth </em>and leave whatever disagrees with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Imaam Aboo Haneefah (d.150H) &#8211; <em>rahimahullaah</em> – said, “If a <em>hadeeth </em>is found to be authentic, then that is my <em>madhhab</em>.” [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Maalik (d.179H) &#8211; <em>rahimahullaah</em> – said, “Indeed I am only a man. I am sometimes mistaken and at other times correct; so look into my opinions. All that agrees with the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, accept it; and all that does not agree with the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, then abandon it.” [22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ash-Shaafi’ee (d.204H) &#8211; <em>rahimahullaah</em> – said, “Everything that I say, for which there is something authentically related from the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) contrary to my saying, then the <em>hadeeth </em>of the Prophet comes first. So do not make <em>taqleed</em> (blind-following) of me.” [23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad (d.241H) &#8211; <em>rahimahullaah</em> – said, “Do not make <em>taqleed</em> (blind-following) of me, nor make <em>taqleed</em> of Maalik, nor of ash-Shaafi’ee, nor of al-Awzaa’ee, nor of ath-Thawree. But take from where they took.” [24]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [9]</strong> The Saved-Sect orders the good and forbids the evil. Thus it renounces the innovated ways and destructive parties and groups which split the <em>Ummah</em>: those that innovate in the Religion and innovate with regards the <em>Sunnah</em> of the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) and that of his Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [10]</strong> The Saved-Sect calls the Muslims to cling to the <em>Qur‘aan</em> and to the <em>Sunnah</em> of the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) and to the way of his Companions, until victory is decreed for them; and until they enter Paradise by the Grace of Allaah and the <em>shifaa’ah</em> (intercession) of His Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [11]</strong> The Saved-Sect reject those laws which are man-made when they contradict the judgement of Islaam. Rather, it calls to the judgement by the Book of Allaah, which Allaah revealed for the happiness and benefit of mankind, both in this world and in the Hereafter, and Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect, the Most High &#8211; knows what it is that will correct and reform them. So His Law is firm and constant, it will not alter for the rest of time, nor does the passage of time alter its values. Indeed, the reason for the misfortunes of this world in general, and the Islaamic world in particular &#8211; which is experiencing misfortune, lowliness and humiliation &#8211; is: abandoning judging by the Book of Allaah and the <em>Sunnah</em> of His Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>). And nothing will make the Muslims strong again except by them returning to the teachings of Islaam &#8211; individually, collectively and in their governance &#8211; acting upon the saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>Indeed, never will Allaah change the condition of a people until they change themselves.</strong>” [25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [12]</strong> The Saved-Sect call the Muslims collectively to <em>Jihaad</em> in the path of Allaah &#8211; which is obligatory upon every Muslim in accordance with his ability and strength. And <em>Jihaad</em> comprises the following:-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [i]</strong><em>Jihaad</em> with the Tongue and the Pen: to call the Muslims and others to the adherence of the true and correct Islaam and adherence to <em>Tawheed</em> free from the <em>Shirk </em>which has spread in the Islaamic lands; and which Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) informed us would appear amongst the Muslims, saying, “The Hour will not be established until a group from my <em>Ummah </em>will follow the<em> mushriks</em>, and large groups [26] of my<em> Ummah </em>will worship idols.” [25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [ii]</strong><em>Jihaad</em> with Wealth: and it is to give wealth for the propagation of Islaam and for printing <em>da’wah</em> books based upon the correct approach. It also consists of the distribution of funds to the weak Muslims to incline their hearts and to strengthen them. It also consists of the manufacture and purchase of weapons and equipping the <em>mujaahideen</em> &#8211; providing them with food, clothing and other requirements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [iii]</strong><em>Jihaad</em> with Oneself: it consists of fighting and participating in battle for the victory of Islaam, such that the Word of Allaah is made uppermost, whilst the word of <em>kufr</em> (disbelief) is debased and made low.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the noble Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) pointed to these three types of <em>Jihaad </em>in his saying: “Make <em>Jihaad </em>against the <em>mushrikeen </em>with your wealth, yourselves and your tongues.” [28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the ruling concerning <em>Jihaad </em>in the path of Allaah is according to the following cases:-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Fard ’Ayn</strong> (individual obligation)<strong>:</strong> When the enemy aggressors take over any part of the Muslim lands &#8211; such as Palestine &#8211; which has been over-run by the wicked Jews. So it is an obligation upon the Muslims &#8211; whether with their wealth or their selves &#8211; to drive out the Jews from Palestine and return Masjidul-Aqsaa to the Muslims &#8211; the Muslims being sinful until they do so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Fard Kifaayah</strong> (collective obligation)<strong>:</strong> If some Muslims carry it out, then it is no longer obligatory upon the rest of them. And it is to convey the <em>da’wah </em>(call) of Islaam to the rest of the lands until they are ruled by Islaam. So whosoever contends with and obstructs the <em>da’wah</em>, then they must be fought until the obstruction is removed and the <em>da’wah </em>is allowed to continue freely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Signs of the Saved-Sect:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [1]</strong><em>al-Firqatun-Naajiyah</em> (the Saved-Sect) are few amongst the people. Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) prayed for them in the following words: “Toobaa (a tree in Paradise) is for the Strangers &#8211; the people who are righteous amongst a people who are mostly wicked, those that disobey them are more than those who obey them.” [29] And the noble <em>Qur‘aan</em> inform about them. So it says in praise of them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>But few of My Servants are grateful.</strong>” [30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [2]</strong> The Saved-Sect are abandoned by most people, who slander them and ridicule them with insulting names. So there is for them an example in the Prophets &#8211; <em>’alayhimus-salaam</em> &#8211; about whom Allaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>And so We appointed for every Prophet an enemy; devils amongst mankind and jinn, inspiring one another with flowery discourses by way of deception.</strong>” [31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) was treated in this way by his people. So when he called them to <em>Tawheed </em>they called him a sorcerer and a liar &#8211; whereas prior to this they used to call him as-Saadiq (truthful) and al-Ameen (trustworthy).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [3]</strong> Shaykh ’Abdul-’Azeez Ibn Baaz &#8211; <em>hafidhahullaah </em>&#8211; was asked about <em>al-Firqatun-Naajiyah</em> (the Saved-Sect), so he said, “They are the <em>Salafees </em>[32] and all who adhere to the path of the <em>Salafus-Saalih</em> (the Pious Predecessors).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Aided and Victorious Group:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [1]</strong> The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) said, “There will not cease to be a group from my <em>Ummah </em>victorious upon the truth, not being harmed by those who oppose them until the command of Allaah comes about, and they are like that.” [33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [2]</strong> He (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) said, “When the people of Shaam (Syria, Jordan, Palestine) become corrupt then there will be no good in you. And there will not cease to be a group from my <em>Ummah </em>being helped; those that oppose them will not harm them, until the hour is established.” [34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [3]</strong> Ibnul-Mubaarak (d.151H) &#8211; <em>rahimahullaah </em>– said, “According to me, they are <em>Ashaabul-Hadeeth </em>(the Scholars of <em>Hadeeth</em>).” [35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [4]</strong> Imaam al-Bukhaaree (d.256H) &#8211; <em>rahimahullaah </em>– said, “It means: <em>Ahlul-Hadeeth</em> (the People of <em>Hadeeth</em>).” [36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [5]</strong> Imaam Ahmad (d.241H) &#8211; <em>rahimahullaah </em>– said, “If this <em>Taa‘ifatul-Mansoorah</em> (Victorious and Aided Group) is not<em> Ashaabul-Hadeeth</em>, then I do not know who they are.” [37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Qaadee ’Iyaad (d.544H) &#8211; <em>rahimahullaah </em>– said, “What Ahmad intended was <em>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah</em>: those who hold the <em>’aqeedah </em>of<em> Ahlul-Hadeeth</em>.” [38]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [6]</strong> Indeed, <em>Ahlul-Hadeeth</em>, by virtue of their competence in the study of the <em>Sunnah</em>, are not attached to any person, but are altogether concerned with the <em>Sunnah </em>of the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>); his guidance, his manners, his battles, and whatever else pertains to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [7]</strong> Imaam ash-Shaafi’ee said, whilst addressing Imaam Ahmad, “You are more knowledgeable about <em>Hadeeth </em>than I am. So if there comes to you a <em>Hadeeth </em>that is authentic, then make me aware of it, until I accept it and accord with it &#8211; it is from Basrah.” [39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>Ahlul-Hadeeth</em> &#8211; may Allaah make us amongst them &#8211; do not have <em>ta’assub </em>(bigoted blind adherence) for the saying of any particular person, however elevated, or whatever position he holds. Rather, they cling to the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>), as opposed to those who do not ascribe themselves to <em>Ahlul-Hadeeth</em>; those who have <em>ta’assub </em>to their Imaams &#8211; who have actually prohibited them from this &#8211; just as <em>Ahlul-Hadeeth</em> readily cling to the sayings of their Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>). So it is not surprising that <em>Ahlul-Hadeeth </em>are <em>al-Firqatun-Naajiyah</em> (the Saved-Sect ) and <em>at-Taa‘ifatul-Mansoorah</em> (the Aided and Victorious Group).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [8]</strong> al-Khateeb al-Baghdaadee (d.463H) said, “And if only the people of blameworthy opinion busied themselves with beneficial knowledge, and seeking the <em>Sunnah </em>of the Messenger of the Lord of Creation, and followed the way of the <em>fuqahaa‘</em> and <em>muhaddithoon </em>&#8211; then they would find that this would be sufficient for them. And the narration would take the place of his opinion which he used to hold; since the <em>Hadeeth </em>comprehends the fundamentals of<em> Tawheed</em>, the reported Threats and the Promises, the Attributes of the Lord of Creation &#8211; who is High above the saying of the apostates, it also contains information about Paradise and Hell-Fire, and what Allaah has prepared therein for the pious and the wicked, and what Allaah has created in the earths and the heavens, and the remarkable things and great signs, and a mention of the nearest Angels &#8211; those drawn up in ranks and those who recite <em>tasbeeh</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>Hadeeth </em>comprehends stories of the about the pious ascetics and <em>Awliyaa‘</em>, wonderful admonition and sayings of the Scholars. It contains histories of the kings of the ’Arabs and non-’Arabs, and the accounts of past nations, and descriptions of the battles of the Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>); his expeditions, rulings, judgements, sermons, warnings, predictions and miracles. It also contains information about the number of his Wives and Children, his Relatives and Companions, and a mention of their excellence and merit, and a mention of their lives, their actions and their ancestry. And the <em>Hadeeth </em>contains <em>tafseer </em>of the<em> Qur‘aan</em>, information and the wise remembrance contained in it. It contains the sayings of the Companions about its preserved rulings, the different sayings they held, as well as those of the Scholars and<em> mujtahideen</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah made <em>Ahlul-Hadeeth</em> (the People of<em> Hadeeth</em>) the pillar of the <em>Sharee’ah </em>and the destroyer of every despicable innovation. So they are Allaah’s wardens amongst His creation, and the link between the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) and his<em> Ummah</em>, and the strivers to preserve His Religion. So their light shines brightly, their excellence remains, their signs are clear, their positions evident and their proofs are over-powering. And all the sects coil themselves around vain desires and prefer opinion which they cling to &#8211; except for<em> Ahlul-Hadeeth</em>, since the Book is their provision, the <em>Sunnah </em>is their proof, the Messenger their leader and to him is their ascription. They do not deviate upon vain desires, nor turn to mere conjecture. They accept what is reported from the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) and they are the trustworthy and reliable ones, who memorise the Religion and are its treasurers, its storehouses of knowledge and its bearers. If anyone differs about a <em>hadeeth</em>, then it is referred back to them. Thus, their judgement is accepted and listened to. From them is every Scholar and Imaam, and every true ascetic, and one of excellence, and precise reciter and righteous <em>Khateeb</em>. They are the Saved-Sect and their way is the straight one&#8230;” [40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah make us from amongst<em> Ahlul-Hadeeth</em>, and provide us with the ability to act upon it, love its people and to act in accordance with it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE BASIS OF RIGHT GUIDANCE</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) &#8211; <i>rahimahallaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Religion of the Muslims is built upon following the Book of Allaah, the Sunnah of His Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, and that which the Ummah has agreed upon. So these are the three infallible <i>usool</i> (fundamentals). So whatever the Ummah differs in, then it is referred back to Allaah and His Messenger. Thus, it is not for anyone to set-up a person for the Ummah, and to call to his way, and form <i>walaa</i> (love, loyalty and allegiance) and <i>&#8216;adaa</i> (enmity and hatred) based upon that, except for the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. Nor is any speech set-up for them based upon which they form <i>walaa</i> and <i>&#8216;adaa</i>, except for the speech of Allaah, and that of His Messenger, and that which the Ummah has agreed upon. Rather, this is the practice of the people of Innovation, who set-up a person, or a saying, with which they cause splits in the Ummah; forming <i>walaa</i> or<i> &#8216;adaa</i> based upon that saying or ascription.&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Taymiyyah &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; also said:<br>
&#8220;It is not for anyone to ascribe himself to a particular Shaykh and to have <i>walaa</i> with those who follow him, or to have <i>&#8216;adaa</i> based upon that. Rather, he should have <i>walaa</i> for everyone who is from the people of <i>eemaan</i> (i.e. is a Muslim) and is known to have <i>taqwaa</i> (piety and obedience to Allaah in that which He has ordered and prohibited), from the Shaykhs, or from others. No one should be particularised with an increase in <i>walaa</i> except if he sees from him greater <i>eemaan</i> and <i>taqwaa</i>. So precedence and excellence is given to whomsoever Allaah and His Messenger have given them to. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;O mankind! Indeed We created you from a man and a woman, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Indeed the most noblest of you with Allaah are those that have the most <i>taqwaa</i> (piety).&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Hujuraat 49:13].&#8221;2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>SECTARIANISM AND MISPLACED LOYALTIES</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah said:<br>
&#8220;Indeed the people of the truth and the Sunnah do not follow anyone (unconditionally) other than Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>; who does not speak from his desires, rather it is nothing less than Revelation sent down to him. So it is obligatory to affirm all that he informs, and to obey all that he commands. This status is not given to anyone else from this Ummah. Rather, every person&#8217;s saying can be taken or left, except that of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. So whoever sets up an individual other than Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, such that the one who loves and agrees with him is reckoned to be from <i>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah</i>, and the one that differs with him is reckoned to be from the people of innovations and sectarianism &#8211; as happens with those groups who follow certain Imaams of <i>kalaam</i> (theology and rhetorical speech) &#8211; then the person doing so is from the people of innovation, deviation and sectarianism.&#8221;3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; further said:<br>
&#8220;Indeed many &#8211; from the people who say such sayings &#8211; follow their desires in this, in order to elevate their egos, or to gain leadership; or whatever is connected to it. Their intention is not to make the word of Allaah uppermost, nor is it to make the Religion purely for Allaah. Indeed, they have hatred for those who oppose them &#8211; even if it is a <i>mujtahid</i> (a Scholar striving his utmost to arrive at the truth) who is excused, and whom Allaah is not angry with. Likewise, they are pleased with those who agree with them &#8211; even if it is an ignorant person with evil intentions, who neither has any knowledge, nor good intent. This leads them to praise those whom Allaah and His Messenger have not praised, and to censure those whom Allaah and His Messenger have not censured. It also causes them to have <i>walaa</i> (love and allegiance) and <i>&#8216;adaa</i> (enmity and hatred) based upon their own self-desires, not upon the Religion of Allaah and His Messenger &#8230; So whosoever does this will only bring about <i>fitan</i> (trials and discord) between the people.&#8221;4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>PRESERVING THE LOVE AND UNITY</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez bin Baaz &#8211; <i>hafidhahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Religion of Allaah orders to judge (with justice) in all matters, and not to have <i>walaa</i> (love, loyalty and allegiance) with your brother merely because he agrees with you, or to have <i>&#8216;adaa</i> (enmity and being distant) from him merely because he disagrees with you on a certain opinion or issue. This is not from justice at all! The Companions &#8211; <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhum</i> &#8211; differed in various issues, yet this did not affect the happiness and sincerity between them, nor their <i>walaa</i> and love for each other &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with them all. So the Believer acts upon the <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i> (Prescribed and Divine Islaamic Law) of Allaah, follows the truth, gives priority to the evidences before anyone &#8211; yet in doing so, he does not oppress his brother, nor negate doing justice to him when he differs regarding any issue of <i>ijtihaad</i> in which the evidences are not so apparent. Likewise is the case for those issues in which differences occur due to a different interpretation of the text. So, in such instances he is excused, and it is upon you to sincerely advice him, and to love only the good for him, and not to split-up, nor to have enmity and hatred between you and your brother &#8211; and there is no might, nor any power, except with Allaah. &#8220;5</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">TAMAAM-UL-MINNAH’<br>
Translated by Dawud Burbank (rahimahullaah)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many writers – especially in the present age – despite their differing madhabs and specialities – are in the habit of quoting Ahaadeeth attributed to the Prophet (s.a.w.s) – without declaring those which are weak there from, out of ignorance of the Sunnah, or desiring that, or being too lazy to refer back to the books of the experts in that field – and some of those experts are lenient in that about narrating Ahaadeeth about excellent actions. Aboo Shaamah said [‘al-Baa’ith ‘alaa Inkaar il-Bida’ wal-Hawaadith’ p.54] :<strong>&#8221; And this is with the verifiers of the scholars of Ahaadeeth and with the scholars of Usool and Fiqh a mistake, rather they should make its status clear if known – and if not then that will fall under the threat in his (s.a.w.s) saying : &#8221; He who narrates from me a saying which he thinks is a lie, then he is one of them. &#8221; Reported by Muslim. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the ruling for one who remains silent about weak Ahaadeeth concerning excellent actions!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then how about that which concerns rulings and its like?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And know that this done by one of two men : &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) Either he knows the weakness of those Ahaadeeth and he does not indicate their weakness – then he does not indicate their weakness – then he is one who deceives the Muslims, definitely entering under the aforementioned threat – as Ibn Hibbaan says in his book ‘Ad-Du’afaa’ (1/7-8).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; In this narration is a proof that if the Muhaddith narrates something which is not         authentic from the Prophet (s.a.w.s) from what is attributed to him incorrectly and he knows that – then he is like one of the liars – and the text of the narration is even stronger than that, he (s.a.w.s) said : <strong> &#8221; He who narrates Ahaadeeth form me and he thinks it is a lie.. &#8220;</strong>and he did not say : <strong> &#8221; Which he is sure is a lie&#8221;,</strong> so everyone who doubts about what he narrates whether it is authentic or not – then he falls under the address of that narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Ibn ‘Abdul-Haadee quotes this in ‘as-saamirul-munkee’ (p.165-166) and agrees to it, or that he does not know that is it weak &#8211; and he is also sinful due to his taking it upon himself to attribute it to the Prophet (s.a.w.s) without knowledge, and he (s.a.w.s) said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8221; It is enough falsehood for a person that he narrates everything which he hears&#8221; [Reported by Muslim in the introduction of his ‘saheeh’ see ‘as-saheehah, no. 205]. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he has his share of the sin lying upon the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.s), since he (s.a.w.s) indicated that he who narrates everything which he hears &#8211; and like him is the one who writes is – falls for certain into lying upon him – and therefore he is one of the liars. Firstly – the one who invented it,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and secondly this one who spread it! And Ibn Hibbaan also said (1/9) :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8221; And this narration contains a strong warning against a person’s narrating everything which he hears until he knows for certain that it is authentic.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And an-Nawawee clearly states that the one who does not know whether Ahaadeeth is weak or not then it is not permissible for him to use it as a proof without researching and checking it if he knows how – or by asking the people of knowledge if he does not know. And refer to the preface of ‘ad-Da’eefah’ (pp.10-12 ).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>KNOWING THE STRAIGHT PATH</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullaah ibn Mas&#8217;ood <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> said:<br>
<i>The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam drew a line for us and said. &#8220;This is Allaah&#8217;s Straight Path.&#8221; Then he drew lines to its right and left and then said. &#8220;These ore other paths. Upon every one of them there is a devil calling towards it.&#8221; Then he recited:</i> <b>&#8220;Indeed this is My Straight Path, so follow it, and do not follow other paths that will separate you from His Path.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:153].&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, that which is necessary for the Muslims &#8211; both individuals and groups in order to prepare for the mighty task and to achieve the lofty goal, is to truly know the Straight Path, its People, their <i>&#8216;aqeedah</i> (belief) and their <i>manhaj</i> (methodology), knowing also the innovations and evils which cause one to separate from this way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The wisdom in learning about the evil is taken from the hadeeth of Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamaan radiallaahu &#8216;anhu where he said. &#8220;The people used to ask the Messenger of Allaah <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> about the good, but I used to ask him about the evil for fear that it would overtake me &#8230;&#8221;2 And may Allaah have mercy upon the one who said in poetic wisdom:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I learnt what was evil, not for itself, but to avoid it. He who does not know evil from good, falls into it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>CLINGING TO THE ORIGINAL STATE OF AFFAIRS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul-&#8216;Aaliyah (d.90H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; who said:<br>
&#8220;Learn Islaam. Then when you have learnt Islaam, do not turn away from it to the right nor the left. But be upon the Straight Path and upon the Sunnah of your Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and that which his Companions were upon &#8230; and beware of these innovations because they cause enmity and hatred amongst you. But stick to the original state of affairs which was there before they divided.&#8221; So &#8216;Aasim said: I related this to al-Hasan al-Basree so he said. &#8220;He has given you sincere advice and has told you the truth.&#8221;3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is known that this original state of affairs, had as its pure and sweet spring, the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah, built upon the understanding of the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> (the Pious Predecessors) &#8211; the Companions, the <i>Taabi&#8217;een</i> and those that followed them &#8211; about whom the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said. <i>&#8220;The best of mankind is my generation, then those who follow them, then those who follow them.&#8221;</i>4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Aaishah <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhaa</i> said:<br>
A man come to the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and said. Who is the most excellent of mankind? So the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;The generation of those that I am in, then the second, then the third.&#8221;</i>5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this principle &#8211; the obligation of adhering to the Qur&#8217;aan and the authentic Sunnah upon the understanding of the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> &#8211; is the cornerstone principle of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Abu Haneefah (d.150H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br>
&#8220;Stick to the narrations and the way of the Salaf and beware of newly invented matters, for all of it is innovation.&#8221;6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Awzaa&#8217;ee (d.157H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said.<br>
&#8220;Patiently restrict yourself to the Sunnah and pause where the people paused, say what they said and avoid what they avoided. Take to the path of your Salafus-Saalih, for indeed, what was sufficient for them, is sufficient for you.&#8221;7</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal (d.241H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br>
&#8220;The fundamentals of the Sunnah with us are: Clinging to that which the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> were upon, taking them as our examples to be followed; avoiding innovations, for every innovation is misguidance.&#8221;8</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abdul-Haadee (d.748H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br>
&#8220;It is not permissible to invent on interpretation about a verse or a Sunnah which was not there in the time of the Salaf (the Pious Predecessors), nor did they have any knowledge concerning it, nor explain it to the Ummah. Since this would imply that the Salaf were ignorant of the truth in this matter and failed to reach it. Whereas the late-coming opponent is somehow guided to the truth!&#8221;9</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim (d.751H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br>
&#8220;Inventing on explanation with regards to the Book of Allaah &#8211; which the Salaf and the Scholars are in opposition to &#8211; necessitates one of two things: Either the explanation itself is a mistake. Or that the sayings of the Salaf &#8211; which differs with such a saying &#8211; are in error! And no one who possess even an ounce of intellect would doubt that the one whose saying is in opposition to that of the Salaf, then he is the one who is in error.&#8221;10</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>SOFTENING THE HEARTS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Along with seeking to understand the correct Islaamic <i>&#8216;aqeedah</i> (beliefs) and <i>fiqh</i> (jurisprudence), <i>tafseer</i> (Qur&#8217;aanic explanation), and <i>hadeeth</i>, on essential part of the way of the Salaf includes understanding matters relating to <i>aadaab</i> and <i>akhlaaq</i> (manners and etiquettes) and <i>tazkiyatun-nufoos</i> (purification of the souls) and reflecting upon the lives of the Salafus-Saaliheen. Since this &#8211; it is hoped &#8211; will enable hearts to cultivate mildness and humility in the worship of Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; and also strengthen the determination to strive to making His Religion uppermost in the hearts of the people and upon the face of this earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn al-Jawzee (d.597H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br>
&#8220;I feel that occupying oneself with jurisprudence and acquiring the narrations is hardly enough to correct the heart, unless he adds to that the study of <i>raqaa&#8217;iq</i> (heart-melting narrations) and the study of the lives of the Salaf us-Saaliheen (the Pious Predecessors). Since they attained what is desirous from the narrations and took from the outer actions what is ordered and what is wanted from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I do not inform you of this except after personal trial and experience. Since I have found that the majority of the narrators and the students of Hadeeth are concerned chiefly with attaining the briefest <i>isnaad</i> (chain of narration) and increase in the number of narrations. And the majority of the Jurisprudents are concerned with dialectics and how to win arguments. So how can the hearts be softened with these things? Previously a group of the Salaf would visit a pious servant to see his conduct and manners, not to take from his knowledge. This was because the fruit of his knowledge was his manners and conduct, so understand this. Thus, along with the study of <i>fiqh</i> and Hadeeth, study the lives of the Salaf and those who were <i>zaahid</i> (abstainers) with regards to the world, so that this may be a cause of softness in your hearts.&#8221;11</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yoonus ibn &#8216;Ubayd (d.139H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> -said:<br>
&#8220;With good manners you understand the knowledge. With the knowledge your actions are corrected. With actions wisdom is obtained. With wisdom you understand <i>zuhd</i> (abstinence) and are granted its benefits. With <i>zuhd</i> comes abandoning the world. With abandoning the world comes desire for the Hereafter. With desire for the Hereafter the pleasure of Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; is obtained.&#8221;12</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE FOUNDATIONS FOR UNITY</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said:<br>
<i>&#8220;This knowledge will be carried by the trustworthy ones of every generation. They will expel from it the alteration made by those going beyond bounds; the false claims of the liars and the false interpretations of the ignorant ones.&#8221;</i>13</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is our hope in Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect- that He adorns us with the correct knowledge bequeathed to us by our Salafus-Saalih, and that He aids us in learning their <i>&#8216;aqeedah</i>, so that hearts may embrace it; learning their <i>manhaj</i>, so that people may follow it and learning also their manners and behaviour, so that souls may be cultivated upon it, seeking to convey this to others with the wisdom, patience and forebearance that this pure and sublime message demands. So herein lies the excellence and of the one who reaches it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Rajab (d.795H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br>
&#8220;So the beneficial knowledge from amongst all the types of knowledge is to take possession of the texts of the Book and the Sunnah and to understand their meanings, and to limit oneself in that to what is reported from the Companions, the <i>Taabi&#8217;een</i> and their Successors &#8211; with regards to the meaning of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Hadeeth, and what is reported from them as regard to the <i>halaal</i> (lawful) and <i>haraam</i> (prohibited), and <i>zuhd</i>, <i>raqaa&#8217;iq</i>, the accounts (of previous nations and Prophets), and other than that. Striving firstly, to distinguish what is authentic and what is weak; and then secondly, striving to understand and comprehend it. And there is enough in that for the intelligent one, and enough to occupy one who busies himself with beneficial knowledge. And he who stops at that and makes his intention purely for the Face of Allaah and seeks His help &#8211; then Allaah will help him, guide him and grant him success, satisfaction, understanding and inspiration. Then such a person will take the benefits of this knowledge &#8211; which ore found through it alone &#8211; and that is fear of Allaah, as Allaah &#8211; the Exalted and Majestic &#8211; says: <b>&#8220;Indeed, it is only those who have knowledge, amongst His slaves, that truly tear Allaah.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Faatir 35:10].&#8221;14</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Awaa&#8217;ee (d.157H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br>
&#8220;Hold fast to the narrations of the Salaf, even if people were to abandon you. And beware of the opinions of the people, no matter how much they beautify it with their speech.&#8221;15</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan al-Basree (d.110H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br>
&#8220;If there was a man who reached the first Salaf, then he (this man) was raised up today, he would not recognise anything of Islaam.&#8221; The narrator said: Al-Hasan put his hand on his cheek and said. &#8220;Except for this Prayer.&#8221; Then he said. &#8220;So &#8211; by Allaah &#8211; how is it for the one who lives in this bad time, not having reached the Salafus-Saalih. So he sees on innovator calling to his innovation, and a worldly person calling to the world, but Allaah protects him from that and makes his heart lean towards those Salafus-Saalih, asking about their way, seeking their narrations and following their path. Allaah will recompense him with a greet reward. So be like that &#8211; if Allaah wills.&#8221;16</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Compiled by The Eminent Shaykh, the Muhaddith, Rabee’ ibn Haadee al-Madkhalee<br>
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the place which is enlightened by the Book and the Sunnah in the Islaamic world is the place of the People of Hadeeth, as-Salafiyoon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the place which is darkened in the Islaamic world is the place of the People of Bida’ and misguidance, those who oppose the people of Hadeeth and wage war against them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the present day political groups – who have among them Ikhwaan Muslimoon and their likes – and the deviant sects – who have among them Jamaat Tabligh – want this darkness to remain in dominance over the Islaamic world and to cover it, they do not even move against it. They have no intention of eliminating it and they have no Manhaj (methodology) to direct them to its removal or to establish Tawheed and the light of the Book and the Sunnah, taking its place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they guard this darkness &#8211; especially the darkness of the Rafidah and Soofeeyah- with the justification that they are combating the enemies of Islaam, although they definitely do not do this. Their justification is that they say, ‘We cooperate in what we agree upon and overlook what we differ upon,’ which they justify further with their claim that they gather the Muslims together along with the Rawafidah and the extreme Soofees in order to confront the enemies of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, they wage war against the people of Hadeeth, placing different obstacles and hindrances in front of them which then prevent the people from being enlightened by that which the People of Hadeeth have of the light of Tawheed and the light of the Book, the Sunnah and the Manhaj of the Salaf-as-Saalih.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How long will the defence of this darkness subjected upon the Ummah continue?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When will the Muslims see this light?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qayyim -Rahimullaah- said, quoting as-Samaanee -Rahimullaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Every sect from the people of Bida’ claims that they adhere to the Sharia’ of Islaam and that the truth the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- established is what they believe in and profess. However, Allah has denied them that as the truth and correct ‘Aqeedah will only be with the People of Hadeeth and Athaar because they successively took their Deen and beliefs with from those who preceded them, generation by generation, until they reached the Tabi’een.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Tabi’een took it from the Companions of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam and the Companions took it from the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no way of knowing what the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- called the people to, of the straight path, except by way of what the People of Hadeeth followed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What shows that the People of Hadeeth are upon the truth is that if you were to research all the books authored by them, from the first to the last, the oldest to the newest, you would find &#8211; despite the fact that they are from different countries and time periods with vast distances between their lands, each of them living in their own regions- that in the matter of belief they are on one path, they flow in one direction following that path and they do not diverge from it, nor do they deviate from it. Their hearts are one heart; you do not see any differing in what they narrated nor any divisions or differing in any issue, no matter how small it may be.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, if everything they uttered with their tongues and what they narrated from the Salaf were gathered you would find it as though it had come from one heart and spoken by one tongue. So is there any evidence clearer than this to show the truth?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Do they not then consider the Qur’aan carefully? Had it been from other than Allaah, they would surely have found therein much contradiction. &gt;&gt; [Nisa:82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And hold fast, all of you together, to the Rope of Allaah (i.e. this Qur’aan), and be not divided among yourselves, and remember Allaah’s Favour on you, for you were enemies one to another but He joined your hearts together, so that, by His Grace, you became brethren (in Islaamic Faith)&gt;&gt; [Aali-Imraan: 103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason that the people of Hadeeth are united is because they take their Deen and method of narration from the Book and the Sunnah and so, they inherit unity and harmony.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of Bida’ took the Deen from their intellects so they inherited separation and differences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed conveying and narrating from trustworthy, precise narrators ensures that differences are rare and if there were a difference it would be in a single word or the wording of a narration. This differing does not harm the Deen, not does it belittle it. As for following intellects and desires, ideas and opinions, they rarely bring unity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have seen that the Companions of Hadeeth, past and present, are those who travelled for these Aathaar. They sought them and took from their sources, they memorized them and became delighted by them, they called to following these narrations and they rebuked those who opposed them. They had numerous narrations between them such that they became famous due to them, just as a craftsman becomes famous because of his skill and what he produces.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then we saw a people who became disconnected from their memorization and knowledge and deviated from following the well-known, authentic narrations. They absolved themselves from the companionship of its people and attacked the narrations and their people. These people abandoned the rights due to this knowledge, they ascribed evil examples to it and to the people of hadeeth, giving them the vilest of descriptions. So, they called them Nawasib (haters of the family of the Prophet), Mushabiha (those who compare Allaah to the creation), Hashaweeyah (those who busy themselves with things of no benefit) or Mujjassama (those who ascribe a physical body to Allaah). So we came to know, from the correct proofs and supporting evidences, that the people of hadeeth have more right to it (i.e. the knowledge of hadeeth/narrations) than the rest of the sects.’ [Mukhtasir as-Sawaaiq pg 423-429]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The new opponents of the People of Hadeeth continually repeat the attacks that the communist, laymen and Baaith party (a political party with strong socialist tendencies) use against their opponents from amongst the Muslims and other than them, attacking with such statements as, ‘they are spies,’ ‘working for America,’ ‘ scholars of the royal courts’ or ‘scholars who want meals.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah for guidance that everyone returns to the truth, turning away from falsehood and departing from the darkness of Bida’.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><em> Shaykh Muhammad Nasir Uddin al-Albani / </em><em> Source: Al-Asaalah, Issue 9 </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why use the name Salafee? Is it a call towards a party or a group or a madh-hab (school of thought)? Or is it a new sect in Islaam ?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, the word Salaf is well known in the Arabic language as well as in the religious terminology. But what concerns us here, is its discussion from the religious standpoint. Thus, it has authentically been reported on the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, that during the sickness from which he died from, he said to Faatimah, radyAllaahu &#8216;anhaa: <strong> &#8220;…So fear Allaah and have patience. And I am the best Salaf (predecessor) for you.&#8221;</strong> 20</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the scholars have used this word “Salaf” many times, such that it would be too abundant to number and take into account. Sufficient for us, is one example, and it was that which they have used in their battle against innovations: <em> &#8220;And every good lies in following he who has preceded (man salaf) while every evil lies in the innovating of he who came after (man khalaf).&#8221; </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>  </em>However, there are from those who claim to have knowledge, some people who reject this ascription, claiming that there is no basis for it! And so they say: &#8220;It is not permissible for a Muslim to say: &#8216;I am Salafee.&#8217;” So it is as if he is saying that it is not permissible for a Muslim to say: &#8220;I am following the <em> Salaf As-Saalih </em> (the Pious Predecessors) in what they were upon from beliefs, worship and methodology&#8221;! There is no doubt that such a rejection – if that is what he intended – necessitates that one free himself from the correct Islaam, which the righteous predecessors were upon, at the head of whom was the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216; alayhi wa sallam. This is as is indicated in the <em> mutawaatir </em> hadeeth found in the two <em> Saheehs </em> and other than them, that he, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, said: <strong> &#8220;The best of mankind is my generation, then those that come after them, then those that come after them.&#8221; </strong> So it is not permissible for a Muslim to absolve himself from this ascription to the righteous predecessors, whereas, if he were to absolve himself from any other ascription, the scholars would not be able to ascribe him with disbelief or sinfulness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who rejects this name from himself, will you not see him ascribing himself to one of the <em> madh-hab</em> s?! Regardless of whether this <em> madh-hab </em> is related to &#8216;Aqeedah (Creed) or Fiqh (Jurisprudence)? So he is either Ash&#8217;aree or Matureedee. Or perhaps he is from the people of Hadeeth or Hanafee, or Shaafi&#8217;ee or Maalikee or Hanbalee or whatever else enters into the title of &#8220;Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah.&#8221; But in spite of this, the one who ascribes himself to the Ash&#8217;aree <em> madh-hab </em> or to one of the four <em> madh-habs </em> is in fact ascribing himself to individuals that are not infallible, without a doubt, even if there were scholars among them who were correct (in their verdicts). I wish I knew – why doesn&#8217;t he reject the likes of these ascriptions to individuals who are not free from error? But as for the one who ascribes himself to the <em> Salaf As-Saalih </em> (righteous predecessors), then he indeed ascribes himself to infallibility <em> (&#8216;isma</em> h), in the general sense. The Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, has mentioned that one of the signs of the Saved Sect is that they will cling tightly onto what the Messenger of Allaah, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, was upon and what his Companions were upon. So whosoever holds tightly onto them, then he is certainly upon the guidance from his Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And furthermore, it is an ascription that brings honor to the one that ascribes himself to it, and one that facilitates for him the way of the Saved Sect. And these matters do not apply to anyone that ascribes himself to any other ascription, since they are not free from one of two things. Either it is an ascription to a specific individual that is not infallible or it is an ascription to a group of people who follow the methodology of this individual who is not infallible. So there is no infallibility (in their ascriptions) either way. On the opposite of this, there is the infallibility of the Companions of the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, (as a whole). And it is that which we have been commanded to hold tightly onto, from his Sunnah and the Sunnah of his Companions after him. And we must persist and strongly emphasize that our understanding of Allaah&#8217;s Book and the Sunnah of His Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, must be in accordance with the methodology of his, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, Companions. This is so that we can be upon infallibility, as opposed to inclining away towards the right or the left, or deviating with an understanding that comes solely from ourselves, of which there is not found in the Book of Allaah or the Sunnah of His Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, that which provides evidence for it. Furthermore, why is it not sufficient for us to ascribe ourselves to (just) the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah? The reason goes back to two matters, the first of which is related to <strong> the religious texts </strong> , and the second of which is due to <strong> the existence of numerous Islaamic groups </strong> .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to the first reason, then we find in the religious texts, a command to obey something else in connection with the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah, as is found in Allaah&#8217;s saying: <strong> &#8220;O you who believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger and those in authority amongst you.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>  </strong>So if there were someone in authority, who was given the oath of allegiance by the Muslims, it would be obligatory to obey him just as it would be obligatory to obey the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah. So even if he or those around him commit errors, it would be obligatory to obey him in order to repel the harm of differences of opinions. But this is with the well-known condition: <strong> &#8220;There is no obedience to a creation (if it involves) disobeying the Creator.&#8221;</strong> 21</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, may He be Exalted, says: <strong> &#8220;And whosoever opposes the Messenger after the guidance has been clearly explained to him, and follows a way other than the Way of the Believers, We will turn him to what he has chosen </strong><strong>and burn him in Hell – what an evil destination.&#8221; </strong> [Surah An-Nisaa: 115]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, Allaah, Mighty and Sublime, is free and far removed from all imperfections and defects. And there is no doubt or uncertainty that His mentioning of <strong> &#8220;the Way of the Believers&#8221; </strong> here, is only due to an immense and comprehensive wisdom and benefit. So it indicates that there is an important obligation – and it is that our following of the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, <strong><em> must be </em></strong> in accordance with what the first Muslims were upon. And they are the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, then those who came after them, then those who came after them. And this is what the <em> da&#8217;wat-us-salafiyyah </em> (The Salafee Call) invites and calls to. And it is that which is its main priority in the foundation of its call and the methodology of its educating process.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, the Salafee Call truly unites the ummah, while any other call only causes division to the ummah. Allaah, Mighty and Sublime, says: <strong> &#8220;O you who believe, fear Allaah, and be with the truthful.&#8221; </strong> [Surah At-Tawbah: 119]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So anyone that distinguishes between the Book and the Sunnah on one side and the <em> Salaf As-Saalih </em> (Righteous Predecessors) on the other side, then he can never be truthful. As for with regard to the second reason, then the groups and parties of today do not direct at all towards the following of <strong> “the Way of the Believers </strong> ”, which has been mentioned in the ayah. And there are some ahaadeeth, which further confirm and support that ayah, such as the hadeeth of the seventy-three sects. All of them will be in the Hellfire except one. The Messenger of Allaah, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, described them as: <strong> &#8220;The one which is upon the same thing that I and my companions are upon today.&#8221;</strong> 22</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth resembles that ayah which mentions the <strong> “Way of the Believers</strong> ”. Also, there is the hadeeth of Al-&#8216;Irbaad Ibn Saariyah, radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu, in which he, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, said: <strong> &#8220;So stick to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly-guided Khaleefahs after me.&#8221; </strong> 23</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, there are two Sunnahs: The Sunnah of the Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, and the Sunnah of the righteous Khaleefahs. So there is no doubt that we – who come in a later time – must return back to the Qur&#8217;aan, the Sunnah and <strong> &#8220;the Way of the Believers.&#8221; </strong> And it is not permissible for us to say: &#8220;We can understand the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah by themselves, without turning towards what the righteous predecessors were upon.&#8221; And there must be an ascription in this time that distinguishes and is detailed. So it is not sufficient for us to say, &#8220;I am a Muslim&#8221; only! Or &#8220;My <em> madh-hab </em> is Islaam&#8221;! For every sect says that! – the Raafidee, the Ibaadee, the Qadyianee, as well as other sectarians!! So what is it that distinguishes you from them?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if you were to say, &#8220;I am a Muslim who is upon the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah&#8221;, this would also not be sufficient. This is because, the members of these sects – of the Ash&#8217;arees and the Matureedees and the Hizbees – they all claim to follow these two sources also. So there is no doubt that the clear, plain, distinctive and decisive classification is to say, &#8220;I am a Muslim who is upon the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah and upon the methodology of the <em> Salaf As-Saalih </em> (Pious Predecessors). And that can be said in short by saying, &#8220;I am a Salafee.&#8221; So based on this, indeed the truth which is unavoidable, is that it is not enough to rely on the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah without the methodology of the <em> Sala</em> f, for it explains these two with regard to understanding and concept, knowledge and action, and da&#8217;wah (calling) and Jihaad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we know that they (the Sahaabah), may Allaah be pleased with them, did not used to fanatically cling onto one specific <em> madh-hab </em> or to one specific individual. So there was not found amongst them he who was Bakree (a follower of Abu Bakr), or &#8216;Umaree (a follower of &#8216;Umar), or &#8216;Uthmaanee (a follower of &#8216;Uthmaan) or &#8216;Alawee (a follower of &#8216;Alee). Rather, if it were more easy for one of them to ask Abu Bakr or &#8216;Umar or Abu Hurairah, he would ask any of them. This is because they believed that it was not permissible to have total and unrestricted devotion in following, except to one individual. Indeed, he was the Messenger of Allaah sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, the one who did not speak from his own desire, rather it was only revelation revealed to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if we were to submit to these criticizers, for the sake of argument, that we would name ourselves &#8220;Muslims&#8221; only, without ascribing ourselves to the <em> Salaf </em> – in spite of it being an honorable and correct ascription. Would they abandon classifying themselves with the names of their parties or their <em> madh-habs </em> or their ways – based on the fact that they are not prescribed in the Religion nor are they correct? <em> &#8220;So this contrast between us is enough for you And every container becomes wet due to what is in it.&#8221;</em> And Allaah is the Guide to the Right Path. And He, free is He from all defects, is the One in whom we seek assistance.</p>
