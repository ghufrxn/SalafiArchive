		<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 14 : Point 12</strong><br>
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And no one says regarding the Attributes of the Lord, the Most High, “How?” and “Why?” except for one who doubts about Allaah, the Exalted and Most High.</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/no-one-says-regarding-the-attributes-of-allahhow-why-except-for-one-who-doubts-about-allaah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The kayfiyya (how) is not to be asked about. And the reason why He said such and such, is not to be asked about. Rather one should submit to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, because no one knows the how except for Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee hafizahullaah said regarding this point, “No one will say, ‘Why (is that)?’ with regard to Allaah’s Attributes except one who doubts about the Attributes of Allaah, the Most High. A person who is always afflicted with ‘Why (is this)?’ and ‘How (is that)?’ and this saying comes out upon the slips of his tongue, this person is in danger. Indeed he is at the limit of danger. And for this reason the Companions, when revelation came down to them, they believed in it with certainty and they attested to it. And they did not ask ‘Why is this?’ and ‘How (is that)?’ Rather they submitted to everything which Allaah informed of open heartedly and accepting it fully. So therefore they did not ask ‘Why?’ and ‘How?’”</p>

		<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 14 : Point 11 (Part B)</strong><br>
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And know, may Allaah have mercy upon you, that speculative speech, kalaam, about the Lord, the Most High, is a newly introduced matter and it is an innovation and misguidance. Nothing is to be said about the Lord except what He, the Mighty and Majestic, described Himself with in the Qur·aan and what the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam explained to his Companions. So He, the Majestic in Renown, is One.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">There is nothing like Him; and He is The All Hearing The All Seeing.</span> (Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Our Lord is the First without any beginning, and the Last without any end. He knows whatever is secret and whatever is most hidden. He has ascended over His Throne, and His Knowledge is in every place. And no place is free of His Knowledge.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>[In this <strong>Part B</strong> audio, the last paragraph in the above point is covered. You can Listen to <a style="color:#808080;" href="../../../../2017/12/02/speculative-speech-kalaam-about-allaah-is-an-innovation-and-misguidance/index.htm"><strong>Point 11 (Part A)</strong></a>]</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/our-lord-is-the-first-without-any-beginning-and-the-last-without-any-end" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Our Lord is The First, without any ‘when’. And He is The Last, without any end.”</strong> Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, is The First without any beginning and The Last without any end. He, the Most High, said</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He (Allaah) is The First and The Last and The Uppermost and The One who is Closest</strong></span> (Sooratul-Hadeed (57), aayah 3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are names which are opposites. ‘The First’ (Al-Owwal) is opposite to ‘The Last’ (Al-Aakhir). ‘The Uppermost’ (Az-Zaahir) is opposite to ‘The Closest’ (AlBaatin). And the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam explained this aayah in his saying: You are The First, and there is nothing before You. And You are The Last, so there is nothing after You. And You are The Uppermost One, so there is nothing above You. And You are The Closest One, so there is nothing closer than You. [01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the explanation of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. But then there came those people who explained it with other than the explanation of the Messenger (sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) who say, “Az-Zaahir means ‘one who became apparent to the intellects’ and ‘who became apparent through clear proofs’, and it does not mean that He is above the created beings or that He is above the Throne!” So this is false and futile, contrary to the explanation of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. The one from the people who knows best about Allaah is Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. And he has explained this aayah with a clear explanation, that ‘The First One’ means the One whom there is nothing before Him: “The First with no beginning.” And ‘The Last one’ He is the One whom there is nothing after Him: “The Last with no end.” And “The Uppermost” is the One whom there is nothing above Him. He is above all created beings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He is The Invincible Subduer above His servants. And He is The All Wise, The All Aware.</strong></span> (Sooratul-An`aam (6), aayah 18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And (Allaah) He is the Invincible Subduer above His servants. And He sends down guardians over you. (Sooratul-An`aam (6), aayah 61)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He has exaltedness (being above and exalted) with regard to His Self (Thaat). And He has exaltedness of Status (Qadr). And He has exaltedness in Supremacy (Qahr). <strong>“And You are The One who is Closest so there is nothing closer than you&#8230;”</strong> meaning that He knows everything. Nothing at all is hidden from Him. So He, along with the fact that He is above His created beings, then along with this, nothing is hidden from Him, from the innermost secrets and what their chests conceal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Nothing whatever is hidden from Allaah, in the earth nor in the heavens</strong> </span>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), aayah 5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then people come who say, “Allaah the Majestic and Most High is not above and He is not beneath, and He is not to the right and He is not to the left, and He is not inside the Universe and He is not outside the Universe.” The meaning of this would be that He does not exist as occurs in the books of the people of kalaam (people of theological rhetoric).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“He knows what is secret and what is most hidden. And He is ascended upon His Throne.”</strong> So His knowing whatever is upon the earth and whatever is beneath the earth and whatever is under the soil, this does not contradict His being above His Throne. Because Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, encompasses everything and nothing encompasses Him, He the Perfect and Most High. And the whole of the creation in comparison to Him is just tiny, like nothing at all. And He is Al-`Azeem, The Tremendously Great One; Al-Kabeer, The Incomparably Great One; Al-Muta`aal, The Supreme and Exalted One; Al-Jaleel, The Majestic and Supreme &#8211; He the Perfect and Most High. So we do not make analogy between Him and ourselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They have not given Allaah the respect and honour which is due to Him, and the whole earth will be grasped by Him on the Day of Resurrection, and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand. Perfect and Exalted is He and far removed from that which they associate with Him</strong></span>. (Sooratuz-Zumar (39), aayah 67)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All the created things are, in relation to Him, like nothing. Even if they are very great in the eyes of the people, but with respect to Him they are like nothing. (They are nothing) before His Tremendousness, He the Perfect and Most High. People, they do not give the honour and respect to Allaah that is His due when they deny His Ability and His Greatness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O mankind, a similitude has been struck for you so listen to it. Those whom you call upon besides Allaah could never create even a fly, even if they gathered together to do it. And if the fly were to take something from them (those idols) they cannot rescue it from it. Weak is the seeker and the one sought.2 They do not give Allaah His due honour and respect.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Hajj (22), aayahs 73-74)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They do not recognise the Tremendousness of Allaah and His Ability and His Supremeness and His Knowledge. So therefore they draw analogy between Him and themselves. Therefore they belittle Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. If you people, all of you together, from the first of you to the last of you, all the jinn and all mankind, were to gather together to create a fly, the smallest thing, they would not be able to do so. Particularly whom they call upon besides Allaah, from those objects of worship and those false lords.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They could never create a fly even if they all gathered together to do it. If the most proficient doctors gathered, and the cleverest people in the world and the craftsmen and the inventors, and you were to say to them, “Produce a fly for us,” they would not be able to do it &#8211; even though they are able to build huge ocean liners which contain airstrips and carry aeroplanes, and they can build huge aeroplanes. They are able to build these things. As for creating a fly and putting life into it, then they are not able to do it. They can draw a picture of a fly and of a person and of wild animals and the like, but they are not able to make any such thing walk and talk. They can just draw it with its details only. As for breathing life into it, then this is from the command of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. So therefore how can analogy be made between the Creator, the Majestic and Most High, and the creation. He is not reached by the intellects and people’s thoughts, and He cannot be imagined by their thinking, He the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“He knows whatever is secret and whatever is most hidden. And He is ascended over His throne.”</strong> His being ascended over His Throne does not contradict His knowing whatever is hidden and whatever is most secret. So it may not be said that because He has ascended over His throne He is therefore distant from the people and He does not hear and does not see therefore, for this is claiming tashbeeh, that there is likeness between the Lord and the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, all things are the same to Him. Nothing is hidden from Him, He the Perfect and Most High; something close or something far, the first of the creation and the last of them, this world or the Hereafter. All of it is within the Knowledge of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. And therefore this gigantic creation is caused to proceed by Him, He the Perfect, and by His Ability and His Will and His Creating.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah holds the heavens and the earth, so that they do not move away. And if they were to move away, then no one besides Him, could hold them. Indeed He is Forbearing and He forgives extensively</span> </strong>(Soorah Faatir(35), aayah 41)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The orbit of the stars, the Sun and the Moon in its precise calculated manner which does not alter and does not err and does not slip, who is the One who ordered it with this arrangement? He is Allaah the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Moon and the stars proceed in an orderly manner until Allaah wishes the end of this world and moving on to the Hereafter. The One who ordered it is All Wise and All Knowing, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if you were to reflect upon this creation, then you would realise the greatness of Allaah the Perfect and Most High. So when the people see a precise machine they marvel at this skill, and at its maker, but it is a small thing; then how about this whole creation which does not fail. Who causes it to persist and who preserves it? Who is the One who preserves this creation, all of it, so that it does not alter and does not fail and does not miss out on anything? He is Allaah, the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these created things, the small ones and the large ones, who brings provision to them? Huge created things, who is the One who produced provision for them, for each one in accordance with its own condition? He is Allaah, the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is obligatory is that we should submit to that which came from Allaah, because He knows best about Himself, and that we submit to what came from Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam because the Messenger is the one from the creation who knows best about his Lord, He the Perfect and Most High; and that we do not raise objections and we do not interfere with our intellects and our own thinking. So there is no contradiction between the fact that “He knows whatever is secret and whatever is most hidden” and “He is ascended over His throne.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His Saying,<strong> “And His knowledge is in every place. And no place is free of His knowledge.”</strong> His knowledge is in every place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Nothing whatever is hidden from Allaah, in the earth nor in the heavens.</strong> </span>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), aayah 5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (Allaah) knows whatever is in the land and in the sea. And no leaf falls except that He knows it. And there is no grain in the darkest depths of the earth, nor anything fresh, nor anything dry, except that it is written in a clear book. (Sooratul-An`aam (6), aayah 59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (Allaah) is the One who takes your souls by night. Meaning in sleep.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He knows whatever you do&#8230;<br>
Meaning ‘whatever (deeds) you earn’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8230;in the day. Then He raises you up in it.</strong></span> (Sooratul-An`aam (6), aayah 60)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning you get up from sleep. Who caused you to sleep in the first place? And who is it that causes you to wake up? He is Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. So if you were to think about this creation, then this would lead you to realize the Greatness of Allaah and you would submit to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic; if you were to reflect upon the speech of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and what he informed about with regard to events of the past and of the future, things which have occurred just as he informed sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. Who guided him to know that? It was Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. He is the One who revealed it to him. It was not from himself; rather it was just from Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. If you were to compare the ahaadeeth (sayings of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) to the events that have occurred, you would be amazed. The Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam mentioned to us about the lives of the Prophets and the previous nations (he mentioned) a great deal (of that), even though his time was much later. Who made him aware of this? It was Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. So this is indeed a proof that he is a Messenger from Allaah. This tremendous Qur·aan, it is not possible that it could have come from other than Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say, if the whole of mankind and jinn were to gather together to bring the like of this Qur·aan, they could not bring its like, even if they all tried to help each other.</strong> </span>(Sooratul-Israa· (17), aayah 88)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is from the speech of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. And the Messenger was just one who conveyed the Message from Allaah, the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And this Qur&#8217;aan has been sent by Revelation to me to warn you with it and to warn whomever it reaches.</strong></span> (Sooratul-An`aam (6), aayah 19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he was one who conveyed the Message from Allaah, the Majestic and Most High.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 13 : Point 11 (Part A)</strong><br>
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know, may Allaah have mercy upon you, that speculative speech, kalaam, about the Lord, the Most High, is a newly introduced matter and it is an innovation and misguidance. Nothing is to be said about the Lord except what He, the Mighty and Majestic, described Himself with in the Qur·aan and what the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam explained to his Companions. So He, the Majestic in Renown, is One.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him; and He is The All Hearing The All Seeing.</span> </strong></span>(Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Our Lord is the First without any beginning, and the Last without any end. He knows whatever is secret and whatever is most hidden. He has ascended over His Throne, and His Knowledge is in every place. And no place is free of His Knowledge.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F363826523&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/speculative-speech-kalaam-about-allaah-the-most-high-is-an-innovation-misguidance" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Kalaam, speech/rhetorical theology/theological rhetoric, with regard to the Lord, the Most High, is something new and it is an innovation and misguidance.”</strong> Meaning, theological rhetoric, kalaam, with regard to the Self of the Lord, the Perfect and Most High, and with regard to His Names and His Attributes, is a newly introduced affair. It was introduced by the people of misguidance, those who do not submit to the texts and who do not have fear of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. So therefore they speak about the Self of the Lord, and they speak about His Names and His Attributes, and they deny and they negate that which Allaah affirmed for Himself or that which His Messenger affirmed for Him. And they bring opinions from themselves. (And they say) “This is what is correct.” They speak in explanation of the texts with other than their correct explanation, or they say, “We don’t understand them.” They say, “We leave and entrust them to Allaah.” And the Speech of Allaah and the speech of His Messenger becomes just like foreign/non-Arabic speech which the Arabs do not understand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is obligatory upon the Muslims is that they continue upon the correct path, upon the way of the Salaf and that they do not give any attention to those people who mislead others, those who argue about Allaah without any proof which He has given them. They dispute about the Qur·aan and they dispute about the Sunnah. Their affair is just argumentation. So it is obligatory to beware of those people. Those people are not people who are followers (of the Truth); rather they are innovators who are just following their desires. [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And nothing is to be said about the Lord except that which He described Himself with, He the Mighty and Majestic, in the Qur&#8217;aan.”</strong> Having forbidden argumentation about Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and arguments/debates about the Names of Allaah and His Attributes, he now explains what is obligatory. And it is that we affirm the Qur·aan and the Sunnah just as they came upon their meaning, the meaning taken from the Arabic language with which the Qur·aan and the Sunnah came down. So al `ilm, knowledge, its meaning is well known in the language. Likewise al-wajh, the face, is well known. And al-`ayn, eyes, and al-yad, hands, and al-istiwaa·, ascending, and al-`uloow, being high above, all of these and their like, their meaning is well known in the Arabic language in which the Qur·aan came down. Whereas the people of misguidance, they say “This speech is not in accordance with what is apparent from it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And then they divide into two categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• A category who say, “We stop and withhold. And we say what is apparent is not what is meant; but then we do not understand what is actually meant by it.” And they are the <strong>Mufowwidah</strong> the people of <strong>tafweed</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• And the second category are the <strong>Mu&#8217;owwillah</strong>, the people of <strong>ta&#8217;weel</strong>, who give false interpretations. And they are more in number; they are the majority out of these two groups. They interpret with other than their correct meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they went astray and they lead others astray and they preoccupy the people. And they fill up books with these debates, with arguments and disputations which lead to nothing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is obligatory is to submit to what occurs in the Book and in the Sunnah with regard to the Names of Allaah and His Attributes as was meant by Allaah and His Messenger, because Allaah knows best about Himself, He the Perfect and Most High, and He knows best about other than Himself. And the most knowledgeable one from the creation about Allaah is the Messenger of Allaah sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. As for us, then our knowledge falls short. There are many things that we do not know related to our own selves with regard to the details of our bodies and the veins and the senses. There are things which we do not know. Do you know the rooh, about the soul? What exactly is it? The intellect, what is it? If you do not know something from your own body, nor something about your own self, then how can you speak about the Self of Allaah the Perfect and Most High, which is not known, except to Him, He, the Perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He (Allaah) knows whatever is in front of them and whatever is behind them and they do not encompass Him with knowledge</strong></span> (Soorah TaaHaa (20), aayah 110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is outside what they know and outside what they can imagine. And no analogy can be made between Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, and His creation. This would be a belittlement of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. So He knows best about His Self and about other than Himself. And He is the One who is truest in saying and better in speech than His creation, as Shaykhul-Islaam rahimahullaah said in al-Waasitiyyah [03].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and what Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam explained to his Companions.”</strong> The issue of the Names and Attributes hinges upon the Book and the Sunnah. And their explanation is also in the Book and the Sunnah, and the language of the Arabs in which the Legislation came down. And we do not go to the logic of Aristotle and Plato, or so and so, or such and such. This is a crime against the Legislation of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, and it is a case of replacing the Revelation with logic and `ilmul-kalaam, theological rhetoric. And what fruit did theological rhetoric and argumentation produce for those people with regard to misguidance and ruin and loss. And they did not reach any result. And this is by their own admission.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They expended their whole lives in debating and disputations, and in the end they acknowledged that they did not reached any result. And if only they had submitted to Allaah and to His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, they would have found relaxation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore one of them said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;"><em>“The result of using the intellects is just that the mind is tied in knots</em></span><br>
<span style="color:#800080;"><em> And most of the striving of the people is just misguidance</em></span><br>
<span style="color:#800080;"><em> And our spirits are forlorn strangers within our bodies</em></span><br>
<span style="color:#800080;"><em> And all the results that come about in this world for us are just harm and an evil climate</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we did not benefit from our studies through our whole lives except that we just gathered they said and such and such said (idle speech).” [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they came to a state of doubt and uncertainty. And as for those who submitted to Allaah and to His Messenger, then they were saved and at peace from this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the people of misguidance say also:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;"><em>“Upon my life, I have gone around all of the institutions of learning</em></span><br>
<span style="color:#800080;"><em> And I have looked upon all those places</em></span><br>
<span style="color:#800080;"><em> And I did not see except one who is putting his palm</em></span><br>
<span style="color:#800080;"><em> upon his chin in confusion or one who is striking his teeth in regret.”</em></span> [05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He went around all the institutes of learning, institutes of theological rhetoric and logic and debating and he examined them and did not find in them that which could remedy the need to know. And he said [06]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I have carefully considered the different paths of theological rhetoric and the ways of the philosophers. And I did not see them remedying the sick [07] nor quenching the thirst of the person with extreme thirst. And I saw that the closest path was the way of the Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Read with regard to affirmation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The good word ascends to Him.</strong></span> (Soorah Faatir (35), aayah 10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The Most Merciful ascended upon the Throne.</span></strong> (Soorah TaaHaa (20), aayah 5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And read with regard to negation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him</span></strong> (Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they do not encompass Him with knowledge</span></strong>. (Soorah Taahaa (20), aayah 110) ”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(End of quote)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“So He, the Majestic in Renown, is One. There is nothing like Him; and He is The All Hearing, The All Seeing.”</strong></span> He is, He the Perfect, One. No one shares with Him with regard to His Self nor with regard to His Names and His Attributes nor with regard to His Creating and His Actions nor with regard to His worship. There is no sharer and no partner for Him. So why therefore tire yourself out? You are a created being and He is the Creator. How can the created being encompass knowledge of the Creator, the Majestic and Most High? So you, your role is just to submit to Allaah and to His Messenger and not to dispute and not to argue and not to tire yourself out and to tire other people out. This is what is obligatory and binding. And therefore the Companions, they did not engage themselves in these unnecessary matters. And they did not withhold with regard to an aayah or with regard to a hadeeth. Rather they affirmed it and submitted to it and held what it contained as their creed and belief, and they never had any problems arise, ever. So the matter is a matter requiring submission and compliance. And that we do not delve into matters of creed and belief in the way which the people of disputation and the people of kalaam, theological rhetoric, and people of logic delved into it. Such that the result was, as they themselves admitted regarding themselves, that they ended up in a state of bewilderment and confusion and not reaching any result, as one of them said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“We didn’t benefit anything from our studies, throughout our whole lives Except in the end we just gathered idle speech.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Meaning), so and so said and so and so said. And if he says such and such then the response is such and such. [08]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee hafizahullaah said regarding this point, “Meaning by that, speech which was introduced by the Jahmiyyah with regard to delving into speaking about Attributes of Allaah without knowledge. But as for describing (giving as an Attribute) that which Allaah described Himself with or which His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam described Him with, then this is something required.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] This occurs in al-`Aqeedah Al-Waasitiyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] These lines of poetry are by al-Fakhrur-Raazee. You can refer back to Dar· Ta`aarud al-Aql wan-Naql and Minhaajus-Sunnah (of Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymeeyah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[05] These lines of poetry are by ash-Shahristaanee, the author of the book al-Milal wan-Nahl. You can refer back to Dar· Ta`aarud al-Aql wan-Naql and Minhaajus-Sunnah (of Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymeeyah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[06] This is a quote from ar-Raazee quoted from him in the book an-Nuboowaat of Shaykhul-Islaam (ibn Taymeeyah)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[07] <strong>Translator’s note:</strong> curing the one who has a need for knowledge</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[08] Shaykh as-Suhaymee hafizahullaah said, “Then he made clear that it is obligatory to describe Allaah with that which He described Himself with, and that which His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam described Him with, without tahreef, distorting the meaning, without ta`teel, denying/depriving it of meaning, without takyeef, saying how, and without tamtheel, likening the Creator to the creation, in accordance with His Saying, He, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There is nothing like Him (Allaah); and He is The All Hearing, The All Seeing</strong> </span>(Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, “There is nothing like Him;” this is negation. And, “and He is The All Hearing, The All Seeing;” this is affirmation. And it contains a proof for detailed affirmation and for general and concise negation. Because His Saying, “There is nothing like Him,” this is a general and concise and negation. It negates everything that can be imagined or can cross the mind. And “and He is The Hearing, The Seeing,” this is affirmation in detail. And this aayah is a tremendous principle with regard to affirming the Attributes along with declaring Allaah, the Exalted and Most High, free of whatever does not befit Him.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 13 : Point 10</strong><br>
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Al-kalaam (theological rhetoric), arguing, debating and disputing are newly introduced affairs. They cast doubt into the heart, even if the person happens to attain the Truth and the Sunnah.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F363815261&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/theological-rhetoric-arguing-debating-disputing-are-all-newly-introduced-affairs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These matters, al-kalaam (theological rhetoric), debating and disputing which occurred between all of the sects, these are newly introduced matters. And the reason for them is the following of desires. And whoever is such that his desires follow that which the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam came with, then he will not have doubt.; and he will not be a person of disputing nor arguing nor quarrelling, because he is one who submits and complies. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So if Guidance comes to you from Me, then whoever follows My Guidance, then there will be no fear upon them and they will not grieve.</strong></span> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 38)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So whoever follows My Guidance, then he will not go astray and he will not be wretched.</strong></span> (Soorah Taa Haa (20), aayah 123)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the matter is a question of following, <em><strong>ittibaa</strong></em>`, and complying, <em><strong>inqiyaad</strong></em>, and submitting, <em><strong>tasleem</strong></em>, to the command of Allaah and His Messenger without debating and without argumentation. And the people of misguidance did not fall into argumentation and debates except on account of the fact that they did not submit to Allaah and to His Messenger in the way that the Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah submitted. And therefore you will find the Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah, and all Praise is for Allaah, united with no difference between them in the matter of `aqeedah, creed and belief; rather disagreement is found with the misguided sects. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So if they turn away then they are the ones who will have split away and opposed. So Allaah will suffice you against them. And He is the all Hearing the all Knowing.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 137)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the confirmation of this occurs in another aayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And do not follow the other paths for they will cause you to split away and separate from His path. This He has commanded you with so that you may be dutiful to Him.</span></strong> (Sooratul-An `aam (6), aayah 153)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“(Theological rhetoric, arguing, debating, disputing are all newly introduced affairs. They cast doubt into the heart)</strong> <strong>even if the person involved in them happens to attain the Truth and the Sunnah</strong>.” Meaning, he will still be in error, because he has attained these two (the Truth and Sunnah) through other than the correct path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because the correct path is submission and not delving and debating and arguing which just causes the hearts to become bitter and produces grudges. And it also brings about something worse than that which is at-takfeer, people declaring others to be disbelievers, because the misguided sects they declare each other to be disbelievers and they declare each other to be misguided.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Every sect rejoicing at what they themselves are upon.</strong> </span>(Sooratur-Room (30), aayah 32)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everyone thinking that what he is upon is what is correct. As for the Ahlus-Sunnah walJamaa`ah, the people of Sunnah and the United Body upon the Truth, who submitted to the command and complied, then disagreements did not occur between them, and all Praise is for Allaah. And they do not declare each other to be disbelievers, and they do not declare each other to be misguided; rather they praise each other. And some of them follow others, because they are upon a correct path. Indeed hatred and grudges and declarations of others being disbelievers and being misguided only comes about on account of contradicting the Truth and taking hold of opinions and ideas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is no doubt that everyone wants to defend his own opinion. So he will not accept that it will be said to him, “You are wrong,” for this will mean that you are accusing his intellect of being deficient and he will not be pleased with this. However, if you say to a person of Truth when he has made a mistake, “You have erred with regard to the evidence in this matter, you have missed out on the Sunnah,” then he will accept it, because his intent is the Truth and his intent is not just to support his own opinion. So if you say, “O so and so, you have missed out on the Sunnah, you have missed out on the correct evidence,” then he will accept and return. But if you say to a person who is a follower of desires, “You are in error,” then he will become angry and become worse. And this is the sign of the people of desires, that everyone just wants to aid and support that which he desires. But as for the person of the Truth, then what he wants is that the Truth should be aided, and he seeks after the Truth. And the wise word is the lost property of the believer; wherever he finds it, he takes hold of it. [01]</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 12 : Point 09</strong><br>
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And know, may Allaah have mercy upon you, that there is no making analogies with regard to the Sunnah, nor reasoning with examples and desires are not to be followed regarding it. Rather it is just a case of affirming the narrations from Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam without asking how, or explaining it away and without saying, “Why is that?” or “How can that be?”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F363542144&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/there-is-no-qiyaas-analogy-in-the-matters-of-aqeedah-creed-and-belief" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is meant by the Sunnah here is the `aqeedah (creed and belief) because this book is on the topic of `aqeedah, and the (correct) creed is the Sunnah. And this book is called Sharhus-Sunnah, an explanation of the Sunnah (the correct creed). It is called Sunnah because the Sunnah is the (correct) path. And the `aqeedah (creed and belief) is towqeefiyyah, dependent upon text. There is no scope at all for adding anything to it. It hinges upon what occurs from Allaah and from His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. And whatever is contrary to what came from Allaah and His Messenger, then it is false and futile and it is misguidance. So this is the meaning of the saying of the scholars that `aqeedah is towqeefiyyah (depends upon text). Analogy does not enter into it because qiyaas (analogy) can only be in issues of fiqh. They are where analogy can enter, and they are the rulings of what is lawful and what is forbidden. As for the matters of `aqeedah, then there is no analogy in them. Rather it is just tasleem, submission, and inqiyaad, compliance, to that which came from Allaah and his Messenger without any interference. [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And desires are not to be followed regarding it.”</strong> Meaning it is not to be said concerning the `aqeedah (creed and belief) “Whatever agrees to your desires can be accepted and whatever goes against your desires, you should reject it,” as is the way of the people of misguidance. And therefore they were called ahlul-ahwaa (the people of desires). He, the Most High, said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So if they do not respond to you </strong></span>[04]<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>, then know that they are just following their desires. And who is more astray, than one who follows his desires without guidance from Allaah.</strong> </span>(Sooratul-Qasas (28), aayah 50)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever does not submit to the `aqeedah (creed and belief) that is established in the Book and the Sunnah, then he is just following his desires. And therefore the people of innovations in creed and belief are called ahlul-ahwaa, the people of desires, because they are just following their desires, as occurs in the aayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And who is more astray, than one who follows his desires without guidance from Allaah.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Qasas (28), aayah 50)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Rather it is just a case of affirming the narrations from Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam without asking how and without explaining it away and without saying, “Why is that?” or “How can that be?”</strong> Meaning submission to the sayings of the Messenger of Allaah sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam with regard to the Names and Attributes of Allaah and the matters of creed and belief. “Without explaining” meaning, not giving an explanation which is contrary to its correct meaning. And it is an explanation which is contrary to what the texts indicate. And this became widespread amongst the Jahmiyyah, the Mu`tazilah and the Ash`arees. Such as their claiming that what is meant by al-Yad, Allaah’s Hand, is al-Qudrah, ability. And what is meant by al-Wajh, Allaah’s Face, is ath-Thaat, His Self. And what is meant by al-Istiwaa·, Allaah’s ascending is al-Isteelaa·, Allaah’s overcoming. This is a false and futile explanation. This is not the meaning of these texts. So his saying “without explanation” means without any false explanation. As for explaining them with the meaning of making clear/explaining their correct meaning, then this is true.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Saalih ibn Sa`d as Suhaymee hafizahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“What is meant by analogy is that which texts are rejected on account of. That is prohibited in the Sunnah. Indeed it is prohibited in all of the Islaamic rulings. As for the analogy which is well known with the people of Usool (people of fundamental of fiqh) and it is joining a matter for which we do not have a text, joining it to a matter which we do have a text for, based upon a ruling in that matter built upon a reason that is common to both of them, when there is no text to be found.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for this matter here (analogy in this way) then this is a matter which is acted upon and is something which the Salaf stated. However, it is only resorted to when there is a dire need. So it is a supplementary principle and it is not a fundamental principle. It is resorted to, just in the same way that dead meat is resorted to, it is just like eating dead meat. When a text is not present or the text cannot be understood (or so on and so forth) then in that case analogy can be resorted to. And it is particular to the detailed rulings of legislation. But as for the Sunnah in general, then there is no analogy in the Sunnah. Because it is either a text from the Book of Allaah, or from the way of the Messenger, sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.”</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 12 : Point 08</strong><br>
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And know, may Allaah have mercy upon you, that a person’s Islaam will not be complete until he is one who follows, one who attests and one who submits </span></strong><span style="color:#993300;">(to the Book and the Sunnah)</span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">. So whoever claims that there remains anything from Islaam not sufficiently explained by the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> then he has lied against them. And this is sufficient for a person as a separation from them, and as an attack upon them. So he is an innovator, astray, leading others astray, introducing into Islaam that which is not from it.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F363464639&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/whoever-claims-that-companions-didnt-sufficiently-explain-islam-then-he-has-lied-against-them" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a completion of the previous speech. So his saying, <strong>“A person’s Islaam will not be complete until he is one who is a follower </strong>(of the Book and the Sunnah)<strong>, one who attests to it, one who submits to it.”</strong> He is one who follows, not one who innovates. He should be one who believes and attests to the Truth, not one who has doubts and is uncertain. <strong>“One who submits”</strong> meaning one who submits to the Book and the Sunnah, because these matters require submission. They are not matters were argumentation is acceptable. So we submit to Allaah and to his Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and we do not argue about this matter, or we do not give our own opinion, as they say, along with the Speech of Allaah and the speech of His Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“So whoever claims that anything remains from the affair of Islaam which the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam have not sufficed us with regard to</strong> (not sufficiently explained to us) <strong>then he has lied against them.”</strong> Meaning whoever claims that the Companions fell short in clearly explaining and in clarifying and in conveying it to the people from the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and claims that he has scope to speak or to add something, then he intends evil for the people. Because the Companions<em> radiyAllaahu`anhum</em> did not leave anything from that which they heard from the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> or anything which they saw from him except that they conveyed it to the nation faithfully; and they made it clear to the nation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore for this reason the <em>tafseer</em> (explanation of the Qur&#8217;aan) of the Companions is given precedence over the <em>tafseer</em> of anyone after them. Because they were the students of the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and they heard the Qur&#8217;aan from him <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and they heard the <em>ahaadeeth</em> (his sayings) from him and they heard the explanation of the Qur&#8217;aan from him, and they saw his <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> actions and they conveyed that faithfully. So they did not leave out anything at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever claims that they fell short and left something out that they did not convey then he is a liar and an inventor of falsehood. He is astray/misguided, leading others astray, trying to cause the people to have doubts of the Religion of Allaah and about its carriers from the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger, <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And he is acting treacherously towards the Companions, as is the way with the people of innovation. They betray the Companions and make false accusations against them in order to remove the intermediary link between us and between Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So it is obligatory to beware of those people and that we should know the true worth of the Companions and their status <em>radiyAllaahu `anhum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Where did this Qur&#8217;aan come to us from? And these <em>ahaadeeth</em> (sayings of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) and this <em>fiqh</em> (knowledge of the Religion). It did not come except through them taking it and carrying it from the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. They are the ones who carried it to us and they narrated it to us completely, each one in accordance with the amount which Allaah gifted him with and each one in accordance with his own ability. They did not leave anything from the Religion of Allaah except that they conveyed it just as they took it from Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And they are fully trustworthy because Allaah chose them to be Companions of His Prophet and to take from him and to narrate from him. Allaah chose them for that, and then people come along and accuse them of falling short or accuse them of having deficiency. No one says this except one who is astray, trying to lead other people astray. He wants to cut off the link of this nation with the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and therefore to cut off their link with Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu <em>`alayhi wa sallam</em>. We were not present at the gatherings of the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and we didn’t hear him; and between us and him there are many centuries. So the honourable Companions <em>radiyAllaahu`anhum</em>, they are the ones who conveyed to us from the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So the status of the Companions in the Religion is a tremendous status and they cannot be accused of having concealed anything or having hidden anything, and of not bringing it out openly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Then he is an innovator. He is astray, leading others astray, introducing into Islaam that which is not from it.”</strong> This is his intent, to introduce into Islaam that which is not from it, and he will not be able to do this unless he makes attacks upon the Companions and he betrays them and lies against them. Then he will be able to bring things from himself and say, “This is the religion which it is obligatory for us to proceed upon.” This is their goal in lying against the Companions and in betraying them and in belittling them. So that they can take the opportunity to establish for the people a religion from themselves, and in accordance with their intellects and their opinions; and so that we should take from shaykhs of misguidance and imaams of misguidance; those who change the Sunnah of the Messenger, <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> by lying/falsehood and who falsely bring about shaykhs and chains [01] from themselves in contradiction to sources of Islaam. This is something which is clear, which is present in what they pass on and in their thinking.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, and all praise is for Allaah, any misguidance which may persist with them is surrounded and restricted and is exposed by the light of the truth and the light of revelation. These expose the many lies which they are guilty of and which are written in their books. [02]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] Translator’s side point: Shaykh Saalih ibn Sa`d as-Suhaymee <em>hafizahullaah</em> said in his taped explanation,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It is related from Imaam Maalik, <em>rahimahullaah ta`aalaa</em>, that he used to say, <strong>‘Whoever introduces an innovation into the Religion, thinking that it is something good, then he has claimed that Muhammad <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> betrayed his duty to convey the Message</strong>, because Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>This day have I completed your Religion for you, and perfected My favour upon you, and am pleased with Islaam as your Religion.’ </strong></span>(Sooratul-Maa·idah (5), aayah 3)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is related from Imaam ash-Shaafi`ee <em>rahimahullaah</em> that he said, <strong>‘Whoever sanctions an action as being something good then he has legislated (brought about Islaamic legislation).’</strong> Meaning: whoever holds something to be good from himself, and introduces it into the Religion as an innovation, then he has set himself up as one who can legislate besides Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Imaam Maalik rahimahullaah also said  when a man came to him and said, ‘O Aboo `Abdillaah! <strong>Where should I enter the state of ihraam from?’</strong> (the state which you enter when you want to perform `Umrah or Hajj) So he replied, ‘You enter the state of ihraam from Thul-Hulayfah, from the place where Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> entered the state of ihraam.’ (Imaam Maalik was the Imaam of Madeenah, and the man who was asking him in the city of Madeenah) So then the man said, ‘But I want to enter the state of ihraam from Madeenah itself, from the vicinity of the grave.’ So Imaam Maalik said, ‘But I fear for you fitnah (evil, tribulation).’ The man said, ‘And what fitnah can there be? <strong>It’s just some miles which I’m adding.’</strong> So Imaam Maalik said, ‘I fear for you fitnah, because Allaah, the Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So let those who contradict the command of the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam beware, lest a fitnah (trial/tribulation) befall them or a painful punishment.’</strong> </span>(Sooratun-Noor (24), aayah 63)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh as-Suhaymee said, “So the affair is dangerous; that a person introduces innovation into the Religion. He is dangerous, and introduces that which is not from it. The affair is at the limit of danger.”</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 11 : Point 07</strong><br>
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that departing from the correct path occurs in one of two ways. As for one of them, then it is that a man strays from the correct path, intending nothing but good. So he is not to be followed upon his error, because he is heading towards destruction. And (secondly) a man who deliberately opposes the Truth and acts contrary to the pious ones who came before him, then he is astray, leading others astray. He is a rebellious devil within this nation. It is a duty upon those who are aware of him to warn the people against him and to explain his condition to them so that no one falls into his innovation and is destroyed.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/know-that-departing-from-the-correct-path-occurs-in-one-of-two-ways" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh rahimahullaah having explained in the preceding speech the correct path which it is obligatory upon the Muslim to proceed upon in his `aqeedah (creed and belief and his Religion. He then mentioned that one who departs from this path will be one two men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first man:</strong> is one who departs from it, not doing so deliberately, rather intending good. However he follows a path other than the path of good. And personal deduction will not be sufficient, even if the person’s intention was righteous and his intent was good, but along with that he must be upon the correct path. This person is counted as being one who has erred. Whoever agrees with him upon that and proceeds with him upon error, and he knows that it is error, then he is destroyed, because this is a path leading to destruction. Even though the person (original person), did not intend to depart from it, rather he was only seeking after good. And this is the condition of many of those people who introduce new ideas from themselves in the matter of knowledge of `aqeedah (creed and belief). So this is a matter which is not permissible and they are not to be followed upon it and the person is not upon correctness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah the Majestic and Most High says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And this is my Straight Path so follow it, and do not follow the divergent paths which will separate you away from His path (Allaah’s path)</span></strong> (Sooratul-An`aam (6), aayah 153)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whichever path will take us away from the Straight Path, then we reject it. Even if the person upon it is intending good and his intention is good, then still we do not following him upon that. And he, if he continues upon his error, he will go on to destruction, because whoever leaves the correct path on his journey and takes a path leading to ruin, then he will be destroyed. [01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>As for the second man:</strong> then he is the one who exits deliberately. He is aware of the Truth. And he knows that what he is gone out to is baatil (false and futile). However, he deliberately exits from the Truth with the intent of misleading the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the first person, his intention was to rectify the people. However he did not proceed upon the correct path. Whereas the second person, his intention is to misguide the people and to turn them away from the correct path. So this one is a shaytaan (a devil), because the devils take the people away from the Straight Path. Iblees said to his Lord, the Mighty and Majestic,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;I shall lie in wait for them and lead them astray from Your Straight Path&#8221;</span></strong>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), aayah 16)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He meant that he would turn them away from it, towards the deviant paths. And the Prophet, sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, struck an example for this, when he drew a straight line and he drew around it other lines. He said with regard to the straight path,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“This is the path of Allaah,”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said with regard to the other paths,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“and these are the other paths, upon every path from them there is a devil calling the people to it.”</strong></span> [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a clear illustration, and what the Shaykh (Imaam Al-Barbahaaree) mentioned here is consistent with it. Since the person who takes the people from the Straight Path, taking them to new and innovated paths, does not want good for them. Rather he wants for them destruction and he is a devil. Whether he be from the devils of the jinn or from the devils of mankind. So it is upon us to beware of this even more than we are wary of the first one, because this one deliberately tries to misguide the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“So he is astray, leading others astray. He is a rebellious devil.”</strong> He is misguided himself, misguiding other people and he is a rebellious, defiant devil. He wants the people turn away from the Straight Path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“It is a duty upon whoever knows of him that he should warn the people against him and make clear his condition to the people so that no one falls into his innovation and is destroyed.”</strong> This person who has departed from the Truth deliberately, it is not permissible to remain silent about him. Rather it is obligatory to disclose his affair and to expose his shameful state, so that the people can beware of him. It should not be said, “The people are free to have their own opinions,” “The people should have freedom of speech,” or “There should be respect for the opinions of others,” as they constantly say these days, with regard to respecting the other person’s opinion. So the matter is not a matter of opinions, the matter is a question of ittibaa` (following the Truth). So for us, Allaah has laid down and described a clear path and He has told us to proceed upon it when He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And this is my straight path, so follow it.&#8221;</span></strong> (Sooratul- An`aam (6), aayah 153)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whichever person comes to us and wants us to depart from this path then, firstly, we reject his saying, and secondly, we make his affair clear and we warn the people against him. And it is not allowable to remain silent about him, because if we remain silent about him, then the people will be fooled by him. Especially if he is a person of eloquence, one who can speak and write well, and a person of culture, then the people will be fooled by him. They will say, “This is a qualified person” “This person is from the thinkers,” as occurs at present. So the matter is very dangerous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this shows that it is obligatory to refute the one who opposes. Opposite to those people who say, “Leave off refutations,” “Leave the people,” “Let everyone have his own opinion and have his own respect and have freedom of thought and the freedom to speak.” In this way this nation will be destroyed. The Salaf (Predecessors), were not silent about the like of those people. Rather they exposed them and refuted them, because they knew of their danger to this nation. So we have no scope for remaining silent about their evil. Rather we must make clear that which Allaah send down. Otherwise we will be people hiding the Truth from those whom about Allaah has said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Those who conceal that which Allaah sent down from the clear signs and the guidance after we have made it clear to the people in the Book; those people Allaah curses them and those who curse, curse them</span></strong>. (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), aayah 159)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the affair is not restricted to the mubtadi’ (innovator). Rather the matter involves those who remain silent about him, because blame and punishment include him as well, because what is obligatory is to clarify and clearly explain to the people. This is the role of the knowledge based refutations (rudood), which are to be found plentifully in Islaamic book shops today. All of them defending the Straight Path and warning against those people. So no one promotes these ideas, the idea of the freedom to hold any opinion, or the freedom of speech and respecting others, except for one who strives to misguide and who conceals the Truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we, our intention is the Truth. We do not intend just to defame the people or to just speak against the people. The intent is to make the Truth clear. This is an amaanah (trust and responsibility) which Allaah has placed upon the scholars. So it is not permissible to remain silent about the like of those people. However, unfortunately, when a scholar comes and refutes the like of those people, then they say, “He is just one who is speaking in haste,” to the rest of the evil whisperings. So such a person should not betray the People of Knowledge for their clarifying the evil of the callers to misguidance to the people. He should not betray and let them down. [03] [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Points discussed by Shaykh Saalih al-Fowzaan and Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee hafizahumAllaah:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">leaving the correct path occurs in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The first is one who leaves the correct path but only intends good
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">He did not seek knowledge from the correct place and is heading for destruction</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Following him in his error knowingly is a path leading to destruction</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">He should be advised privately (if he is not calling to his error)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The second one leaves the correct path deliberately, obstinately and knowing the Truth
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">He wishes to mislead the people and he is a devil</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The devil misleads people from the Straight Path (aayah and hadeeth mentioned as proof)</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory to warn against this person otherwise he will fool the people</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">This is the role of the knowledge-based refutations, rudood</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Clarifying the Truth is a trust and responsibility Allaah placed upon the scholars</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Remaining silent about those who mislead the people is hiding the Truth</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> With regard to the wording, “ Innahu Haalaka” this person who intended good but strayed away from the true path, strayed into innovation, then literally ‘he is destroyed’, Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee rahimahullaah said, “I say, if the author rahimahullaah, had restricted this wording and the judgement concerning it, such that he had said, ‘he is destroyed, if he dies upon it and does not repent’ (it would be better). And I say also, that intending good will not benefit a person, that he just intends what is good, but he does not adhere to the Straight Path which came from Allaah and from His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.” Then the Shaykh, mentioned the long incident of those people who were counting the stones in the masjid (reported by ad-Daarimee in his Sunan) the narration concerning `Abdullaah ibn Mas`ood radiyAllaahu `anh. When they were criticized by `Abdullaah ibn Mas`ood radiyAllaahu `anh, that they made their excuse and they said, “<strong>By Allaah, O Aboo `Abdur-Rahmaan, we only intended good</strong>.” Ibn Mas`ood radiyAllaahu `anh, responded to them, “<strong>And how many people intend good, but do not attain it</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] Reported by at-Tayaalisee in his Musnad, Imaam Ahmad in his Musnad, Sa`eed ibn Mansoor in his Sunan, ad-Daarimee, an-Nasaa·ee in (Sunan) al-Kubraa and a number of other references besides. All of them say as a narration of `Abdullaah ibn Mas`ood. It was declared authentic by Ibn Hibbaan and al-Haakim, agreed to by ath-Thahabee and declared saheeh (authentic) by others from the people of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> In addition Shaykh al-Albaanee, in his checking of al-Mishkaat, declared this narration to have a hasan (good) chain of narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] <strong>Translators side point:</strong> Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee rahimahullaah said, “What is obligatory upon everyone who is aware of the Truth is that he should aid it.” After some speech he said, “And whoever claims that refuting the people of innovation causes splits in this nation and it disunites this nation, then he is misguided also, because he wants this nation to unite upon falsehood. This is a matter which Islaam does not consent to.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] <strong>Translators side point:</strong> From the taped explanation of Shaykh Saalih ibn Sa`d as-Suhaymee hafizahullaah. With regard to this point that the people who depart from the Truth are one of two people, he said, “Yes, this is a precise categorisation from the Shaykh, rahimahullaah. The innovators are indeed of two categories, because the Shaykh, as you know, throughout his whole book, his focus is upon the innovators. And from them there is a category who actually want the Truth, but he does not attain it. Just like the people of thikr who we mentioned a short while ago (the same incident of those people in the masjid who were doing an innovated form of thikr which `Abdullaah ibn Mas`ood criticised). Those who said to Ibn Mas`ood, radiyAllaahu’anh, ‘We only intend the Truth.’ However, how many people there are who intend the Truth, but do not attain it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Whoever intends the Truth, he should seek it from its correct place. And the Truth does not come about through venerating individuals, nor through flashy words, nor by having a majority. It only comes about through ittibaa`, following the Truth, following the first generations, the generations of the Companions and the Taabi`een and proceeding upon their methodology. So the like of this person (the first person, he strays into innovation but he only intends the Truth) is destroyed if he does not come back and seek the Truth with its proof from the correct place. However his danger is less than the danger of the second category of the people. And perhaps his harm will be restricted to himself, meaning the one who intends the Truth but he seeks it not in the correct way. So he slips and innovates and falls into innovation, and the judgement upon him will be in the light of how severe his innovations are. It may be of the level of something less or it may be something major or it may be something which takes him out of Islaam, but his danger will be less. And your advising him should be between you and him, if you know that he is not a caller to innovation and that he does not propagate innovation. Then you should come to him privately and you make clear to him the correct path, so that he can follow it. You make clear to him the methodology of the Ahlus-Sunnah walJamaa`ah. You don’t make his affair open. You don’t mention him upon the minbars. You don’t mention him as being a person with criticism. Rather you direct him and give him sincere advice. So if this type of person is how he is, then maybe be one day, by the permission of Allaah, he will turn back. And even if he stays upon his innovation, then he does not represent a great danger to the people (he doesn’t call to this innovation). However what is obligatory is that you strive to give him advice and clarify and give him correct, constructive direction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“As for the second category of people, those who are obstinate, those who do so deliberately with pride, they commit innovation, obstinately, deliberately. The more you forbid him, the more he increases in his error until he becomes a caller to innovation. Therefore the Salaf used to reject the narrations of an innovator, who was a caller to innovation and not accept them, rather they would reject them and warn against him and against his innovation. So the like of this person, you must make his affair clear and warn against him. And if he has written a book, he is refuted with a book. If he has a tape, he is refuted with a tape. If he gives speeches, he is refuted in speeches. The people are warned against his evil. ”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Shaykh went on to mention further examples in that regard: this is not backbiting; this is correct; this is one of the examples that Imaam An-Nawawee in his book Riyaadus-Saaliheen mentioned are an exception. This is a case where it is obligatory to speak against that person and it cannot be said, “This is backbiting, this is forbidden.” This is not the case. Then after some speech the Shaykh said finishing, “So this second type, who is indicated by the author here, he is the most dangerous of people for this nation. Therefore it is obligatory to warn the people against him and to draw attention to their evil and to warn the nation against their evil. ”</p>

<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">So examine, may Allaah have mercy upon you, the speech of everyone you hear from, in your time in particular; so do not act in haste. And do not enter into anything from it, until you ask and see: Did any of the Companions of the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam speak about it or anyone from the scholars? So if you find a narration about it from them, then cling onto it and do not go beyond it for anything and do not give preference to anything over it, and thus fall into the Fire.</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/examine-the-speech-of-everyone-you-hear-from-in-your-time-in-particular" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not be hasty regarding that which you hear from the people, particularly in later times, and the large number of people who speak and give rulings and who stand to give knowledge and speak. And particularly, with the new development in information media, that it is now the case that everyone talks foolishly and speaks in the name of knowledge and in the name of the Religion, even the people of misguidance and the deviated and the misguided sects. They now speak in the name of the Religion on satellite channels. So the danger is very great.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is upon you O Muslim, and O Student of Knowledge in particular, to verify and that you are not hasty in taking everything that you hear. It is upon you to verify and to be aware, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>who is the one who said this thing? And where did this idea come from? And then what is its basis, and its proofs from the Book and the Sunnah? Then where did this person study and who did he take knowledge from?</strong> </span>So these matters require verification, particularly in this time. So we do not accept every saying that anyone is saying, even if he speaks well, and speaks eloquently, and speaks abundantly and attracts people&#8217;s hearing, do not be taken in by it until you look and see the extent of their knowledge and understanding of the Religion that he has.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or it may be the case that a person&#8217;s speech may be little, but he is a person of understanding of the Religion. And it might also be the case that a person&#8217;s speech may be plentiful, but he is an ignorant one who has nothing from knowledge and understanding of the Religion. Rather he just has magical/enchanting speech so that he fools the people, and gives the false impression that he is a scholar and that he is a person of understanding and that he is a thinker and the likes of that, so that the people are taken in and he takes them away from the Truth. So what is counted is not the amount of speech and being able to ramble on, rather what is counted is what it contains with regard to knowledge and what it contains with regard to being based upon correct principles. And it may be the case with speech that is little but it is correctly based upon correct principles. This will be far more beneficial than abundant speech which is just lengthy, and from which no benefit can be taken except a little. And this is the situation in our time, where speech is abundant and knowledge is scarce; the recitors are many, and the people of knowledge and understanding (fuqahaa·) are few in number. And fiqh (knowledge and understanding of the Religion) does not come about by being able to speak a great deal, or to recite a great deal, or being able to speak well or being able to word things well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Poet said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Embellished (falsely adorned) speech may make its falsehood seem attractive,</em><br>
<em> Whereas the Truth, may suffer as a result of being badly expressed.</em><br>
<em> So you may say, “This is the spittle of the bees” if you want to praise it;</em><br>
<em> but if you wanted you could say, “It is the vomit of flying insects which sting.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you wish to praise honey, you can say, “This is something put out from the mouth of the bee,” but if you want to speak against it, then you can say, “This is vomit,” instead of saying it is ‘spittle’ (something put out from the mouth); and instead of ‘a bee’ you can say ‘a hornet’ (a stinging insect that flies). So the eloquent person, he can turn the Truth into falsehood and falsehood look like the Truth by means of his eloquence, so beware of this. And therefore the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam he warned against the person who is very eloquent in speech, the person who moves his tongue around just as the cows move the tongue around.1 He (sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) warned against this one and he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“Some speech is like magic.”</strong> </span>[02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning it enchants the people’s hearing (acts like magic upon the hearing of the people). His saying, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“So look and examine, may Allaah have mercy upon you, at the speech of everyone whom you hear from in your time in particular. Do not be hasty and do not enter into anything from it.”</strong> </span>This was at the time of the author [03] and the author was almost at the same time as Imaam Ahmad, because he is one of the students of his students. He says: Do not be hasty in accepting the speech of the people in your time, until you verify it. So where is this in comparison to this time of ours now, the time of desires and the time of ignorance and the time when the different parts of the world are all mixed together? To the extent that trials and tribulations and evils and ideas arise and surge like waves and the enemy now wants to turn the Religion upon its head. He wants us to follow him and to impose his ideas upon us and to impose his politics upon us. Therefore it is upon us to check this affair carefully and to withhold from many affairs and to turn attention to seeking to understand the Speech of Allaah and the speech of His Messenger, and to acquire knowledge and understanding of the Religion of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So al-fiqh (knowledge and understanding of the Religion) contains a protection from trials and tribulations. And al-fiqh means al-fahm (understanding of the Religion). And a person may have memorized a great deal, but he does not have understanding, so therefore he and the common person are just the same. Indeed the common person may be better than him because he withholds himself and he recognizes his own ignorance, while this one does not realise that he is actually an ignorant person. Therefore the matter is not just memorizing a great amount or speaking a great deal. The matter is a matter of fiqh (understanding) and therefore he sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said, “Perhaps one who has something conveyed to him will be better comprehending than the one who heard it (originally).” [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a person may memorize something, and transmit and narrate, and yet there may be someone there who understands it better than he does. (Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“There may be a person who conveys knowledge of the Religion but he is not one who comprehends it.”</strong></span> [05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is a carrier of the knowledge and a transmitter of it, however he is not one who has understanding of it. So fiqh (knowledge and understanding of the Religion) is a gift from Allaah which Allaah gives to whomever He wishes from His servants. However, if he utilizes it properly and advances it/causes it to grow then he will benefit from it. But if he neglects it, it will be lost.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“So do not be hasty and do not enter into anything from it until you ask and look: Did anyone from the Companions of the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam speak with it?”</strong></span> This is a tremendous piece of advice if some speech pleases you regarding the Religion. As for speech about the affairs of this world, then that is not the topic under discussion here. Rather if some speech with regard to the Religion seems pleasing to you then don&#8217;t be hasty until you examine it: Is it founded upon something true and upon proof or is it just from the person&#8217;s own head and his own thinking? For if it is, then it is just scum, like the scum which is carried on the top of flood water. Leave it (in that case). But otherwise if it is founded and based upon the Book and the Sunnah, then it is true. So therefore to do not be hasty in taking speech without restraint, even if it seems pleasing to you in its fine manner of speaking and it is eloquence and its forcefulness and in the style of address, do not be hasty about it until you examine and you test it against the Book and the Sunnah, and examine and see who said it. Is he a person of knowledge and understanding (a faqeeh) or not a person of knowledge and understanding? Until you ask the people of knowledge about it (this matter) and you look and see, did anyone from the Salaf (Predecessors) say it or did they not say it? And this is something I have warned against many times, that I say: Do not introduce personal deductions and opinions and sayings and wording which have not been preceded upon. Take as your example the Salaf and the speech of the Salaf, and if you bring something which you have no one who precedes you upon it, then it will be something odd and strange, and its danger will be far more than its benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the speech of the Companions is the balance because they were the students of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. Their sayings are looked to with regard to an aayah; how did they explain it? And with regard to a hadeeth, how did they explain it? So you take from their sayings and from their explanation because they will be closer to the Truth than anyone who came after them; because they were students of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and they heard the interpretation and the explanation from the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and they took knowledge directly from him, so they will be the people who are closest to the Truth. And no weight is to be given, to the saying of those people who say, “The Companions are not to be counted, they were men and they had their own opinions, and we are men and we have our thoughts. Times change.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Religion remains and will remain until the Hour is established. And it does not change with the changing time; it covers every time and place. What changes is only human deductions, which may sometimes be wrong and sometimes correct. As for the Religion itself, it does not change because it is suitable for every time and every place because it was sent down from One who is all wise, deserving of all praise. And therefore they used to advise and say, “Adhere to the Book and the Sunnah with the understanding of the Pious Predecessors. Do not introduce an understanding from yourself or from the later people.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“or anyone from the People of Knowledge (scholars)”</strong></span> Meaning, did anyone from the scholars who are counted say it, from the Imaams who proceeded upon the way of the Companions of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam? Because they were the ones who narrated from the Companions, and the Companions were the ones who narrated from the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“So if you find a narration from them about it, then cling onto it.”</span></strong> If you find it being in agreement with their saying then cling onto it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“And do not go beyond it for anything.”</span></strong> And do not go beyond the speech of the Salaf for the opinion of so and so, and so and so from those who came after them. His saying, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And do not prefer anything over and above it and thus fall into the Fire.”</strong></span> And do not prefer over what came from the Salaf anything, from that which the later people brought such that you fall into the Fire. Because you have gone against the path leading to Paradise, and the path of Paradise is what (they) were upon, those who&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Those whom Allah has bestowed favor upon, from the Prophets, and the true and truthful followers of the Prophet, and the martyrs, and the righteous people and what a fine companionship they are.&#8221; </strong></span>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), aayah 69)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the path to Paradise, and whatever conflicts with it is a path leading to the Fire. And Allaah the Mighty and Majestic says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;And this is My Straight Path so follow it, and do not follow the multiple paths, for they will cause you to split away from His path”</strong></span> (Sooratul-An`aam (6), aayah 153)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s path is one but as for other than it, then it is many paths. Every devil has a path and he has a path; on each path there will be devils from mankind and from the jinn. So they are many different paths which will throw the person who follows them into confusion. But as for the Straight Path, then it is one. It does not contain any disagreement and you will never become lost if you follow it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Points discussed by Shaykh Saalih al-Fowzaan hafizahullaah:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Concerning matters of the Religion, Muslims should verify:
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Who has said this thing?</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Where did it come from?</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">What is its basis in the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah?</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Did any of the Salaf say it?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">If it is just from a person’s own head and own thinking then leave it</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the person who spoke about this matter, Muslims should verify:
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Where did he study?</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Whom did he take knowledge from?</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The extent of his knowledge and understanding</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">It may be that a person speaks little, yet he is a person of understanding of the Religion</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">It may be that a person speaks plentifully yet he has no knowledge and understanding of the Religion</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">In our time:
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Speech is abundant and knowledge is scarce;</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The recitors are many and the people of knowledge and understanding are few</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The eloquent one can make the Truth look like falsehood and make falsehood like look the Truth</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Allaah hates those men who are eloquent, the one who moves his tongue around, just as the cow moves its tongue around. (hadeeth)</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">He (sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) warned against this one saying, “Some speech is like magic.”</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">It is upon us to:
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Check affairs carefully,</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Withhold from many affairs</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Turn to seeking to understand the Qur·aan and the speech of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Acquire knowledge and understanding of the Religion of Allaah</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Knowledge and understanding of the Religion contains a protection from trials and tribulations</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">A common person may be better than one who has memorized a lot because he recognizes his own ignorance</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">“There may be a person who conveys knowledge of the Religion but he is not one who comprehends it.” (hadeeth)</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Fiqh, knowledge and understanding of the Religion, is a gift from Allaah
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">If a person utilizes this gift properly and advances it he will benefit from it</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">If he neglects it, it will be lost</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Do not introduce personal deductions, opinions, sayings and wording which have not been preceded upon</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The danger of bringing something which has not been preceded upon is more than its benefit.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Take as your example the Salaf and the speech of the Salaf</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Companions took knowledge directly from the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, so they will be the people who are closest to the Truth</li>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 09 : Point 06A</strong><br>
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And beware of small matters that have been newly introduced, because small innovations grow, until they become large. This is what happened with every innovation introduced into this nation. Initially it was something small, having resemblance to the Truth; so those who entered into it were misled by this. Then they were unable to depart from it; so it grew large and it became the religion which they followed. So the person diverged from the Straight Path and exited from Islaam.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F362019281&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/small-innovations-grow-until-they-become-large" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And beware of small matters that have been newly introduced.”</strong> He says do not be lax about anything from innovation or bid`ah, even if it is something small because it will grow and other things will become added to it, and this is one of the evil results of innovations. Since if the door to innovations is opened they will increase; so do not be negligent and lax about them. And it said (some people say), “This is a small innovation &#8211; it will not harm.” Innovation is actually like a burning piece of coal, even if it is small, then the fire will grow until it burns down the whole house, or the shop, or indeed the whole town.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And most fires come about on account of sparks which are thought little of”</strong> [01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So one should not be careless about them, rather totally close the door to innovation altogether. And the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Beware of newly introduced affairs.</strong></span>” [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(This word) iyyaakum “beware” is an unrestricted warning against newly introduced innovations, whether they be small newly introduced affairs or large newly introduced affairs. The Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam did not make any exception with regard to innovations. So his prohibition is general, referring to all innovations. And he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“And the worst of affairs are the newly introduced matters”</strong></span> [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And likewise every innovation that was introduced into this nation, it was something small initially having resemblance to the Truth so those who entered into it were fooled by that, then he (that person) was not able to depart from it.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Troubles, trials and tribulations, when they first occurred in this nation, they occurred on account on being lax with the people who cause corruption, until they spread corruption upon the earth. And they brainwashed the youth and the common people and they filled it (the earth) with evil to the extent that great tribulations occurred in Islaam and between the Muslims as is well-known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this was on account of overlooking the people of evil and leaving them alone, until the affair became very serious. So therefore firm resolve must be shown and the door to this affair must be blocked. <span style="color:#ff0000;">And nothing will safeguard against innovations, after Allaah the Majestic and Most High, except for beneficial knowledge. As for the person who does not have knowledge then he will be swept away with the innovations, and he will think that they are something fine because he does not understand innovations</span>. So nothing will save a person from innovations except for that which the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam commanded with in his saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“So adhere to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Orthodox Khulafaa (caliphs).”</span></strong> [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what will safeguard from innovations, and this requires learning and acquiring knowledge and understanding of the Religion of Allaah. And therefore the Salaf, the Predecessors, were the people who had the greatest knowledge and understanding of the Religion from this nation, and they took the greatest precaution against innovations, and they were foremost in warning against innovations, because of the fact that they knew what they (innovations) lead to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Trials and tribulations when they start to blaze, then they come upon whatever is fresh and dry [05]. They affect the old person and the young person; they come upon the scholars and others besides them; they come upon the whole of the people and they (the people) are not able to escape from them. And if they do manage to escape from them, then their families and their children do not escape from them and those who are round about them. So they are like the fire when it blazes upon the dry stalks of firewood, it is difficult to extinguish. However stopping them as soon as they begin is easy, but as for stopping them after they have grown large and become serious then that is difficult. So therefore it is obligatory to have firm resolve with regard to them, and not to be lax about them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Salaf in the Most Excellent Generations, they used to block innovations and they would not permit anything from them. So the Most Excellent Generations were the purest generations of this nation. And therefore Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam praised them in his saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“The best of you is my generation, then those who come after them, then those who come after them.”</span></strong> [06]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because they had not used to be lax with innovations, rather they used to blockade them, and their people (people of innovation) used to have to hide themselves away, because of the strength of the people of the Truth. So then when the Most Excellent Generations passed away, then innovations and their people and evils became active. And trials and tribulations were set ablaze amongst the Muslims. However, Allaah the Majestic and Most High guaranteed that this Religion would be preserved. So the Religion is safeguarded and all praise is for Allaah. However destruction occurs for the people of this Religion, they are the ones who may be destroyed. As for the Religion then it is preserved, by Allaah the Mighty and Majestic’s preserving it. And Allaah brings for it those who aid it and establish it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if you people turn away then Allaah will exchange another people in your place. Then they will not be the like of you.</strong></span> (Soorah Muhammad (47) aayah 38)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then Allaah will soon bring a people whom He loves and who love Him</strong> </span>(Sooratul-Maa·idah (5), aayah 54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah will not let His Religion become lost, however we are the people who may become lost, if we lose our Religion, and if we give assistance to the people of innovation and to the people who newly introduce affairs and we become lax with them. Then if that happens then we will become lost and perhaps trials and tribulations and fighting and the shedding of blood will occur on account of that, and we will not be able to free ourselves from that. [07]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“until it became large and it became the religion which the person followed”</strong> &#8211; meaning that innovations if they are left then they become the religion later on. And his saying has already preceded, “The people never introduce an innovation except that its like is taken away from the Sunnah.” Until the innovations they become the religion (of those people), and the sunnahs are taken away and innovations become the religion with this society. And that does not mean the whole nation is like that; rather just the society which permits innovations to spread, then they becomes its religion. However that does not mean that the Religion altogether will pass away, rather there will be some other people in a different region or a different city who stand, whom Allaah brings for this Religion, those who will aid it and defend it and guard it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in the hadeeth that at the end of time the sunnahs will be taken to be innovations and innovations will be taken to be sunnahs to such an extent that if they are corrected it is said, “You have changed the Religion,” and if they are criticized, then people will say to you, “You are criticizing the Religion”! [08]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“So the person diverged from the Straight Path and exited from Islaam.”</strong> &#8211; meaning that the person of innovation, the affair overtakes him to such an extent that his whole religion becomes innovations and he departs from Islaam, since nothing remains from his religion from the sunnahs. [09]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Reported by Imaam Ahmad , Aboo Daawood, At Tirmithee and Ibn Maajah. From the famous hadeeth of al-Irbaad ibn Saariyah radiyAllaahu `anhu. Declared authentic by Shaykh Al-Albaanee.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> This hadeeth was reported by an-Nasaa·ee, and by Ibn Khuzaymah and it was declared saheeh by Shaykh Al-Albaanee – that, “Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam when he gave a khutbah, he used to say&#8230;” and they report the wording, and it contained this wording, “and the worst of affairs are those that are newly introduced.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] Editor’s note: Part of the same hadeeth mentioned in footnote 2 of this transcript.<br>
[05] Translator’s note: meaning everything<br>
[06] Reported by Al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh (no. 3450) and by Muslim (no. 2535) as a hadeeth of `Imraan ibn al-Husayn radiyAllaahu `anhu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[07 <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> The explanation of Shaykh Saalih ibn Sa`d as-Suhaymee hafizahullaah mentions with regard to this affair of innovations which start as something small,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“In the story of `Abdullaah ibn Mas`ood along with the people of these circles who gathered in circles in Basrah (reported by Daarimee and others) when Aboo Moosaa al-Ash`aree came to him and informed him that there are some people gathering in circles. So in the beginning all they were doing was gathering in circles and repeating words of thikr (remembrance). This, it is possible to say that this is from the smaller innovations. So then the narrator of this report said, “But then I saw most of those who were in those circles fighting against us on the Day of Nahrawaan.” SubhaanAllaah! What is meant by the Day of Nahrawaan? It is the day when `Alee radiyAllaahu `anhu fought against the Khawaarij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So those people of the circles what did they begin with? They began with a small innovation; it would not be counted as something major without a doubt, however their gathering in circles and the manner in which they were doing the thikr, this is the way in which it was an innovation. So tasbeeh (saying subhaanAllaah) and tahleel (saying laa ilaaha illAllaah) is not an evil act, rather it is something legislated. So what was it that Ibn Mas`ood was criticizing from them? It was the manner in which they were doing thikr. So therefore afterwards when the major innovation appeared, the innovation of the Khawaarij those people went with whom? They went along with the Khawaarij. So therefore the narrator of this report said, “So I saw most of the people of those circles fighting against us (meaning the people who were with `Alee radiyAllaahu `anhu) on the Day of Nahrawaan.” So see, this is a witness that emphasizes for us what the author rahimahullaah is saying, that innovation if it is taken lightly, people justifying it, it will continue until it becomes something major and until maybe it will lead the person to exiting/shooting out from the Religion; and the best example of that is the Khawaarij and the extreme Raafidah Shee`ah and the Baatiniyyah and the ones who follow their path.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[08] From `Abdullaah ibn Mas`ood radiyAllaahu `anhu that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“How will you be when trials and tribulations overcome you to such an extent that the old person grows old upon it and the young person grows up upon it and the people take it as being Sunnah. And if it changed the people say, ‘You are changing the Sunnah.’”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the people said, “When will that occur O Aboo Abdur-Rahman?” He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“When your recitors become many and your people with understanding of the Religion become few and your rulers become many and your trustworthy ones are few and this world is sought after by means of actions which should be done for the Hereafter.”</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by ad-Daarimee in his Sunan and al-Haakim in al-Mustadrak `alas-Saheehayn and Ibn `Abdil-Barr in Jaami` Bayaanil- `ilm wa Fadlih and al-Bayhaqee in al-Madkhal ilas-Sunanil-Kubraa and others. And it is a narration which is mowqoof (a statement of a Companion, `Abdullaah ibn Mas&#8217;ood), but it has the ruling of being marfoo` (having come from Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Al-Albaanee rahimahullaah said about this report in his SaheehutTargheeb wat-Tarheeb (no. 111) that this report is saheeh (authentic) because of supports. It is mowqoof, a statement of the Companion. And in his book Tahreem Aalaatit-Tarb where he mentions the forbiddance of musical instruments, page 16, Shaykh Al-Albaanee said about this report, “It is mowqoof (meaning it is a statement of the Companion), but it has the ruling of coming from the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam because it is a matter related to the unseen (a matter of the future) which cannot be arrived at through opinion, especially when all that was predicted in it has occurred, and Allaah&#8217;s aid is sought.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[09] Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee hafizahullaah said in explanation of this point,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“This does not mean that every innovation takes a person outside the fold of Islaam. Rather what he meant was that there were some innovations which cause a person to reach the level of kufr, disbelief, and an example of that is the innovation of the <strong>Baatiniyyah</strong> (those who say all the commands of Islaam have an outward aspect e.g. the prayer and the fasting, for the common people, then there is an inner meaning for the special elite) and the <strong>extreme Soofees</strong>, those who believe that commands and the prohibitions fall away from them (they’re no longer bound by Islaamic commands and prohibitions) and they make lawful that which Allaah has forbidden and they declare forbidden that which Allaah has made lawful. And they worship individuals and cling and devote themselves to them besides Allaah, and they believe that they are infallible or they believe that they know the ghayb (hidden and the unseen) or the like of that. These are from the innovations which reach the level of exiting from the Religion, and Allaah’s refuge is sought.”</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And know that the people never introduce an innovation, until they abandon its like from the Sunnah.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-people-do-not-introduce-an-innovation-except-that-they-lose-its-like-from-the-sunnah" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a tremendous point of wisdom and it is something reported as a saying from the Salaf, that they said, <strong>“The people do not introduce an innovation, except that they lose its like from the Sunnah.”</strong> [01] Because the Sunnah and innovation cannot be combined, except that one of them will expel the other, so a person cannot be an innovator and a person of Sunnah. Rather either he will be an innovator or a person of the Sunnah, they cannot both be combined in him. So one of them will necessarily expel the other, and this is from the harmful effects of innovation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this point of wisdom narrated is confirmed by experience, and the witness for this and its proof is, that you will find the people of innovation having hatred for the authentic ahaadeeth [02], and having hatred for the matters of the Sunnah (sunan). And the worst enemy to them and the most hateful thing that they can hear, is that it is said, “Such and such hadeeth prohibits such and such.” or, “It forbids such and such.” They do not want to hear the hadeeth and the sunan which contradict what they are upon. So this is a sign that the Sunnah and innovation cannot come together.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the person who is upon the Sunnah, then if he hears a hadeeth from Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam then he becomes happy with that. And he adds something good to the good which he already possesses. And he adds knowledge to his knowledge. The person of Sunnah he is happy with the ahaadeeth of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. Whereas the person of innovation he has aversion for the ahaadeeth of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. This is something very clear in the innovators. And they wage war in the matters from the Sunnah, because these things put an end to the innovations which they are upon. And this is a deterrent against innovation, and that they also cause matters of the Sunnah to pass away, and they cause love of matters of the Sunnah to pass away from the hearts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“So beware of forbidden matters.”</strong> Because forbidden matters have no good in them, whether these forbidden matters relate to shirk [03] or kufr [04] or matters of sin, because Allaah will not forbid something and there is good in it. He will only forbid something which is purely evil, or something which the evil of it outweighs the good or an evil which is equal. So if good and evil come together in something, then if the evil is more or equal then you should avoid it, and if the good is more then there is no harm in taking hold of it. And a slight evil found in it along with the greater good is excused.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying,<strong> “For every new introduction is a bid`ah (an innovation) and every innovation is misguidance.”</strong> &#8211; this is the textual wording of the hadeeth of al-`Irbaad ibn Saariyah radiyAllaahu `anhu who said, “Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam gave us an admonition from which the hearts trembled and the eyes shed tears, so therefore we said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, it is as if it is the admonition given by one who is departing (a farewell admonition), so therefore advise us.’ So he, sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, said, <span style="color:#333300;">‘<strong>I council you with being dutiful to (having taqwaa/ being fearful of) Allaah, and with hearing and obeying, even if a slave is appointed over you.’”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in one narration, <span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“an Abyssinian slave whose head is as if it is a raisin.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“`For whoever lives long amongst you, then he will see very great differing. So adhere to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly guided orthodox Khulafaa after me. Cling onto it and bite onto it with your premolar teeth. And beware of newly introduced affairs.’”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a warning, “iyyaaka”, “beware of”. It is a word of warning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“`Beware of newly introduced affairs, for every newly introduced affair is a bid`ah (an innovation) and every innovation is misguidance.””</strong></span> [05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in one narration there occurs the wording,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“and every misguidance will be in the Hellfire.”</strong></span> [06]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every newly introduced affair is a bid`ah, an innovation, and what is meant by a newly introduced affair is: in the Religion. As for newly introduced affairs with regards to customs/everyday habits and with regard to worldly benefits and with regard to types of food and drinks and clothing, then these are innovations in the language sense. They are not innovations in the legislated sense, but rather newly introduced affairs in the Religion, they are the forbidden innovations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this contains a refutation of those who divide innovations into categories, dividing them into good innovations and bad innovations, and permissible innovations. And they say that they fall under the five rulings [07]; then this is a mistake, because innovations, bida`, in the Religion, all of them are misguidance, by the textual statement of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, that he said, <span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“For every new introduction is an innovation and every innovation is misguidance.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I think that what they have done is to enter those things which are an innovation with regards to the language, and they call these things good innovations. And innovations in the linguistic sense are permissible, for example, building schools and building accommodation buildings for students of knowledge and such as putting vowel points on the mus.hafs, (the written copy of the Qur·aan) and the like of that. They call these good innovations, but these are not innovations, these are matters that follow on from the sunnahs and are revival of the sunnahs. So building schools and building accommodation buildings for students of knowledge and printing the mus.hafs and putting vowel points on them, all of these are an aid upon knowledge, so they are something good and they are sunnahs. So these people are either taking good practices and calling them innovations, or they are calling matters of custom innovations when they do not enter into the Religion, because they are from the affairs of this world, so they do not enter into the Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And misguidance and its people will be in the Fire.”</strong> &#8211; as occurs in the hadeeth, “and all misguidance will be in the Fire.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as occurs in the hadeeth of the different sects (that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said), <span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“And this nation will split into seventy-three sects, all of them in the Fire except for one.”</strong></span> [08]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a proof that the people of innovation will be in the Fire and they vary in level. From them are those who will be in the Fire because of their disbelief, and some of them will be in the Fire because of his sin and from them will be those who remain in the Fire forever, and from them will be those who do not remain forever in it; but rather the ruling of such a person will be the same as the ruling of the people of the major sins. [9] [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Points discussed by Shaykh Saalih al-Fowzaan hafizahullaah:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Introducing innovation into the Religion leads to abandoning its like from the Sunnah</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The people of innovation have hatred for the authentic ahaadeeth (narrations) and matters of the Sunnah</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The People of the Sunnah are happy with the narrations and increase in knowledge</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Allaah forbids only that which is purely evil, or its evil outweighs its good or an evil that is equal</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Slight evil found in something along with the greater good is excused</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Every innovation is misguidance and its proof</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">What is meant by the word ‘bid`ah’ or ‘innovation’ in the Legislation</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">What is not included in the legislative meaning of ‘bid`ah’</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Some of the people of innovation will be in the Fire forever and some will not remain there forever</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Some of the people of innovation will be in the Fire for their disbelief and some of  them will enter it due to their sin</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] It has already preceded that this was the saying of Hassaan ibn `Attiyah rahimahullaah&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> As for this report, that it is reported from him that he said, “No people introduce an innovation in their Religion except that Allaah removes from their Sunnah its like, then He does not return it to them until the Day of Resurrection.” This report is mentioned as the saying of Hassaan ibn `Attiyyah, reported by ad-Daarimee and al-Laalikaa·ee and declared authentic by Shaykh al-Albaanee in his checking of al-Mishkaat. Shaykh Al-Albaanee said in al-Mishkaat (no. 188), “And it is also related as being a saying of Aboo Hurayrah reported by Abul-`Abbaas al-Asam in a hadeeth.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Refer to the continuation of the footnote in the Maktabatur-Rushd edition of this book for a quote from Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah on this point with regard to the people of innovation).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] Editor’s note: plural of the Arabic word ‘hadeeth’<br>
[03] Editor’s note: polytheism<br>
[04] Editor’s note: disbelief</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[05] This (hadeeth of al-`Irbaad ibn Saariyah) has preceded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> It was reported by Imaam Ahmad and Aboo Daawood and At-Tirmithee and Ibn Maajah. This hadeeth was declared saheeh (authentic) by Shaykh Al-Albaanee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[06] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> This particular wording occurs in a hadeeth of Jaabir ibn `Abdillaah radiyAllaahu `anhumaa reported by an-Nasaa·ee as hadeeth 1578, in the Book of the Two `Eed prayers, Chapter 22, How The Khutbah is Given; also reported by Ibn Khuzaymah, where he mentioned Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam used to give a khutbah (an address) and he would praise Allaah and repeat words of praise upon Him as He deserves, and then he would say,<strong><span style="color:#008080;"><span style="color:#333300;"> “Whomever Allaah guides then none can misguide him, and whomever He misguides, then none can guide him. And the truest speech is the Book of Allaah, and the best way is the Way of Muhammad. And the worst of affairs are the newly introduced affairs, and every newly introduced affair is an innovation, and every innovation is misguidance, and all misguidance is in the Fire.</span>” </span></strong>Shaykh alAlbaanee declared that narration saheeh (authentic) also.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[07]<strong> Translator’s side point:</strong> What they meant was the five rulings of Islaam, the five rulings of all affairs, meaning: 1. those things which are obligatory, 2. those things which are recommended, 3. those things which are permissible 4. those things which are disliked and 5. those things which are forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[08] The checking for this has preceded.<br>
<strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Reported by at-Tirmithee and al-Haakim, and declared hasan (good) by Shaykh al-Albaanee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[09] Translator’s side point abridged from the explanation of Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee rahimahullah on the same point as the author,<strong> “And know that the people do not introduce innovation until they leave its like from the Sunnah”</strong>: He mentions the seriousness of this matter of introducing innovations, that when a person does that, he does two forbidden things. A person introduces an innovation into his Religion, then he has introduced an innovation which is forbidden and he will have abandoned a matter of the Sunnah which is also something forbidden. Then he gives some evidences for that; some aayahs from Sooratul-Anfaal the 24th and 25th aayahs; Sooratun-Noor, the 24th soorah, aayahs 48-50; and Sooratun-Nisaa·, aayah 115; and he explains those aayahs. Then he says at the end of the discussion,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So there is a threat upon the person who abandons matters of the Sunnah and introduces innovations, there is a tremendous threat away from it&#8230;” And he mentions more of these aayahs. “&#8230;And likewise as occurs in His Saying, He the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And whoever contends with the Messenger after the Guidance has been made clear to him, and follows others than the way of the Believers, then We will land him in the path he has chosen and We will burn him in the Fire of Hell, and what an evil destination.</strong></span>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), aayah 115)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And just as occurs in the saying of the Prophet sallAllaahu alayhi wa salaam,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>‘All of my nation will enter Paradise, except for those who refuse.’ So they said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah and who would refuse?’ So he said, ‘Whoever obeys me he will enter Paradise, and whoever disobeys me then he has refused.’ </strong></span>(Hadeeth reported by al-Bukhaaree, no. 7280)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The person of innovation is one who is disobedient to Allaah and his Messenger. He is following his desires, venerating his own self, claiming by his condition that his opinion and his desires are better than that which the Messenger sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam came with. So therefore beware from being from those people, such that you will have the threat of the Fire upon you, and Allaah&#8217;s refuge is sought. And Allaah is the One who grants success.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Irshaadus-Saaree fee Sharhis-Sunnati lil-Barbahaaree, pp 50-52)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee hafizahullaah mentioned in his explanation the famous saying of Imaam Sufyaan Ath-Thowree rahimahullaah, <span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“Innovation is more beloved to Iblees (the devil) than sin, because a person may repent from sin, but a person does not repent from innovation.”</strong> </span>(Reported by al-Laalikaa·ee in Sharh Usool I`tiqaad Ahlis-Sunnah).</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 07 : Point 04B</strong><br>
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Continuation of Point 04 : </strong>The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“And know, may Allaah have mercy upon you, that the Religion is only what came from Allaah, the Exalted and Most High. It was not left to the intellects of men and to their opinions; and knowledge of it is what comes from Allaah and from His Messenger. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">So do not follow anything based upon your desires and therefore depart from the Religion and leave Islaam. There will be no excuse for you, since the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam explained the Sunnah to his nation, and he made it clear to his Companions and they are the Jamaa`ah, and they are the Main Body. And the Main Body is the Truth and its people. So whoever contradicts the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam in anything of the affairs of the Religion he has disbelieved.”</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“So do not follow anything based upon your desires”</strong> &#8211; do not follow anything based upon your desires and your personal wishes, but rather your desires and wishes should follow whatever comes from Allaah and His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. So that you do not desire except what came from Allaah and His Messenger and you do not wish for, except that which came from Allaah and his Messenger, this is the path of salvation. If you were to follow your desires, you would become one of those who follow their desires and who do not follow the Revelation which has been sent down. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So if they (the people of shirk) do not respond to you </span></strong>[01]<strong><span style="color:#008000;"> then know that they are merely following their desires. And who is more astray than one who follows his desires without guidance from Allaah. Allaah does not guide a people who are disobedient wrong-doers.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Qasas (28), aayah 50)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So pass judgement between them with that which Allaah sent down; and do not abandon acting upon that in favour of their desires, so that they lead you astray from the Truth that has come to you.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Maa·idah (5), aayah 48)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Then, after the previous Prophets, We have placed you upon a clear Way with regard to the Religion so follow it and do not follow the desires of those ignorant ones who do not know. They could be of no avail to you against Allaah at all. And the wrong-doers are just allies of each other; and Allaah is the Guardian Lord of those who are dutiful to Him.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Jaathiyah (45), ayaahs 18-19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore you are between two affairs, either you will follow the correct Religion or otherwise you will be following desires. There is no third case.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and therefore depart from the Religion and exit from Islaam.”</strong> Whoever follows his desires, then he departs from the Religion, even if it be something that occurs in the distant future. To begin with he is lax about disobedience and about desires. Then the following of desires grows in seriousness until he exits from the Religion, so that his religion comes to be just whatever he desires. Just as He, the Majestic and Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do you see the one who takes whatever he desires as his object of worship, and Allaah misguides him knowing that he will not be guided, and He seals his hearing and his heart and He places upon his sight a covering.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Jaathiyah (45), aayah 23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So al-hawaa, desires, this is another object of worship (ilaah), and shirk is not restricted to just the worship of an idol or an object that is worshipped. Rather there is something else, which is al-hawaa, desires. So a person may perhaps not worship the idols, and trees and rocks and not worship graves, however he follows his desires. So he is a slave and worshipper of his desires, so it is upon the person to beware and not to follow except that which conforms to the Book and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“</strong></span><strong>Because then there will be no excuse for you, since the Messenger of Allaah sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam explained the Sunnah to his nation, and he clarified it to his Companions</strong><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>.”</strong></span> There will be no excuse/plea/argument for the one who opposes and instead follows his desires, because he went astray after the affair has been made clear and after having knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do you see the one who takes whatever he desires as his object of worship and Allaah misguides him, knowing that if guidance were to come to him he would not follow it.</strong> </span>(Sooratul-Jaathiyah (45), aayah 23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is not an ignorant person, rather he knows and he is aware of the Book and the Sunnah, and he knows and he is aware of the sayings of the People of Knowledge; however they do not agree with his desires, so therefore he abandons them and instead he takes on whatever actually agrees with his desires. This is misguidance, and Allaah&#8217;s refuge is sought. So following desires is very dangerous, so therefore it is upon a person that he should beware of the following of desires. Allaah the Majestic and Most High said to his Prophet Daawood `alayhis-salaatu was-salaam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And do not follow your desires so that they lead you astray from the path of Allaah. Those who stray from the path of Allaah will have a severe punishment on the Day of Resurrection, because of their abandoning Allaah’s commands.</strong> (Soorah Saad (38), aayah 26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Ibnul-Jawzee rahimahullah has a book in a large volume which is entitled ThammulHawaa (The Blameworthiness of Desires) and in it he brought evidences and sayings of the People of Knowledge and wise sayings which warn against the following of desires. So what is obligatory upon the person is that he takes caution against his desires because he may be saved from the worship of idols and rocks and trees and graves and he may know towheed and know the Sunnah; however he may not be secure from the following of desires, and this is a tremendous calamity. So it is upon the Muslim that he should beware of the following of desires, and rather his desires should follow on from that which came from the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, just as occurs in the hadeeth that he sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said, “None of you truly believes until his desires follow on from that which I came with.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was declared saheeh (authentic) by an-Nawawi in al-Arba`een (the 40 hadeeth) and he said, “We have it narrated to us in the book al-Hujjah with an authentic chain of narration.” [02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam did not leave anything except that he clearly explained it to his nation, to the extent that one of the Companions said, “<span style="color:#008080;"><strong>Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam did not pass away and there was a bird flapping its wings in the air, except that he had mentioned to us some knowledge concerning it</strong></span>.” [03] He did not leave anything from that which mankind have a need of, from that which will draw them closer to Allaah and distance them from disbelief and misguidance except that he made is clear. And he sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008080;"><strong>“I am leaving amongst you that which if you hold onto it, you will never go astray after me; the Book of Allaah and my Sunnah”</strong></span> [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He left his nation upon clear white evidence; its night is just like its day. And when Allaah had completed through him the Religion, and perfected the favour by means of him, then he moved on to his Lord after he had conveyed the clear Message, and clearly explained the Sunnah to his Companions. And <span style="color:#008080;"><strong>he said in the address of the Farewell Hajj, “Have I conveyed the Message?” So they said, “We bear witness that you have indeed conveyed the Message and have acted sincerely. He said, “O Allaah bear witness.”</strong></span> [05] (Sooratun-Ni0saa· (4) aayah 65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And they are the Jamaa`ah and they are the Main Body.”</strong> His Companions sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam they are the Jamaa`ah, meaning they are the foundation of the Jamaa`ah, then those who followed them, then those who followed them. Just as he sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008080;"><strong>“The best of you is my generation, then those who followed them, then those who followed them.”</strong></span> [06]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Companions and Taabi`oon and the Atbaa`ut-Taabi`een, and they are the most excellent generations, they are the Jamaa&#8217;ah. And whoever comes after them, then he follows on from them. They follow on from the foundation which the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam were upon. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the first and foremost ones from the Muhaajireen and the Ansaar and those who follow them upon goodness</strong></span>. (Sooratut-Towbah (9), aayah 100)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are the Jamaa&#8217;ah whom Allaah has commanded us to be with, and whom the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam commanded us that we should be with, and whom he forbade us from separating from. And they are as-<strong>Sawaadul-A`zam</strong>, the Main Body, who are upon the Truth and upon guidance. So those people who declare that the Salaf were ignorant or unaware and who belittle their status, and those who say, “They were men and we are men,” and who say, “There is nothing to prevent us from introducing new things, and we are not bound to follow the Salaf and the sayings of the Salaf,” &#8211; this is misguidance, and Allaah&#8217;s refuge is sought. This is to separate the later part of this ummah (nation) from its first part. And if its later part indeed becomes separate from its first part it will be destroyed; and they want that the nation should be destroyed, so they bring this trick, and it is the separation of the later people from the first part of the nation. There are to be found now, people who warn against the way of the Salaf and who warn against turning back to their sayings, and who say, “That was a time that has gone by.” So they warn against what the Salaf were upon, and encourage originating new things in the Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Religion is a matter depending upon texts, and it is <strong>ittibaa</strong>`, it is to follow, it is not to innovate or originate new things. Originating new things can only be in the field of manufacturing and of worldly benefits. But as for the Religion, then nothing may be newly introduced in it after the passing away of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam; because laying down Legislation came to an end with the passing away of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. So there is nothing upon us except al-ittibaa`, to follow, and that we do not introduce anything new from our selves and say, “This is what is fitting for this time.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Maalik rahimahullah said, “<strong>Nothing will rectify the latter part of this nation, except that which rectified its first part</strong>.” [07] That which rectified its first part was the Book and the Sunnah. So nothing will rectify the last part of this nation except for the Book and the Sunnah and following the guidance of the Salafus-Saalih (Pious Predecessors).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying, <strong>“And the Main Body is the Truth and its people.”</strong> &#8211; As-Sawaad, the Main Body, they are the people of the Truth, and its people, those who cling onto it. And the meaning of as- Sawaadul-A`zam, the Main Body, it does not mean merely the majority of the people/a large number of people. The meaning of as-Sawaadul-A`zam, the Main Body, is those who are upon the Truth, even if they are few in number yet still they are as-Sawaadul-A`zam, the Main Body, even if they be a single man [08]. Whoever is upon the Truth he is the Main Body. We do not look to see where the majority of the people is (what they are upon), rather we look at what they are upon. So majority/a large number may be upon misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if you were to obey most of those people who are upon the earth, they will lead you away from the Path of Allaah.</strong></span> (Sooratul-An`aam (6) aayah 116)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And most of the people, no matter how eager you are, will not be Believers.</span></strong>  Soorah Yoosuf (12) aayah 103)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And we did not find most of them to be true to their covenant, of worshipping Allaah alone and obeying him, rather we found most of them to be disobedient sinners.</span></strong> (Sooratul-A&#8217;raaf (7) aayah 102)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And many of the people are disobedient ones.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Maa·idah (5) aayah 49)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So do not be fooled by a large number of people/the majority of people, and it is not to be followed unless it is upon the Truth. Whoever is upon the Truth then he/it is the Jamaa`ah whether they are few or many. So the discerning factor is: what they are upon; is it Truth or falsehood. So if it is the Truth, then they are the Jamaa&#8217;ah, even if there is only a single person upon it; and if it is falsehood (that they are upon) then it is misguidance, even if the majority or most of the people are upon it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And whoever opposes the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam in anything from the affair of the Religion then he has disbelieved.”</strong> &#8211; he has committed disbelief; this carries a possibility of referring to major disbelief, al-kufrul-akbar, (disbelief that he has left Islam); and it carries a possibility of referring to lesser disbelief al- kufrul-asghar (that which is called disbelief but it does not take a person outside the fold of Islam); in accordance with the level of his opposition. So his saying that he has committed disbelief, it doesn’t mean that he has committed kufr and left the Religion altogether always. This maybe the case, however it maybe lesser disbelief. What is important is that conflicting with the Salaf is kufr, disbelief. It may be major disbelief; it may be lesser disbelief in accordance with the level of the opposition to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or that what is meant is that if he opposes them at the beginning of his affair with something slight, then in gradual stages he becomes worse until he departs from the Religion altogether. So his affair leads him to disbelief, if his opposition continues, his affair leads to major disbelief, so that then he exits from the Religion altogether. (So that) Satan leads him gradually, and desires, and his soul that is prompted by evil, until he departs from the Religion altogether. [09]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] <strong>Translator’s Note:</strong> addressed to the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[02] Reported by Ibn Abee `Aasim in as-Sunnah, al-Hasan ibn Sufyaan in al-Arba`een and al-Bayhaqee in alMadkhal ilaa Sunanil-Kubraa and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> As for Shaykh al-Albaanee rahimahullaah then he said with regard to this hadeeth in his checking of as-Sunnah of Ibn Abee `Aasim and likewise in his checking of al-Mishkaat (no. 167), the chain of narration is da`eef . It contains Nu`aym ibn Hammaad and he was weak. And al-Haafiz ibn Rajab quoted other weaknesses for it disagreeing with an-Nawawee for his declaring it saheeh so refer to his book Jaami`ul-`Uloom wal-Hikam. Then some of them such as the grandson of Muhammad ibn `Abdil-Wahhab rahimahullaah, Sulaymaan ibn `Abdillaah, he said in regards to this narration, “This chain of narration is authentic as anNawawee said, however Ibn Rajab said declaring it saheeh is something far-fetched from many aspects which he mentioned, and some people criticised that.” He said (Sulaymaan ibn `Abdillaah), “I say that its meaning is authentic/correct for certain, even if its chain of narration is not authentic. And the origin of it occurs in the Qur·aan in many places. Then he quoted a number of aayahs in that regard, such as His saying, He, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;So no by your Lord they will not believe until they make you (Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) judge in whatever disputes occur between them.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] Wakee` reported this narration in az-Zuhd, Imaam Ahmad in the Musnad and Ibn Sa&#8217;d in Tabaqaat&#8230; (and others) from a narration of Aboo Tharr radiyAllaahu `anhu. Shaykh Sulaymaan ibn `Abdillaah said in TayseerulAzeezil-Hameed, “Its chain of narration is good.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh al-Albaanee said it was saheeh, authentic, in his checking of Ibn Hibbaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] This is reported by al-Haakim in al-Mustadrak `alas-Saheehayn and by al-Bayhaqee in as-Sunan al-Kubraa and by al-Aajurree in his book ash-Sharee`ah from a hadeeth of `Abdullaah ibn `Abbaas radiyAllaahu `anhumaa. Translator’s side point: The chain of narration of al-Haakim was hasan, sound, and Shaykh al-Albaanee mentioned that in his checking of al-Mishkaat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[05] Reported by al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh (no. 67) and Muslim (no. 1671) as a hadeeth of Aboo Bakrah radiyAllaahu `anhu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[06] Reported by al-Bukhaaree (no. 3450) and in Muslim (no. 2535), as a hadeeth of `Imraan ibnul-Husayn radiyAllaahu `anhu .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[07] This is reported from him by a number of people such ash-Shaatibee in al-I`tisaam and Ibn `Abdil-Haadee in Tanqeehit-Tahqeeq. And perhaps Imaam Maalik took this point of benefit from his teacher Wahb ibn Kaysaan, for indeed Ibn `Abdil Barr reports in at-Tamheed from Imaam Maalik that he (himself) said, “Wahb ibn Kaysaan used to sit for us, and he would never get up until he had said to us, “<strong>Know that nothing will rectify the latter part of this nation, except what rectified its first part</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[08] Aboo Nu`aym said in Hilyatul-Awliyaa· that a man asked Imaam Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh “<strong>Who is the Main Body (as-Sawaadul-A`zam)?</strong>” So he said, “Muhammad ibn Aslam (that is at-Toosee) and his Companions and whoever follows him.” Then he said, “A man asked Ibnul-Mubaarak, ‘O Aboo Abdir-Rahmaan! Who is the Main Body (as-Sawaadul-A`zam)?’ So he said, ‘Aboo Hamza as-Sukkaree.’” Then Ishaaq said, “Meaning at that time it was Aboo Hamza, and in our time it is Muhammad ibn Aslam, and whoever follows him.” Then Ishaaq said, “And if you were to ask the ignorant people, ‘Who are the Main Body?’ they would say, ‘(It means) the majority of the people.’ And they do not know that the Jamaa`ah is a scholar/Person of Knowledge, adhering to the narrations of Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and his way. So whoever is with him and follows him, then he is the Jamaa`ah, and whoever opposes him in that regard, he has left the Jamaa`ah.” Then Ishaaq said, “And I have not heard a scholar for fifty years who is more knowledgeable than Muhammad ibn Aslam.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[09] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee rahimahullaah said, “The like of this phrase occurs a number of times in the speech of the author rahimahullaah, and it is to be taken to have one of three meanings:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Either it is to be taken to mean, that he (the author) intends a person who denies something that is a fundamental point of the creed and belief of the Religion and he denies it. Then he has disbelieved,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Or he intended that his deeds may lead him into disbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Or that he intended disbelief which is lesser than major disbelief, meaning rejecting (Allaah&#8217;s) favour. And it is not the case that everyone who goes against something which the Companions of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam were upon departs altogether from the Religion, for this is not from the `aqeedah of the AhlusSunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah. For indeed Anas ibn Maalik said when he came to Madeenah at the end of his life, ‘I do not recognize anything from that which I reached except for the Prayer and you are spoiling that as well.’ (This narration was brought by Imaam al-Bukhaaree) and in one narration, ‘and have you not spoiled what you have spoiled from it?’ Meaning: you pray them out of their due times; however he did not declare them to be disbelievers. And no one takes this saying of his from the people of the Sunnah to mean that the people who were in his time had become disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore his saying, ‘Whoever contradicts the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam in anything from the affairs of the Religion has committed kufr,’ it is to be taken to have one of the meanings that we have already mentioned because the `aqeedah of the Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah is that they do not declare disbelievers any one from the Muslims based upon a sin, unless it is major shirk that he has committed, or that he has denied a ruling which is agreed upon, or that he has mocked the Religion or its people or the like of that, those things which are mentioned amongst those things that break a person&#8217;s Islaam. And they do not declare anyone to be a disbeliever based just upon a sin, even if it is a major sin, even if he persists upon it and dies upon it, because the texts of the Book and the Sunnah indicate this creed and belief.

		<p><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 06 : Point 04A</strong><br>
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And know, may Allaah have mercy upon you, that the Religion is only what came from Allaah, the Exalted and Most High. It was not left to the intellects of men and to their opinions; and knowledge of it is what comes from Allaah and from His Messenger. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">So do not follow anything based upon your desires and therefore depart from the Religion and leave Islaam. There will be no excuse for you, since the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam explained the Sunnah to his nation, and he made it clear to his Companions and they are the Jamaa`ah, and they are the Main Body. And the Main Body is the Truth and its people. So whoever contradicts the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam in anything of the affairs of the Religion he has disbelieved.”</span></strong></p>
<p><em>[ <strong>Note</strong>: In this audio, explanation of the only first paragraph from the above is covered]</em></p>

<p><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-religion-is-only-what-came-from-allaah-it-was-not-left-to-the-intellectsopinions-of-men" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Religion came only from Allaah, so He is the One who legislated the Religion, He the Perfect. It is not for anyone to legislate religion, which Allaah has not permitted. He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do they have partners who legislate for them religion, not ordained by Allaah.</span> </strong>(Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a rebuke and a warning. So the Religion is that which Allaah has legislated, and which His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam conveyed. This is the Religion about which Allaah the Majestic and Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">He (Allaah) legislated for you the Religion with which He enjoined Nooh, and which He revealed to you, and which He enjoined upon Ibraaheem, and Moosaa and `Eesaa; that you should establish the Religion, and not separate within it.</span> </strong>(Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah13)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the revealed way of the Prophets, specifically those five Prophets, who are those firmest in resolve. This is their Religion. So whoever deviates away from it or differs with it, then he is destroyed and he is astray. And it is built upon the tawheed of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic (singling out Allaah the Mighty and Majestic with all worship) and abandonment of the worship of everything besides Him, and restricting oneself to that which Allaah the Mighty and Majestic legislated, and keeping away from whatever Allaah has forbidden &#8211; this is the Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“It was not left up to the intellects of men and their opinions.”</strong> &#8211; the Religion is not what men deem to be good or what they hold as their opinion, because this is not the Religion of Allaah. This is the Religion of the people, which they have newly invented. As for the Religion of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, then it is what He legislated. As for that which the men hold as their opinion, based upon their own opinions, this is not the Religion of Allaah the Perfect and Most High. Rather it is just a religion of whoever holds that opinion. So nothing can be ascribed to Allaah from the Religion except that which He legislated upon the tongue of His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. And as for what others besides Him legislated, then it cannot be ascribed to Allaah, rather it can only be ascribed to whoever legislated it, and Allaah is free of it. He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do they have partners who legislate for them religion which Allaah has not permitted</strong></span> (Sooratush-Shooraa (42), aayah 21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And its knowledge is with Allaah and His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.”</strong> &#8211; the affairs of the Religion are <span style="color:#ff0000;"><em>towqeefiyyah</em> </span>(depend upon text); there must be proofs from Allaah and His Messenger with regard to the affairs of the Religion. The matter is restricted to what occurs in the Book and the Sunnah from the affairs of the Religion. And newly introduced matters and innovations are abandoned, that which Allaah has not sent down any proof for &#8211; even if their people hold them to be religion, and they draw closer to Allaah through them, then we turn no attention to these things and we do not believe in them, because the Religion of Allaah is what He legislated and His Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because the Religion is based upon knowledge which came from Allaah and His Messenger. And do not follow the desires of the people and the opinions of the people and what they declare to be good and what they follow each other upon, and it has no basis in the Book of Allaah or the Sunnah of His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as he `alayhis-salaatu was-salaam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008080;"><strong>“Whoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it, it is rejected.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in one narration:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008080;"><strong>“Whoever does an action which our affair is not in accordance with, it is rejected”</strong></span> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the person who wishes that his action be righteous and be beneficial, then he should adhere to two matters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first matter:</strong> is that he makes his Religion pure for Allaah and free from shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And the second matter:</strong> ittibaa`, following the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, free of innovations and newly introduced affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A person will indeed find many things which contradict what is correct in the `aqeedah, matters which contradict what is correct in matters of worship, many of them; (because) the people have desires, and have their own aspirations, and they have their own opinions and they have their own ways (which they follow). So we do not follow the people, rather we present whatever the people are upon to the Book and the Sunnah. So whatever conforms with the Book and the Sunnah then it is the Truth, and whatever contradicts these two then it is false and futile.</p>

		<p><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 06 : Point 3C</strong><br>
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation | Dawud Burbank [Audio|En]</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The author rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And that is because the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah have firmly established all of the Religion, and it has become clear to the people. So it is upon the people to comply and to follow.”</strong></span></p>

<p><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-sunnah-the-jamaaah-have-firmly-established-all-of-the-religion" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, may Allah have mercy upon him, said, <strong>“That is because the Sunnah and the Jamaa&#8217;ah have firmly established all of the Religion.”</strong> “That” indicating what has preceded with regard to the encouragement upon adhering to the way of the People of the Sunnah and the Jamaa&#8217;ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it has preceded that what is meant by Ahlus-Sunnah (the People of the Sunnah), are those who adhere to the Sunnah of the Messenger sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam and to his way. They are the people of the Sunnah. And the Jamaa&#8217;ah, they are those who come together upon the Truth and they do not split.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the evidence for this:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And cling all of you together to the Rope of Allaah and do not separate. </strong></span>(Soorah Aal `Imraan (3), aayah 103)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they gathered upon the Truth and they do not separate away from it. And they do not disagree and differ concerning it. They are the people of the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for: <strong>Those who split up their religion, and they are sects&#8230;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah the Majestic and Most High says to His Prophet:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;then you have nothing to do with them at all. Their affair is for Allaah; then He will inform them of what they used to do.”</span></strong> (Sooratul- An&#8217;aam (6), aayah 159)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And that is because the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah have firmly established (ahkamaa),”</strong> meaning they have precisely established; so ihkaam means precision; they have precisely established the whole of the affair of the Religion. All of it is contained within the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah. Just as He sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008080;"><strong>“Whoever lives long from amongst you, then he will see very great differing so adhere to my Sunnah.”</strong></span> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nothing will protect from the evil of this differing except adherence to/clinging onto the Sunnah of the Messenger sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam. And it is what the Messenger sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam and his Companions were upon in `aqeedah (creed and belief) and in `ibaadah (worship) and in dealings and in behaviour and in manners. And they are the Saved Sect, from amongst the 73 sects; all of them will be in the Fire except for one. They said, “Which it is, O Messenger of Allaah?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this one which is exempted from amongst these sects, it is a distinctive group; who is it? He sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam said in explanation of it,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Whoever is upon the like of what I am upon and my Companions.”</strong></span> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That which the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and his Companions were upon is the Sunnah. So whoever adheres to it will be saved; and therefore they are called ‘The Saved Sect’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And it has become clear to the people. So therefore it is upon the people to do ittibaa` (to comply and follow).”</strong> It has become clear to the people, that the affair of the Religion, all of it, lies in adherence to the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah. So no one will oppose what the people of the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah were upon except for the people of misguidance:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So what is there after the Truth, except for misguidance. </span></strong>(Soorah Yoonus (10), aayah 32)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever leaves off the Truth he will fall into misguidance; and the Truth is what the people of the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah are upon to the exclusion of others besides them.[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[01]</strong> This is a part of the hadeeth of al-`Irbaad ibn Saariyah, radiyAllaahu`anhu and its checking has already preceded (page 46).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> It is a hadeeth which is declared saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaanee rahimahullaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[02]</strong> Reported by at-Tirmithee in his Sunan and Ibn Nasr al-Marwazee in as-Sunnah and al-Haakim in alMustadrak and al-Aajurree in ash-Sharee`ah and al-Laalikaa·ee in Sharh Usool I`tiqaad Ahlis-Sunnah&#8230; (and many others). At-Tirmithee said the hadeeth is hasan ghareeb mufassar, a hadeeth which is hasan with a singular chain which explains the other narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh al-Albaanee discussed this hadeeth and declared (it) hasan. It has enough supporting witnesses to support the hadeeth, that it is declared hasan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[03]</strong> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee rahimahullaah said on this point (point 3), “He, may Allah have mercy upon him, said, “And that is because the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah have firmly established the whole affair of the Religion, and it has become clear to the people. So what is upon the people is to follow/comply”. I say, the `aqeedah of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah is clear in its source references and it is tied to the Sunnah and its people. So whomever Allaah wishes good for, then he guides him to those source books. And he makes easy for him to be a companion of the carriers of this `aqeedah, and I mean by it, carriers upon the way of the Ahlus-Sunnah wal Jamaa`ah. And whoever Allaah wishes evil for then He makes easy for him whatever he was created for.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So whoever grows up at the hands of the people of the Soofees and the people of <strong>Soofism</strong> then he will think that that is right guidance and he will go astray and lead others astray. And whoever grows up at the hands of the people of the `aqeedah of the <strong>Jahmiyyah</strong> and he lives upon it and accompanies its people, he will think that that is the Sunnah and he will go astray and lead others astray. And whoever grows up at the hands of the people of the ideas of the <strong>Mu`tazilah</strong>, he will think that that is the Sunnah and he will go astray and lead others astray. And whoever grows up at the hands of the people of the `aqeedah of the <strong>Ash`arees</strong> he will think that that is the Sunnah and he will go astray and lead others astray. And whoever grows up at the hands of the people of <strong>rafd (the Raafidah)</strong>, and the <strong>Shee`ah</strong>, those who curse and abuse the Companions of the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and belittle them, he will think that that is the Truth he will go astray and lead others astray. And whoever grows up at the hands of the <strong>Khawaarij</strong> those who declare the Muslims to be kaafirs (disbelievers), he will think that that is the Truth he will go astray and lead others astray.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“However the people of these deviant sects they must necessarily find certain gaps/flaws/faults in their `aqeedah, which should make clear to them the deficiencies in the methodology which they are upon in belief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And likewise the people of irjaa· (the <strong>Murji·ah</strong>), and likewise the people who are upon the present day calls which give attention just to virtuous acts, and they treat (matters of) `aqeedah lightly, so that the people think that they are upon the Truth, because they see them outwardly adhering; whilst they actually stay away themselves from the very foundation of `aqeedah (creed and belief) and they incite others to avoid it, which is tawheed, the tawheed of worship, (Towheed al-Uloohiyyah). They have nothing to do with it, and they keep other people away from it as well; and they treat lightly whatever infringes it or diminishes it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So what is important is that whoever wishes salvation, should adhere to the Book of Allah, then to the books of the Sunnah; and they are well known such as the Saheeh of al-Bukhaaree,and the Saheeh of Muslim and the Sunan al-Arba&#8217; (The four Sunan), the Musnad of Imam Ahmad. And what follow from that, from the books of hadeeth, and those books that gather the narrations of the Salaf such as: the Musannaf of Ibn Abee Shaybah, and the Musannaf of `Abdur-Razzaaq, and the Musannaf of Sa&#8217;eed ibn Mansoor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And the books of `aqeedah (creed and belief) such as: At-Towheed of Ibn Khuzaymah, and such as ArRadd `alal-Jahmiyyah, (The refutation of the Jahmiyyah) of Imaam Ahmad, Kitaabus-Sunnah (the Book of the Sunnah) of `Abdullaah the son of (Imaam) Ahmad, Radd `alal-Jahmiyyah (Refutation of the Jahmiyyah) by `Uthmaan ibn Sa`eed Ad-Daarimee, Sharh Usool I`tiqaad Ahlis-Sunnah of al-Laalikaa·ee, al-Ibaanatul-Kubraa of Ibn Battah, and the books of Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah, and of IbnulQayyim, and of Muhammad ibn `Abdil-Wahhaab and other than that from the books. These are the books which make the Truth clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And beware of slipping away with the hizbiyyeen, (the sectarians, the people of partisanship) of taking their books and then following their restricted path, and proceeding upon their crooked methodology. “Beware, O my brother Muslim, of taking the books of those people, because their truth is mixed with falsehood and the Sunnah which they have is mixed with bid`ah (innovation).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if you want the pure fountain with no pollution in it, then adhere to the Book of Allaah, and to the books of the Sunnah and to the books of the narrations. And follow the way of the people of the narrations (Ahlul-Athar), those who take knowledge with its chain of narration going all the way back to the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam from their Prophet salawaatullaahi wa salaamuhu `alayh. Whatever they said does not contradict the Truth which they were upon. So here you will know the saying of the author, “And that is because the Sunnah and the Jamaa`ah have clearly/precisely established the affair of the Religion, all of it, and the Truth has become clear to the people, so it is upon the people to follow and to leave off innovating.” Therefore you will know that this is speech which is fully appropriate, and it is binding upon you also to abandon the books of the people of innovation if you want salvation for yourself. May Allaah guide and grant me and you that we take on board the Truth and that we abandon every falsehood; and Allaah grants success.” (Irshaadus-Saaree fee Sharhis-Sunnati lilBarbahaaree)</p>

<p>The author rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And `Umar Ibnul-Khattaab rahimahullaah said, there is no excuse for anyone going astray, thinking that he is upon Guidance, nor for abandoning Guidance thinking it to be misguidance, since the affairs have been made clear, the proof has been established and the excuse has been cut off.”</strong></span> [2]</p>

<p><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/there-is-no-excuse-for-anyone-going-astray-thinking-that-he-is-upon-guidance" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The saying of `Umar radiyAllaahu `anhu <strong>“There is no excuse for anyone&#8230;”</strong> because Allaah has made the Truth clear and He has clarified it in detail in the Qur·aan and in the Sunnah, so there is no excuse for anyone therefore to be upon misguidance, because it is he who has fallen short since he did not seek after the Truth, and he did not ask the People of Knowledge, so the misguidance has come about on account of him himself, so he is the one who has fallen short of what is required.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“thinking that it is guidance&#8230;”</strong> &#8211; this clarifies that supposing/assuming/thinking wrongly something to be the case; this will not suffice with regard to the Truth at all. And Allaah the Majestic and Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And (the devils) hinder them from the true path and they (the people of shirk) think that they are upon right guidance.</span></strong> (Sooratuz-Zukhruf (43), aayah37)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what they consider will not justify and excuse them, so they have no excuse, for they did not refer back to the Book and the Sunnah and become aware of the Truth and distinguish it from falsehood, rather they just followed their desires, and they think that they are guided even though, Allaah has judged that they are guilty of disbelief and misguidance. So a person’s merely thinking that he is upon the Truth does not become an excuse for him, unless nothing from the Divinely sent Revelation which was sent down to the Messengers reaches him. Since what is obligatory upon him is to refer back to the Book and the Sunnah and not just that he remains upon what he thinks and what he considers and upon what other people say to him that it is the Truth. This is not an excuse. And there occurs in the other aayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They took the devils as allies besides Allaah and they think that they are rightly guided.</span></strong> (Sooratul-A`raaf (7), aayah 30)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look how they took devils from mankind and from the jinn as their allies besides Allaah and they followed them and yet they think that they are rightly guided! So do the devils wish good for them? 3] He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever turns away from the remembrance of the Most Merciful then We will appoint for him a devil so he will be his companion.</span></strong> (Sooratuz-Zukhruf (43), aayah 36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look at his Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whoever turns away from the remembrance of the Most Merciful then We will appoint for him a devil&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is his punishment.<br>
&#8230;so he will be his companion. And they&#8230; meaning the devils</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;block them away from the true path and yet still they think that they are rightly guided.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The followers think that they are rightly guided, so that does not benefit them (at all) and there is no excuse for them in that because the call of the Messengers reached them but they did not accept it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather excuse can only be with regard to matters of ijtihaad, matters where there is room for scholars to make personal deduction, things where ijtihaad is permissible; that a person performs ijtihaad, personal scholarly striving. He strives in accordance with is ability and his capability to research to the extent that he thinks that he is then upon the Truth, then he is excused. As is shown by his saying, sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008080;"><strong>“If a judge strives and he is correct, then he will receive two rewards and if he strives and he is in error then there is one reward for him.”</strong></span> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is with regard to matters of ijtihaad. As for matters which are, towqeefiyyah, dependent upon a direct text, and they are the matters of `aqeedah, creed and belief, then no one has the right to delve into them with personal deduction, rather what is obligatory is to follow the evidence. There is no scope for ijtihaad, personal deduction in them (matters of creed and belief).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#008000;">“nor for abandoning guidance thinking it to be misguidance”</span></strong> &#8211; the matter is not left up to what the person considers himself and thinks, so that he adopts misguidance thinking it to be guidance or that he abandons the Truth thinking it to be misguidance. What he thinks and considers here will not excuse and justify him because guidance and misguidance have both been made clear by Allaah in the Qur·aan and they have been made clear by the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam in the Sunnah, and the Salaf have explained these two in their lives and their creeds, so the Truth is clear and all praise is for Allaah. And from the Mercy of Allaah is that the Truth is clear in the Book and the Sunnah and the way of the Salafus-Saalih, the Pious Predecessors. There is no obscurity and confusion about it as occurred for the previous nations, when the time became prolonged for them and the Truth became confused for them and the Books became distorted and changed. But as for this nation, then the Truth remains clear and the Book and the Sunnah are both preserved from distortion and change; so therefore there is no excuse for anyone in this case.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“for the affairs have been made clear”</strong> &#8211; yes the affairs have indeed been made clear, however it needs research and study, that the person learns and acquires knowledge and takes knowledge from the People of Knowledge. He does not take knowledge from himself or from his like from the ignorant people or from those false claimants to knowledge or just from the books, rather he takes the knowledge from its people, because this knowledge should be taken from the `ulamaa·, the People of Knowledge/the scholars. So knowledge is gained by taking it correctly not just by taking it out of books. The books are indeed only tools for research but they are to be explained by the scholars. And as for reaching the Truth then it is taken from the People of Knowledge and narrated from them, the later generations from the earlier ones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and the proof is confirmed and the excuse has been cut off.”</strong> No-one has an excuse. So this Religion has been preserved by Allaah from distortion and from being changed and the Truth has become clear. There is no confusion about it. Contrary to the case with the earlier nations for when the time became prolonged for them, then they distorted and changed their books and they altered them, so therefore the Truth became confused and disappeared.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes</span></strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] It is reported by Aboo Yoosuf in the book al-Kharaaj and Ibn Shabbah in the Taareekh of alMadeenah and Ibn Battah in al-Ibaanah and, Ibn Hazm in al Ihkaam and others, through different chains of narration from `Umar radiyAllaahu `anhu with it. And it is also reported by Aboo Nu`aym in al-Hilyatul-Owliyaa· from `Umar ibn `Abdil `Azeez rahimahullaah (the famous khaleefah, as his saying).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> In the checking of Shaykh Khaalid ar-Raddaadee he mentions with regard to this report that it is reported by Ibn Battah in al-Ibaanatul-Kubraa by way of al-Awzaa`ee that he said that it reached him that `Umar ibn al-Khattaab said this saying. Therefore its chain of narration is disconnected. It is also reported by al-Marwazee in (his book) as-Sunnah as a statement of `Umar ibn `Abdil-`Azeez that he said, “There is no excuse for anyone after the Sunnah to be upon misguidance thinking that it is guidance.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Translator’s note: Of course not</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Reported by al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh (no. 7352) and by Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 1716) as a hadeeth of `Amr ibnul-`Aas and (also a hadeeth of) Aboo Hurayrah radiyAllaahu `anhumaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmee rahimahullaah said in his explanation,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The author rahimahullaah said `Umar ibnul-Khattaab radiyAllaahu `anhu said, “There is no excuse for anyone to be upon misguidance which he is upon thinking it to be Guidance, nor to abandon Guidance thinking it to be misguidance, because the affairs have been made clear and the proof has been established and the excuse has been cut off.” This is tremendous speech which came from a tremendous man, that man who was the second Khaleefah, `Umar ibnul-Khattaab radiyAllaahu `anhu. And this necessitates that whoever puts himself upon misguidance thinking it to be Guidance or who abandons Guidance thinking it to be misguidance, then there will be no excuse for him with Allaah, since this will not be done except by a person who has fallen short of searching for the Truth in the Book and the Sunnah; so therefore there will be no excuse for him. And therefore he said, “because the affairs have been made clear,” meaning, been made clear in the Book of Allaah and in the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and in action of the Companions and the proof has indeed been established upon the people as is shown by His Saying, He the Perfect and Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So that the people should not have any argument left with Allaah after the sending of the Messengers</strong> </span>(Sooratun-Nisaa (4), aayah 165)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So the excuse has been cut off. So there is no excuse for a person who innovates in the Religion or who goes astray or is ignorant of the rulings after Allaah has made them clear and has made them very clear upon the tongue of His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam with what He sent by Revelation to him in the Book and the Sunnah.” (Irshaadus-Saaree fee Sharhis-Sunnati lilBarbahaaree)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Points discussed by Shaykh Saalih al-Fowzaan hafizahullaah:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">There is no excuse for being misguided for the one who did not seek after the Truth</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The excuse can only be in matters of ijtihaad, after striving to reach the Truth</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">There is no scope of ijtihaad in matters of creed and belief</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Truth is clear in the Book and the Sunnah and the way of the Salafus-Saalih</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Book and the Sunnah are both preserved from distortion and change</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">A person must learn from the People of Knowledge, the scholars</li>

<p><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And the foundation upon which the Jamaa`ah is built upon”</strong> – who are the Jamaa`ah who have this status? They are the Companions of Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and those who come after them from the Taabi`een (their successors) and from the successors of the Taabi`een, and the most excellent generations. They are the Jamaa`ah and whoever follows them from the later peoples, they are the Jamaa`ah; those whom it is obligatory upon the Muslims to be with, whatever harm comes upon him and whatever threats and whatever blame and whatever attacks &#8211; he should still have patience upon that and he should bear it, as long as he is upon the Truth. So he should not deviate away from the Truth, rather he should have patience upon whatever befalls him, otherwise he will just be a target for those people with evil intentions and the callers to evil and the callers to misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the first and foremost ones from the Muhaajireen (the Muslims who emigrated from Makkah) and the Ansaar (the Muslims of Madeenah who gave them shelter) and those who followed them upon good. Allaah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him</strong></span>.[1] (Sooratut-Towbah (9), aayah 100)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High, when He mentioned the Muhaajireen and the Ansaar in Sooratul-Hashr, He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And those who come after them they say, O our Lord forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in Eemaan and do not place any ill feeling in our hearts towards those who truly believe. O our Lord, you are Compassionate, Merciful.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Hashr (59), aayah 10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the one who comes later he follows the earlier one from the people of the Truth and good even if there is a long period of time between him and them, he adheres to what they were upon no matter what it costs him, he should have patience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“the Companions of Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam”</strong> &#8211; from the Muhaajireen and the Ansaar because they were the ones who accompanied the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and they fought jihaad along with him and they aided him and they bore the Religion and they conveyed it to us; so they are the intermediaries between us and between Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. So those people who abuse the Companions or belittle them, they only want to demolish Islaam; however they come with this ploy. So when they speak against the Companions and they devalue them, then what will remain at that time from the intermediary that is between us and the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam? Their intent is to cut off the connection with the first and foremost ones from the Muhaajireen and the Ansaar so that the nation will go astray; otherwise what else could lead them to abusing the Companions? Did they have any dispute with the Companions with regard to money or something else? Have the Companions caused them any personal harm when there are many centuries between them and the Companions?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what led them to this is hatred in the hearts, because the Companions they are the ones who bore this Religion. So they want to cut off the link between the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and his nation so that this Religion falls. This is their intent.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and they (the Companions of Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) are the People of the Sunnah and of the Jamaa`ah (the United Body of the Muslims upon the Truth).”</strong> The Companions of Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and those who came after them, those who followed them upon good, they are the People of the Sunnah, meaning the people of the correct path; and it is the ‘Sunnah’ which we have explained in this book (the Sunnah referring to the path that which the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and his Companions were upon).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they are the true Jamaa`ah; but as for the uniting of others besides them, upon false and futile matters then they are not called the Jamaa`ah even if they are many in number.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">You think that they are all together but their hearts are actually divided.</span></strong><br>
(Sooratul-Hashr 59, aayah 14)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Jamaa`ah is whoever is upon the Truth. So the person who says, “I am with such-and-such hizb (party); this group is a jamaa`ah and you people say, “Adhere to the Jamaa`ah” and they are a jamaa`ah.” So we say to them, “Who said to you that those people are the Jamaa`ah. The Jamaa`ah is those who are upon the Truth; whoever is upon the Sunnah, they are the Jamaa`ah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“So whoever does not take from them (the Companions radiyAllaahu `anhum) then he has gone astray and has innovated.”</strong> Whoever does not take his Religion from the Companions, those who are the conveyers of the Book and the Sunnah, then he is not upon the Truth. So if they are attacked and accused then what they convey is nullified, and Allaah’s refuge is sought. And the intent of the enemies of Allaah and His Messenger is indeed to nullify Islaam, however they came with this filthy trick in order to cause a separation between the later people and the early people from the Muslims, so that it will be easy for them to devour the later people and easy to chew them up. But as for if the people tie themselves to the first Jamaa`ah and to the Book and the Sunnah then that will never be easy for them to do, indeed it will be impossible for them to chew them up by the permission of Allaah. His saying, “then he has gone astray” – meaning he has strayed away from the Truth and become lost.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“and he has innovated”</strong>&#8211; Innovation is whatever is from the matters of worship or from matters of creed and beliefs or from sayings and it does not have a proof from the Book and the Sunnah (that is an innovation). He sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;"><strong>“Whoever does an action which our affair is not in accordance with, it is rejected.”</strong> </span>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in a narration,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#339966;">“Whoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it then it is rejected.”</span></strong> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;"><strong>“And beware of newly introduced matters for every newly introduced matter is a bid`ah (an innovation) and every innovation is misguidance”</strong></span> [5].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So innovation is whatever has been introduced into the Religion and it is not from it. And how can it be known that it is not from it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it does not have a daleel, a proof, then it is not from the Religion, because Allaah the Majestic and Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>This day have I completed your Religion for you</strong></span> [6]<br>
(Sooratul-Maa·idah (5), aayah 3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Religion is complete, and all praise is for Allaah; it does not accept any additions. So it is just upon us to come to know of the Religion which Allaah the Mighty and Majestic completed, and to cling to it and that we abandon whatever is besides it from additions and from things which people deem to be good introductions and from supplements and from other than that, because these things only take people farther away from Allaah the Majestic and Most High. And there will follow a clarification that: No people introduce an innovation except that its like (a like amount of it) will be taken away from the Sunnah.[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the correct and straight path, adhering to the Jamaa`ah, adhering to the Sunnah and abandoning innovations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying,<strong> “And every innovation is misguidance”</strong> – so there is no such thing as bid`ah hasanah, ‘good innovation’, as some people say. Rather all innovations are misguidance by the textual statement of the hadeeth of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam when he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#339966;">“For every newly invented matter is an innovation (bid`ah) and every innovation is misguidance.”</span></strong> [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So innovations in the Religion, there is nothing good from them at all, rather all of them are misguidance and this is the speech of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam who did not speak from desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And misguidance and its people will be in the Hell Fire”</strong> &#8211; Misguidance and the people of misguidance will be in the Fire, either on account of their disbelief or on account of sin. So innovations are not of one level only. Some of them are kufr, disbelief, such that its person will be forever in the Fire, such as seeking aid from the dead and making supplication to the dead and making sacrifice to other than Allaah and making vows to other than Allaah &#8211; so these are innovations which are disbelief, kufr. And likewise denying the Names of Allaah and His and Attributes as is said by the Jahmiyyah, those who deny the Names and Attributes. So this is kufr, disbelief, and Allaah’s refuge is sought, because they describe Allaah as not having names or attributes; so in that case He would be nonexistent! Because that which exists must have attributes and the one who has no attributes does not exist. And therefore the Imaams judged that the Jahmiyyah are disbelievers, those who said that the Qur·aan is a created thing. So they made the Qur·aan which is the Speech of Allaah and His Revelation and that which He sent down, they made it a created thing, such as the rest of the created things. And they said Allaah does not speak so therefore they likened Him to an inanimate object; and one who does not speak cannot be a god/one deserving of worship. He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the people of Moosaa in his absence made out of the jewellery of the Copts a calf in bodily form which produced a mooing sound. Do they not then see that it could not speak to them and nor could it guide them upon the way?</strong> </span>(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), aayah 148)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this shows that the one who does not speak cannot be an ilaah, one deserving of worship; whereas the Jahmiyyah say Allaah does not speak, so therefore He would not be one deserving of worship, High and Exalted is Allaah above what they say. And there occurs in Soorah Taahaa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do they not see that it cannot respond to them with any saying and it does not possess any power to harm or benefit them.</strong></span> (Soorah Taahaa (20), aayah 89)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning the calf &#8211; if they were to speak to it, it could not respond to them, so therefore was it befitting that it could be one deserving of worship? [9] And Ibraaheem `alayhissalaam said to the worshippers of the idols:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So ask them if they are able to speak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You already know that they (these idols) can’t speak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So then he said to them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then will you worship besides Allaah that which cannot benefit you at all and cannot harm you. Uff (word of anger and disgust) to you and to that which you worship besides Allaah! Do you have no intellect which prevents you from this?</strong></span> (Sooratul-Anbiyaa· (21), aayahs 66-67)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Majestic and Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord said, call upon Me, I will respond to you.</span><br>
</strong>(Soorah Ghaafir (40), aayah 60)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He described Himself that He says and He speaks. So the one who does not speak He is not one deserving of worship. So therefore many of the Imaams declared the heads of the Jahmiyyah to be disbelievers, but not their blind followers or those who were just followers, those to whom the Truth had not become clear, but rather they were just blindly following upon ignorance. Those people are a case for examination and the matter must be clarified to them, and then if they persist, then judgement that they are disbelievers will be passed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Foot notes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> In tafseer of this aayah ‘And the first and foremost ones’ the people of tafseer such as at-Tabaree and those who came after them like al-Baghawee, as-Sam`aanee, Ibn Katheer and others mention a number of different sayings with regard to who are those actually meant by ‘the first and foremost ones’ (from the Muslims). Amongst what at-Tabaree brings, he brings with an authentic chain of narration from the noble Taabi`ee Sa`eed ibnul-Musayyib that he said, “The first Muhaajireen (referred to here) they are the ones who prayed towards both qiblahs” meaning the ones who accepted Islaam before the qiblah was changed, so they prayed toward Jerusalem then when the qiblah was changed they prayed towards Makkah afterwards.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise the great Salafee mufassir Aboo Muzaffar as-Sam`aanee in his tafseer, he mentioned four saying in explanation of this aayah. One of the sayings, he mentioned this same saying as Sa`eed ibnul Musayyib and he mentioned it also from Ibn Sireen and a group. Then he mentioned three further saying as well with regards to who are ‘the first and foremost ones’. The first saying he mentioned was that they are the people of Badr, meaning the people who fought at Badr; they had accepted Islaam by that time, in the second year. The second saying he quotes is that they are the people of Bay`atur-Ridwaan, the people who gave the pledge at the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah in Thul-Qa`dah in the sixth year. The third saying he quoted is that the first and foremost ones from the Muhaajireen are the ones who accepted Islaam before the Hijrah, and the first and foremost ones from the Ansaar are those who gave the pledge to Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam on the night of `Aqabah just before the Hijrah, those who accepted Islaam in Madeenah and they came for the Hajj and gave the pledge of `Aqabah to Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. Shaykul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah preferred the view that they were those who accepted Islaam before the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, and as it is known that those at the treaty of Hudaybiyyah were one thousand and four hundred and more in number. Likewise Shaykh al-Fowzaan said the same thing in his explanation of al-Waasitiyyah, that ‘the first and foremost ones’ refers to those who had accepted Islaam before the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah in the eleventh month of the sixth year. An evidence for that is an aayah from Sooratul-Hadeed (57), aayah 10:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are not equal, those who spent in charity before the Conquest (meaning the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah) and who fought&#8230;(to the end of the aayah)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee hafizahullaah said in his explanation, “The author rahimahullaah explained the importance of following and of adhering to this methodology, and that the foundation of that methodology is what we have explained a short while ago, that the foundation of the Jamaa`ah is, after Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, the Companions ridwaanullaahi `alayhim ajma`een (may Allaah be pleased with them all). So whoever makes an attack upon the Companions then he has made an attack upon the whole of Islaam and whoever abuses the Companions then he has abused Islaam and whoever maligns and attacks the Companions, then he has spoken against and accused Islaam and whoever belittles the Companions then he has belittled Islaam. Why is this the case? Because they are the ones who conveyed Islaam to us so if it were not for them Islaam would not have reached us, if it were not for the Companions, Islaam would not have reached us, for Islaam only came to us by way of them. They are the ones who conveyed the Qur·aan to us and they are the ones who conveyed the Sunnah to us and therefore Allaah praised them for that&#8230; So whoever claims that they left Islaam, became apostates (the same as the Raafidah Shee`ah say) or that they changed and altered then he is the apostate and he is the one who is changing and altering and he is the one who is making a change in the Religion.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Reported by Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 1718) and reported by al-Bukhaaree in disconnected form in his Saheeh from a hadeeth of Aa`ishah radiyAllaahu `anhaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Reported by al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh (no.2 550) and by Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 1718) from Aa`ishah radiyAllaahu `anhaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] This is part of a hadeeth of al-`Irbaad ibn Saariyah radiyAllaahu `anhu, and its checking has preceded. Translator’s side point: The checking of this hadeeth is reported by Imaam Ahmad and Aboo Daawood and at-Tirmithee and Ibn Maajah and it was declared authentic by Shaykh al-Albaanee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> This aayah came down on the day of `Arafah on the 10th year of the Hijrah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(There is) a famous saying from Imaam Maalik: So whatever was not Religion on that day it will never be Religion today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] Hassaan ibn `Atiyyah (from the Taabi`een) rahimahullaah said, “A people never introduce an innovation in their Religion except that Allaah takes away from their Sunnah its like and then He does not return it to them right until the Day of Resurrection.” Reported by ad-Daarimee and Aboo Nu`aym in al-Hilyah and al-Laalikaa·ee in Sharh Usool I`tiqaad Ahlis-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> With regards to this Taabi`ee, Hassaan ibn Atiyyah, Shaykh al-Albaanee said in his notes to al-Mishkaat, “He was a great and noble Taabi`ee who died in the year 130.” Shaykh alAlbaanee said with regard to this report from him, “Its chain of narration is saheeh and its like is also reported as a saying of Aboo Hurayrah radiyAllaahu `anhu reported by Abul-`Abbaas ibn al-Assam in his hadeeth.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] This occurs in a number of ahaadeeth, from them the hadeeth of al-`Irbaad ibn Saariyah which has just preceded, also a hadeeth of Jaabir reported by an-Nasaa·ee (no. 1578) and also by Ibn Khuzaymah in his Saheeh; and the basis of this hadeeth occurs in Saheeh Muslim (no. 768).</p>

<p><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 03 : Point 02</strong><br><strong> Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>



<p><span class="fontstyle0">The author (Imaam al-Barbahaaree) </span>rahimahullaah <span class="fontstyle0">said,</span></p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><strong>“So from the Sunnah is adhering to the Jamaa`ah. And whoever desires other than the Jamaa`ah and departs from it, then he has thrown off the yoke of Islaam from his neck, and he is astray leading others astray.”</strong></span></p>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls="" src="https://archive.org/download/sharh-us-sunnah-dawood-burbank/02.From%20the%20Sunnah%20is%20adhering%20to%20the%20Jamaa%60ah.mp3"></audio></figure>



<p><strong>[<a href="https://archive.org/download/sharh-us-sunnah-dawood-burbank/02.From%20the%20Sunnah%20is%20adhering%20to%20the%20Jamaa%60ah.mp3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><strong>The Explanation </strong></span>(Transcription of above Audio)<span style="color: #993300"><strong>:</strong></span></p>



<p>His saying, “<strong>So from the Sunnah is adhering to the Jamaa`ah’</strong> (the United Body of the Muslims upon the Truth). Since that is the case, and since Islaam is the Sunnah and the Sunnah is Islaam, then the Sunnah is of different types. So from the Sunnah is adhering to the Jamaa`ah – meaning adhering to the United Body of the Muslims, and what is meant by the Jamaa`ah here is the United Body of the Muslims who are upon the Truth [3].</p>



<p>As for the jama`aat, the groups which are not upon the Truth, then these are not called the true Jamaa`ah. Every jamaa`ah which gathers upon misguidance or upon a methodology contrary to Islaam or upon a way contrary to Islaam, then it is not called the true Jamaa`ah, that which is required and praiseworthy.</p>



<p>So the Jamaa`ah, the United Body, which is meant here, they are the people of the Truth and this does not necessitate that they must be numerous, rather even if it is a single person upon the Truth then he will be called the Jamaa`ah, the United Body.</p>



<p>So the Jamaa`ah is those who are upon the Truth, whether its people are few or whether they are many. So you adhere to whoever is upon the Truth and you do not contradict the Jamaa`ah which is upon the Truth, rather you should be with them upon the Truth. So whoever splits from the Jamaa`ah, the United Body, then explanation of this will follow.</p>



<p>And, “<strong>Adhering to the Jamaa`ah</strong>” means not departing from it and not conflicting with it. [4]</p>



<p>His saying, “<strong>And whoever desires other than the Jamaa`ah and splits from it then he has thrown off the yoke of Islaam from his neck</strong>’ – this is the text of a hadeeth:</p>



<p>“<span style="color: #008000"><strong>Whoever separates from the Jamaa`ah by the amount of a hand span then he has thrown off the yoke of Islaam from his neck</strong></span>.” [5]</p>



<p>This is a severe threat. So if the splitting away is with regard to `aqeedah (creed and belief) such that he comes to worship other than Allaah then this is kufr (disbelief). And if the splitting away is less than that then it will be misguidance. So splitting away from the Jamaa`ah, there is no good in it. And there occurs in the hadeeth: “Adhere to the Jamaa`ah for the Hand of Allaah is upon the Jamaa`ah” [6].</p>



<p>And when the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam informed Huthayfah ibn alYamaan of the trials and tribulations that would occur and the splitting that was going to occur, Huthayfah said to him, “What do you command me with if that reaches me?” So he said, “<span style="color: #008000"><strong>That you should adhere to the Jamaa`ah (United Body of the Muslims upon the Truth) and their ruler</strong></span>.” [7]</p>



<p><span style="color: #808000"><strong>So the Jamaa`ah will not be except by way of two matters:</strong></span></p>



<p><strong>The first matter:</strong> is that the person is upon the methodology, the way, of the Book and the Sunnah. Its methodology is not the math.hab (the way) of so-and-so, nor the saying of so-and-so rather the Book and the Sunnah.</p>



<p><strong>The second matter</strong>&nbsp;which comprises the Jamaa`ah: is that it has an imaam (a Muslim ruler) who leads it and to whom it refers back. It is not possible for a Jamaa`ah to unite without an imaam; there must be a ruler for it to turn back to, and therefore he said to Huthayfah, “<strong>Adhere to the Jamaa`ah of the Muslims and their ruler</strong>.” So then he (Huthayfah radiyAllaahu `anh) said, “What if they do not have a United Body nor a ruler?” Then he (sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) said, “<strong>Then avoid all of those sects.</strong>”</p>



<p>He ordered him to avoid all of the sects, so he should not be except with the United Body of the Muslims and he should not be with the jama`aat, the different groups, other than the Jamaa`ah of the Muslims, rather he should remain alone upon the Truth until death comes to him while he remains upon that.</p>



<p>So this shows that a person should not be with the jama`aat, the groups, which conflict with the true methodology and they will not be the Jamaa`ah except with two conditions; that their methodology is the Book and the Sunnah and the methodology, the way, of the Pious Predecessors and (secondly) that they have a Muslim ruler who leads them and they refer back to. So there will be no religion except with the Jamaa`ah, United Body of the Muslims, and there will be no Jamaa`ah except with the ruler and there will be no ruler except with hearing and obeying. This is the methodology of the Muslims and this is the Sunnah which he rahimahullaah explained.</p>



<p>So this contains a prohibition of isolated and irregular opinions and conflicting acts and that a person should adhere to the Jamaa`ah as long as they are not upon misguidance.</p>



<p>His saying, “<strong>then he has thrown off the yoke of Islaam from his neck</strong>” – it used to be the custom of the Arabs that they would put a cord or heavy rope upon the sheep, upon their necks so that the sheep would not become separate and become lost and become eaten by the wolves, and these ropes would be connected by a single rope which joined them together to safeguard them. So the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam likened adhering to the Jamaa`ah to this matter, for the Jamaa`ah is the rope which protects from those things which bring about destruction; just like the rope, which is upon the necks of the sheep, protects them from the wolf and from being lost.</p>



<p>His saying, “<strong>and he is misguided, misguiding others</strong>” – meaning misguided himself away from the path, misguiding other people. So he is misguided himself and misguiding other people who take him as an example and follow him. He the Most High says:</p>



<p><span style="color: #008000"><strong>And whoever contends with the Messenger after the guidance has been made clear to him and then he follows other than the way of the believers, then We will put him upon the path he has chosen and enter him into Hell Fire and what an evil destination.</strong> </span>(Sooratun-Nisaa· (4),aayah 115)</p>



<p>So what is obligatory upon the Muslim is to follow the path of the Believers and not to be at variance with them and not to isolate himself away from them</p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>



<p>[3] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh al-Albaanee rahimahullaah mentioned in his notes to Mishkaat alMasaabeeh, Volume 1, page 61, the statement of `Abdullaah ibn Mas`ood radiyAllaahu `anhu in that regard, that he said, “The Jamaa`ah is whatever conforms to the Truth even you are alone.” Shaykh alAlbaanee said this is reported by Ibn Asaakir in his Taareekh Dimashq, volume 13, page 322 part number 2, with an authentic, a saheeh chain from him.</p>



<p>[4] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee hafizahullaah said on this same point, “He (alBarbahaaree) encouraged adherence to the Jamaa`ah, and the Jamaa`ah is al- Firqatun-Naajiyah, the Saved Sect, as proven by his sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam saying in the hadeeth of Mu`aawiyah radiyAllaahu `anhu when he mentioned the splitting of the Ummah that it will split into seventy-three sects, all of them being in the Fire. So they said, ‘What is it, O Messenger of Allaah?’ So he said, ‘It is the Jamaa`ah.’ This was the narration of Ibn Maajah and it is the most authentic of the narrations and it is more authentic than the narration of at-Tirmithee (when Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam was asked which one was the saved one he said) ‘That which is upon the like of what I and my Companions are upon today.’ Even though there is no difference between the two sentences with regard to the meaning, so each one of them emphasises the other one.</p>



<p>“So the Jamaa`ah is, to mention it in brief, the Companions and the Taabi`een and those who followed them upon good, those who are upon that which the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam was upon and his Companions. This is the most precise and the most excellent and the most comprehensive and all-inclusive definition that it is possible to give to the Jamaa`ah. And there are some people who limit the Jamaa`ah to the time of the Companions, or limit it to the time of the rightly guided Khulafaa·, or the like of that. This is a restriction of something very wide, which Allaah has made wide, because Allaah the Exalted and Most High says, “And the first and foremost from the Muhaajireen and the Ansaar and those who follow them upon good, Allaah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him.” So what is meant by the Jamaa`ah is: whoever is upon the methodology in any time and in any city, whoever is upon the methodology which the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and his Companions were upon in their sayings and actions and creed and belief, then he is from the Jamaa`ah and whoever splits from that and isolates himself from it, then he has split from the Jamaa`ah. And there occurs a severe threat upon those who split from the Jamaa`ah, that he has isolated himself, and whoever isolates himself will do so and be in the Fire, and whoever separates from the Jamaa`ah by a hand span then he has thrown off the yoke of Islaam from his neck.”</p>



<p>[5] Reported by Imaam Ahmad and at-Tirmithee and Ibn Khuzaymah and Ibn Hibbaan and al-Haakim and others as a hadeeth of Al-Haarith al-Ash`aree radiyAllaahu `anhu and it was declared to be saheeh by Imaam at-Tirmithee and ibn Khuzaymah and ibn Hibbaan and al-Haakim and others.</p>



<p><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> It was declared saheeh by Muhammad Naasirud-Deen al-Albaanee rahimahullaah.</p>



<p>[6] Reported by Imaam Ahmad and al-Humaydee and at-Tirmithee and an-Nasaa·ee in his Sunan alKubraa and Ibn Hibaan and al-Haakim and others besides them from the hadeeth of `Umar radiyAllaahu `anhu with wordings which are close to each other. At-Tirmithee said the hadeeth is ‘hasan saheeh ghareeb, (good, authentic, singular) with this chain here’. And it was declared saheeh, authentic, by Ibn Hibaan and al-Haakim and ath-Thahabee agreed.</p>



<p><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> It was declared authentic by Shaykh al-Albaanee.</p>



<p>[7] Reported by al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh (no. 3411) and reported by Muslim (no. 1847) as a hadeeth of Huthayfah radiyAllaahu `anh.</p>

<p><span style="color: #333300"><strong><span class="fontstyle3">“Know that Islaam is the Sunnah and the Sunnah is Islaam and one of them cannot be established without the other. “ </span></strong></span></p>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls="" src="https://archive.org/download/sharh-us-sunnah-dawood-burbank/01.The%20Sunnah%20is%20Islaam%20and%20Islaam%20is%20the%20Sunnah.mp3"></audio></figure>



<p><strong>[<a href="https://archive.org/download/sharh-us-sunnah-dawood-burbank/01.The%20Sunnah%20is%20Islaam%20and%20Islaam%20is%20the%20Sunnah.mp3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><strong>The Explanation </strong></span>(Transcription of above Audio)<span style="color: #993300"><strong>:</strong></span></p>



<p>His saying, “<strong>Know</strong>” – this is a word used to show importance, and the meaning of ‘i`lam’, ‘know’ is ‘ta`allam’ ‘learn’. And how will you know that Islaam is the Sunnah? If you learn, then you will know that.</p>



<p>So ‘i`lam’ ‘know’ is a word which is brought to show the importance of that which comes after it, just as He the Most High said:</p>



<p><strong>So know, that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and seek forgiveness for your sin.</strong> (Soorah Muhammad (47), aayah 19)</p>



<p>Meaning: Know the meaning of ‘laa ilaaha illAllaah’ (‘none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah’) and act upon it.</p>



<p><strong>Know that Allaah is severe in punishing and that Allaah forgives extensively and shows mercy.</strong> (Sooratul- Maa·idah (5), aayah 98)</p>



<p>So the word <strong>‘i’lam’ ‘know’</strong> (a command in the singular) or i`lamoo (a command in the plural) occurs to show the importance of that which comes after it.</p>



<p>His saying, “<strong>Islaam is the Sunnah and the Sunnah is Islaam</strong>” – meaning Islaam is the way which the Messengers alayhimus-salaatu was-salaam came with. And every Messenger came with Islaam. So every Prophet called to Allaah and came with a sharee`ah, a revealed way, from Allaah, so that is Islaam. So Islaam is the worship of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, alone at every time with that which He legislated. And Allaah legislated for the Prophets ways and laws to last for appointed terms. Then He abrogated it (brought some new law and abrogated the previous one), so when that was abrogated then action came to be upon that which abrogated, that is Islaam, until all those revealed laws were abrogated by the revealed way sent to Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. Allaah the Majestic and Most High says:</p>



<p><strong>There is an appointed time span for each Book sent down by Allaah. Allaah abrogates and changes whatever He wishes and He confirms. And the foundation of the Book is with Him.</strong> (Sooratur-Ra`d (13), aayah 38-39)</p>



<p>So Islaam is that which the Messengers came with, with regard to the call and the action at every time with what was specific to it, until the sending of Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam came about; and then Islaam is whatever he came with to the exclusion of everything else. So therefore whoever remains upon the previous religious ways and does not believe in Muhammad sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam then he is not a Muslim, since he has not yielded or submitted to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and he has not obeyed this Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam; because what he was upon has now ended and been abrogated, and remaining upon something abrogated (something replaced) is not a religion for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, rather acting on what abrogates (what comes later and replaces) that is the religion.[1]</p>



<p>His saying, “<strong>and the Sunnah is Islaam</strong>” – there is no difference between these two, if we explain the Sunnah to mean ‘the way’, the ‘tareeqah’, then there is no difference between it and Islaam.</p>



<p>His saying, “<strong>And one of them will not be established without the other one</strong>’ – Islaam will not be established except through the Sunnah and the Sunnah will not be established except through Islaam. So the person who claims to be upon Islaam but does not act upon the Sunnah, meaning the way of the Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, then he is not a Muslim; and the person who knows of the Sunnah but does not submit to Allaah, then he is not a Muslim, even if he knows about the Sunnah. So it is essential to combine both of them.[2]</p>



<p><strong><span style="color: #993300">Footnotes:</span></strong></p>



<p><strong>[1] Translator’s side point:</strong> The noble Shaykh, Saalih ibn Sa`d as-Suhaymee, hafizahullaah, (the teacher who used to be in charge of the department of `aqeedah in Madeenah) said referring to this initial part of al-Barbahaaree’s book, “He, rahimahullaah, began with the fact that the Sunnah and Islaam are inseparable. And what is meant by the Sunnah here is the Sunnah with its general meaning which is the tareeqah, the way, which the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam and his Companions were upon. So this is Islaam and Islaam is the Sunnah in this sense.”</p>



<p><strong>[2] Translator’s side point:</strong> The noble Shaykh, Ahmad ibn Yahyaa an-Najmee rahimahullaah said in his explanation, Irshaadus-Saaree, page 26, on this same point that Islaam is the Sunnah and the Sunnah is Islaam and one of them will not be established without the other, “Islaam is the Sunnah and the Sunnah is Islaam. How is that the case? Meaning that true Islaam is the Sunnah, so whoever is upright upon the Sunnah and establishes it then he has established Islaam, and whoever deviates away from it (from the Sunnah) and inclines away towards the right or the left, then he has fallen short with regard to true Islaam, in accordance with his deviation. However this inclining away is of two categories. Firstly turning away totally, such that the person becomes a disbeliever and judgement is passed about him that he has exited from Islaam altogether. Secondly is a partial turning away (from the Sunnah) through which a person does not become a disbeliever and he is not judged to be an apostate or to have left Islaam however he has rendered his Islaam deficient in accordance with the level of his deviation, whether it be a small deviation or a large one.”</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Or like the one who passed by a town in ruin up to its roofs. He said: &#8220;How will Allah ever bring it to life after its death&#8221; So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him up (again). He said: &#8220;How long did you remain (dead)&#8221; He (the man) said: &#8220;(Perhaps) I remained (dead) a day or part of a day.&#8221; He said: &#8220;Nay, you have remained (dead) for a hundred years, look at your food and your drink, they show no change; and look at your donkey! And thus We have made of you a sign for the people. Look at the bones, how We bring them together and clothe them with flesh.&#8221; When this was clearly shown to him, he said, &#8220;I know (now) that Allah is able to do all things.&#8221;</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 2.259)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(Have you not looked at him who disputed with Ibrahim about his Lord)</span> means, &#8220;Have you seen anyone like the person who disputed with Ibrahim about his Lord&#8221; Then, Allah connected the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(Or like the one who passed by a town in ruin up to its roofs)</span> to the Ayah above by using `or&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Ali bin Abi Talib said that the Ayah (2:259) meant `Uzayr. Ibn Jarir also reported it, and this explanation was also reported by Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim from Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and Sulayman bin Buraydah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujahid bin Jabr said that the Ayah refers to a man from the Children of Israel, and the village was Jerusalem, after Nebuchadnezzar destroyed it and killed its people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(in ruin)</span> means, it became empty of people. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(up to its roofs)</span> indicates that the roofs and walls (of the village) fell to the ground. `Uzayr stood contemplating about what had happened to that city, after a great civilization used to inhabit it. He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(Oh! How will Allah ever bring it to life after its death)</span> because of the utter destruction he saw and the implausibility of its returning to what it used to be. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him up (again).)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The city was rebuilt seventy years after the man (`Uzayr) died, and its inhabitants increased and the Children of Israel moved back to it. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>When Allah resurrected `Uzayr after he died, the first organ that He resurrected were his eyes, so that he could witness what Allah does with him, how He brings life back to his body.</strong></span> When his resurrection was complete, Allah said to him, meaning through the angel,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(&#8220;How long did you remain (dead)&#8221; He (the man) said: &#8220;(Perhaps) I remained (dead) a day or part of a day.&#8221;)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars said that since the man died in the early part of the day and Allah resurrected him in the latter part of the day, when he saw that the sun was still apparent, he thought that it was the sun of that very day. He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(&#8220;Or part of a day. &#8221; He said: &#8220;Nay, you have remained (dead) for a hundred years, look at your food and your drink, they show no change.&#8221;)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He had grapes, figs and juice, and he found them as he left them; neither did the juice spoil nor the figs become bitter nor the grapes rot.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(And look at your donkey!),</span> &#8220;How Allah brings it back to life while you are watching.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(And thus We have made of you a sign for the people)</span> that Resurrection occurs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(Look at the bones, how We Nunshizuha)</span> meaning, collect them and put them back together. In his Mustadrak, Al-Hakim, recorded that Kharijah bin Zayd bin Thabit said that his father said that the Messenger of Allah read this Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(how We Nunshizuha.)</span> Al-Hakim said; &#8220;Its chain is Sahih and they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not record it.&#8221; The Ayah was also read,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(نُنْشِرُهَا)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Nunshiruha&#8221; meaning, bring them back to life, as Mujahid stated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(And clothe them with flesh. )</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Suddi said, &#8221; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>`Uzayr observed the bones of his donkey, which were scattered all around him to his right and left, and Allah sent a wind that collected the bones from all over the area. Allah then brought every bone to its place, until they formed a full donkey made of fleshless bones. Allah then covered these bones with flesh, nerves, veins and skin. Allah sent an angel who blew life in the donkeys&#8217; nostrils, and the donkey started to bray by Allah&#8217;s leave.&#8221; All this occurred while `Uzayr was watching</strong></span>, and this is when he proclaimed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(He said, &#8220;I know (now) that Allah is able to do all things,&#8221;)</span> meaning, &#8220;I know that, and I did witness it with my own eyes. Therefore, I am the most knowledgeable in this matter among the people of my time.&#8221;</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwa no. 1304</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: The questioner would like to be given a general idea about the Qadiriyyah Tariqah (Sufi order). He read one of the Qadiriyyah books: <em>&#8220;Al-Fiyudat Al-Rabbaniyyah fi Al-Ma&#8217;athir wa Al-Awrad Al-Qadiriyyah&#8221;</em>, and saw a poem including some of the claims and feats performed by the shaykh of this Tariqah. He asks if what is said in this poem is true or untrue. The questioner sent the poem along with his question to ask for a general Fatwa (legal opinion issued by a qualified Muslim scholar) on it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The poem that was sent by the questioner shows that the one who wrote it was ignorant, as the things that he ascribes to himself are Kufr (disbelief) and misguidance. He claims that all the scholars&#8217; knowledge has been derived from his knowledge and is part of him. He also claims that the Servants&#8217; behavior is according to what he legislates for them and that he would be able to close the Fire due to his greatness, except for a prior pledge taken from the Prophet. He says he can help those of his Murid (students) who are loyal to him and save them from ordeals, protect them in this world and in the Hereafter, secure them from fear, and be with them at the Mizan (the Scales for weighing deeds) on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are false claims, and could only be said by someone who is ignorant and does not know his own ability. Comprehensive knowledge is possessed by Allah Alone, as are the matters related to the Hereafter, and He Alone has control over them; not an angel, a prophet, or a pious person. Allah commanded His Messenger, who was the best of His Creation, to recite to the Ummah (nation) His Words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8220;I possess no power over benefit or harm to myself except as Allâh wills. If I had the knowledge of the Ghaib (Unseen), I should have secured for myself an abundance of wealth, and no evil should have touched me. I am but a warner, and a bringer of glad tidings unto people who believe</strong></span>.&#8221; (Surah Al-A`raf, 7: 188)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Say: &#8220;It is not in my power to cause you harm, or to bring you to the Right Path.&#8221; </strong></span>(Surah Al-Jinn, 72: 21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8220;None can protect me from Allâh’s punishment (if I were to disobey Him), nor can I find refuge except in Him</strong></span>.&#8221; (Surah Al-Jinn, 72: 22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) told those closest to him to save themselves and their children from Allah&#8217;s Punishment through having Iman (Faith) in Him (Glorified be He) and by acting according to His Shari`ah (laws). He also told them that Allah is not in need of them and that Adam, Nuh (Noah), Ibrahim (Abraham) and `Isa (Jesus) will be saying on the Day of Resurrection, &#8220;Myself, myself!&#8221; So how can a shaykh of the Qadiriyyah Tariqah or anyone else created by Allah save their followers, protect those who are loyal to them, and come with them when their deeds are being weighed on the Day of Resurrection? And how could he close the gates of Hell by his greatness? <strong>This is a manifest fabrication and clear Kufr regarding the Shari`ah of the Lord of the Worlds</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author of this poem has been excessive in his exaggeration and has overstepped the boundaries of the senses,the intellect, and the Shari`ah, when he claims that he was in the light of Muhammad before the existence of creation, and that he witnessed the meeting of friends, i.e. when Jibril (Gabriel) met with Muhammad (peace be upon them both); he was with Nuh (peace be upon him) in the ark and witnessed the flood; he was with Ibrahim (peace be upon him) when he was thrown to the fire and saw how the fire cooled due to his Du`a&#8217; (supplication); he was with Isma`il (Ishmael) and that the ram was only sent except by his generosity; he was with Ya`qub (Jacob, peace be upon him) when his sight was taken away and that his eyes were only cured with his spit; he was the one who settled Idris (Enoch, peace be upon him) in Jannah (Paradise); he was with Musa (Moses, peace be upon him) when he talked to his Lord and that Musa&#8217;s stick was taken from his stick; he was with `Isa (peace be upon him) in the cradle; and that it was he who gave Dawud (David) his beautiful voice for recitation. He also makes even more obscene claims than these, as he claims that he is Allah in three verses of his poem, the clearest of which is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I am the one, the only, and the great one in himself,<br>
I am the describer and the described; the shaykh of the Tariqah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah be Exalted and Glorified from this great exceeding of the bounds; <strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">is there anything worse than this sheer Kufr?</span> </strong>May Allah protect us from it!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Dear questioner, may Allah turn you away from this evil you heard and make you feel no need to study the detailed history and biography of the Qadiriyyah, and what is in this poem by the shaykh of this Tariqah in terms of falsehood, Kufr, and exaggeration. Exert yourself instead to learn the truth from the Book of Allah(Exalted be He), the Sunnah of His Prophet (peace be upon him), and the explanations of the Salaf (pious predecessors) from among the Sahabah (Companions) and their followers of the Qur&#8217;an and the Sahih (authentic) Sunnah. We believe that <strong>Shaykh `Abdul-Qadir Al-Jilany</strong>, to whom this Tariqah is ascribed, is as innocent of what is in this poem as the wolf was innocent of the blood of Yaqub&#8217;s son. His followers tell many lies about him and ascribe to him that which he is innocent of.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>
