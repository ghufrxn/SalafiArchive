<h3 align="center">Hunting, Slaughtering</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.067.384"></a>Volume 7, Book 67, Number 384:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Adi bin Hatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked the Prophet about the game killed by a Mi&#8217;rad (i.e. a sharp-edged piece of wood or a piece of wood provided with a sharp piece of iron used for hunting). He said, &#8220;If the game is killed with its sharp edge, eat of it, but if it is killed with its shaft, with a hit by its broad side then the game is (unlawful to eat) for it has been beaten to death.&#8221; I asked him about the game killed by a trained hound. He said, &#8220;If the hound catches the game for you, eat of it, for killing the game by the hound, is like its slaughtering. But if you see with your hound or hounds another dog, and you are afraid that it might have shared in hunting the game with your hound and killed it, then you should not eat of it, because you have mentioned Allah&#8217;s name on (sending) your hound only, but you have not mentioned it on some other hound</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 385:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Adi bin Hatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about the Mi&#8217;rad. He said, &#8220;If you hit the game with its sharp edge, eat it, but if the Mi&#8217;rad hits the game with its shaft with a hit by its broad side do not eat it, for it has been beaten to death with a piece of wood. (i.e. unlawful).&#8221; I asked, &#8220;If I let loose my trained hound after a game?&#8221; He said, &#8220;If you let loose your trained hound after game, and mention the name of Allah, then you can eat.&#8221; I said, &#8220;If the hound eats of the game?&#8221; He said &#8220;Then you should not eat of it, for the hound has hunted the game for itself and not for you.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Some times I send my hound and then I find some other hound with it?&#8221; He said &#8220;Don&#8217;t eat the game, as you have mentioned the Name of Allah on your dog only and not on the other.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 386:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Adi bin Hatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We let loose our trained hounds after a game?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Eat what they hunt for you.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Even if they killed (the game)?&#8221; He replied, &#8216;Even if they killed (the game).&#8221; I said, &#8216;We also hit (the game) with the Mi&#8217;rad?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Eat of the animal which the Mi&#8217;rad kills by piercing its body, but do not eat of the animal which is killed by the broad side of the Mi&#8217;rad.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 387:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Tha&#8217;laba Al-Khushani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! We are living in a land ruled by the people of the Scripture; Can we take our meals in their utensils? In that land there is plenty of game and I hunt the game with my bow and with my hound that is not trained and with my trained hound. Then what is lawful for me to eat?&#8221; He said, &#8220;As for what you have mentioned about the people of the Scripture, if you can get utensils other than theirs, do not eat out of theirs, but if you cannot get other than theirs, wash their utensils and eat out of it. If you hunt an animal with your bow after mentioning Allah&#8217;s Name, eat of it. and if you hunt something with your trained hound after mentioning Allah&#8217;s Name, eat of it, and if you hunt something with your untrained hound (and get it before it dies) and slaughter it, eat of it.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 388:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Maghaffal:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that he saw a man throwing stones with two fingers (at something) and said to him, &#8220;Do not throw stones, for Allah&#8217;s Apostle has forbidden throwing stones, or e used to dislike it.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah added: Throwing stones will neither hunt the game, nor kill (or hurt) an enemy, but it may break a tooth or gouge out an eye.&#8221; Afterwards &#8216;Abdullah once again saw the man throwing stones. He said to him, &#8220;I tell you that Allah&#8217;s Apostle has forbidden or disliked the throwing the stones (in such a way), yet you are throwing stones! I shall not talk to you for such-and-such a period.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 389:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever keeps a (pet) dog which is neither a watch dog nor a hunting dog, will get a daily deduction of two Qirat from his good deeds.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 390:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;If someone keeps a dog neither for hunting, nor for guarding livestock, the reward (for his good deeds) will be reduced by two Qirats per day.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 391:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;If someone keeps a dog neither for guarding livestock, nor for hunting, his good deeds will decrease (in reward) by two Qirats a day.&#8217;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 392:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Adi bin Hatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle. &#8220;We hunt with the help of these hounds.&#8221; He said, &#8220;If you let loose your trained hounds after a game, and mention the name of Allah, then you can eat what the hounds catch for you, even if they killed the game. But you should not eat of it if the hound has eaten of it, for then it is likely that the hound has caught the game for itself. And if other hounds join your hound in hunting the game, then do not eat of it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 393:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Adi bin Hatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;If you let loose your hound after a game and mention Allah&#8217;s Name on sending it, and the hound catches the game and kills it, then you can eat of it. But if the hound eats of it, then you should not eat thereof, for the hound has caught it for itself. And if along with your hound, join other hounds, and Allah&#8217;s Name was not mentioned at the time of their sending, and they catch an animal and kill it, you should not ea: of it, for you will not know which of them has killed it. And if you have thrown an arrow at the game and then find it (dead) two or three days later and, it bears no mark other than the wound inflicted by your arrow, then you can eat of it. But if the game is found (dead) in water, then do not eat of it.&#8221; And it has also been narrated by &#8216;Adi bin Hatim that he asked the Prophet &#8220;If a hunter throws an arrow at the game and after tracing it for two or three days he finds it dead but still bearing his arrow, (can he eat of it)?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;He can eat if he wishes.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 394:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Adi bin Hatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I let loose my hound after a game and mention Allah&#8217;s Name on sending it.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;If you let loose your hound after a game and you mention Allah&#8217;s Name on sending it and the hound catches and kills the game and eats of it, then you should not eat of it, for it has killed it for itself.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Sometimes when I send my hound after a game, I find another hound along with it and I do not know which of them has caught the game.&#8221; He said, &#8220;You must not eat of it because you have not mentioned, the Name of Allah except on sending your own hound, and you did not mention it on the other hound.&#8221; Then I asked him about the game hunted with a Mi&#8217;rad (i.e. a sharp edged piece of wood or a piece of wood provided with a sharp piece of iron used for hunting). He said, &#8220;If the game is killed with its sharp edge, you can eat of it, but if it is killed by its broad side (shaft), you cannot eat of it, for then it is like an animal beaten to death with a pie</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 395:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Adi Bin Hatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle, &#8220;We hunt with these hounds.&#8221; He said, &#8220;If you send your trained hounds after a game and mention Allah&#8217;s Name on sending, you can eat of what they catch for you. But if the hound eats of the game, then you must not eat of it, for I am afraid that the hound caught it for itself, and if another hound joins your hounds (during the hunt), you should not eat of the game.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 396:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Tha&#8217;laba Al-Khushani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We are living in the land of the people of the Scripture and we take our meals in their utensils, and in the land there is game and I hunt with my bow and trained or untrained hounds; please tell me what is lawful for us of that.&#8221; He said, &#8220;As for your saying that you are living in the land of the people of the Scripture and that you eat in their utensils, if you can get utensils other than theirs, do not eat in their utensils, but if you do not find (other than theirs), then wash their utensils and eat in them. As for your saying that you are in the land of game, if you hung something with your bow, and have mentioned Allah&#8217;s Name while hunting, then you can eat (the game). And if you hunt something with your trained hound, and have mentioned Allah&#8217;s Name on sending it for hunting then you can eat (the game). But if you hunt something with your untrained hound and you were able to slaughter it before its death, you can eat of it.&#8221;</p>

I was riding my horse and I used to be fond of ascending mountains. So while I was doing so I noticed that the people were looking at something. I went to see what it was, and behold it was an onager. I asked my companions, &#8220;What is that?&#8221; They said, &#8220;We do not know.&#8221; I said, &#8220;It is an onager.&#8217; They said, &#8220;It is what you have seen.&#8221; I had left my whip, so I said to them, &#8220;Hand to me my whip.&#8221; They said, &#8220;We will not help you in that (in hunting the onager).&#8221; I got down, took my whip and chased the animal (on my horse) and did not stop till I killed it. I went to them and said, &#8220;Come on, carry it!&#8221; But they said, &#8220;We will not even touch it.&#8221; At last I alone carried it and brought it to them. Some of them ate of it and some refused to eat of it. I said (to them), &#8220;I will ask the Prophet about it (on your behalf).&#8221; When I met the Prophet, I told him the whole story. He said to me, &#8220;Has anything of it been left with you?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Eat, for it is a meal Allah has offered to you.&#8221;</p>

Abu Musa said (to him), &#8220;Come on (and eat), for I have seen Allah&#8217;s Apostle eating of it (i.e. chicken).&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have seen it eating something (dirty) and since then I have disliked it, and have taken an oath that I shall not eat it &#8216; Abu Musa said, &#8220;Come on, I will tell you (or narrate to you). Once I went to Allah s Apostle with a group of Al-Ash&#8217;ariyin, and met him while he was angry, distributing some camels of Rakat. We asked for mounts but he took an oath that he would not give us any mounts, and added, &#8216;I have nothing to mount you on&#8217; In the meantime some camels of booty were brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and he asked twice, &#8216;Where are Al-Ash&#8217;ariyin?&#8221; So he gave us five white camels with big humps. We stayed for a short while (after we had covered a little distance), and then I said to my companions, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle has forgotten his oath. By Allah, if we do not remind Allah&#8217;s Apostle of his oath, we will never be successful.&#8221; So we returned to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We asked you for mounts, but you took an oath that you would not give us any mounts; we think that you have forgotten your oath.&#8217; He said, &#8216;It is Allah Who has given you mounts. By Allah, and Allah willing, if I take an oath and later find something else better than that. then I do what is better and expiate my oath.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Once we provoked a rabbit at Marr-az-Zahran. The people chased it till they got tired. Then I caught It and brought it to Abu Talha, who slaughtered it and then sent both its pelvic pieces (or legs) to the Prophet, and the Prophet accepted the present.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle and I entered the house of Maimuna. A roasted mastigure was served. Allah&#8217;s Apostle stretched his hand out (to eat of it) but some woman said, &#8220;Inform Allah&#8217;s Apostle of what he is about to eat.&#8221; So they said, &#8220;It is mastigure, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; He withdrew his hand, whereupon I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Is it unlawful?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No, but this is not found in the land of my people, so I dislike it.&#8221; So I pulled the mastigure towards me and ate it while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was looking at me.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 446:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Maimuna:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that Ibn &#8216;Umar disliked the branding of animals on the face. Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;The Prophet forbade beating (animals) on the face.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Rait&#8217; bin Khadij:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to the Prophet, &#8220;We will be facing the enemy tomorrow and we have no knives (for slaughtering)&#8217; He said, &#8220;If you slaughter the animal with anything that causes its blood to flow out, and if Allah&#8217;s Name is mentioned on slaughtering it, eat of it, unless the killing instrument is a tooth or nail. I will tell you why: As for the tooth, it is a bone; and as for the nail, it is the knife of Ethiopians.&#8221; The quick ones among the people got the war booty while the Prophet was behind the people. So they placed the cooking pots on the fire, but the Prophet ordered the cooking pots to be turned upside down. Then he distributed (the war booty) among them, considering one camel as equal to ten sheep. Then a camel belonging to the first party of people ran away and they had no horses with them, so a man shot it with an arrow whereby Allah stopped it. The Prophet said, &#8220;Of these animals there are some which are as wild as wild beasts. So, if anyone of them runs away like this, do like this (shoot it with an arrow).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 452:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Rafi bin Khadij:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While we were with the Prophet. on a journey, one of the camels ran away. A man shot it with an arrow and stopped it. The Prophet said, &#8220;Of these camels some are as wild as wild beasts, so if one of them runs away and you cannot catch it, then do like this (shoot it with an arrow).&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Sometimes when we are in battles or on a journey we want to slaughter (animals) but we have no knives.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Listen! If you slaughter the animal with anything that causes its blood to flow out, and if Allah&#8217;s Name is mentioned on slaughtering it, eat of it, provided that the slaughtering instrument is not a tooth or a nail, as the tooth is a bone and the nail is the knife of Ethiopians.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl bin Sad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A tumbler (full of milk or water) was brought to the  Prophet who drank from it, while on his right side there was sitting a boy who was the  youngest of those who were present and on his left side there were old men. The Prophet  asked, &#8220;O boy, will you allow me to give it (i.e. the rest of the drink) to the old  men?&#8221; The boy said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I will not give preference to anyone  over me to drink the rest of it from which you have drunk.&#8221; So, the Prophet gave it  to him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Az-Zuhri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Anas bin Malik said, that once a domestic sheep was milked  for Allah&#8217;s Apostle while he was in the house of Anas bin Malik. The milk was mixed with  water drawn from the well in Anas&#8217;s house. A tumbler of it was presented to Allah&#8217;s  Apostle who drank from it. Then Abu Bakr was sitting on his left side and a bedouin on his  right side. When the Prophet removed the tumbler from his mouth, &#8216;Umar was afraid that the  Prophet might give it to the bedouin, so he said. &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Give it to Abu  Bakr who is sitting by your side.&#8221; But the Prophet gave it to the bedouin, who was to  his right and said, &#8220;You should start with the one on your right side.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;No bloodmoney will be charged  if somebody dies in a mine or in a well or is killed by an animal; and if somebody finds a  treasure in his land he has to give one-fifth of it to the Government.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah (bin Mas&#8217;ud): </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever takes a false oath to  deprive somebody of his property will meet Allah while He will be angry with him.&#8221;  Allah revealed: &#8216;Verily those who purchase a little gain at the cost of Allah&#8217;s covenant,  and their oaths.&#8217; &#8230;&#8230;..(3.77) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Al-Ash&#8217;ath came (to the place where &#8216;Abdullah was  narrating) and said, &#8220;What has Abu &#8216;Abdur-Rahman (i.e. Abdullah) been telling you?  This verse was revealed concerning me. I had a well in the land of a cousin of mine. The  Prophet asked me to bring witnesses (to confirm my claim). I said, &#8216;I don&#8217;t have  witnesses.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Let the defendant take an oath then.&#8217; I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He  will take a (false) oath immediately.&#8217; Then the Prophet mentioned the above narration and  Allah revealed the verse to confirm what he had said.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 692) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 40, Number 547: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;There are three persons whom  Allah will not look at on the Day of Resurrection, nor will he purify them and theirs  shall be a severe punishment. They are: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>1. A man possessed superfluous water, on a way and he  withheld it from travelers. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>An Ansari man quarrelled with Az-Zubair in the presence of  the Prophet about the Harra Canals which were used for irrigating the date-palms. The  Ansari man said to Az-Zubair, &#8220;Let the water pass&#8217; but Az-Zubair refused to do so.  So, the case was brought before the Prophet who said to Az-Zubair, &#8220;O Zubair!  Irrigate (your land) and then let the water pass to your neighbor.&#8221; On that the  Ansari got angry and said to the Prophet, &#8220;Is it because he (i.e. Zubair) is your  aunt&#8217;s son?&#8221; On that the color of the face of Allah&#8217;s Apostle changed (because of  anger) and he said, &#8220;O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) and then withhold the water till  it reaches the walls between the pits round the trees.&#8221; Zubair said, &#8220;By Allah,  I think that the following verse was revealed on this occasion&#8221;: &#8220;But no, by  your Lord They can have No faith Until they make you judge In all disputes between  them.&#8221; (4.65) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When a man from the Ansar quarrelled with AzZubair, the  Prophet said, &#8220;O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) first and then let the water flow (to  the land of the others).&#8221; &#8220;On that the Ansari said, (to the Prophet), &#8220;It  is because he is your aunt&#8217;s son.&#8221; On that the Prophet said, &#8220;O Zubair! Irrigate  till the water reaches the walls between the pits around the trees and then stop (i.e. let  the water go to the other&#8217;s land).&#8221; I think the following verse was revealed  concerning this event: &#8220;But no, by your Lord They can have No faith Until they make  you judge In all disputes between them.&#8221; (4.65) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>An-Ansari man quarrelled with Az-Zubair about a canal in  the Harra which was used for irrigating date-palms.

Irrigate (your land) first and then leave the water for  your neighbor.&#8221; The Ansari said, &#8220;Is it because he is your aunt&#8217;s son?&#8221; On  that the color of the face of Allah&#8217;s Apostle changed and he said, &#8220;O Zubair!  Irrigate (your land) and withhold the water till it reaches the walls that are between the  pits around the trees.&#8221; So, Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave Zubair his full right. Zubair said,  &#8220;By Allah, the following verse was revealed in that connection&#8221;: &#8220;But no,  by your Lord They can have No faith Until they make you judge In all disputes between  them.&#8221; (4.65) </font></p>

So he (went down the well), filled his shoe with  water, caught hold of it with his teeth and climbed up and watered the dog. Allah thanked  him for his (good) deed and forgave him.&#8221; The people asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  Is there a reward for us in serving (the) animals?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Yes, there is a  reward for serving any animate.&#8221; </font></p>

If she had left the water of Zam-Zam (fountain) as it was, (without  constructing a basin for keeping the water), (or said, &#8220;If she had not taken handfuls  of its water&#8221;), it would have been a flowing stream. Jurhum (an Arab tribe) came and  asked her, &#8216;May we settle at your dwelling?&#8217; She said, &#8216;Yes, but you have no right to  possess the water.&#8217; They agreed.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;There are three types of people  whom Allah will neither talk to, nor look at, on the Day of Resurrection. (They are): </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>1. A man who takes an oath falsely that he has been offered  for his goods so much more than what he is given, </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>2. a man who takes a false oath after the &#8216;Asr prayer in  order to grab a Muslim&#8217;s property, and </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>3. a man who with-holds his superfluous water. Allah will  say to him, &#8220;Today I will with-hold My Grace from you as you with-held the  superfluity of what you had not created.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Keeping horses may be a source  of reward to some (man), a shelter to another (i.e. means of earning one&#8217;s living), or a  burden to a third. He to whom the horse will be a source of reward is the one who keeps it  in Allah&#8217;s Cause (prepare it for holy battles) and ties it by a long rope in a pasture (or  a garden). He will get a reward equal to what its long rope allows it to eat in the  pasture or the garden, and if that horse breaks its rope and crosses one or two hills,  then all its foot-steps and its dung will be counted as good deeds for its owner; and if  it passes by a river and drinks from it, then that will also be regarded as a good deed  for its owner even if he has had no intention of watering it then. Horses are a shelter  from poverty to the second person who keeps horses for earning his living so as not to ask  others, and at the same time he gives Allah&#8217;s right (i.e. Rakat) (from the wealth he earns  through using them in trading etc.,) and does not overburden them. He who keeps horses  just out of pride and for showing off and as a means of harming the Muslims, his horses  will be a source of sins to him.&#8221; When Allah&#8217;s Apostle was asked about donkeys, he  replied, &#8220;Nothing particular was revealed to me regarding </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and asked about Al-Luqata (a  fallen thing). The Prophet said, &#8220;Recognize its container and its tying material and  then make a public announcement about it for one year and if its owner shows up, give it  to him; otherwise use it as you like.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;What about a lost  sheep?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;It is for you, your brother or the wolf.&#8221; The  man said &#8220;What about a lost camel?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Why should you take  it as it has got its water-container (its stomach) and its hooves and it can reach the  places of water and can eat the trees till its owner finds it?&#8221; </font></p>

I let both of them kneel at the door of one of the Ansar, intending to carry  Idhkhir on them to sell it and use its price for my wedding banquet on marrying Fatima. A  goldsmith from Bam Qainqa&#8217; was with me. Hamza bin &#8216;Abdul-Muttalib was in that house  drinking wine and a lady singer was reciting: &#8220;O Hamza! (Kill) the (two) fat old she  camels (and serve them to your guests).&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So Hamza took his sword and went towards the two she-camels  and cut off their humps and opened their flanks and took a part of their livers.&#8221; (I  said to Ibn Shihab, &#8220;Did he take part of the humps?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;He cut  off their humps and carried them away.&#8221;) &#8216;Ali further said, &#8220;When I saw that  dreadful sight, I went to the Prophet and told him the news. The Prophet came out in the  company of Zaid bin Haritha who was with him then, and I too went with them. He went to  Hamza and spoke harshly to him. Hamza looked up and said, &#8216;Aren&#8217;t you only the slaves of  my forefathers?&#8217; The Prophet retreated and went out. This incident happened before the  prohibition of drinking.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.046.693">Volume 3, Book 46, Number 693: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever frees a Muslim slave, Allah  will save all the parts of his body from the (Hell) Fire as he has freed the body-parts of  the slave.&#8221; Said bin Marjana said that he narrated that Hadith to &#8216;Ali bin Al-Husain  and he freed his slave for whom &#8216;Abdullah bin Ja&#8217;far had offered him ten thousand Dirhams  or one-thousand Dinars. </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.046.694"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 694: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Dhar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked the Prophet, &#8220;What is the best deed?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;To believe in Allah and to fight for His Cause.&#8221; I then asked,  &#8220;What is the best kind of manumission (of slaves)?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;The  manumission of the most expensive slave and the most beloved by his master.&#8221; I said,  &#8220;If I cannot afford to do that?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Help the weak or do good for a  person who cannot work for himself.&#8221; I said, &#8220;If I cannot do that?&#8221; He  said, &#8220;Refrain from harming others for this will be regarded as a charitable deed for  your own good.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 695: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Asma&#8217; bint Abu Bakr: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet ordered us to free slaves at the time of solar  eclipses. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.046.696"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 696: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Asma&#8217; bint Abu Bakr: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were ordered to free slaves at the time of lunar  eclipses. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.046.697"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 697: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever manumits a slave owned by  two masters, should manumit him completely (not partially) if he is rich after having its  price evaluated.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.046.698"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 698: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whoever frees his share of a  common slave and he has sufficient money to free him completely, should let its price be  estimated by a just man and give his partners the price of their shares and manumit the  slave; otherwise (i.e. if he has not sufficient money) he manumits the slave  partially.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.046.699"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 699: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whoever manumits his share of a  slave, then it is essential for him to get that slave manumitted&#8217; completely as long as he  has the money to do so. If he has not sufficient money to pay the price of the other  shares (after the price of the slave is evaluated justly), the manumitted manumits the  slave partially in proportion to his share. </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.046.700"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 700: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ubaidullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>as above BRIEFLY. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.046.701"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 701: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;He who manumits his share of a  slave and has money sufficient to free the remaining portion of that slave&#8217;s price (justly  estimated) then he should manumit him (by giving the rest of his price to the other  co-owners).&#8221; Nafi&#8217; added, &#8220;Otherwise the slave is partially free.&#8221; Aiyub is  not sure whether the last statement was said by Nafi&#8217; or it was a part of the Hadith. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.046.702"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 702: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That he used to give his verdict regarding the male or  female slaves owned by more than one master, one of whom may manumit his share of the  slave. Ibn &#8216;Umar used to say in such a case, &#8220;The manumitted should manumit the slave  completely if he has sufficient money to pay the rest of the price of that slave (which is  to be justly estimated) and the other share-holders are to take the price of their shares  and the slave is freed (released from slavery).&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar narrated this verdict from  the Prophet. </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.046.703"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 703: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that the Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever frees his portion of a  (common) slave.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.046.704"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 704: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever frees his portion of a  common slave should free the slave completely by paying the rest of his price from his  money if he has enough money; otherwise the price of the slave is to be estimated and the  slave is to be helped to work without hardship till he pays the rest of his price.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 705: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah has accepted my invocation to  forgive what whispers in the hearts of my followers, unless they put it to action or utter  it.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 657 Vol. 8) </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.046.706"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 706: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The (reward of) deeds depend on  intentions, and every person will get the reward according to what he intends. So, whoever  migrated for Allah and His Apostle, then his migration will be for Allah and His Apostle,  and whoever migrated for worldly benefits or for marrying a woman, then his migration will  be for what he migrated for.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 1, Vol. 1) </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.046.707"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 707: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Qais: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Abu Huraira accompanied by his slave set out intending  to embrace Islam they lost each other on the way. The slave then came while Abu Huraira  was sitting with the Prophet. The Prophet said, &#8220;O Abu Huraira! Your slave has come  back.&#8221; Abu Huraira said, &#8220;Indeed, I would like you to witness that I have  manumitted him.&#8221; That happened at the time when Abu Huraira recited (the following  poetic verse):&#8211; &#8216;What a long tedious tiresome night! Nevertheless, it has delivered us  From the land of Kufr (disbelief). </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.046.708"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 708: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On my way to the Prophet I was reciting:&#8211; &#8216;What a long  tedious tiresome night! Nevertheless, it has saved us From the land of Kufr (disbelief).&#8217;  I had a slave who ran away from me on the way. When I went to the Prophet and gave the  pledge of allegiance for embracing Islam, the slave showed up while I was still with the  Prophet who remarked, &#8220;O Abu Huraira! Here is your slave!&#8221; I said, &#8220;I  manumit him for Allah&#8217;s Sake,&#8221; and so I freed him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 709: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Qais: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Abu Huraira accompanied by his slave came intending to  embrace Islam, they lost each other on the way. (When the slave showed up) Abu Huraira  said (to the Prophet), &#8220;I make you witness that the slave is free for Allah&#8217;s  Cause.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 46, Number 710: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Utba bin Abi Waqqas authorized his brother Sad bin Abi  Waqqas to take the son of the slave-girl of Zam&#8217;a into his custody, telling him that the  boy was his own (illegal) son. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle went (to Mecca) at the time of the  Conquest, Sad took the son of the slavegirl of Zam&#8217;a to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and also brought  &#8216;Abu bin Zam&#8217;a with him and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! This is the son of my brother  &#8216;Utba who authorized me to take him into my custody.&#8221; &#8216;Abu bin Zam&#8217;a said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He is my brother, the son of Zam&#8217;a&#8217; slave-girl and he was born on his  bed.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle looked at the son of the slave-girl of Zam&#8217;a and noticed much  resemblance (to &#8216;Utba). Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;It is for you, O &#8216;Abu bin Zam&#8217;a as he  was born on the bed of your father.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then told Sauda bint Zam&#8217;a to  observe veil in the presence of the boy as he noticed the boy&#8217;s resemblance to &#8216;Utba and  Sauda was the wife of the Prophet . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I bought Buraira but her masters put the condition that her  Wala&#8217; would be for them. I told the Prophet about it. He said (to me), &#8220;Manumit her  as her Wala&#8217; will be for the one who pays the price.&#8221; So, I manumitted her. The  Prophet called Buraira and gave her the option of either staying with her husband or  leaving him. She said, &#8220;Even if he gave me so much money, I would not stay with  him,&#8221; and so she preferred her freedom to her husband. </font></p>

When he embraced Islam he again slaughtered  one-hundred camels and manumitted one-hundred slaves. Hakim said, &#8220;I asked Allah&#8217;s  Apostle, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What do you think about some good deeds I used to practice in  the prelslamic period of ignorance regarding them as deeds of righteousness?&#8217; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said, &#8220;You have embraced Islam along with all those good deeds you did.&#8221;  </font></p>

The Prophet stood  up and said to them, &#8220;I have other people with me in this matter (as you see) and the  most beloved statement to me is the true one; you may choose either the properties or the  prisoners as I have delayed their distribution.&#8221; The Prophet had waited for them for  more than ten days since his arrival from Ta&#8217;if. So, when it became evident to them that  the Prophet was not going to return them except one of the two, they said, &#8220;We choose  our prisoners.&#8221; The Prophet got up amongst the people and glorified and praised Allah  as He deserved and said, &#8220;Then after, these brethren of yours have come to us with  repentance, and I see it logical to return them the captives. So, whoever amongst you  likes to do that as a favor, then he can do it, and whoever of you likes to stick to his  share till we recompense him from the very first war booty which Allah will give us, then  he can do so (i.e. give up the present captives).&#8221; The people unanimously said,  &#8220;We do that (return the captives) willingly.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;We do not  know which of you has agreed to it and which have not, so go back and let your leaders  forward us your decision.&#8221; So, all the people then went back and discussed the matter  with their leaders who returned and informed the Prophet that all the people had willingly  given their consent to return the captives. This is what has reached us about the captives  of Hawazin. Narrated Anas that &#8216;Abbas said to the Prophet, &#8220;I paid for my ransom and  Aqil&#8217;s ransom.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Aun: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I wrote a letter to Nafi and Nafi wrote in reply to my  letter that the Prophet had suddenly attacked Bani Mustaliq without warning while they  were heedless and their cattle were being watered at the places of water. Their fighting  men were killed and their women and children were taken as captives; the Prophet got  Juwairiya on that day. Nafi said that Ibn &#8216;Umar had told him the above narration and that  Ibn &#8216;Umar was in that army. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I saw Abu Said and asked him about coitus interruptus. Abu  Said said, &#8220;We went with Allah&#8217;s Apostle, in the Ghazwa of Barli Al-Mustaliq and we  captured some of the &#8216;Arabs as captives, and the long separation from our wives was  pressing us hard and we wanted to practice coitus interruptus. We asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle  (whether it was permissible). He said, &#8220;It is better for you not to do so. No soul,  (that which Allah has) destined to exist, up to the Day of Resurrection, but will  definitely come, into existence.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I have loved the people of the tribe of Bani Tamim ever  since I heard, three things, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said about them. I heard him saying, These  people (of the tribe of Bani Tamim) would stand firm against Ad-Dajjal.&#8221; When the  Sadaqat (gifts of charity) from that tribe came, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;These are the  Sadaqat (i.e. charitable gifts) of our folk.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha had a slave-girl from that  tribe, and the Prophet said to &#8216;Aisha, &#8220;Manumit her as she is a descendant of Ishmael  (the Prophet).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I saw Abu Dhar Al-Ghifari wearing a cloak, and his slave,  too, was wearing a cloak. We asked him about that (i.e. how both were wearing similar  cloaks). He replied, &#8220;Once I abused a man and he complained of me to the Prophet .  The Prophet asked me, &#8216;Did you abuse him by slighting his mother?&#8217; He added, &#8216;Your slaves  are your brethren upon whom Allah has given you authority. So, if one has one&#8217;s brethren  under one&#8217;s control, one should feed them with the like of what one eats and clothe them  with the like of what one wears. You should not overburden them with what they cannot  bear, and if you do so, help them (in their hard job).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That &#8216;Aisha told him that Buraira came to seek her help in  her writing of emancipation (for a certain sum) and that time she had not paid anything of  it. &#8216;Aisha said to her, &#8220;Go back to your masters, and if they agree that I will pay  the amount of your writing of emancipation and get your Wala&#8217;, I will do so.&#8221; Buraira  informed her masters of that but they refused and said, &#8220;If she (i.e. &#8216;Aisha) is  seeking Allah&#8217;s reward, then she can do so, but your Wala&#8217; will be for us.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha  mentioned that to Allah&#8217;s Apostle who said to her, &#8220;Buy and manumit her, as the Wala&#8217;  is for the liberator.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then got up and said, &#8220;What about the  people who stipulate conditions which are not present in Allah&#8217;s Laws? Whoever imposes  conditions which are not present in Allah&#8217;s Laws, then those conditions will be invalid,  even if he imposed these conditions a hundred times.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Buraira came (to &#8216;Aisha) and said, &#8220;I have made a  contract of emancipation with my masters for nine Uqiyas (of gold) to be paid in yearly  installments. Therefore, I seek your help.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;If your masters agree,  I will pay them the sum at once and free you on condition that your Wala&#8217; will be for  me.&#8221; Buraira went to her masters but they refused that offer. She (came back) and  said, &#8220;I presented to them the offer but they refused, unless the Wala&#8217; was for  them.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle heard of that and asked me about it, and I told him about it.  On that he said, &#8220;Buy and manumit her and stipulate that the Wala&#8217; should be for you,  as Wala&#8217; is for the liberator.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle then got up  amongst the people, Glorified and Praised Allah, and said, &#8216;Then after: What about some  people who impose conditions which are not present in Allah&#8217;s Laws? So, any condition  which is not present in Allah&#8217;s Laws is invalid even if they were one-hundred conditions.  Allah&#8217;s ordinance is the truth, and Allah&#8217;s condition is stronger and more solid. Why do  some men from you say, O so-and-so! manumit the slave but the Wala will be for me? Verily,  the Wala is for the liberator.&#8221; </font></p>

The sons of &#8216;Utba stipulated that my Wala&#8217; should be for them.&#8221;  &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;Buraira came to me and she was given the writing of emancipation by her  masters and she asked me to buy and manumit her. I agreed to it, but Buraira told me that  her masters would not sell her unless her Wala&#8217; was for them.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;I  am not in need of that.&#8221; When the Prophet heard that, or he was told about it, he  asked &#8216;Aisha about it. &#8216;Aisha mentioned what Buraira had told her. The Prophet said,  &#8220;Buy and manumit her and let them stipulate whatever they like.&#8221; So, &#8216;Aisha  bought and manumitted her and her masters stipulated that her Wala&#8217; should be for  them.&#8221; The Prophet;, said, &#8220;The Wala&#8217; will be for the liberator even if they  stipulated a hundred conditions.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.042.608">Volume 3, Book 42, Number 608: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I found a purse containing one hundred Diners. So I went to  the Prophet (and informed him about it), he said, &#8220;Make public announcement about it  for one year&#8221; I did so, but nobody turned up to claim it, so I again went to the  Prophet who said, &#8220;Make public announcement for another year.&#8221; I did, but none  turned up to claim it. I went to him for the third time and he said, &#8220;Keep the  container and the string which is used for its tying and count the money it contains and  if its owner comes, give it to him; otherwise, utilize it.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The sub-narrator Salama said, &#8220;I met him (Suwaid,  another sub-narrator) in Mecca and he said, &#8216;I don&#8217;t know whether Ubai made the  announcement for three years or just one year.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 42, Number 609: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A bedouin went to the Prophet and asked him about picking  up a lost thing. The Prophet said, &#8220;Make public announcement about it for one year.  Remember the description of its container and the string with which it is tied; and if  somebody comes and claims it and describes it correctly, (give it to him); otherwise,  utilize it.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What about a lost sheep?&#8221; The  Prophet said, &#8220;It is for you, for your brother (i.e. its owner), or for the  wolf.&#8221; He further asked, &#8220;What about a lost camel?&#8221; On that the face of the  Prophet became red (with anger) and said, &#8220;You have nothing to do with it, as it has  its feet, its water reserve and can reach places of water and drink, and eat trees.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 42, Number 610: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sulaiman bin Bilal from Yahya: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Yazid Maula Al-Munba&#8217;ith heard Zaid bin Khalid al-Juham  saying, &#8220;The Prophet was asked about Luqata. He said, &#8216;Remember the description of  its container and the string it is tied with, and announce it publicly for one year.&#8217;  &#8221; Yazid added, &#8220;If nobody claims then the person who has found it can spend it,  and it is regarded as a trust entrusted to him.&#8221; Yahya said, &#8220;I do not know  whether the last sentences were said by the Prophet or by Yazid.&#8221; Zaid further said,  &#8220;The Prophet was asked, &#8216;What about a lost sheep?&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;Take it, for it  is for you or for your brother (i.e. its owner) or for the wolf.&#8221; Yazid added that it  should also be announced publicly. The man then asked the Prophet about a lost camel. The  Prophet said, &#8220;Leave it, as it has its feet, water container (reservoir), and it will  reach a place of water and eat trees till its owner finds it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 42, Number 611: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Zaid bin Khalid: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man came and asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about picking a lost  thing. The Prophet said, &#8220;Remember the description of its container and the string it  is tied with, and make public announcement about it for one year. If the owner shows up,  give it to him; otherwise, do whatever you like with it.&#8221; He then asked, &#8220;What  about a lost sheep?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;It is for you, for your brother (i.e.  its owner), or for the wolf.&#8221; He further asked, &#8220;What about a lost camel?&#8221;  The Prophet said, &#8220;It is none of your concern. It has its water-container (reservoir)  and its feet, and it will reach water and drink it and eat the trees till its owner finds  it.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.042.612"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 42, Number 612: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet passed a date fallen on the way and said,  &#8220;Were I not afraid that it may be from a Sadaqa (charitable gifts), I would have  eaten it.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, &#8220;Sometimes  when I return home and find a date fallen on my bed, I pick it up in order to eat it, but  I fear that it might be from a Sadaqa, so I throw it.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.042.613"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 42, Number 613: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah gave victory to His Apostle over the people of  Mecca, Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up among the people and after glorifying Allah, said,  &#8220;Allah has prohibited fighting in Mecca and has given authority to His Apostle and  the believers over it, so fighting was illegal for anyone before me, and was made legal  for me for a part of a day, and it will not be legal for anyone after me. Its game should  not be chased, its thorny bushes should not be uprooted, and picking up its fallen things  is not allowed except for one who makes public announcement for it, and he whose relative  is murdered has the option either to accept a compensation for it or to retaliate.&#8221;  Al-&#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Except Al-ldhkhir, for we use it in our graves and houses.&#8221;  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Except Al-ldhkhir.&#8221; Abu Shah, a Yemenite, stood up and  said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Get it written for me.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said,  &#8220;Write it for Abu Shah.&#8221; (The sub-narrator asked Al-Auza&#8217;i): What did he mean by  saying, &#8220;Get it written, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;The speech which  he had heard from Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.042.614"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 42, Number 614: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;An animal should not be milked  without the permission of its owner. Does any of you like that somebody comes to his store  and breaks his container and takes away his food? The udders of the animals are the stores  of their owners where their provision is kept, so nobody should milk the animals of  somebody else, without the permission of its owner.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about the Luqata. He said,  &#8220;Make public announcement of it for one year, then remember the description of its  container and the string it is tied with, utilize the money, and if its owner comes back  after that, give it to him.&#8221; The people asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What about a  lost sheep?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Take it, for it is for you, for your  brother, or for the wolf.&#8221; The man asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What about a lost  camel?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle got angry and his cheeks or face became red, and said,  &#8220;You have no concern with it as it has its feet, and its water-container, till its  owner finds it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 42, Number 616: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Suwaid bin Ghafala: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I as in the company of Salman bin Rabi&#8217;a and Suhan,  in one of the holy battles, I found a whip. One of them told me to drop it but I refused  to do so and said that I would give it to its owner if I found him, otherwise I would  utilize it. On our return we performed Hajj and on passing by Medina, I asked Ubai bin  Ka&#8217;b about it. He said, &#8220;I found a bag containing a hundred Dinars in the lifetime of  the Prophet and took it to the Prophet who said to me, &#8216;Make public announcement about it  for one year.&#8217; So, I announced it for one year and went to the Prophet who said, &#8216;Announce  it publicly for another year.&#8217; So, I announced it for another year. I went to him again  and he said, &#8220;Announce for an other year.&#8221; So I announced for still another  year. I went to the Prophet for the fourth time, and he said, &#8216;Remember the amount of  money, the description of its container and the string it is tied with, and if the owner  comes, give it to him; otherwise, utilize it.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Salama: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>the above narration (Hadith 616) from Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b:  adding, &#8220;I met the sub-narrator at Mecca later on, but he did not remember whether  Ka&#8217;b had announced what he had found one year or three years.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.042.618"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 42, Number 618: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Zaid bin Khalid: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A bedouin asked the Prophet about the Luqata. The Prophet  said, &#8220;Make public announcement about it for one year and if then somebody comes and  describes the container of the Luqata and the string it was tied with, (give it to him);  otherwise, spend it.&#8221; He then asked the Prophet about a lost camel. The face of the  Prophet become red and he said, &#8220;You have o concern with it as it has its water  reservoir and feet and it will reach water and drink and eat trees. Leave it till its  owner finds it.&#8221; He then asked the Prophet about a lost sheep. The Prophet said,  &#8220;It is for you, for your brother, or for the wolf.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.042.619"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 42, Number 619: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Bakr: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was on my way, all of a sudden I saw a shepherd  driving his sheep, I asked him whose servant he was. He replied that he was the servant of  a man from Quraish, and then he mentioned his name and I recognized him. I asked, &#8220;Do  your sheep have some milk?&#8221; He replied in the affirmative. I said, &#8220;Are you  going to milk for me?&#8221; He replied in the affirmative. I ordered him and he tied the  legs of one of the sheep. Then I told him to clean the udder (teats) of dust and to remove  dust off his hands. He removed the dust off his hands by clapping his hands. He then  milked a little milk. I put the milk for Allah&#8217;s Apostle in a pot and closed its mouth  with a piece of cloth and poured water over it till it became cold. I took it to the  Prophet and said, &#8220;Drink, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; He drank it till I was pleased. </font></p>

<h3 align="center">Retiring to a Mosque for Remembrance ofAllah (I&#8217;tikaf)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.033.242"></a>Volume 3, Book 33, Number 242:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah bin Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to practise Itikaf in the last ten days of the month of Ramadan.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 243:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) The Prophet used to practice Itikaf in the last ten days of Ramadan till he died and then his wives used to practice Itikaf after him.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 244:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to practice Itikaf in the middle ten days of Ramadan and once he stayed in Itikaf till the night of the twenty-first and it was the night in the morning of which he used to come out of his Itikaf. The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever was in Itikaf with me should stay in Itikaf for the last ten days, for I was informed (of the date) of the Night (of Qadr) but I have been caused to forget it. (In the dream) I saw myself prostrating in mud and water in the morning of that night. So, look for it in the last ten nights and in the odd ones of them.&#8221; It rained that night and the roof of the mosque dribbled as it was made of leaf stalks of date-palms. I saw with my own eyes the mark of mud and water on the forehead of the Prophet (i.e. in the morning of the twenty-first).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 245:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to (put) bend his head (out) to me while he was in Itikaf in the mosque during my monthly periods and I would comb and oil his hair.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 246:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to let his head in (the house) while he was in the mosque and I would comb and oil his hair. When in Itikaf he used not to enter the house except for a need.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 247:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to embrace me during my menses. He also used to put his head out of the mosque while he was in Itikaf, and I would wash it during my menses.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 248:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar asked the Prophet &#8220;I vowed in the Pre-lslamic period of ignorance to stay in Itikaf for one night in Al-Masjid al-Haram.&#8221; The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Fulfill your vow.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 249:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aisha said, &#8220;the Prophet used to practice Itikaf in the last ten days of Ramadan and I used to pitch a tent for him, and after offering the morning prayer, he used to enter the tent.&#8221; Hafsa asked the permission of &#8216;Aisha to pitch a tent for her and she allowed her and she pitched her tent. When Zainab bint Jahsh saw it, she pitched another tent. In the morning the Prophet noticed the tents. He said, &#8216;What is this?&#8221; He was told of the whole situation. Then the Prophet said, &#8220;Do you think that they intended to do righteousness by doing this?&#8221; He therefore abandoned the Itikaf in that month and practiced Itikaf for ten days in the month of Shawwal.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 250:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet intended to practice Itikaf and when he reached the place where he intended to perform Itikaf, he saw some tents, the tents of &#8216;Aisha, Hafsa and Zainab. So, he said, &#8220;Do you consider that they intended to do righteousness by doing this?&#8221; And then he went away and did not perform Itikaf (in Ramadan) but performed it in the month of Shawwal for ten days.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 251:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ali bin Al-Husain:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Safiya, the wife of the Prophet told me that she went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to visit him in the mosque while he was in Itikaf in the last ten days of Ramadan. She had a talk with him for a while, then she got up in order to return home. The Prophet accompanied her. When they reached the gate of the mosque, opposite the door of Um-Salama, two Ansari men were passing by and they greeted Allah&#8217;s Apostle . He told them: Do not run away! And said, &#8220;She is (my wife) Safiya bint Huyai.&#8221; Both of them said, &#8220;Subhan Allah, (How dare we think of any evil) O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; And they felt it. The Prophet said (to them), &#8220;Satan reaches everywhere in the human body as blood reaches in it, (everywhere in one&#8217;s body). I was afraid lest Satan might insert an evil thought in your minds.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 252:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Salama bin &#8216;Abdur-Rahman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Abu Said Al-Khudri, &#8220;Did you hear Allah&#8217;s Apostle talking about the Night of Qadr?&#8221; He replied in the affirmative and said, &#8220;Once we were in Itikaf with Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the middle ten days of (Ramadan) and we came out of it in the morning of the twentieth, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle- delivered a sermon on the 20th (of Ramadan) and said, &#8216;I was informed (of the date) of the Night of Qadr (in my dream) but had forgotten it. So, look for it in the odd nights of the last ten nights of the month of Ramadan. I saw myself prostrating in mud and water on that night (as a sign of the Night of Qadr). So, whoever had been in Itikaf with Allah&#8217;s Apostle should return for it.&#8217; The people returned to the mosque (for Itikaf). There was no trace of clouds in the sky. But all of a sudden a cloud came and it rained. Then the prayer was established (they stood for the prayer) and Allah&#8217;s Apostle prostrated in mud and water and I saw mud over the forehead and the nose of the Prophet.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 253:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the wives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle practiced Itikaf with him while she ad bleeding in between her periods and she would see red (blood) or yellowish traces, and sometimes we put a tray beneath her when she offered the prayer.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 254:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali bin Al-Husain (from Safiya, the Prophet&#8217;s wife):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The wives of the Prophet were with him in the mosque (while he was in Itikaf) and then they departed and the Prophet said to Safiya bint Huyai, &#8220;Don&#8217;t hurry up, for I shall accompany you,&#8221; (and her dwelling was in the house of Usama). The Prophet went out and in the meantime two Ansari men met him and they looked at the Prophet and passed by. The Prophet said to them, &#8220;Come here. She is (my wife) Safiya bint Huyai.&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Subhan Allah, (How dare we think of evil) O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! (we never expect anything bad from you).&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Satan circulates in the human being as blood circulates in the body, and I was afraid lest Satan might insert an evil thought in your minds.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 255:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali bin Al-Husain from Safiya:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Safiya went to the Prophet while he was in Itikaf. When she returned, the Prophet accompanied her walking. An Ansari man saw him. When the Prophet noticed him, he called him and said, &#8220;Come here. She is Safiya. (Sufyan a sub-narrator perhaps said that the Prophet had said, &#8220;This is Safiya&#8221;). And Satan circulates in the body of Adam&#8217;s offspring as his blood circulates in it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(A sub-narrator asked Sufyan, &#8220;Did Safiya visit him at night?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Of course, at night.&#8221;)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 256:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We practiced Itikaf with Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the middle ten days (of Ramadan). In the morning of the twentieth (of Ramadan) we shifted our baggage, but Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to us and said, &#8220;Whoever was m Itikaf should return to his place of Itikaf, for I saw (i.e. was informed about the date of) this Night (of Qadr) and saw myself prostrating in mud and water.&#8221; When I returned to my place the sky was overcast with clouds and it rained. By Him Who sent Muhammad with the Truth, the sky was covered with clouds from the end of that day, and the mosque which was roofed with leaf-stalks of date palm trees (leaked with rain) and I saw the trace of mud and water over the nose of the Prophet and its tip.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 257:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amra bint &#8216;Abdur-Rahman from &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to practice Itikaf every year in the month of Ramadan. And after offering the morning prayer, he used to enter the place of his Itikaf. &#8216;Aisha asked his permission to let her practice Itikaf and he allowed her, and so she pitched a tent in the mosque. When Hafsa heard of that, she also pitched a tent (for herself), and when Zainab heard of that, she too pitched another tent. When, in the morning, Allah&#8217;s Apostle had finished the morning prayer, he saw four tents and asked, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; He was informed about it. He then said, &#8220;What made them do this? Is it righteousness? Remove the tents, for I do not want to see them.&#8221; So, the tents were removed. The Prophet did not perform Itikaf that year in the month of Ramadan, but did it in the last ten days of Shawwal.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 258:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah bin Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I vowed in the Pre-lslamic period to perform Itikaf in Al-Masjid-al-Haram for one night.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Fulfill your vow.&#8221; So, he performed Itikaf for one night.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 259:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that &#8216;Umar had vowed in the Pre-lslamic period to perform Itikaf in Al-Masjid-al-Haram. (A sub-narrator thinks that &#8216;Umar vowed to perform Itikaf for one night.) Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to &#8216;Umar, &#8220;Fulfill your vow.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 260:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to perform Itikaf every year in the month of Ramadan for ten days, and when it was the year of his death, he stayed in Itikaf for twenty days.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 261:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amra bint &#8216;AbdurRahman from &#8216;Aisha: Allah&#8217;s Apostle mentioned that he would practice Itikaf in the last ten days of Ramadan. &#8216;Aisha asked his permission to perform Itikaf and he permitted her. Hafsa asked &#8216;Aisha to take his permission for</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 262:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Urwa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aisha during her menses used to comb and oil the hair of the Prophet while he used to be in Itikaf in the mosque. He would stretch out his head towards her while she was in her chamber.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Fadl (his brother) was riding behind Allah&#8217;s Apostle and a woman from the tribe of Khath&#8217;am came and Al-Fadl started looking at her and she started looking at him. The Prophet turned Al-Fadl&#8217;s face to the other side. The woman said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The obligation of Hajj enjoined by Allah on His devotees has become due on my father and he is old and weak, and he cannot sit firm on the Mount; may I perform Hajj on his behalf?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Yes, you may.&#8221; That happened during the Hajj-al-Wida (of the Prophet ).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 597:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Jubair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I went to visit &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar at his house which contained many tents made of cotton cloth and these were encircled with Suradik (part of the tent). I asked him from where, should one assume Ihram for Umra. He said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle had fixed as Miqat (singular of Mawaqit) Qarn for the people of Najd, Dhul-Hulaifa for the people of Medina, and Al-Juhfa for the people of Sham.&#8221;</p>
<hr>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of Yemen used to come for Hajj and used not to bring enough provisions with them and used to say that they depend on Allah.

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 599:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) made Dhul-Huiaifa as the Miqat for the people of Medina; Al-Juhfa for the people of Sham; Qarn-al-Manazil for the people of Najd; and Yalamlam for the people of Yemen; and these Mawaqit are for the people at those very places, and besides them for those who come thorough those places with the intention of performing Hajj and &#8216;Umra; and whoever is living within these boundaries can assume lhram from the place he starts, and the people of Mecca can assume Ihram from Mecca.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 600:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;The people of Medina should assume lhram from Dhul-Hulaifa; the people of Sham from Al-Juhfa; and the people of Najd from Qarn.&#8221; And &#8216;Abdullah added, &#8220;I was informed that Allah&#8217;s Apostle had said, &#8216;The people of Yemen should assume Ihram from Yalamlam.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

So, these (above mentioned) are the Mawaqit for all those living at those places, and besides them for those who come through those places with the intention of performing Hajj and &#8216;Umra and whoever lives within these places should assume Ihram from his dwelling place, and similarly the people of Mecca can assume lhram from Mecca.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;The Miqat for the people of Medina is Dhul-Hulaifa; for the people of Sham is Mahita; (i.e. Al-Juhfa); and for the people of Najd is Qarn. And said Ibn &#8216;Umar, &#8220;They claim, but I did not hear personally, that the Prophet said, &#8220;The Miqat for the people of Yemen is Yalamlam.&#8221;</p>
<hr>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet fixed Dhul-Hulaifa as the Miqat for the people of Medina, Al-Juhfa, for the people of Sham, Yalamlam for the people of Yemen, and Qarn for the people of Najd. And these Mawaqlt are for those living at those very places, and besides them for those who come through those places with the intention of performing Hajj and Umra; and whoever is living inside these places can assume lhram from his own dwelling place, and the people of Mecca can assume lhram from Mecca.</p>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 606:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">When these two towns (Basra and Kufa) were captured, the people went to &#8216;Umar and said, &#8220;O the Chief of the faithful believers! The Prophet fixed Qarn as the Miqat for the people of Najd, it is beyond our way and it is difficult for us to pass through it.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Take as your Miqat a place situated opposite to Qarn on your usual way. So, he fixed Dhatu-Irq (as their Miqat).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 607:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar&#8217; said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle made his camel sit (i.e. he dismounted) at Al-Batha&#8217; in Dhul-Hulaifa and offered the prayer.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar used to do the same.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to go (for Hajj) via Ash-Shajara way and return via Muarras way; and no doubt, whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle went to Mecca, he used to offer the prayer in the Mosque of Ash-Shajara; and on his return, he used to offer the prayer at Dhul-Hulaifa in the middle of the valley, and pass the night there till morning.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet with his companions started from Medina after combing and oiling his hair and putting on two sheets of lhram (upper body cover and waist cover). He did not forbid anyone to wear any kind of sheets except the ones colored with saffron because they may leave the scent on the skin. And so in the early morning, the Prophet mounted his Mount while in Dhul-Hulaifa and set out till they reached Baida&#8217;, where he and his companions recited Talbiya, and then they did the ceremony of Taqlid (which means to put the colored garlands around the necks of the Budn (camels for sacrifice). And all that happened on the 25th of Dhul-Qa&#8217;da. And when he reached Mecca on the 4th of Dhul-Hijja he performed the Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba and performed the Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. And as he had a Badana and had garlanded it, he did not finish his Ihram. He proceeded towards the highest places of Mecca near Al-Hujun and he was assuming the Ihram for Hajj and did not go near the Ka&#8217;ba after he performed Tawaf (round it) till he returned from &#8216;Arafat. Then he ordered his companions to perform the Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba and then the Tawaf of Safa and Marwa, and to cut short the hair of their heads and to finish their Ihram. And that was only for those people who had not garlanded Budn. Those who had their wives with them were permitted to contact them (have sexual intercourse), and similarly perfume and (ordinary) clothes were permissible for them.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) We set out with the Prophet in his last Hajj and we assumed Ihram for Umra. The Prophet then said, &#8220;Whoever has the Hadi with him should assume Ihram for Hajj along with &#8216;Umra and should not finish the Ihram till he finishes both.&#8221; I was menstruating when I reached Mecca, and so I neither did Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba nor Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. I complained about that to the Prophet on which he replied, &#8220;Undo and comb your head hair, and assume Ihram for Hajj (only) and leave the Umra.&#8221; So, I did so. When we had performed the Hajj, the Prophet sent me with my brother &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr to Tan&#8217;im. So I performed the &#8216;Umra. The Prophet said to me, &#8220;This &#8216;Umra is instead of your missed one.&#8221; Those who had assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra (Hajj-atTamattu) performed Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba and between Safa and Marwa and then finished their Ihram. After returning from Mina, they performed another Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa). Those who had assumed Ihram for Hajj and &#8216;Umra together (Hajj-al-Qiran) performed only one Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa).</p>

He ordered me to perform Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba and between Safa and Marwa and then to finish my Ihram. I did so and went to a woman from my tribe who combed my hair or washed my head. Then, when Umar came (i.e. became Caliph) he said, &#8220;If we follow Allah&#8217;s Book, it orders us to complete Hajj and Umra; as Allah says: &#8220;Perform the Hajj and Umra for Allah.&#8221; (2.196).

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216; Aisha said, &#8220;We set out with Allah&#8217;s Apostles in the months of Hajj, and (in) the nights of Hajj, and at the time and places of Hajj and in a state of Hajj. We dismounted at Sarif (a village six miles from Mecca). The Prophet then addressed his companions and said, &#8220;Anyone who has not got the Hadi and likes to do Umra instead of Hajj may do so (i.e. Hajj-al-Tamattu) and anyone who has got the Hadi should not finish the Ihram after performing &#8216; Umra). (i.e. Hajj-al-Qiran). Aisha added, &#8220;The companions of the Prophet obeyed the above (order) and some of them (i.e. who did not have Hadi) finished their Ihram after Umra.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle and some of his companions were resourceful and had the Hadi with them, they could not perform Umra (alone) (but had to perform both Hajj and Umra with one Ihram). Aisha added, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me and saw me weeping and said, &#8220;What makes you weep, O Hantah?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I have heard your conversation with your companions and I cannot perform the Umra.&#8221; He asked, &#8220;What is wrong with you?&#8217; I replied, &#8216; I do not offer the prayers (i.e. I have my menses).&#8217; He said, &#8216; It will not harm you for you are one of the daughters of Adam, and Allah has written for you (this state) as He has written it for them. Keep on with your intentions for Hajj and Allah may reward you that.&#8221; Aisha further added, &#8220;Then we proceeded for Hajj till we reached Mina and I became clean from my menses. Then I went out from Mina and performed Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; Aisha added, &#8220;I went along with the Prophet in his final departure (from Hajj) till he dismounted at Al-Muhassab (a valley outside Mecca), and we too, dismounted with him.&#8221; He called &#8216; Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr and said to him, &#8216; Take your sister outside the sanctuary of Mecca and let her assume Ihram for &#8216; Umra, and when you had finished &#8216; Umra, return to this place and I will wait for you both till you both return to me.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216; Aisha added, &#8216; &#8216; So we went out of the sanctuary of Mecca and after finishing from the &#8216; Umra and the Tawaf we returned to the Prophet at dawn. He said, &#8216;Have you performed the &#8216; Umra?&#8217; We replied in the affirmative. So he announced the departure amongst his companions and the people set out for the journey, and the Prophet: too left for Medina.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216; Aisha said, We went out with the Prophet (from Medina) with the intention of performing Hajj only and when we reached Mecca we performed Tawaf round the Kaba and then the Prophet ordered those who had not driven the Hadi along with them to finish their Ihram. So the people who had not driven the Hadi along with them finished their Ihram. The Prophet&#8217;s wives, too, had not driven the Hadi with them, so they too, finished their Ihram.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;I got my menses and could not perform Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; So when it was the night of Hasba (i.e. when we stopped at Al-Muhassab), I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Everyone is returning after performing Hajj and &#8216;Umra but I am returning after performing Hajj only.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Didn&#8217;t you perform Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba the night we reached Mecca?&#8217; I replied in the negative. He said, &#8216;Go with your brother to Tan&#8217;im and assume the Ihram for&#8217;Umra, (and after performing it) come back to such and such a place.&#8217; On that Safiya said, &#8216;I feel that I will detain you all.&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;O &#8216;Aqra Halqa! Didn&#8217;t you perform Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba on the day of sacrifice? (i.e. Tawaf-al-ifada) Safiya replied in the affirmative. He said, (to Safiya). &#8216;There is no harm for you to proceed on with us.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;(after returning from &#8216;Umra), the Prophet met me while he was ascending (from Mecca) and I was descending to it, or I was ascending and he was descending.&#8221;</p>

Some of us had assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra only, some for both Hajj and &#8216;Umra, and others for Hajj only. Allah&#8217;s Apostle assumed Ihram for Hajj. So whoever had assumed Ihram for Hajj or for both Hajj and &#8216;Umra did not finish the Ihram till the day of sacrifice. (See Hadith No. 631, 636, and 639).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The people (of the Pre-lslamic Period) used to think that to perform &#8216;Umra during the months of Hajj was one of the major sins on earth. And also used to consider the month of Safar as a forbidden (i.e. sacred) month and they used to say, &#8220;When the wounds of the camel&#8217;s back heal up (after they return from Hajj) and the signs of those wounds vanish and the month of Safar passes away then (at that time) &#8216;Umra is permissible for the one who wishes to perform it.&#8221; In the morning of the 4th of Dhul-Hijja, the Prophet and his companions reached Mecca, assuming Ihram for Hajj and he ordered his companions to make their intentions of the Ihram for&#8217;Umra only (instead of Hajj) so they considered his order as something great and were puzzled, and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What kind (of finishing) of Ihram is allowed?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Finish the Ihram completely like a non-Muhrim (you are allowed everything).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I left for Mecca for Hajj-at-Tamattu&#8217; assuming Ihram for &#8216;Umra. I reached Mecca three days before the day of Tarwiya (8th Dhul-Hijja). Some people of Mecca said to me, &#8220;Your Hajj will be like the Hajj performed by the people of Mecca (i.e. you will lose the superiority of assuming Ihram from the Miqat). So I went to &#8216;Ata&#8217; asking him his view about it. He said, &#8220;Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah narrated to me, &#8216;I performed Hajj with Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the day when he drove camels with him. The people had assumed Ihram for Hajj-al-Ifrad. The Prophet ordered them to finish their Ihram after Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba, and between Safa and Marwa and to cut short their hair and then to stay there (in Mecca) as non-Muhrims till the day of Tarwiya (i.e. 8th of Dhul-Hijja) when they would assume Ihram for Hajj and they were ordered to make the Ihram with which they had come as for &#8216;Umra only. They asked, &#8216;How can we make it &#8216;Umra (Tamattu&#8217;) as we have intended to perform Hajj?&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;Do what I have ordered you. Had I not brought the Hadi with me, I would have done the same, but I cannot finish my Ihram till the Hadi reaches its destination (i.e. is slaughtered).&#8217; So, they did (what he ordered them to do).&#8221;</p>

Why don&#8217;t you rebuild it on its original foundation laid by Abraham?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Were it not for the fact that your people are close to the pre-lslamic Period of ignorance (i.e. they have recently become Muslims) I would have done so.&#8221; The sub-narrator, &#8216;Abdullah (bin &#8216;Umar ) stated: &#8216;Aisha &#8216;must have heard this from Allah&#8217;s Apostle for in my opinion Allah&#8217;s Apostle had not placed his hand over the two corners of the Ka&#8217;ba opposite Al-Hijr only because the Ka&#8217;ba was not rebuilt on its original foundations laid by Abraham.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked the Prophet whether the round wall (near Ka&#8217;ba) was part of the Ka&#8217;ba. The Prophet replied in the affirmative. I further said, &#8220;What is wrong with them, why have they not included it in the building of the Ka&#8217;ba?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see that your people (Quraish) ran short of money (so they could not include it inside the building of Ka&#8217;ba)?&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What about its gate? Why is it so high?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Your people did this so as to admit into it whomever they liked and prevent whomever they liked. Were your people not close to the Pre-lslamic Period of ignorance (i.e. they have recently embraced Islam) and were I not afraid that they would dislike it, surely I would have included the (area of the) wall inside the building of the Ka&#8217;ba and I would have lowered its gate to the level of the ground.&#8221;</p>

Were your nation not close to the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance, I would have had the Ka&#8217;ba demolished and would have included in it the portion which had been left, and would have made it at a level with the ground and would have made two doors for it, one towards the east and the other towards the west, and then by doing this it would have been built on the foundations laid by Abraham.&#8221; That was what urged Ibn-Az-Zubair to demolish the Ka&#8217;ba. Jazz said, &#8220;I saw Ibn-Az-Zubair when he demolished and rebuilt the Ka&#8217;ba and included in it a portion of Al-Hijr (the unroofed portion of Ka&#8217;ba which is at present in the form of a compound towards the north-west of the Ka&#8217;ba). I saw the original foundations of Abraham which were of stones resembling the humps of camels.&#8221; So Jarir asked Yazid, &#8220;Where was the place of those stones?&#8221; Jazz said, &#8220;I will just now show it to you.&#8221; So Jarir accompanied Yazid and entered Al-Hijr, and Jazz pointed to a place and said, &#8220;Here it is.&#8221; Jarir said, &#8220;It appeared to me about six cubits from Al-Hijr or so.&#8221;</p>

Jafar and Ali did not inherit anything as they were Muslims and the other two were non-believers. &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab used to say, &#8220;A believer cannot inherit (anything from an) infidel.&#8221; Ibn Shihab, (a sub-narrator) said, &#8220;They (Umar and others) derived the above verdict from Allah&#8217;s Statement: &#8220;Verily! those who believed and Emigrated and strove with their life And property in Allah&#8217;s Cause, And those who helped (the emigrants) And gave them their places to live in, These are (all) allies to one another.&#8221; (8.72)</p>

In Allah&#8217;s Apostle you have a good example.&#8221; And I asked Jabir bin Abdullah (the same question), and he replied, &#8220;You should not go near your wives (have sexual relations) till you have finished Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. &#8220;</p>

The Prophet then said to them, &#8220;Carry on! You are doing a good deed.&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;Were I not afraid that other people would compete with you (in drawing water from Zam-zam), I would certainly take the rope and put it over this (i.e. his shoulder) (to draw water).&#8221; On saying that the Prophet pointed to his shoulder.</p>

Then the Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever has a Hadi with him should assume Ihram for both Hajj and &#8216;Umra, and should not finish it till he performs both of the them (Hajj and &#8216;Umra).&#8221; When we reached Mecca, I had my menses. When we had performed our Hajj, the Prophet sent me with &#8216;Abdur-Rahman to Tan&#8217;im and I performed the &#8216;Umra. The Prophet said, &#8220;This is in lieu of your missed &#8216;Umra.&#8221; Those who had assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra performed Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa) and then finished their Ihram. And then they performed another Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa) after returning from Mina. And those who had assumed lhram for Hajj and &#8216;Umra to get her ( Hajj-Qiran ) performed only one Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar and his riding animal entered the house of Ibn &#8216;Umar. He (the son of Ibn &#8216;Umar) said, &#8220;I fear that this year a battle might take place between the people and you might be prevented from going to the Ka&#8217;ba. I suggest that you should stay here.&#8221; Ibn Umar said, &#8220;Once Allah&#8217;s Apostle set out for the pilgrimage, and the pagans of Quraish intervened between him and the Ka&#8217;ba. So, if the people intervened between me and the Ka&#8217;ba, I would do the same as Allah&#8217;s Apostle had done . . . &#8220;Verily, in Allah&#8217;s Apostle you have a good example.&#8221; Then he added, &#8220;I make you a witness that I have intended to perform Hajj along with &#8216;Umra.&#8221; After arriving at Mecca, Ibn &#8216;Umar performed one Tawaf only (between Safa and Marwa).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 704:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Umar intended to perform Hajj in the year when Al-Hajjaj attacked Ibn Az-Zubair. Somebody said to Ibn &#8216;Umar, &#8220;There is a danger of an impending war between them.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Verily, in Allah&#8217;s Apostle you have a good example. (And if it happened as you say) then I would do the same as Allah&#8217;s Apostle had done. I make you witness that I have decided to perform &#8216;Umra.&#8221; Then he set out and when he reached Al-Baida&#8217;, he said, &#8220;The ceremonies of both Hajj and &#8216;Umra are similar. I make you witness that I have made Hajj compulsory for me along with &#8216;Umra.&#8221; He drove (to Mecca) a Hadi which he had bought from (a place called) Qudaid and did not do more than that. He did not slaughter the Hadi or finish his Ihram, or shave or cut short his hair till the day of slaughtering the sacrifices (10th Dhul-Hijja). Then he slaughtered his Hadi and shaved his head and considered the first Tawaf (of Safa and Marwa) as sufficient for Hajj and &#8216;Umra. Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle did the same.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 705:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Muhammad bin &#8216;AbdurRahman bin Nawfal Al-Qurashi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked &#8216;Urwa bin Az-Zubair (regarding the Hajj of the Prophet ). &#8216;Urwa replied, &#8220;Aisha narrated, &#8216;When the Prophet reached Mecca, the first thing he started with was the ablution, then he performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and his intention was not &#8216;Umra alone (but Hajj and &#8216;Umra together).&#8217; &#8221; Later Abu Bakr I performed the Hajj and the first thing he started with was Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and it was not &#8216;Umra alone (but Hajj and &#8216;Umra together). And then &#8216;Umar did the same. Then &#8216;Uthman performed the Hajj and the first thing he started with was Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and it was not &#8216;Umra alone. And then Muawiya and &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar did the same. I performed Hajj with Ibn Az-Zubair and the first thing he started with was Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and it was not &#8216;Umra alone, (but Hajj and &#8216;Umra together). Then I saw the Muhajirin (Emigrants) and Ansar doing the same and it was not &#8216;Umra alone. And the last person I saw doing the same was Ibn &#8216;Umar, and he did not do another &#8216;Umra after finishing the first. Now here is Ibn &#8216;Umar present amongst the people! They neither ask him nor anyone of the previous ones. And all these people, on entering Mecca, would not start with anything unless they had performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, and would not finish their Ihram. And no doubt, I saw my mother and my aunt, on entering Mecca doing nothing before performing Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, and they would not finish their lhram. And my mother informed me that she, her sister, Az-Zubair and such and such persons had assumed lhram for &#8216;Umra and after passing their hands over the Corner (the Black Stone) (i.e. finishing their Umra) they finished their Ihram.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 706:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Urwa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked &#8216;Aisha : &#8220;How do you interpret the statement of Allah,. : Verily! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah, and whoever performs the Hajj to the Ka&#8217;ba or performs &#8216;Umra, it is not harmful for him to perform Tawaf between them (Safa and Marwa.) (2.158). By Allah! (it is evident from this revelation) there is no harm if one does not perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;O, my nephew! Your interpretation is not true. Had this interpretation of yours been correct, the statement of Allah should have been, &#8216;It is not harmful for him if he does not perform Tawaf between them.&#8217; But in fact, this divine inspiration was revealed concerning the Ansar who used to assume lhram for worship ping an idol called &#8220;Manat&#8221; which they used to worship at a place called Al-Mushallal before they embraced Islam, and whoever assumed Ihram (for the idol), would consider it not right to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When they embraced Islam, they asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) regarding it, saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We used to refrain from Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.&#8221; So Allah revealed: &#8216;Verily; (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah.&#8217; &#8221; Aisha added, &#8220;Surely, Allah&#8217;s Apostle set the tradition of Tawaf between Safa and Marwa, so nobody is allowed to omit the Tawaf between them.&#8221; Later on I (&#8216;Urwa) told Abu Bakr bin &#8216;Abdur-Rahman (of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s narration) and he said, &#8216;i have not heard of such information, but I heard learned men saying that all the people, except those whom &#8216;Aisha mentioned and who used to assume lhram for the sake of Manat, used to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah referred to the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and did not mention Safa and Marwa in the Quran, the people asked, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We used to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa and Allah has revealed (the verses concerning) Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and has not mentioned Safa and Marwa. Is there any harm if we perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa?&#8217; So Allah revealed: &#8220;Verily As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;It seems that this verse was revealed concerning the two groups, those who used to refrain from Tawaf between Safa and Marwa in the Pre-lslamic Period of ignorance and those who used to perform the Tawaf then, and after embracing Islam they refrained from the Tawaf between them as Allah had enjoined Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and did not mention Tawaf (of Safa and Marwa) till later after mentioning the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8217;</p>

In Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) you have a good example.&#8221; We asked Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah (the same question) and he said, &#8220;He (that man) should not come near (his wife) till he has completed Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.&#8221;</p>

(The two mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah. It is therefore no sin for him who performs the pilgrimage to the Ka&#8217;ba, or performs &#8216;Umra, to perform Tawaf between them.&#8217; &#8221; (2.158)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I was menstruating when I reached Mecca. So, I neither performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, nor the Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. Then I informed Allah&#8217;s Apostle about it. He replied, &#8220;Perform all the ceremonies of Hajj like the other pilgrims, but do not perform Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba till you get clean (from your menses).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet and his companions assumed Ihram for Hajj and none except the Prophet (p.b.u.h) and Talha had the Hadi (sacrifice) with them. &#8216;Ali arrived from Yemen and had a Hadi with him. &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;I have assumed Ihram for what the Prophet has done.&#8221; The Prophet ordered his companions to perform the &#8216;Umra with the lhram which they had assumed, and after finishing Tawaf (of Ka&#8217;ba, Safa and Marwa) to cut short their hair, and to finish their lhram except those who had Hadi with them. They (the people) said, &#8220;How can we proceed to Mina (for Hajj) after having sexual relations with our wives?&#8221; When that news reached the Prophet he said, &#8220;If I had formerly known what I came to know lately, I would not have brought the Hadi with me. Had there been no Hadi with me, I would have finished the state of lhram.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha got her menses, so she performed all the ceremonies of Hajj except Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, and when she got clean (from her menses), she performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba. She said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! (All of you) are returning with the Hajj and &#8216;Umra, but I am returning after performing Hajj only.&#8221; So the Prophet ordered &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr to accompany her to Tan&#8217;im and thus she performed the &#8216;Umra after the Hajj.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(On &#8216;Id) We used to forbid our virgins to go out (for &#8216;Id prayer). A lady came and stayed at the Palace of Bani Khalaf. She mentioned that her sister was married to one of the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle who participated in twelve Ghazawats along with Allah&#8217;s Apostle and her sister was with him in six of them. She said, &#8220;We used to dress the wounded and look after the patients.&#8221; She (her sister) asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle , &#8220;Is there any harm for a woman to stay at home if she doesn&#8217;t have a veil?&#8221; He said, &#8220;She should cover herself with the veil of her companion and she should take part in the good deeds and in the religious gatherings of the believers.&#8221; When Um &#8216;Atiyya came, I asked her. &#8220;Did you hear anything about that?&#8221; Um &#8216;Atiyya said, &#8220;Bi Abi&#8221; and she never mentioned the name of Allah&#8217;s Apostle without saying &#8220;Bi Abi&#8221; (i.e. &#8216;Let my father be sacrificed for you&#8217;). We asked her, &#8220;Have you heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying so and so (about women)?&#8221; She replied in the affirmative and said, &#8220;Let my father be sacrificed for him. He told us that unmarried mature virgins who stay often screened or unmarried young virgins and mature girls who stay often screened should come out and take part in the good deeds and in the religious gatherings of the believers. But the menstruating women should keep away from the Musalla (praying place).&#8221; I asked her, &#8220;The menstruating women?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;Don&#8217;t they present themselves at &#8216;Arafat and at such and such places?&#8221;</p>

On the Day of &#8216;Arafat, when the sun declined at midday, Ibn &#8216;Umar came along with me and shouted near Al-Hajjaj&#8217;s cotton (cloth) tent. Al-Hajjaj came Out, wrapping himself with a waist-sheet dyed with safflower, and said, &#8220;O Abu Abdur-Rahman! What is the matter?&#8221; He said, If you want to follow the Sunna (the tradition of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ) then proceed (to &#8216;Arafat).&#8221; Al-Hajjaj asked, &#8220;At this very hour?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Please wait for me till I pour some water over my head (i.e. take a bath) and come out.&#8221; Then Ibn &#8216;Umar dismounted and waited till Al-Hajjaj came out. So, he (Al-Hajjaj) walked in between me and my father (Ibn &#8216;Umar). I said to him, &#8220;If you want to follow the Sunna then deliver a brief sermon and hurry up for the stay at &#8216;Arafat.&#8221; He started looking at &#8216;Abdullah (Ibn &#8216;Umar) (inquiringly), and when &#8216;Abdullah noticed that, he said that he had told the truth.</p>

Then he asked for his supper and took it, and then, I think, he ordered a man to pronounce the Adhan and Iqama (for the &#8216;isha&#8217; prayer). (&#8216;Amr, a sub-narrator said: The intervening statement &#8216;I think&#8217;, was said by the sub-narrator Zuhair) (i.e. not by &#8216;Abdu-Rahman).

When they reached Mina they would throw pebbles on the Jamra (Jamrat-al-Aqaba) Ibn &#8216;Umar used to say, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave the permission to them (weak people) to do so.&#8221;</p>

The second prayer is the morning prayer which is offered at this hour.&#8217; &#8221; Then &#8216;Abdullah stayed there till it became a bit brighter.

<p style="text-align:justify;">During the last Hajj (Hajj-al-Wada&#8217;) of Allah&#8217;s Apostle he performed &#8216;Umra and Hajj. He drove a Hadi along with him from Dhul-Hulaifa. Allah&#8217;s Apostle started by assuming Ihram for&#8217;Umra and Hajj. And the people, too, performed the &#8216;Umra and Hajj along with the Prophet. Some of them brought the Hadi and drove it along with them, while the others did not. So, when the Prophet arrived at Mecca. he said to the people, &#8220;Whoever among you has driven the Hadi, should not finish his Ihram till he completes his Hajj. And whoever among you has not (driven) the Hadi with him, should perform Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and the Tawaf between Safa and Marwa, then cut short his hair and finish his Ihram, and should later assume Ihram for Hajj; but he must offer a Hadi (sacrifice); and if anyone cannot afford a Hadi, he should fast for three days during the Hajj and seven days when he returns home. The Prophet performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba on his arrival (at Mecca); he touched the (Black Stone) corner first of all and then did Ramal (fast walking with moving of the shoulders) during the first three rounds round the Ka&#8217;ba, and during the last four rounds he walked. After finishing Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, he offered a two Rakat prayer at Maqam Ibrahim, and after finishing the prayer he went to Safa and Marwa and performed seven rounds of Tawaf between them and did not do any deed forbidden because of Ihram, till he finished all the ceremonies of his Hajj and sacrificed his Hadi on the day of Nahr (10th day of Dhul-Hijja). He then hastened onwards (to Mecca) and performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and then everything that was forbidden because of Ihram became permissible. Those who took and drove the Hadi with them did the same as Allah&#8217;s Apostle did.</p>

(Tell me) what is the day today?&#8217; The people replied, &#8216;It is the forbidden (sacred) day.&#8217; He asked again, &#8216;What town is this?&#8217; They replied, &#8216;It is the forbidden (Sacred) town.&#8217; He asked, &#8216;Which month is this?&#8217; They replied, &#8216;It is the forbidden (Sacred) month.&#8217; He said, &#8216;No doubt! Your blood, your properties, and your honor are sacred to one another like the sanctity of this day of yours, in this (sacred) town (Mecca) of yours, in this month of yours.&#8217; The Prophet repeated his statement again and again. After that he raised his head and said, &#8216;O Allah! Haven&#8217;t conveyed (Your Message) to them&#8217;.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 797:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet delivered to us a sermon on the Day of Nahr. He said, &#8220;Do you know what is the day today?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; He remained silent till we thought that he might give that day another name. He said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the Day of Nahr?&#8221; We said, &#8220;It is.&#8221; He further asked, &#8220;Which month is this?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; He remained silent till we thought that he might give it another name. He then said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the month of Dhul-Hijja?&#8221; We replied: &#8220;Yes! It is.&#8221; He further asked, &#8220;What town is this?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know it better.&#8221; He remained silent till we thought that he might give it another name. He then said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the forbidden (Sacred) town (of Mecca)?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Yes. It is.&#8221; He said, &#8220;No doubt, your blood and your properties are sacred to one another like the sanctity of this day of yours, in this month of yours, in this town of yours, till the day you meet your Lord. No doubt! Haven&#8217;t I conveyed Allah&#8217;s message to you? They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Allah! Be witness. So it is incumbent upon those who are present to convey it (this information) to those who are absent because the informed one might comprehend it (what I have said) better than the present audience, who will convey it to him. Beware! Do not renegade (as) disbelievers after me by striking the necks (cutting the throats) of one another.&#8221;</p>

The Prophet reached Mecca and performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and between Safa and Marwa and did not finish the Ihram, because he had the Hadi with him. His companions and his wives performed Tawaf (of the Ka&#8217;ba and between Safa and Marwa), and those who had no Hadi with them finished their Ihram. I got the menses and performed all the ceremonies of Hajj. So, when the Night of Hasba (night of departure) came, I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! All your companions are returning with Hajj and &#8216;Umra except me.&#8221; He asked me, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you perform Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba (Umra) when you reached Mecca?&#8221; I said, &#8220;No.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Go to Tan&#8217;im with your brother &#8216;Abdur-Rahman, and assume Ihram for &#8216;Umra and I will wait for you at such and such a place.&#8221; So I went with &#8216;Abdur-Rahman to Tan&#8217;im and assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra. Then Safiya bint Huyay got menses. The Prophet said, &#8221; &#8216;Aqra Halqa! You will detain us! Didn&#8217;t you perform Tawaf-al-Ifada on the Day of Nahr (slaughtering)?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Yes, I did.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Then there is no harm, depart.&#8221; So I met the Prophet when he was ascending the heights towards Mecca and I was descending, or vice-versa.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Sufyan bin Abu Zuhair, a man from Azd Shanu&#8217;a and one  of the companions of the Prophet said, &#8220;I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;If one keeps  a dog which is meant for guarding neither a farm nor cattle, one Qirat of the reward of  his good deeds is deducted daily.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Did you hear this from Allah&#8217;s  Apostle?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, by the Lord of this Mosque.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;While a man was riding a cow, it  turned towards him and said, &#8216;I have not been created for this purpose (i.e. carrying), I  have been created for sloughing.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;I, Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar  believe in the story.&#8221; The Prophet went on, &#8220;A wolf caught a sheep, and when the  shepherd chased it, the wolf said, &#8216;Who will be its guard on the day of wild beasts, when  there will be no shepherd for it except me?&#8217; &#8220;After narrating it, the Prophet said,  &#8220;I, Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar too believe it.&#8221; Abu Salama (a sub-narrator) said,  &#8220;Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar were not present then.&#8221; (It has been written that a wolf  also spoke to one of the companions of the Prophet near Medina as narrated in  Fatah-al-Bari: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Unais bin &#8216;Amr: Ahban bin Aus said, &#8220;I was  amongst my sheep. Suddenly a wolf caught a sheep and I shouted at it. The wolf sat on its  tail and addressed me, saying, &#8216;Who will look after it (i.e. the sheep) when you will be  busy and not able to look after it? Do you forbid me the provision which Allah has  provided me?&#8217; &#8221; Ahban added, &#8220;I clapped my hands and said, &#8216;By Allah, I have  never seen anything more curious and wonderful than this!&#8217; On that the wolf said, &#8216;There  is something (more curious) and wonderful than this; that is, Allah&#8217;s Apostle in those  palm trees, inviting people to Allah (i.e. Islam).&#8217; &#8220;Unais bin &#8216;Amr further said,  &#8220;Then Ahban went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and informed him what happened and embraced  Islam.)&#8221; palm trees or other trees and share the fruits with me.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 518: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Ansar said to the Prophet &#8220;Distribute the date  palm trees between us and our emigrant brothers.&#8221; He replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; The  Ansar said (to the emigrants), &#8220;Look after the trees (water and watch them) and share  the fruits with us.&#8221; The emigrants said, &#8220;We listen and obey.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 519: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet got the date palm trees of the tribe of  Bani-An-Nadir burnt and the trees cut down at a place called Al-Buwaira . Hassan bin  Thabit said in a poetic verse: &#8220;The chiefs of Bani Lu&#8217;ai found it easy to watch fire  spreading at Al-Buwaira.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 520: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Rafi&#8217; bin Khadij: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We worked on farms more than anybody else in Medina. We  used to rent the land at the yield of specific delimited portion of it to be given to the  landlord. Sometimes the vegetation of that portion was affected by blights etc., while the  rest remained safe and vice versa, so the Prophet forbade this practice. At that time gold  or silver were not used (for renting the land). If they provided the seeds, they would get  so-and-so much. Al-Hasan said, &#8220;There is no harm if the land belongs to one but both  spend on it and the yield is divided between them.&#8221; Az-Zuhri had the same opinion.  Al-Hasan said, &#8220;There is no harm if cotton is picked on the condition of having half  the yield.&#8221; Ibrahim, Ibn Siain, &#8216;Ata&#8217;, Al-Hakam, Az-Zuhri and Qatada said,  &#8220;There is no harm in giving the yarn to the weaver to weave into cloth on the basis  that one-third or one-fourth (or any other portion) of the cloth is given to the weaver  for his labor.&#8221; Ma&#8217;am said, &#8220;There is no harm in hiring animals for a definite  (fixed) period on the basis that one-third or one-fourth of the products carried by the  animals is given to the owner of the animals.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 521: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet concluded a contract with the people of Khaibar  to utilize the land on the condition that half the products of fruits or vegetation would  be their share. The Prophet used to give his wives one hundred Wasqs each, eighty Wasqs of  dates and twenty Wasqs of barley. (When &#8216;Umar became the Caliph) he gave the wives of the  Prophet the option of either having the land and water as their shares, or carrying on the  previous practice. Some of them chose the land and some chose the Wasqs, and &#8216;Aisha chose  the land. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 522: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet made a deal with the people of Khaibar that  they would have half the fruits and vegetation of the land they cultivated. </font></p>
<hr>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 523: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Amr: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I said to Tawus, &#8220;I wish you would give up Mukhabara  (Share-cropping), for the people say that the Prophet forbade it.&#8221; On that Tawus  replied, &#8220;O &#8216;Amr! I give the land to share-croppers and help them. No doubt; the most  learned man, namely Ibn &#8216;Abbas told me that the Prophet had not forbidden it but said, &#8216;It  is more beneficial for one to give his land free to one&#8217;s brother than to charge him a  fixed rental.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 524: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave the land of Khaibar to the Jew&#8217;s on  the condition that they work on it and cultivate it, and be given half of its yield. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 525: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Rafi: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We worked on farms more than anybody else in Medina. We  used to rent the land and say to the owner, &#8220;The yield of this portion is for us and  the yield of that portion is for you (as the rent).&#8221; One of those portions might  yield something and the other might not. So, the Prophet forbade us to do so. </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.039.526"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 526: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;While three men were walking, It  started raining and they took shelter (refuge) in a cave in a mountain. A big rock rolled  down from the mountain and closed the mouth of the cave. They said to each other,  &#8220;Think of good deeds which you did for Allah&#8217;s sake only, and invoke Allah by giving  reference to those deeds so that He may remove this rock from you.&#8221; One of them said,  &#8216;O Allah! I had old parents and small children and I used to graze the sheep for them. On  my return to them in the evening, I used to milk (the sheep) and start providing my  parents first of all before my children. One day I was delayed and came late at night and  found my parents sleeping. I milked (the sheep) as usual and stood by their heads. I hated  to wake them up and disliked to give milk to my children before them, although my children  were weeping (because of hunger) at my feet till the day dawned. O Allah! If I did this  for Your sake only, kindly remove the rock so that we could see the sky through it.&#8217; So,  Allah removed the rock a little and they saw the sky. The second man said, &#8216;O Allah! I was  in love with a cousin of mine like the deepest love a man may have for a woman. I wanted  to outrage her chastity but she refused unless I gave her one hundred Dinars. So, I  struggled to collect that amount. And when I sat between her legs, she said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s  slave! Be afraid of Allah and do not deflower me except rightfully (by marriage).&#8217; So, I  got up. O Allah! If I did it for Your sake only, please remove the rock.&#8217; The rock shifted  a little more. Then the third man said, &#8216;O Allah! I employed a laborer for a Faraq of rice  and when he finished his job and demanded his right, I presented it to him, but he refused  to take it. So, I sowed the rice many time till I gathered cows and their shepherd (from  the yield). (Then after some time) He came and said to me, &#8216;Fear Allah (and give me my  right).&#8221; I said, &#8216;Go and take those cows and the shepherd.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Be afraid of  Allah! Don&#8217;t mock at me.&#8217; I said, &#8216;I am not mocking at you. Take (all that).&#8217; So, he took  all that. O Allah! If I did that for Your sake only, please remove the rest of the rock.&#8217;  So, Allah removed the rock.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;He who cultivates land that does  not belong to anybody is more rightful (to own it).&#8221; &#8216;Urwa said, &#8220;Umar gave the  same verdict in his Caliphate.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While the Prophet was passing the night at his place of  rest in Dhul-Hulaifa in the bottom of the valley (of Aqiq), he saw a dream and it was said  to him, &#8220;You are in a blessed valley.&#8221; Musa said, &#8220;Salim let our camels  kneel at the place where &#8216;Abdullah used to make his camel kneel, seeking the place where  Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to take a rest, which is situated below the mosque which is in the  bottom of the valley; it is midway between the mosque and the road.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While the Prophet was in Al-&#8216;Aqiq he said, &#8220;Someone  (meaning Gabriel) came to me from my Lord tonight (in my dream) and said, &#8216;Offer the  prayer in this blessed valley and say (I intend to perform) Umra along with Hajj  (together).&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 531: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Umar expelled the Jews and the Christians from Hijaz. When  Allah&#8217;s Apostle had conquered Khaibar, he wanted to expel the Jews from it as its land  became the property of Allah, His Apostle, and the Muslims. Allah&#8217;s Apostle intended to  expel the Jews but they requested him to let them stay there on the condition that they  would do the labor and get half of the fruits. Allah&#8217;s Apostle told them, &#8220;We will  let you stay on thus condition, as long as we wish.&#8221; So, they (i.e. Jews) kept on  living there until &#8216;Umar forced them to go towards Taima&#8217; and Ariha&#8217;. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Rafi bin Khadij: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My uncle Zuhair said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle forbade us to  do a thing which was a source of help to us.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Whatever Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said was right.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent for me and asked, &#8216;What are you  doing with your farms?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;We give our farms on rent on the basis that we get the  yield produced at the banks of the water streams (rivers) for the rent, or rent it for  some Wasqs of barley and dates.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Do not do so, but cultivate (the  land) yourselves or let it be cultivated by others gratis, or keep it uncultivated.&#8217; I  said, &#8216;We hear and obey.&#8217; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 533: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people used to rent their land for cultivation for  one-third, one-fourth or half its yield. The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever has land should  cultivate it himself or give it to his (Muslim) brother gratis; otherwise keep it  uncultivated.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whoever  has land should cultivate it himself or give it to his (Muslim) brother gratis; otherwise  he should keep it uncultivated.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 534: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Amr: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When I mentioned it (i.e. the narration of Rafi &#8216;bin  Khadij: no. 532) to Tawus, he said, &#8220;It is permissible to rent the land for  cultivation, for Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8216;The Prophet did not forbid that, but said: One had  better give the land to one&#8217;s brother gratis rather than charge a certain amount for it.&#8217;  &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 535: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Nafi: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn &#8216;Umar used to rent his farms in the time of Abu Bakr,  &#8216;Umar, &#8216;Uthman, and in the early days of Muawiya. Then he was told the narration of Rafi  &#8216;bin Khadij that the Prophet had forbidden the renting of farms. Ibn &#8216;Umar went to Rafi&#8217;  and I accompanied him. He asked Rafi who replied that the Prophet had forbidden the  renting of farms. Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;You know that we used to rent our farms in the  life-time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle for the yield of the banks of the water streams (rivers) and  for certain amount of figs. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Salim: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I knew that the land was  rented for cultivation in the life-time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221; Later on Ibn &#8216;Umar was  afraid that the Prophet had forbidden it, and he had no knowledge of it, so he gave up  renting his land. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 537: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Hanzla bin Qais: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Rafi bin Khadij said, &#8220;My two uncles told me that they  (i.e. the companions of the Prophet) used to rent the land in the life-time of the Prophet  for the yield on the banks of water streams (rivers) or for a portion of the yield  stipulated by the owner of the land. The Prophet forbade it.&#8221; I said to Rafi,  &#8220;What about renting the land for Dinars and Dirhams?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;There is  no harm in renting for Dinars-Dirhams. Al-Laith said, &#8220;If those who have discernment  for distinguishing what is legal from what is illegal looked into what has been forbidden  concerning this matter they would not permit it, for it is surrounded with dangers.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 538: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once the Prophet was narrating (a story), while a bedouin  was sitting with him. &#8220;One of the inhabitants of Paradise will ask Allah to allow him  to cultivate the land. Allah will ask him, &#8216;Are you not living in the pleasures you like?&#8217;  He will say, &#8216;Yes, but I like to cultivate the land.&#8217; &#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;When  the man (will be permitted he) will sow the seeds and the plants will grow up and get  ripe, ready for reaping and so on till it will be as huge as mountains within a wink.  Allah will then say to him, &#8216;O son of Adam! Take here you are, gather (the yield); nothing  satisfies you.&#8217; &#8221; On that, the bedouin said, &#8220;The man must be either from  Quraish (i.e. an emigrant) or an Ansari, for they are farmers, whereas we are not  farmers.&#8221; The Prophet smiled (at this). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 539: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl bin Sad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We used to be very happy on Friday as an old lady used to  cut some roots of the Silq, which we used to plant on the banks of our small water  streams, and cook them in a pot of her&#8217;s, adding to them, some grains of barley. (Ya&#8217;qub,  the sub-narrator said, &#8220;I think the narrator mentioned that the food did not contain  fat or melted fat (taken from meat).&#8221;) When we offered the Friday prayer we would go  to her and she would serve us with the dish. So, we used to be happy on Fridays because of  that. We used not to take our meals or the midday nap except after the Jumua prayer (i.e.  Friday prayer) . </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.039.540"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 540: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people say that Abu Huraira narrates too many  narrations. In fact Allah knows whether I say the truth or not. They also ask, &#8220;Why  do the emigrants and the Ansar not narrate as he does?&#8221; In fact, my emigrant brethren  were busy trading in the markets, and my Ansar brethren were busy with their properties. I  was a poor man keeping the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and was satisfied with what filled  my stomach. So, I used to be present while they (i.e. the emigrants and the Ansar) were  absent, and I used to remember while they forgot (the Hadith). One day the Prophet said,  &#8220;Whoever spreads his sheet till I finish this statement of mine and then gathers it  on his chest, will never forget anything of my statement.&#8221; So, I spread my covering  sheet which was the only garment I had, till the Prophet finished his statement and then I  gathered it over my chest. By Him Who had sent him (i.e. Allah&#8217;s Apostle) with the truth,  since then I did not forget even a single word of that statement of his, until this day of  mine. By Allah, but for two verses in Allah&#8217;s Book, I would never have related any  narration (from the Prophet). (These two verses are): &#8220;Verily! Those who conceal the  clear signs and the guidance which we have sent down &#8230;..(up to) the Merciful.&#8217;  (2.159-160) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 37, Number 488r: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Salama bin Al-Akwa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once, while we were sitting in the company of Prophet, a  dead man was brought. The Prophet was requested to lead the funeral prayer for the  deceased. He said, &#8220;Is he in debt?&#8221; The people replied in the negative. He said,  &#8220;Has he left any wealth?&#8221; They said, &#8220;No.&#8221; So, he led his funeral  prayer. Another dead man was brought and the people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Lead  his funeral prayer.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Is he in debt?&#8221; They said,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Has he left any wealth?&#8221; They said, &#8221;Three  Dinars.&#8221; So, he led the prayer. Then a third dead man was brought and the people said  (to the Prophet ), Please lead his funeral prayer.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Has he left any  wealth?&#8221; They said, &#8220;No.&#8221; He asked, &#8220;Is he in debt?&#8221; They said,  (&#8220;Yes! He has to pay) three Diners.&#8217;, He (refused to pray and) said, &#8220;Then pray  for your (dead) companion.&#8221; Abu Qatada said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Lead his  funeral prayer, and I will pay his debt.&#8221; So, he led the prayer. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 37, Number 488h: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;An Israeli man asked another  Israeli to lend him one thousand Dinars. The second man required witnesses. The former  replied, &#8216;Allah is sufficient as a witness.&#8217; The second said, &#8216;I want a surety.&#8217; The  former replied, &#8216;Allah is sufficient as a surety.&#8217; The second said, &#8216;You are right,&#8217; and  lent him the money for a certain period. The debtor went across the sea. When he finished  his job, he searched for a conveyance so that he might reach in time for the repayment of  the debt, but he could not find any. So, he took a piece of wood and made a hole in it,  inserted in it one thousand Dinars and a letter to the lender and then closed (i.e.  sealed) the hole tightly. He took the piece of wood to the sea and said. &#8216;O Allah! You  know well that I took a loan of one thousand Dinars from so-and-so. He demanded a surety  from me but I told him that Allah&#8217;s Guarantee was sufficient and he accepted Your  guarantee. He then asked for a witness and I told him that Allah was sufficient as a  Witness, and he accepted You as a Witness. No doubt, I tried hard to find a conveyance so  that I could pay his money but could not find, so I hand over this money to You.&#8217; Saying  that, he threw the piece of wood into the sea till it went out far into it, and then he  went away. Meanwhile he started searching for a conveyance in order to reach the  creditor&#8217;s country. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>One day the lender came out of his house to see whether a  ship had arrived bringing his money, and all of a sudden he saw the piece of wood in which  his money had been deposited. He took it home to use for fire. When he sawed it, he found  his money and the letter inside it. Shortly after that, the debtor came bringing one  thousand Dinars to him and said, &#8216;By Allah, I had been trying hard to get a boat so that I  could bring you your money, but failed to get one before the one I have come by.&#8217; The  lender asked, &#8216;Have you sent something to me?&#8217; The debtor replied, &#8216;I have told you I  could not get a boat other than the one I have come by.&#8217; The lender said, &#8216;Allah has  delivered on your behalf the money you sent in the piece of wood. So, you may keep your  one thousand Dinars and depart guided on the right path.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 37, Number 489: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Said bin Jubair: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn Abbas said, &#8220;In the verse: To every one We have  appointed &#8216; (Muwaliya Mawaliya means one&#8217;s) heirs (4.33).&#8217; (And regarding the verse) &#8216;And  those with whom your right hands have made a pledge.&#8217; Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;When the  emigrants came to the Prophet in Medina, the emigrant would inherit the Ansari while the  latter&#8217;s relatives would not inherit him because of the bond of brotherhood which the  Prophet established between them (i.e. the emigrants and the Ansar). When the verse: &#8216;And  to everyone We have appointed heirs&#8217; (4.33) was revealed, it cancelled (the bond (the  pledge) of brotherhood regarding inheritance).&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;The verse: To  those also to whom your right hands have pledged, remained valid regarding co-operation  and mutual advice, while the matter of inheritance was excluded and it became permissible  to assign something in one&#8217;s testament to the person who had the right of inheriting  before. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf came to us and Allah&#8217;s Apostle  established a bond of brotherhood between him and Sad bin Rabi&#8217;a. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 37, Number 491: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Asim: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Anas bin Malik, &#8220;Have you ever heard that the  Prophet said, &#8216;There is no alliance in Islam?&#8217; &#8221; He replied, &#8220;The Prophet made  alliance between Quarish and the Ansar in my house.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 37, Number 492: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Salama bin Al-Akwa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A dead person was brought to the Prophet so that he might  lead the funeral prayer for him. He asked, &#8220;Is he in debt?&#8221; When the people  replied in the negative, he led the funeral prayer. Another dead person was brought and he  asked, &#8220;Is he in debt?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He (refused to lead the  prayer and) said, &#8220;Lead the prayer of your friend.&#8221; Abu Qatada said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I undertake to pay his debt.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then led his funeral  prayer. </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.037.493"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 37, Number 493: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once the Prophet said (to me), &#8220;If the money of  Bahrain comes, I will give you a certain amount of it.&#8221; The Prophet had breathed his  last before the money of Bahrain arrived. When the money of Bahrain reached, Abu Bakr  announced, &#8220;Whoever was promised by the Prophet should come to us.&#8221; I went to  Abu Bakr and said, &#8220;The Prophet promised me so and so.&#8221; Abu Bakr gave me a  handful of coins and when I counted them, they were five-hundred in number. Abu Bakr then  said, &#8220;Take twice the amount you have taken (besides).&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.037.494"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 37, Number 494: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(wife of the Prophet) Since I reached the age when I could  remember things, I have seen my parents worshipping according to the right faith of Islam.  Not a single day passed but Allah&#8217;s Apostle visited us both in the morning and in the  evening. When the Muslims were persecuted, Abu Bakr set out for Ethiopia as an emigrant.  When he reached a place called Bark-al-Ghimad, he met Ibn Ad-Daghna, the chief of the Qara  tribe, who asked Abu Bakr, &#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;My people  have turned me out of the country and I would like to tour the world and worship my  Lord.&#8221; Ibn Ad-Daghna said, &#8220;A man like you will not go out, nor will he be  turned out as you help the poor earn their living, keep good relation with your Kith and  kin, help the disabled (or the dependents), provide guests with food and shelter, and help  people during their troubles. I am your protector. So, go back and worship your Lord at  your home.&#8221; Ibn Ad-Daghna went along with Abu Bakr and took him to the chiefs of  Quraish saying to them, &#8220;A man like Abu Bakr will not go out, nor will he be turned  out. Do you turn out a man who helps the poor earn their living, keeps good relations with  Kith and kin, helps the disabled, provides guests with food and shelter, and helps the  people during their troubles?&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So, Quraish allowed Ibn Ad-Daghna&#8217;s guarantee of protection  and told Abu- Bakr that he was secure, and said to Ibn Ad-Daghna, &#8220;Advise Abu Bakr to  worship his Lord in his house and to pray and read what he liked and not to hurt us and  not to do these things publicly, for we fear that our sons and women may follow him.&#8221;  Ibn Ad-Daghna told Abu Bakr of all that, so Abu- Bakr continued worshipping his Lord in  his house and did not pray or recite Qur&#8217;an aloud except in his house. Later on Abu Bakr  had an idea of building a mosque in the court yard of his house. He fulfilled that idea  and started praying and reciting Qur&#8217;an there publicly. The women and the offspring of the  pagans started gathering around him and looking at him astonishingly. Abu Bakr was a  softhearted person and could not help weeping while reciting Qur&#8217;an. This horrified the  pagan chiefs of Quraish. They sent for Ibn Ad-Daghna and when he came, they said, &#8220;We  have given Abu Bakr protection on condition that he will worship his Lord in his house,  but he has transgressed that condition and has built a mosque in the court yard of his  house and offered his prayer and recited Qur&#8217;an in public. We are afraid lest he mislead  our women and offspring. So, go to him and tell him that if he wishes he can worship his  Lord in his house only, and if not, then tell him to return your pledge of protection as  we do not like to betray you by revoking your pledge, nor can we tolerate Abu Bakr&#8217;s  public declaration of Islam (his worshipping).&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Aisha added: Ibn Ad-Daghna came to Abu Bakr and said,  &#8220;You know the conditions on which I gave you protection, so you should either abide  by those conditions or revoke my protection, as I do not like to hear the &#8216;Arabs saying  that Ibn Ad-Daghna gave the pledge of protection to a person and his people did not  respect it.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;I revoke your pledge of protection and am satisfied  with Allah&#8217;s protection.&#8221; At that time Allah&#8217;s Apostle was still in Mecca and he said  to his companions, &#8220;Your place of emigration has been shown to me. I have seen salty  land, planted with date-palms and situated between two mountains which are the two  ,Harras.&#8221; So, when the Prophet told it, some of the companions migrated to Medina,  and some of those who had migrated to Ethiopia returned to Medina. When Abu Bakr prepared  for emigration, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to him, &#8220;Wait, for I expect to be permitted to  emigrate.&#8221; Abu Bakr asked, &#8220;May my father be sacrificed for your sake, do you  really expect that?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied in the affirmative. So, Abu Bakr  postponed his departure in order to accompany Allah&#8217;s Apostle and fed two camels which he  had, with the leaves of Samor trees for four months. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 37, Number 495: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever a dead man in debt was brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle  he would ask, &#8220;Has he left anything to repay his debt?&#8221; If he was informed that  he had left something to repay his debts, he would offer his funeral prayer, otherwise he  would tell the Muslims to offer their friend&#8217;s funeral prayer. When Allah made the Prophet  wealthy through conquests, he said, &#8220;I am more rightful than other believers to be  the guardian of the believers, so if a Muslim dies while in debt, I am responsible for the  repayment of his debt, and whoever leaves wealth (after his death) it will belong to his  heirs. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;O Muslim women! None of you should  look down upon the gift sent by her she-neighbour even if it were the trotters of the  sheep (fleshless part of legs).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Urwa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Aisha said to me, &#8220;O my nephew! We used to see the  crescent, and then the crescent and then the crescent in this way we saw three crescents  in two months and no fire (for cooking) used to be made in the houses of Allah&#8217;s Apostle.  I said, &#8220;O my aunt! Then what use to sustain you?&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;The two  black things: dates and water, our neighbors from Ansar had some Manarh and they used to  present Allah&#8217;s Apostle some of their milk and he used to make us drink.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;I shall accept the invitation even  if I were invited to a meal of a sheep&#8217;s trotter, and I shall accept the gift even if it  were an arm or a trotter of a sheep.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 47, Number 743: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet sent for a woman from the emigrants and she had  a slave who was a carpenter. The Prophet said to her &#8220;Order your slave to prepare the  wood (pieces) for the pulpit.&#8221; So, she ordered her slave who went and cut the wood  from the tamarisk and prepared the pulpit, for the Prophet. When he finished the pulpit,  the woman informed the Prophet that it had been finished. The Prophet asked her to send  that pulpit to him, so they brought it. The Prophet lifted it and placed it at the place  in which you see now.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 47, Number 744: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Abu Qatada Al-Aslami: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That his father said, &#8220;One day I was sitting with some  of the Prophet&#8217;s companions on the way to Mecca. Allah&#8217;s Apostle was ahead of us. All of  my companions were in the state of Ihram while I was a non-Muhrim. They saw an onager  while I was busy repairing my shoes, so they did not tell me about it but they wished I  had seen it. By chance I looked up and saw it. So, I turned to the horse, saddled it and  rode on it, forgetting to take the spear and the whip. I asked them if they could hand  over to me the whip and the spear but they said, &#8216;No, by Allah, we shall not help you in  that in any way.&#8217; I became angry and got down from the horse, picked up both the things  and rode the horse again. I attacked the onager and slaughtered it, and brought it (after  it had been dead). They took it (cooked some of it) and started eating it, but they  doubted whether it was allowed for them to eat it or not, as they were in the state of  Ihram. So, we proceeded and I hid with me one of its fore-legs. When we met Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and asked him about the case, he asked, &#8216;Do you have a portion of it with you?&#8217; I  replied in the affirmative and gave him that fleshy fore-leg which he ate completely while  he was in the state of Ihram . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 47, Number 745: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once Allah&#8217;s Apostle visited us in this house of ours and  asked for something to drink. We milked one of our sheep and mixed it with water from this  well of ours and gave it to him. Abu Bakr was sitting on his left side and &#8216;Umar in front  of him and a bedouin on his right side. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle finished, &#8216;Umar said to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle &#8220;Here is Abu Bakr.&#8221; But Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave the remaining milk  to the bedouin and said twice, &#8220;The (persons on the) right side! So, start from the  right side.&#8221; Anas added, &#8220;It is a Sunna (the Prophet&#8217;s traditions)&#8221; and  repeated it thrice. </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.047.746"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 47, Number 746: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We chased a rabbit at Mar-al-Zahran and the people ran  after it but were exhausted. I overpowered and caught it, and gave it to Abu Talha who  slaughtered it and sent its hip or two thighs to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. (The narrator confirms  that he sent two thighs). The Prophet accepted that. (The sub-narrator asked Anas,  &#8220;Did the Prophet; eat from it?&#8221; Anas replied, &#8220;He ate from it.&#8221;) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated As-Sa&#8217;b bin Jaththama: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>An onager was presented to Allah&#8217;s Apostle at the place  called Al-Abwa&#8217; or Waddan, but Allah&#8217;s Apostle rejected it. When the Prophet noticed the  signs of sorrow on the giver&#8217;s face he said, &#8220;We have not rejected your gift, but we  are in the state of Ihram.&#8221; (i.e. if we were not in a state of Ihram we would have  accepted your gift, Fateh-al-Bari page 130, Vol. 6) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 47, Number 748: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people used to look forward for the days of my  (&#8216;Aisha&#8217;s) turn to send gifts to Allah&#8217;s Apostle in order to please him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 47, Number 749: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Said bin Jubair: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn Abbas said: Um Hufaid, Ibn &#8216;Abbas&#8217;s aunt sent some  dried yogurt (butter free), ghee (butter) and a mastigar to the Prophet as a gift. The  Prophet ate the dried yogurt and butter but left the mastigar because he disliked it. Ibn  &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;The mastigar was eaten at the table of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and if it had  been illegal to eat, it could not have been eaten at the table of Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 47, Number 750: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever a meal was brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, he would  ask whether it was a gift or Sadaqa (something given in charity). If he was told that it  was Sadaqa, he would tell his companions to eat it, but if it was a gift, he would hurry  to share it with them. </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.047.751"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 47, Number 751: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Some meat was brought to the Prophet and it was said that  the meat had been given in charity to Buraira. He said, &#8220;It was Sadaqa for Buraira  but a gift for us.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.047.752"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 47, Number 752: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I intended to buy Buraira but her masters stipulated that  her Wala should be for them. When the Prophet was told about it, he said to me, &#8220;Buy  and manumit her, as the Wala&#8217; is for the liberator.&#8221; Once Buraira was given some  meat, and the Prophet asked, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; I said, &#8220;It has been given to  Buraira in charity.&#8221; He said, &#8220;It is sadaqa for her but a gift for us.&#8221;  Buraira was given the option (to stay with her husband or to part with him). AbdurRahman  (a sub-narrator) wondered, &#8220;Was her husband a slave or a free man?&#8221; Shu&#8217;ba  (another sub-narrator) said, &#8220;I asked &#8216;Abdur-Rahman whether her husband was a slave  or a free man. He replied that he did not know whether he was a slave or a free man.&#8221;  </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.047.753"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 47, Number 753: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Um &#8216;Atiyya: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once the Prophet went to &#8216;Aisha and asked her whether she  had something (to eat). She said that she had nothing except the mutton which Um &#8216;Atiyya  had sent to (Buraira) in charity. The Prophet said that it had reached its destination  (i.e. it is no longer an object of charity.) </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.047.754"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 47, Number 754: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people used to send gifts to the Prophet on the day of  my turn. Um Salama said: &#8220;My companions (the wives of the Prophet Other than Aisha)  gathered and they complained about it. So I informed the Prophet about it on their behalf,  but he remained silent. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.047.755"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 47, Number 755: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Urwa from &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The wives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle were in two groups. One group  consisted of &#8216;Aisha, Hafsa, Safiyya and Sauda; and the other group consisted of Um Salama  and the other wives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. The Muslims knew that Allah&#8217;s Apostle loved  &#8216;Aisha, so if any of them had a gift and wished to give to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, he would delay  it, till Allah&#8217;s Apostle had come to &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s home and then he would send his gift to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle in her home. The group of Um Salama discussed the matter together and  decided that Um Salama should request Allah&#8217;s Apostle to tell the people to send their  gifts to him in whatever wife&#8217;s house he was. Um Salama told Allah&#8217;s Apostle of what they  had said, but he did not reply. Then they (those wives) asked Um Salama about it. She  said, &#8220;He did not say anything to me.&#8221; They asked her to talk to him again. She  talked to him again when she met him on her day, but he gave no reply. When they asked  her, she replied that he had given no reply. They said to her, &#8220;Talk to him till he  gives you a reply.&#8221; When it was her turn, she talked to him again. He then said to  her, &#8220;Do not hurt me regarding Aisha, as the Divine Inspirations do not come to me on  any of the beds except that of Aisha.&#8221; On that Um Salama said, &#8220;I repent to  Allah for hurting you.&#8221; Then the group of Um Salama called Fatima, the daughter of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and sent her to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to say to him, &#8220;Your wives request to  treat them and the daughter of Abu Bakr on equal terms.&#8221; Then Fatima conveyed the  message to him. The Prophet said, &#8220;O my daughter! Don&#8217;t you love whom I love?&#8221;  She replied in the affirmative and returned and told them of the situation. They requested  her to go to him again but she refused. They then sent Zainab bint Jahsh who went to him  and used harsh words saying, &#8220;Your wives request you to treat them and the daughter  of Ibn Abu Quhafa on equal terms.&#8221; On that she raised her voice and abused &#8216;Aisha to  her face so much so that Allah&#8217;s Apostle looked at &#8216;Aisha to see whether she would retort.  &#8216;Aisha started replying to Zainab till she silenced her. The Prophet then looked at &#8216;Aisha  and said, &#8220;She is really the daughter of Abu Bakr.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Miswar bin Makhrama and Marwan: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the delegates of the tribe of Hawazin came to the  Prophet he stood up amongst the people, Glorified and Praised Allah as He deserved, and  said, &#8220;Then after: Your brethren have come to you with repentance and I see it  logical to return to them their captives; so whoever amongst you likes to do that as a  favor, then he can do it, and whoever of you like to stick to his share till we give him  his right from the very first Fai (war booty) (1) which Allah will bestow on us, then (he  can do so).&#8221; The people replied, &#8220;We do that (to return the captives) willingly  as a favor for your sake.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that his father took him to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said,  &#8220;I have given this son of mine a slave.&#8221; The Prophet asked, &#8220;Have you given  all your sons the like?&#8221; He replied in the negative. The Prophet said, &#8220;Take  back your gift then.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard An-Nu&#8217;man bin Bashir on the pulpit saying, &#8220;My  father gave me a gift but &#8216;Amra bint Rawaha (my mother) said that she would not agree to  it unless he made Allah&#8217;s Apostle as a witness to it. So, my father went to Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and said, &#8216;I have given a gift to my son from &#8216;Amra bint Rawaha, but she ordered  me to make you as a witness to it, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked, &#8216;Have you  given (the like of it) to everyone of your sons?&#8217; He replied in the negative. Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said, &#8216;Be afraid of Allah, and be just to your children.&#8217; My father then returned  and took back his gift.&#8221; </font></p>

He came out leaning on  two men while his feet were dragging on the ground. He was walking between Al-&#8216;Abbas and  another man.&#8221; &#8216;Ubaidullah said, &#8220;When I informed Ibn &#8216;Abbas of what &#8216;Aisha had  said, he asked me whether I knew who was the second man whom &#8216;Aisha had not named.

By Him in Whose Hands my life is, whoever takes something from the  resources of the Zakat (unlawfully) will be carrying it on his neck on the Day of  Resurrection; if it be a camel, it will be grunting; if a cow, it will be mooing; and if a  sheep, it will be bleating.&#8221; The Prophet then raised his hands till we saw the  whiteness of his armpits, and he said thrice, &#8220;O Allah!

So, Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not give them the fruits, nor did he cut  them and distribute them among them, but said, &#8220;I will come to you tomorrow  morning.&#8221; So, he came to us the next morning and walked about in between the  date-palms and invoked Allah to bless their fruits. I plucked the fruits and gave back all  the rights of the creditors in full, and a lot of fruits were left for us. Then I went to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle, who was sitting, and informed him about what happened.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet had returned from Ta&#8217;if, he waited for  them for more than ten nights.

The Prophet then stood up amongst the  Muslims, Glorified and Praised Allah as He deserved, and then said, &#8220;Then after:  These brothers of yours have come to you with repentance and I see it proper to return  their captives, so whoever amongst you likes to do that as a favor, then he can do it, and  whoever of you wants to stick to his share till we pay him from the very first Fai (i.e.  war booty) which Allah will give us, then he can do so.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;We  return (the captives) to them willingly as a favor, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;I do not know who of you has given his consent and who has not; so go back and  your leaders may present your decision to me.&#8221; The people went away, and their  leaders discussed the matter with them, and then came to the Prophet to tell him that all  of them had given their consent (to return the captives) willingly.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I gave a horse in Allah&#8217;s Cause. The person to whom it was  given, did not look after it. I intended to buy it from him, thinking that he would sell  it cheap.

He asked, &#8220;Do you lend them so that their milk may be utilized by  others?&#8221; The bedouin said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The Prophet asked, &#8220;Do you milk them  on the day off watering them?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Do good deeds beyond the merchants (or the sea) and Allah will never disregard any  of your deeds.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 260, Vol. 5) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr came riding his horse from his dwelling place in As-Sunh. He got down from it, entered the Mosque and did not speak with anybody till he came to me and went direct to the Prophet, who was covered with a marked blanket. Abu Bakr uncovered his face. He knelt down and kissed him and then started weeping and said, &#8220;My father and my mother be sacrificed for you, O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! Allah will not combine two deaths on you. You have died the death which was written for you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Salama from Ibn Abbas : Abu Bakr came out and &#8216;Umar , was addressing the people, and Abu Bakr told him to sit down but &#8216;Umar refused. Abu Bakr again told him to sit down but &#8216;Umar again refused. Then Abu Bakr recited the Tashah-hud (i.e. none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is Allah&#8217;s Apostle) and the people attended to Abu Bakr and left &#8216;Umar. Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Amma ba&#8217;du, whoever amongst you worshipped Muhammad, then Muhammad is dead, but whoever worshipped Allah, Allah is alive and will never die. Allah said: &#8216;Muhammad is no more than an Apostle and indeed (many) Apostles have passed away before him ..(up to the) grateful.&#8217; &#8221; (3.144) (The narrator added, &#8220;By Allah, it was as if the people never knew that Allah had revealed this verse before till Abu Bakr recited it and then whoever heard it, started reciting it &#8220;)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the daughters of &#8216;Uthman died at Mecca. We went to attend her funeral procession. Ibn &#8216;Umar and Ibn Abbas were also present. I sat in between them (or said, I sat beside one of them. Then a man came and sat beside me.) &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar said to &#8216;Amr bin &#8216;Uthman, &#8220;Will you not prohibit crying as Allah&#8217;s Apostle has said, &#8216;The dead person is tortured by the crying of his relatives.?&#8221; Ibn Abbas said, &#8220;Umar used to say so.&#8221; Then he added narrating, &#8220;I accompanied Umar on a journey from Mecca till we reached Al-Baida. There he saw some travelers in the shade of a Samura (A kind of forest tree). He said (to me), &#8220;Go and see who those travelers are.&#8221; So I went and saw that one of them was Suhaib. I told this to &#8216;Umar who then asked me to call him. So I went back to Suhaib and said to him, &#8220;Depart and follow the chief of the faithful believers.&#8221; Later, when &#8216;Umar was stabbed, Suhaib came in weeping and saying, &#8220;O my brother, O my friend!&#8221; (on this &#8216;Umar said to him, &#8220;O Suhaib! Are you weeping for me while the Prophet said, &#8220;The dead person is punished by some of the weeping of his relatives?&#8221; Ibn Abbas added, &#8220;When &#8216;Umar died I told all this to Aisha and she said, &#8216;May Allah be merciful to Umar. By Allah, Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not say that a believer is punished by the weeping of his relatives. But he said, Allah increases the punishment of a non-believer because of the weeping of his relatives.&#8221; Aisha further added, &#8220;The Quran is sufficient for you (to clear up this point) as Allah has stated: &#8216;No burdened soul will bear another&#8217;s burden.&#8217; &#8221; (35.18). Ibn Abbas then said, &#8220;Only Allah makes one laugh or cry.&#8221; Ibn Umar did not say anything after that.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">That his father said, &#8220;In the year of the last Hajj of the Prophet I became seriously ill and the Prophet used to visit me inquiring about my health. I told him, &#8216;I am reduced to this state because of illness and I am wealthy and have no inheritors except a daughter, (In this narration the name of &#8216;Amir bin Sad is mentioned and in fact it is a mistake; the narrator is &#8216;Aisha bint Sad bin Abi Waqqas). Should I give two-thirds of my property in charity?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No.&#8217; I asked, &#8216;Half?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No.&#8217; then he added, &#8216;One-third, and even one-third is much. You&#8217;d better leave your inheritors wealthy rather than leaving them poor, begging others. You will get a reward for whatever you spend for Allah&#8217;s sake, even for what you put in your wife&#8217;s mouth.&#8217; I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Will I be left alone after my companions have gone?&#8217; He said, &#8216;If you are left behind, whatever good deeds you will do will up-grade you and raise you high. And perhaps you will have a long life so that some people will be benefited by you while others will be harmed by you. O Allah! Complete the emigration of my companions and do not turn them renegades.&#8217; But Allah&#8217;s Apostle felt sorry for poor Sad bin Khaula as he died in Mecca.&#8221; (but Sad bin Abi Waqqas lived long after the Prophet (p.b.u.h).)</p>

Allah has given you a place in Paradise instead of it.&#8217; &#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;The dead person will see both his places.

He ordered (that he be taken out of the grave) and he was taken out. Then he placed him on his knees and threw some of his saliva on him and clothed him in his (the Prophet&#8217;s) own shirt. Allah knows better (why he did so). &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai had given his shirt to Al-Abbas to wear. Abu Harun said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle at that time had two shirts and the son of &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai said to him, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Clothe my father in your shirt which has been in contact with your skin.&#8217; &#8216; Sufyan added, &#8220;Thus people think that the Prophet clothed &#8216;Abdullah bin Tubal in his shirt in lieu of what he (Abdullah) had done (for Al Abbas, the Prophet&#8217;s uncle.)&#8221;</p>

I do not leave anyone after me dearer to me than you, except Allah&#8217;s Apostle&#8217;s soul and I owe some debt and you should repay it and treat your sisters favorably (nicely and politely).&#8221; So in the morning he was the first to be martyred and was buried along with another (martyr).

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umar set out along with the Prophet (p.b.u.h) with a group of people to Ibn Saiyad till they saw him playing with the boys near the hillocks of Bani Mughala. Ibn Saiyad at that time was nearing his puberty and did not notice (us) until the Prophet stroked him with his hand and said to him, &#8220;Do you testify that I am Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; Ibn Saiyad looked at him and said, &#8220;I testify that you are the Messenger of illiterates.&#8221; Then Ibn Saiyad asked the Prophet (p.b.u.h), &#8220;Do you testify that I am Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; The Prophet (p.b.u.h) refuted it and said, &#8220;I believe in Allah and His Apostles.&#8221; Then he said (to Ibn Saiyad), &#8220;What do you think?&#8221; Ibn Saiyad answered, &#8220;True people and liars visit me.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;You have been confused as to this matter.&#8221; Then the Prophet said to him, &#8220;I have kept something (in my mind) for you, (can you tell me that?)&#8221; Ibn Saiyad said, &#8220;It is Al-Dukh (the smoke).&#8221; (2) The Prophet said, &#8220;Let you be in ignominy. You cannot cross your limits.&#8221; On that &#8216;Umar, said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allow me to chop his head off.&#8221; The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;If he is he (i.e. Dajjal), then you cannot over-power him, and if he is not, then there is no use of murdering him.&#8221; (Ibn &#8216;Umar added): Later on Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) once again went along with Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b to the date-palm trees (garden) where Ibn Saiyad was staying. The Prophet (p.b.u.h) wanted to hear something from Ibn Saiyad before Ibn Saiyad could see him, and the Prophet (p.b.u.h) saw him lying covered with a sheet and from where his murmurs were heard. Ibn Saiyad&#8217;s mother saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle while he was hiding himself behind the trunks of the date-palm trees. She addressed Ibn Saiyad, &#8220;O Saf ! (and this was the name of Ibn Saiyad) Here is Muhammad.&#8221; And with that Ibn Saiyad got up. The Prophet said, &#8220;Had this woman left him (Had she not disturbed him), then Ibn Saiyad would have revealed the reality of his case.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The funeral prayer should be offered for every child even if he were the son of a prostitute as he was born with a true faith of Islam (i.e. to worship none but Allah Alone). If his parents are Muslims, particularly the father, even if his mother were a non-Muslim, and if he after the delivery cries (even once) before his death (i.e. born alive) then the funeral prayer must be offered. And if the child does not cry after his delivery (i.e. born dead) then his funeral prayer should not be offered, and he will be considered as a miscarriage. Abu Huraira, narrated that the Prophet said, &#8220;Every child is born with a true faith (i.e. to worship none but Allah Alone) but his parents convert him to Judaism or to Christianity or to Magainism, as an animal delivers a perfect baby animal. Do you find it mutilated?&#8221; Then Abu Huraira recited the holy verses: &#8216;The pure Allah&#8217;s Islamic nature (true faith i.e. to worship none but Allah Alone), with which He has created human beings.&#8217; &#8221; (30.30).</p>

He then took a green leaf of a date-palm tree split it into two pieces and fixed one on each grave. The people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

Should we not depend on what has been written for us and leave the deeds as whoever amongst us is blessed will do the deeds of a blessed person and whoever amongst us will be wretched, will do the deeds of a wretched person?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;The good deeds are made easy for the blessed, and bad deeds are made easy for the wretched.&#8221; Then he recited the Verses:&#8211; &#8220;As for him who gives (in charity) and is Allah-fearing And believes in the Best reward from Allah. &#8221; (92.5-6)</p>

What has been affirmed?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I said the same as the Prophet had said, that is: if four persons testify the piety of a Muslim, Allah will grant him Paradise.&#8221; We asked, &#8220;If three persons testify his piety?&#8221; He (the Prophet) replied, &#8220;Even three.&#8221; Then we asked, &#8220;If two?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Even two.&#8221; We did not ask him regarding one witness.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 468:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Samura bin Jundab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever the Prophet finished the (morning) prayer, he would face us and ask, &#8220;Who amongst you had a dream last night?&#8221; So if anyone had seen a dream he would narrate it. The Prophet would say: &#8220;Ma sha&#8217;a-llah&#8221; (An Arabic maxim meaning literally, &#8216;What Allah wished,&#8217; and it indicates a good omen.) One day, he asked us whether anyone of us had seen a dream. We replied in the negative. The Prophet said, &#8220;But I had seen (a dream) last night that two men came to me, caught hold of my hands, and took me to the Sacred Land (Jerusalem). There, I saw a person sitting and another standing with an iron hook in his hand pushing it inside the mouth of the former till it reached the jaw-bone, and then tore off one side of his cheek, and then did the same with the other side; in the mean-time the first side of his cheek became normal again and then he repeated the same operation again. I said, &#8216;What is this?&#8217; They told me to proceed on and we went on till we came to a man Lying flat on his back, and another man standing at his head carrying a stone or a piece of rock, and crushing the head of the Lying man, with that stone. Whenever he struck him, the stone rolled away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man went to pick it up and by the time he returned to him, the crushed head had returned to its normal state and the man came back and struck him again (and so on). I said, &#8216;Who is this?&#8217; They told me to proceed on; so we proceeded on and passed by a hole like an oven; with a narrow top and wide bottom, and the fire was kindling underneath that hole. Whenever the fire-flame went up, the people were lifted up to such an extent that they about to get out of it, and whenever the fire got quieter, the people went down into it, and there were naked men and women in it. I said, &#8216;Who is this?&#8217; They told me to proceed on. So we proceeded on till we reached a river of blood and a man was in it, and another man was standing at its bank with stones in front of him, facing the man standing in the river. Whenever the man in the river wanted to come out, the other one threw a stone in his mouth and caused him to retreat to his original position; and so whenever he wanted to come out the other would throw a stone in his mouth, and he would retreat to his original position. I asked, &#8216;What is this?&#8217; They told me to proceed on and we did so till we reached a well-flourished green garden having a huge tree and near its root was sitting an old man with some children. (I saw) Another man near the tree with fire in front of him and he was kindling it up. Then they (i.e. my two companions) made me climb up the tree and made me enter a house, better than which I have ever seen. In it were some old men and young men, women and children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then they took me out of this house and made me climb up the tree and made me enter another house that was better and superior (to the first) containing old and young people. I said to them (i.e. my two companions), &#8216;You have made me ramble all the night. Tell me all about that I have seen.&#8217; They said, &#8216;Yes. As for the one whose cheek you saw being torn away, he was a liar and he used to tell lies, and the people would report those lies on his authority till they spread all over the world. So, he will be punished like that till the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one whose head you saw being crushed is the one whom Allah had given the knowledge of Quran (i.e. knowing it by heart) but he used to sleep at night (i.e. he did not recite it then) and did not use to act upon it (i.e. upon its orders etc.) by day; and so this punishment will go on till the Day of Resurrection. And those you saw in the hole (like oven) were adulterers (those men and women who commit illegal sexual intercourse). And those you saw in the river of blood were those dealing in Riba (usury). And the old man who was sitting at the base of the tree was Abraham and the little children around him were the offspring of the people. And the one who was kindling the fire was Malik, the gate-keeper of the Hell-fire. And the first house in which you have gone was the house of the common believers, and the second house was of the martyrs. I am Gabriel and this is Michael. Raise your head.&#8217; I raised my head and saw a thing like a cloud over me. They said, &#8216;That is your place.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Let me enter my place.&#8217; They said, &#8216;You still have some life which you have not yet completed, and when you complete (that remaining portion of your life) you will then enter your place.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

Then he said, &#8216;Wash this garment of mine and add two more garments and shroud me in them.&#8217; I said, &#8216;This is worn out.&#8217; He said, &#8216;A living person has more right to wear new clothes than a dead one; the shroud is only for the body&#8217;s pus.&#8217; He did not die till it was the night of Tuesday and was buried before the morning.&#8221;</p>

No-one could be found who could tell them about it till I (&#8216;Urwa) said to them, &#8220;By Allah, this is not the foot of the Prophet but it is the foot of Umar.&#8221; Aisha narrated that she made a will to &#8216;Abdullah bin Zubair, &#8220;Do not bury me with them (the Prophet and his two companions) but bury me with my companions (wives of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ) in Al-Baqi as I would not like to be looked upon as better than I really am (by being buried near the Prophet).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I saw &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab (when he was stabbed) saying, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar! Go to the mother of the believers Aisha and say, &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab sends his greetings to you,&#8217; and request her to allow me to be buried with my companions.&#8221; (So, Ibn &#8216;Umar conveyed the message to &#8216;Aisha.) She said, &#8220;I had the idea of having this place for myself but today I prefer him (&#8216;Umar) to myself (and allow him to be buried there).&#8221; When &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar returned, &#8216;Umar asked him, &#8220;What (news) do you have?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;O chief of the believers! She has allowed you (to be buried there).&#8221; On that &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Nothing was more important to me than to be buried in that (sacred) place. So, when I expire, carry me there and pay my greetings to her (&#8216;Aisha ) and say, &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks permission; and if she gives permission, then bury me (there) and if she does not, then take me to the grave-yard of the Muslims. I do not think any person has more right for the caliphate than those with whom Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) was always pleased till his death. And whoever is chosen by the people after me will be the caliph, and you people must listen to him and obey him,&#8221; and then he mentioned the name of &#8216;Uthman, &#8216;Ali, Talha, Az-Zubair, &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf and Sad bin Abi Waqqas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By this time a young man from Ansar came and said, &#8220;O chief of the believers! Be happy with Allah&#8217;s glad tidings. The grade which you have in Islam is known to you, then you became the caliph and you ruled with justice and then you have been awarded martyrdom after all this.&#8221; &#8216;Umar replied, &#8220;O son of my brother! Would that all that privileges will counterbalance (my short comings), so that I neither lose nor gain anything. I recommend my successor to be good to the early emigrants and realize their rights and to protect their honor and sacred things. And I also recommend him to be good to the Ansar who before them, had homes (in Medina) and had adopted the Faith. He should accept the good of the righteous among them and should excuse their wrongdoers. I recommend him to abide by the rules and regulations concerning the Dhimmis (protectees) of Allah and His Apostle, to fulfill their contracts completely and fight for them and not to tax (overburden) them beyond their capabilities.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">from the Prophet the same as above.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 482:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A delegation of the tribe of &#8216;Abdul Qais came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We are from the tribe of Rabi&#8217;a, and the infidels of the tribe of Mudar stands between us and you; so we cannot come to you except during the Sacred Months. Please order us to do something (religious deeds) which we may carry out and also invite to it our people whom we have left behind.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I order you to do four things and forbid you four others: (I order you) to have faith in Allah, and confess that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, (and the Prophet gestured with his hand like this (i.e. one knot) and to offer prayers perfectly and to pay the Zakat, and to pay one-fifth of the booty in Allah&#8217;s Cause. And I forbid you to use Dubba&#8217;, Hantam, Naqir and Muzaffat (all these are the names of utensils used for preparing alcoholic drinks).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 483:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah&#8217;s Apostle died and Abu Bakr became the caliph some Arabs renegade (reverted to disbelief) (Abu Bakr decided to declare war against them), &#8216;Umar, said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;How can you fight with these people although Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;I have been ordered (by Allah) to fight the people till they say: &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and whoever said it then he will save his life and property from me except on trespassing the law (rights and conditions for which he will be punished justly), and his accounts will be with Allah.&#8217; &#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;By Allah! I will fight those who differentiate between the prayer and the Zakat as Zakat is the compulsory right to be taken from the property (according to Allah&#8217;s orders) By Allah! If they refuse to pay me even a she-kid which they used to pay at the time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle . I would fight with them for withholding it&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;By Allah, it was nothing, but Allah opened Abu Bakr&#8217;s chest towards the decision (to fight) and I came to know that his decision was right.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Abdullah bin Umar set out for Mecca intending to perform Umra, at the time of afflictions, he said, &#8220;If I should be prevented from reaching the Kaba, then I would do the same as Allah&#8217;s Apostle did, so I assume the lhram for Umra as Allah&#8217;s Apostle assumed the Ihram for Umra in the year of Hudaibiya.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 34:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That Ubaidullah bin &#8216;Abdullah and Salim bin &#8216;Abdullah informed him that they told Ibn &#8216;Umar when Ibn Az-Zubair was attacked by the army, saying &#8220;There is no harm for you if you did not perform Hajj this year. We are afraid that you may be prevented from reaching the Kaba.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said &#8220;We set out with Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the non-believers of Quraish prevented us from reaching the Ka&#8217;ba, and so the Prophet slaughtered his Hadi and got his head shaved.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;I make you witnesses that I have made &#8216;Umra obligatory for me. And, Allah willing, I will go and then if the way to Ka&#8217;ba is clear, I will perform the Tawaf, but if I am prevented from going to the Ka&#8217;ba then I will do the same as the Prophet did while I was in his company.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar then assumed Ihram for Umra from Dhul-Hulaifa and proceeded for a while and said, &#8220;The conditions of &#8216;Umra and Hajj are similar and I make you witnesses that I have made &#8216;Umra and Hajj obligatory for myself.&#8221; So, he did not finish the Ihram till the day of Nahr (slaughtering) came, and he slaughtered his Hadi. He used to say, &#8220;I will not finish the Ihram till I perform the Tawaf, one Tawaf on the day of entering Mecca (i.e. of Safa and Marwa for both &#8216;Umra and Hajj).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 35:</p>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 36:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle was prevented from performing (&#8216;Umra) Therefore, he shaved his head and had sexual relations with his wives and slaughtered his Hadi and performed Umra in the following year.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 37:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Abdullah) bin &#8216;Umar used to say, &#8220;Is not (the following of) the tradition of Allah&#8217;s Apostle sufficient for you? If anyone of you is prevented from performing Hajj, he should perform the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and between As-Safa and Al-Marwa and then finish the Ihram and everything will become legal for him which was illegal for him (during the state of Ihram) and he can perform Hajj in a following year and he should slaughter a Hadi or fast in case he cannot afford the Hadi.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 38:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Miswar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle slaughtered (the Hadi) before he had his head shaved and then he ordered his Companions to do the same.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 39:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That Abdullah and Salim said to &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar, &#8220;(You should not go for Hajj this year).&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar replied, &#8220;We set out with the Prophet (to Mecca for performing &#8216;Umra) and e infidels of Quraish prevented us from reaching the Ka&#8217;ba. Allah&#8217;s Apostle slaughtered his Budn (camels for sacrifice) and got his head shaved.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 40:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar set out for Mecca with the intentions performing &#8216;Umra in the period of afflictions, he said, &#8220;If I should be prevented from reaching the Ka&#8217;ba, then I would do the same as we did while in the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221; So, he assumed the Ihram for &#8216;Umra since the Prophet had assumed the Ihram for &#8216;Umra in the year of Al-Hudaibiya. Then &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar thought about it and said, &#8220;The conditions for both Hajj and &#8216;Umra are similar.&#8221; He then turned towards his companions and said, &#8220;The conditions of both Hajj and &#8216;Umra are similar and I make you witnesses that I have made the performance of Hajj obligatory for myself along with &#8216;Umra.&#8221; He then performed one Tawaf (between As-Safa and Al-Marwa) for both of them (i.e. Hajj and (&#8216;Umra) and considered that to be sufficient for him and offered a Hadi.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 41:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Layla:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ka&#8217;b bin &#8216;Ujra said that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to him (Ka&#8217;b), &#8220;Perhaps your lice have troubled you?&#8221; Ka&#8217;b replied, &#8220;Yes! O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Have your head shaved and then either fast three days or feed six poor persons or slaughter one sheep as a sacrifice.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 42:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ka&#8217;b bin &#8216;Umra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood beside me at Al-Hudaibiya and the lice were falling from my head in great number. He asked me, &#8220;Have your lice troubled you?&#8221; I replied in the affirmative. He ordered me to get my head shaved. Ka&#8217;b added, &#8220;This Holy Verse:&#8211;&#8216;And if any of you is ill, or has ailment in his scalp (2.196), etc. was revealed regarding me. &#8220;The Prophet then ordered me either to fast three days, or to feed six poor persons with one Faraq (three Sas) (of dates), or to slaughter a sheep, etc (sacrifice) whatever was available.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 43:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Ma&#8217;qal:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I sat with Ka&#8217;b bin &#8216;Ujra and asked him about the Fidya. He replied, &#8220;This revelation was revealed concerning my case especially, but it is also for you in general. I was carried to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the lice were falling in great number on my face. The Prophet said, &#8220;I have never thought that your ailment (or struggle) has reached to such an extent as I see. Can you afford a sheep?&#8221; I replied in the negative. He then said, &#8220;Fast for three days, or feed six poor persons each with half a Sa of food.&#8221; (1 Sa = 3 Kilograms approx.)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 44:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Layla:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Reporting the speech of Ka&#8217;b bin Umra) Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw him (i.e. Ka&#8217;b) while the lice were falling on his face. He asked (him), &#8220;Have your lice troubled you?&#8221; He replied in the affirmative. So, he ordered him to get his head shaved while he was at Al-Hudaibiya. At that time they were not permitted to finish their Ihram, and were still hoping to enter Mecca. So, Allah revealed the verses of Al-Fidya. Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered him to feed six poor persons with one Faraq of food or to slaughter one sheep (as a sacrifice) or to fast for three days.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 45:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whoever performs Hajj to this House (Ka&#8217;ba) and does not approach his wife for sexual relations nor commits sins (while performing Hajj), he will come out as sinless as a newly-born child.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>No doubt, the Prophet mortgaged his armor for barley grams.  Once I took barley bread with some dissolved fat on it to the Prophet and I heard him  saying, &#8220;The household of Muhammad did not possess except a Sa (of food grain,  barley, etc.) for both the morning and the evening meals although they were nine  houses.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Who would kill Ka&#8217;b bin  Al-Ashraf as he has harmed Allah and His Apostle ?&#8221; Muhammad bin Maslama (got up and)  said, &#8220;I will kill him.&#8221; So, Muhammad bin Maslama went to Ka&#8217;b and said, &#8220;I  want a loan of one or two Wasqs of food grains.&#8221; Ka&#8217;b said, &#8220;Mortgage your women  to me.&#8221; Muhammad bin Maslama said, &#8220;How can we mortgage our women, and you are  the most handsome among the Arabs?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Then mortgage your sons to  me.&#8221; Muhammad said, &#8220;How can we mortgage our sons, as the people will abuse them  for being mortgaged for one or two Wasqs of food grains? It is shameful for us. But we  will mortgage our arms to you.&#8221; So, Muhammad bin Maslama promised him that he would  come to him next time. They (Muhammad bin Maslama and his companions came to him as  promised and murdered him. Then they went to the Prophet and told him about it. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Wail: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abdullah (bin Mas&#8217;ud) said, &#8220;Whoever took a false oath  in order to grab somebody&#8217;s property will meet Allah while Allah will be angry with  him.&#8221; Allah revealed the following verse to confirm that:&#8211;&#8220;Verily! Those who  purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah&#8217;s covenant And their oaths&#8230;a painful  torment.&#8221; (3.77) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Al-Ash&#8217;ath bin Qais came to us and asked as to what Abu  Abdur-Rehman (i.e. Ibn Mas&#8217;ud) was telling you.&#8221; We related the story to him. On that  he said, &#8220;He has told the truth. This verse was revealed about me. I had some dispute  with another man regarding a well and we took the case before Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said (to me), &#8220;Produce two witnesses (to support your claim); otherwise the  defendant has the right to take an oath (to refute your claim).&#8217; I said, &#8216;The defendant  would not mind to take a false oath.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said, &#8216;Whoever took a  false oath in order to grab someone else&#8217;s property will meet Allah, Allah will be angry  with him.&#8217; Allah then revealed what Confirmed it.&#8221; Al-Ash&#8217;ath then recited the  following Verse:&#8211;&#8220;Verily! Those who purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah&#8217;s  covenant, And their oaths . . . (to) . . . they shall have a painful torment!&#8217; (3.77) (See  Hadith No. 546) </font></p>

<h3 align="center">Virtues of Madinah</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.030.091"></a>Volume 3, Book 30, Number 91:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Medina is a sanctuary from that place to that. Its trees should not be cut and no heresy should be innovated nor any sin should be committed in it, and whoever innovates in it an heresy or commits sins (bad deeds), then he will incur the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 409, Vol 9).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 92:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet came to Medina and ordered a mosque to be built and said, &#8220;O Bani Najjar! Suggest to me the price (of your land).&#8221; They said, &#8220;We do not want its price except from Allah&#8221; (i.e. they wished for a reward from Allah for giving up their land freely). So, the Prophet ordered the graves of the pagans to be dug out and the land to be levelled, and the date-palm trees to be cut down. The cut date-palms were fixed in the direction of the Qibla of the mosque.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 93:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;I have made Medina a sanctuary between its two (Harrat) mountains.&#8221; The Prophet went to the tribe of Bani Haritha and said (to them), &#8220;I see that you have gone out of the sanctuary,&#8221; but looking around, he added, &#8220;No, you are inside the sanctuary.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 94:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have nothing except the Book of Allah and this written paper from the Prophet (where-in is written:) Medina is a sanctuary from the &#8216;Air Mountain to such and such a place, and whoever innovates in it an heresy or commits a sin, or gives shelter to such an innovator in it will incur the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people, none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted. And the asylum (of protection) granted by any Muslim is to be secured (respected) by all the other Muslims; and whoever betrays a Muslim in this respect incurs the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people, and none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted, and whoever (freed slave) befriends (take as masters) other than his manumitters without their permission incurs the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people, and none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 95:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;I was ordered to migrate to a town which will swallow (conquer) other towns and is called Yathrib and that is Medina, and it turns out (bad) persons as a furnace removes the impurities of iron.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 96:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Humaid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We came with the Prophet from Tabuk, and when we reached near Medina, the Prophet said, &#8220;This is Tabah.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 97:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If I saw deers grazing in Medina, I would not chase them, for Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;(Medina) is a sanctuary between its two mountains.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 98:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;The people will leave Medina in spite of the best state it will have, and none except the wild birds and the beasts of prey will live in it, and the last persons who will die will be two shepherds from the tribe of Muzaina, who will be driving their sheep towards Medina, but will find nobody in it, and when they reach the valley of Thaniyat-al-Wada&#8217;, they will fall down on their faces dead.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 99:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Zuhair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Yemen will be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families, and those who will obey them to migrate (to Yemen) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew. Sham will also be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families and those who will obey them, to migrate (to Sham) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew. &#8216;Iraq will be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families and those who will obey them to migrate (to &#8216;Iraq) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 100:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Verily, Belief returns and goes back to Medina as a snake returns and goes back to its hole (when in danger).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 101:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;None plots against the people of Medina but that he will be dissolved (destroyed) like the salt is dissolved in water.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 102:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Usama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once the Prophet stood at the top of a (looked out from upon one) castle amongst the castles (or the high buildings) of Medina and said, &#8220;Do you see what I see? (No doubt) I see the spots where afflictions will take place among your houses (and these afflictions will be) as numerous as the spots where rain-drops fall.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 103:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The terror caused by Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal will not enter Medina and at that time Medina will have seven gates and there will be two angels at each gate guarding them.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 104:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;There are angels guarding the entrances (or roads) of Medina, neither plague nor Ad-Dajjal will be able to enter it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 105:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;There will be no town which Ad-Dajjal will not enter except Mecca and Medina, and there will be no entrance (road) (of both Mecca and Medina) but the angels will be standing in rows guarding it against him, and then Medina will shake with its inhabitants thrice (i.e. three earth-quakes will take place) and Allah will expel all the nonbelievers and the hypocrites from it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 106:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle told us a long narrative about Ad-Dajjal, and among the many things he mentioned, was his saying, &#8220;Ad-Dajjal will come and it will be forbidden for him to pass through the entrances of Medina. He will land in some of the salty barren areas (outside) Medina; on that day the best man or one of the best men will come up to him and say, &#8216;I testify that you are the same Dajjal whose description was given to us by Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8217; Ad-Dajjal will say to the people, &#8216;If I kill this man and bring him back to life again, will you doubt my claim?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;No.&#8217; Then Ad-Dajjal will kill that man and bring him back to life. That man will say, &#8216;Now I know your reality better than before.&#8217; Ad-Dajjal will say, &#8216;I want to kill him but I cannot.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 107:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A bedouin came to the Prophet and gave a pledge of allegiance for embracing Islam. The next day he came with fever and said (to the Prophet ), &#8220;Please cancel my pledge (of embracing Islam and of emigrating to Medina).&#8221; The Prophet refused (that request) three times and said, &#8220;Medina is like a furnace, it expels out the impurities (bad persons) and selects the good ones and makes them perfect.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 108:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Thabit:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet went out for (the battle of) Uhud, some of his companions (hypocrites) returned (home). A party of the believers remarked that they would kill those (hypocrites) who had returned, but another party said that they would not kill them. So, this Divine Inspiration was revealed: &#8220;Then what is the matter with you that you are divided into two parties concerning the hypocrites.&#8221; (4.88) The Prophet said, &#8220;Medina expels the bad persons from it, as fire expels the impurities of iron.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 109:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah! Bestow on Medina twice the blessings You bestowed on Mecca.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 110:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever the Prophet returned from a journey and observed the walls of Medina, he would make his Mount go fast, and if he was on an animal (i.e. a horse), he would make it gallop because of his love for Medina.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 111:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The people of) Bani Salama intended to shift near the mosque (of the Prophet) but Allah&#8217;s Apostle disliked to see Medina vacated and said, &#8220;O the people of Bani Salama! Don&#8217;t you think that you will be rewarded for your footsteps which you take towards the mosque?&#8221; So, they stayed at their old places.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 112:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, &#8220;There is a garden from the gardens of Paradise between my house and my pulpit, and my pulpit is on my Lake Fount (Al-Kauthar).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 113:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah&#8217;s Apostle reached Medina, Abu Bakr and Bilal became ill. When Abu Bakr&#8217;s fever got worse, he would recite (this poetic verse): &#8220;Everybody is staying alive with his People, yet Death is nearer to him than His shoe laces.&#8221; And Bilal, when his fever deserted him, would recite: &#8220;Would that I could stay overnight in A valley wherein I would be Surrounded by Idhkhir and Jalil (kinds of good-smelling grass). Would that one day I could Drink the water of the Majanna, and Would that (The two mountains) Shama and Tafil would appear to me!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah! Curse Shaiba bin Rabi&#8217;a and &#8216;Utba bin Rabi&#8217;a and Umaiya bin Khalaf as they turned us out of our land to the land of epidemics.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said, &#8220;O Allah! Make us love Medina as we love Mecca or even more than that. O Allah! Give blessings in our Sa and our Mudd (measures symbolizing food) and make the climate of Medina suitable for us, and divert its fever towards Aljuhfa.&#8221; Aisha added: When we reached Medina, it was the most unhealthy of Allah&#8217;s lands, and the valley of Bathan (the valley of Medina) used to flow with impure colored water.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 114:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Aslam from his father:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar said, O Allah! Grant me martyrdom in Your cause, and let my death be in the city of Your Apostle.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abdullah bin Umar: Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;It  is not permissible for any Muslim who has something to will to stay for two nights without  having his last will and testament written and kept ready with him.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 51, Number 2: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Amr bin Al-Harith: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(The brother of the wife of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Juwaira bint  Al-Harith) When Allah&#8217;s Apostle died, he did not leave any Dirham or Dinar (i.e. money), a  slave or a slave woman or anything else except his white mule, his arms and a piece of  land which he had given in charity . </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.051.003"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 51, Number 3: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Talha bin Musarrif: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked &#8216;Abdullah bin Abu Aufa &#8220;Did the Prophet make a  will?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;No,&#8221; I asked him, &#8220;How is it then that the making  of a will has been enjoined on people, (or that they are ordered to make a will)?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;The Prophet bequeathed Allah&#8217;s Book (i.e. Quran).&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.051.004"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 51, Number 4: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Aswad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the presence of &#8216;Aisha some people mentioned that the  Prophet had appointed &#8216;Ali by will as his successor. &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;When did he  appoint him by will? Verily when he died he was resting against my chest (or said: in my  lap) and he asked for a wash-basin and then collapsed while in that state, and I could not  even perceive that he had died, so when did he appoint him by will?&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 51, Number 5: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sad bin Abu Waqqas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet came visiting me while I was (sick) in Mecca,  (&#8216;Amir the sub-narrator said, and he disliked to die in the land, whence he had already  migrated). He (i.e. the Prophet) said, &#8220;May Allah bestow His Mercy on Ibn Afra (Sad  bin Khaula).&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! May I will all my property (in  charity)?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Then may I will half of it?&#8221;  He said, &#8220;No&#8221;. I said, &#8220;One third?&#8221; He said: &#8220;Yes, one third, yet  even one third is too much. It is better for you to leave your inheritors wealthy than to  leave them poor begging others, and whatever you spend for Allah&#8217;s sake will be considered  as a charitable deed even the handful of food you put in your wife&#8217;s mouth. Allah may  lengthen your age so that some people may benefit by you, and some others be harmed by  you.&#8221; At that time Sad had only one daughter. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 51, Number 6: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I recommend that people reduce the proportion of what they  bequeath by will to the fourth (of the whole legacy), for Allah&#8217;s Apostle said,  &#8220;One-third, yet even one third is too much.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.051.007"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 51, Number 7: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I fell sick and the Prophet paid me a visit. I said to him,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I invoke Allah that He may not let me expire in the land whence I  migrated (i.e. Mecca).&#8221; He said, &#8220;May Allah give you health and let the people  benefit by you.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I want to will my property, and I have only one  daughter and I want to will half of my property (to be given in charity).&#8221; He  said,&#8221; Half is too much.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Then I will one third.&#8221; He said,  &#8220;One-third, yet even one-third is too much.&#8221; (The narrator added, &#8220;So the  people started to will one third of their property and that was Permitted for them.&#8221;)  </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.051.008"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 51, Number 8: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(the wife of the Prophet) Utba bin Abi Waqqas entrusted  (his son) to his brother Sad bin Abi Waqqas saying, &#8220;The son of the slave-girl of  Zam&#8217;a is my (illegal) son, take him into your custody.&#8221; So during the year of the  Conquest (of Mecca) Sad took the boy and said, &#8220;This is my brother&#8217;s son whom my  brother entrusted to me.&#8221; &#8216;Abu bin Zam&#8217;s got up and said, &#8220;He is my brother and  the son of the slave girl of my father and was born on my father&#8217;s bed.&#8221; Then both of  them came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Sad said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! This is my brother&#8217;s  son whom my brother entrusted to me.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then &#8216;Abu bin Zam&#8217;a got up and said, &#8220;This is my  brother and the son of the slave-girl of my father.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O  Abu bin Zam&#8217;a! This boy is for you as the boy belongs to the bed (where he was born), and  for the adulterer is the stone (i.e. deprivation).&#8221; Then the Prophet said to his wife  Sauda bint Zam&#8217;a, &#8220;Screen yourself from this boy,&#8221; when he saw the boy&#8217;s  resemblance to &#8216;Utba. Since then the boy did not see Sauda till he died. </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.051.009"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 51, Number 9: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A Jew crushed the head of a girl between two stones. She  was asked, &#8220;Who has done so to you, so-and-so? So-and-so?&#8221; Till the name of the  Jew was mentioned, whereupon she nodded (in agreement). So the Jew was brought and was  questioned till he confessed. The Prophet then ordered that his head be crushed with  stones. </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.051.010"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 51, Number 10: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The custom (in old days) was that the property of the  deceased would be inherited by his offspring; as for the parents (of the deceased), they  would inherit by the will of the deceased. Then Allah cancelled from that custom whatever  He wished and fixed for the male double the amount inherited by the female, and for each  parent a sixth (of the whole legacy) and for the wife an eighth or a fourth and for the  husband a half or a fourth. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.051.011"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 51, Number 11: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man asked the Prophet, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What kind  of charity is the best?&#8221; He replied. &#8220;To give in charity when you are healthy  and greedy hoping to be wealthy and afraid of becoming poor. Don&#8217;t delay giving in charity  till the time when you are on the death bed when you say, &#8216;Give so much to so-and-so and  so much to so-and so,&#8217; and at that time the property is not yours but it belongs to  so-and-so (i.e. your inheritors).&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.051.012"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 51, Number 12: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The signs of a hypocrite are three:  Whenever he speaks he tells a lie; whenever he is entrusted he proves dishonest; whenever  he promises he breaks his promise.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.051.013"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 51, Number 13: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Urwa bin Az-Zubair: Hakim bin Hizam said, &#8220;I  asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle for something, and he gave me, and I asked him again and he gave me  and said, &#8216;O Hakim! This wealth is green and sweet (i.e. as tempting as fruits), and  whoever takes it with </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The upper (i.e. giving) hand is better than the lower (i.e.  taking) hand.&#8221; Hakim added, &#8220;I said, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! By Him Who has sent you  with the Truth I will never demand anything from anybody after you till I die.&#8221;  Afterwards Abu Bakr used to call Hakim to give him something but he refused to accept  anything from him. Then &#8216;Umar called him to give him (something) but he refused. Then  &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Muslims! I offered to him (i.e. Hakim) his share which Allah has  ordained for him from this booty and he refuses to take it.&#8221; Thus Hakim did not ask  anybody for anything after the Prophet, till he died&#8211;may Allah bestow His mercy upon him.  </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.051.014"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 51, Number 14: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;All of you are  guardians and responsible for your charges: the Ruler (i.e. Imam) is a guardian and  responsible for his subjects; and a man is a guardian of his family and is responsible for  his charges; and a lady is a guardian in the house of her husband and is responsible for  her charge; and a servant is a guardian of the property of his master and is responsible  for his charge.&#8221; I think he also said, &#8220;And a man is a guardian of the property  of his father.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.051.015"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 51, Number 15: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said to Abu Talha, &#8220;I recommend that you  divide (this garden) amongst your relatives.&#8221; Abu Talha said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! I will do the same.&#8221; So Abu Talha divided it among his relatives and  cousins. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn &#8216;Abbes said, &#8220;When the Qur&#8217;anic Verse: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;Warn your nearest kinsmen.&#8221; (26.214) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Was revealed, the Prophet started calling the various big  families of Quraish, &#8220;O Bani Fihr! O Bani Adi!&#8221;. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Huraira said, &#8220;When the Verse: &#8220;Warn your  nearest kinsmen&#8221; was revealed, the Prophet said (in a loud voice), &#8220;O people of  Quraish!&#8221; </font></p>

I cannot save you from Allah&#8217;s Punishment, O Safiya, the  Aunt of Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I cannot save you from Allah&#8217;s Punishment; O Fatima bint  Muhammad!

There  are two kinds of guardians (who are in charge of the inheritance): One is that who  inherits; such a person should give (of what he inherits to the relatives, the orphans and  the needy, etc.), the other is that who does not inherit (e.g. the guardian of the  orphans): such a person should speak kindly and say (to those who are present at the time  of distribution), &#8220;I can not give it to you (as the wealth belongs to the  orphans).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 51, Number 25: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Az-Zuhri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Urwa bin Az-Zubair said that he asked &#8216;Aisha about the  meaning of the Quranic Verse:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;And if you fear that you will not deal fairly with  the orphan girls then marry (other) women of your choice.&#8221; (4.2-3) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Aisha said, &#8220;It is about a female orphan under the  guardianship of her guardian who is inclined towards her because of her beauty and wealth,  and likes to marry her with a Mahr less than what is given to women of her standard. So  they (i.e. guardians) were forbidden to marry the orphans unless they paid them a full  appropriate Mahr (otherwise) they were ordered to marry other women instead of them. Later  on the people asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about it. So Allah revealed the following Verse:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;They ask your instruction (O Muhammad!) regarding  women. Say: Allah instructs you regarding them&#8230;&#8221; (4.127) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>and in this Verse Allah indicated that if the orphan girl  was beautiful and wealthy, her guardian would have the desire to marry her without giving  her an appropriate Mahr equal to what her peers could get, but if she was undesirable for  lack of beauty or wealth, then he would not marry her, but seek to marry some other woman  instead of her. So, since he did not marry her when he had no inclination towards her, he  had not the right to marry her when he had an interest in her, unless he treated her  justly by giving her a full Mahr and securing all her rights. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle , Umar gave in charity  some of his property, a garden of date-palms called Thamgh. &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! I have some property which I prize highly and I want to give it in charity.&#8221;  The Prophet; said, &#8220;Give it in charity (i.e. as an endowment) with its land and trees  on the condition that the land and trees will neither be sold nor given as a present, nor  bequeathed, but the fruits are to be spent in charity.&#8221; So &#8216;Umar gave it in charity,  and it was for Allah&#8217;s Cause, the emancipation of slaves, for the poor, for guests, for  travelers, and for kinsmen. The person acting as its administrator could eat from it  reasonably and fairly, and could let a friend of his eat from it provided he had no  intention of becoming wealthy by its means. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>was revealed in connection with the guardian of an orphan,  and it means that if he is poor he can have for himself (from the orphan&#8217;s wealth) what is  just and reasonable according to the orphan&#8217;s share of the inheritance. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Talha had the greatest wealth of date-palms amongst the  Ansar in Medina, and he prized above all his wealth (his garden) Bairuha&#8217;, which was  situated opposite the Mosque (of the Prophet ).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;By no means shall you attain piety until you spend of  what you love,&#8221; (3.92) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Talha got up saying. &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah  says, &#8216;You will not attain piety until you spend of what you love,&#8217; and I prize above al I  my wealth, Bairuha&#8217; which I want to give in charity for Allah&#8217;s Sake, hoping for its  reward from Allah. So you can use it as Allah directs you.&#8221; On that the Prophet said,  &#8220;Bravo! It is a profitable (or perishable) property. (Ibn Maslama is not sure as to  which word is right, i.e. profitable or perishable.) I have heard what you have said, and  I recommend that you distribute this amongst your relatives.&#8221; On that Abu Talha said,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I will do (as you have suggested).&#8221; So, Abu Talha  distributed that garden amongst his relatives and cousins. </font></p>

On  seeing him, the creditors started claiming their rights pressingly at that time. When the  Prophet saw how they behaved, he went round the biggest heap for three times and sat over  it and said, &#8220;Call your companions (i.e. the creditors).&#8221; Then he kept on  measuring and giving them, till Allah cleared all my father&#8217;s debts. By Allah, it would  have pleased me that Allah would clear the debts of my father even though I had not taken  a single date to my sisters. But by Allah, all the heaps were complete, (as they were) and  I looked at the heap where Allah&#8217;s Apostle was sitting and noticed as if not a single date  had been taken thereof. </font></p>

<h3 align="center">Penalty of Hunting while on Pilgrimage</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.029.047"></a>Volume 3, Book 29, Number 47:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Abu Qatada:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My father set out (for Mecca) in the year of Al-Hudaibiya, and his companions assumed Ihram, but he did not. At that time the Prophet was informed that an enemy wanted to attack him, so the Prophet proceeded onwards. While my father was among his companions, some of them laughed among themselves. (My father said), &#8220;I looked up and saw an onager. I attacked, stabbed and caught it. I then sought my companions&#8217; help but they refused to help me. (Later) we all ate its meat. We were afraid that we might be left behind (separated) from the Prophet so I went in search of the Prophet and made my horse to run at a galloping speed at times and let it go slow at an ordinary speed at other times till I met a man from the tribe of Bani Ghifar at midnight. I asked him, &#8220;Where did you leave the Prophet ?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I left him at Ta&#8217;hun and he had the intention of having the midday rest at As-Suqya. I followed the trace and joined the Prophet and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Your people (companions) send you their compliments, and (ask for) Allah&#8217;s Blessings upon you. They are afraid lest they may be left behind; so please wait for them.&#8217; I added, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I hunted an onager and some of its meat is with me. The Prophet told the people to eat it though all of them were in the state of Ihram.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 29, Number 48:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Abu Qatada:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That his father said &#8220;We proceeded with the Prophet in the year of Al-Hudaibiya and his companions assumed Ihram but I did not. We were informed that some enemies were at Ghaiqa and so we went on towards them. My companions saw an onager and some of them started laughing among themselves. I looked and saw it. I chased it with my horse and stabbed and caught it. I wanted some help from my companions but they refused. (I slaughtered it all alone). We all ate from it (i.e. its meat). Then I followed Allah&#8217;s Apostle lest we should be left behind. At times I urged my horse to run at a galloping speed and at other times at an ordinary slow speed. On the way I met a man from the tribe of Bani Ghifar at midnight. I asked him where he had left Allah&#8217;s Apostle . The man replied that he had left the Prophet at a place called Ta&#8217;hun and he had the intention of having the midday rest at As-Suqya. So, I followed Allah&#8217;s Apostle till I reached him and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have been sent by my companions who send you their greetings and compliments and ask for Allah&#8217;s Mercy and Blessings upon you. They were afraid lest the enemy might intervene between you and them; so please wait for them.&#8221; So he did. Then I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We have hunted an onager and have some of it (i.e. its meat) left over.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle told his companions to eat the meat although all of them were in a state of Ihram.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 29, Number 49:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Qatada:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were in the company of the Prophet at a place called Al-Qaha (which is at a distance of three stages of journey from Medina). Abu Qatada narrated through another group of narrators: We were in the company of the Prophet at a place called Al-Qaha and some of us had assumed Ihram while the others had not. I noticed that some of my companions were watching something, so I looked up and saw an onager. (I rode my horse and took the spear and whip) but my whip fell down (and I asked them to pick it up for me) but they said, &#8220;We will not help you by any means as we are in a state of Ihram.&#8221; So, I picked up the whip myself and attacked the onager from behind a hillock and slaughtered it and brought it to my companions. Some of them said, &#8220;Eat it.&#8221; While some others said, &#8220;Do not eat it.&#8221; So, I went to the Prophet who was ahead of us and asked him about it, He replied, &#8220;Eat it as it is Halal (i.e. it is legal to eat it).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 29, Number 50:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Abu Qatada:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That his father had told him that Allah&#8217;s Apostle set out for Hajj and so did his companions. He sent a batch of his companions by another route and Abu Qatada was one of them. The Prophet said to them, &#8220;Proceed along the sea-shore till we meet all together.&#8221; So, they took the route of the sea-shore, and when they started all of them assumed Ihram except Abu Qatada. While they were proceeding on, his companions saw a group of onagers. Abu Qatada chased the onagers and attacked and wounded a she-onager. They got down and ate some of its meat and said to each other: &#8220;How do we eat the meat of the game while we are in a state of Ihram?&#8221; So, we (they) carried the rest of the she-onager&#8217;s meat, and when they met Allah&#8217;s Apostle they asked, saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We assumed Ihram with the exception of Abu Qatada and we saw (a group) of onagers. Abu Qatada attacked them and wounded a she-onager from them. Then we got down and ate from its meat. Later, we said, (to each other), &#8216;How do we eat the meat of the game and we are in a state of Ihram?&#8217; So, we carried the rest of its meat. The Prophet asked, &#8220;Did anyone of you order Abu Qatada to attack it or point at it?&#8221; They replied in the negative. He said, &#8220;Then eat what is left of its meat.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 29, Number 51:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From As-Sa&#8217;b bin Jath-thama Al-Laithi that the latter presented an onager to Allah&#8217;s Apostle while he was at Al-Abwa&#8217; or at Waddan, and he refused it. On noticing the signs of some unpleasant feeling of disappointment on his (As-Sab&#8217;s) face, the Prophet said to him, &#8220;I have only returned it because I am Muhrim.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hafsa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;It is not sinful (of a Muhrim) to kill five kinds of animals, namely: the crow, the kite, the mouse, the scorpion and the rabid dog.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 29, Number 55:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Five kinds of animals are harmful and could be killed in the Haram (Sanctuary). These are: the crow, the kite, the scorpion, the mouse and the rabid dog.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 29, Number 56:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While we were in the company of the Prophet in a cave at Mina, when Surat-wal-Mursalat were revealed and he recited it and I heard it (directly) from his mouth as soon as he recited its revelation. Suddenly a snake sprang at us and the Prophet said (ordered us): &#8220;Kill it.&#8221; We ran to kill it but it escaped quickly. The Prophet said, &#8220;It has escaped your evil and you too have escaped its evil.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha the wife of the Prophet:</p>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 29, Number 58:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said bin Abu Said Al-Maqburi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Shuraih, Al-&#8216;Adawi said that he had said to &#8216;Amr bin Sa&#8217;id when he was sending the troops to Mecca (to fight &#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair), &#8220;O Chief! Allow me to tell you what Allah&#8217;s Apostle said on the day following the Conquest of Mecca. My ears heard that and my heart understood it thoroughly and I saw with my own eyes the Prophet when he, after Glorifying and Praising Allah, started saying, &#8216;Allah, not the people, made Mecca a sanctuary, so anybody who has belief in Allah and the Last Day should neither shed blood in it, nor should he cut down its trees. If anybody tells (argues) that fighting in it is permissible on the basis that Allah&#8217;s Apostle did fight in Mecca, say to him, &#8216;Allah allowed His Apostle and did not allow you.&#8217; &#8220;Allah allowed me only for a few hours on that day (of the conquest) and today its sanctity is valid as it was before. So, those who are present should inform those who are absent (concerning this fact.&#8221; Abu Shuraih was asked, &#8220;What did &#8216;Amr reply?&#8221; He said, (&#8216;Amr said) &#8216;O Abu Shuraih! I know better than you in this respect Mecca does not give protection to a sinner, a murderer or a thief.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 29, Number 59:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Prophet said, &#8216;Allah has made Mecca, a sanctuary, so it was a sanctuary before me and will continue to be a sanctuary after me. It was made legal for me (i.e. I was allowed to fight in it) for a few hours of a day. It is not allowed to uproot its shrubs or to cut its trees, or to chase (or disturb) its game, or to pick up its luqata (fallen things) except by a person who would announce that (what he has found) publicly.&#8217; Al-&#8216;Abbas said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Except Al-ldhkhir (a kind of grass) (for it is used) by our goldsmiths and for our graves.&#8217; The Prophet then said, &#8216;Except Al-idhkhir.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Ikrima said, &#8216;Do you know what &#8220;chasing or disturbing&#8221; the game means? It means driving it out of the shade to occupy its place.&#8221;</p>

I greeted him and he asked who I was. I replied, &#8220;I am &#8216;Abdullah bin Hunain and I have been sent to you by Ibn &#8216;Abbas to ask you how Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to wash his head while in the state of lhram.&#8221; Abu Aiyub Al-Ansarl caught hold of the sheet of cloth and lowered it till his head appeared before me, and then told somebody to pour water on his head.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet and Abu Bakr employed a (pagan) man from the  tribe of Bani Ad-Dail and the tribe of Bani &#8216;Abu bin &#8216;Adi as a guide. He was an expert  guide and he broke the oath contract which he had to abide by with the tribe of Al-&#8216;Asi  bin Wail and he was on the religion of Quraish pagans. The Prophet and Abu Bakr had  confidence in him and gave him their riding camels and told him to bring them to the Cave  of Thaur after three days. So, he brought them their two riding camels after three days  and both of them (The Prophet and Abu Bakr) set out accompanied by &#8216;Amir bin Fuhaira and  the Dili guide who guided them below Mecca along the road leading to the sea-shore. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I fought in Jaish-al-Usra (Ghazwa of Tabuk) along with the  Prophet and in my opinion that was the best of my deeds. Then I had an employee, who  quarrel led with someone and one of the them bit and cut the other&#8217;s finger and caused his  own tooth to fall out. He then went to the Prophet (with a complaint) but the Prophet  cancelled the suit and said to the complainant, &#8220;Did you expect him to let his finger  in your mouth so that you might snap and cut it (as does a stallion camel)?&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Juraij from Abdullah bin Abu Mulaika from his  grandfather a similar story: A man bit the hand of another man and caused his own tooth to  fall out, but Abu Bakr judged that he had no right for compensation (for the broken  tooth). </font></p>

He then asked, Who will work for  me from midday up to the &#8216;Asr prayer for one Qirat?&#8217; The Christians accepted and fulfilled  the work. He then said, &#8216;Who will work for me from the &#8216;Asr till sunset for two Qirats?&#8217;  You, Muslims have accepted the offer. The Jews and the Christians got angry and said, &#8216;Why  should we work more and get lesser wages?&#8217; (Allah) said, &#8216;Have I with-held part of your  right?&#8217; They replied in the negative.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah said, &#8216;I will be an opponent  to three types of people on the Day of Resurrection: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>1. One who makes a covenant in My Name, but proves  treacherous; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>2. One who sells a free person and eats his price; and </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>3. One who employs a laborer and takes full work from him  but does not pay him for his lab our.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Musa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The example of Muslims, Jews and  Christians is like the example of a man who employed laborers to work for him from morning  till night for specific wages. They worked till midday and then said, &#8216;We do not need your  money which you have fixed for us and let whatever we have done be annulled.&#8217; The man said  to them, &#8216;Don&#8217;t quit the work, but complete the rest of it and take your full wages.&#8217; But  they refused and went away. The man employed another batch after them and said to them,  &#8216;Complete the rest of the day and yours will be the wages I had fixed for the first  batch.&#8217; So, they worked till the time of &#8216;Asr prayer. Then they said, &#8220;Let what we  have done be annulled and keep the wages you have promised us for yourself.&#8217; The man said  to them, &#8216;Complete the rest of the work, as only a little of the day remains,&#8217; but they  refused. Thereafter he employed another batch to work for the rest of the day and they  worked for the rest of the day till the sunset, and they received the wages of the two  former batches. So, that was the example of those people (Muslims) and the example of this  light (guidance) which they have accepted willingly. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 36, Number 472: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Three men from among  those who were before you, set out together till they reached a cave at night and entered  it. A big rock rolled down the mountain and closed the mouth of the cave. They said (to  each other), Nothing could save you Tom this rock but to invoke Allah by giving referenda  to the righteous deed which you have done (for Allah&#8217;s sake only).&#8217; So, one of them said,  &#8216;O Allah! I had old parents and I never provided my family (wife, children etc.) with milk  before them. One day, by chance I was delayed, and I came late (at night) while they had  slept. I milked the sheep for them and took the milk to them, but I found them sleeping. I  disliked to provide my family with the milk before them. I waited for them and the bowl of  milk was in my hand and I kept on waiting for them to get up till the day dawned. Then  they got up and drank the milk. O Allah! If I did that for Your Sake only, please relieve  us from our critical situation caused by this rock.&#8217; So, the rock shifted a little but  they could not get out.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet added, &#8220;The second man said, &#8216;O Allah! I  had a cousin who was the dearest of all people to me and I wanted to have sexual relations  with her but she refused. Later she had a hard time in a famine year and she came to me  and I gave her one-hundred-and-twenty Dinars on the condition that she would not resist my  desire, and she agreed. When I was about to fulfill my desire, she said: It is illegal for  you to outrage my chastity except by legitimate marriage. So, I thought it a sin to have  sexual intercourse with her and left her though she was the dearest of all the people to  me, and also I left the gold I had given her. O Allah! If I did that for Your Sake only,  please relieve us from the present calamity.&#8217; So, the rock shifted a little more but still  they could not get out from there.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet added, &#8220;Then the third man said, &#8216;O Allah!  I employed few laborers and I paid them their wages with the exception of one man who did  not take his wages and went away. I invested his wages and I got much property thereby.  (Then after some time) he came and said to me: O Allah&#8217;s slave! Pay me my wages. I said to  him: All the camels, cows, sheep and slaves you see, are yours. He said: O Allah&#8217;s slave!  Don&#8217;t mock at me. I said: I am not mocking at you. So, he took all the herd and drove them  away and left nothing. O Allah! If I did that for Your Sake only, please relieve us from  the present suffering.&#8217; So, that rock shifted completely and they got out walking. </font></p>

I will never do that till you die and be resurrected.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Will I be dead  and then resurrected after my death?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;There I  will have property and offspring and then I will pay you your due.&#8221; Then Allah  revealed. &#8216;Have you seen him who disbelieved in Our signs, and yet says: I will be given  property and offspring?&#8217; (19.77) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Some of the companions of the Prophet went on a journey  till they reached some of the &#8216;Arab tribes (at night). They asked the latter to treat them  as their guests but they refused. The chief of that tribe was then bitten by a snake (or  stung by a scorpion) and they tried their best to cure him but in vain. Some of them said  (to the others), &#8220;Nothing has benefited him, will you go to the people who resided  here at night, it may be that some of them might possess something (as treatment),&#8221;  They went to the group of the companions (of the Prophet ) and said, &#8220;Our chief has  been bitten by a snake (or stung by a scorpion) and we have tried everything but he has  not benefitted. Have you got anything (useful)?&#8221; One of them replied, &#8220;Yes, by  Allah! I can recite a Ruqya, but as you have refused to accept us as your guests, I will  not recite the Ruqya for you unless you fix for us some wages for it.&#8221; They agrees to  pay them a flock of sheep. One of them then went and recited (Suratul-Fatiha): &#8216;All the  praises are for the Lord of the Worlds&#8217; and puffed over the chief who became all right as  if he was released from a chain, and got up and started walking, showing no signs of  sickness. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>They paid them what they agreed to pay. Some of them (i.e.  the companions) then suggested to divide their earnings among themselves, but the one who  performed the recitation said, &#8220;Do not divide them till we go to the Prophet and  narrate the whole story to him, and wait for his order.&#8221; So, they went to Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and narrated the story. Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked, &#8220;How did you come to know that  Surat-ul-Fatiha was recited as Ruqya?&#8221; Then he added, &#8220;You have done the right  thing. Divide (what you have earned) and assign a share for me as well.&#8221; The Prophet  smiled thereupon. </font></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Book 27:</p>
<h3 align="center">Minor Pilgrammage (Umra)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.027.001"></a>Volume 3, Book 27, Number 1:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;(The performance of) &#8216;Umra is an expiation for the sins committed (between it and the previous one). And the reward of Hajj Mabrur (the one accepted by Allah) is nothing except Paradise.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 2:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Juraij:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ikrima bin Khalid asked Ibn &#8216;Umar about performing &#8216;Umra before Hajj. Ibn &#8216;Umar replied, &#8220;There is no harm in it.&#8221; &#8216;Ikrima said, &#8220;Ibn &#8216;Umar also said, &#8216;The Prophet had performed &#8216;Umra before performing Hajj.'&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 3:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ikrima bin Khalid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I asked Ibn &#8216;Umar the same (as above).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 4:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Mujahid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ursa bin AzZubair and I entered the Mosque (of the Prophet) and saw &#8216;Abdullah bin Umar sitting near the dwelling place of Aisha and some people were offering the Duha prayer. We asked him about their prayer and he replied that it was a heresy. He (Ursa) then asked him how many times the Prophet had performed &#8216;Umra. He replied, &#8216;Four times; one of them was in the month of Rajab.&#8221; We disliked to contradict him. Then we heard &#8216;Aisha, the Mother of faithful believers cleaning her teeth with Siwak in the dwelling place. &#8216;Ursa said, &#8220;O Mother! O Mother of the believers! Don&#8217;t you hear what Abu &#8216;Abdur Rahman is saying?&#8221; She said, &#8220;What does he say?&#8221; &#8216;Ursa said, &#8220;He says that Allah&#8217;s Apostle performed four &#8216;Umra and one of them was in the month of Rajab.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;May Allah be merciful to Abu &#8216;Abdur Rahman! The Prophet did not perform any &#8216;Umra except that he was with him, and he never performed any &#8216;Umra in Rajab.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 5:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ursa bin Az-Zubair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked &#8216;Aisha (whether the Prophet had performed &#8216;Umra in Rajab). She replied, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle never performed any &#8216;Umra in Rajab.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 6:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Qatada:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Anas how many times the Prophet had performed &#8216;Umra. He replied, &#8220;Four times. 1. &#8216;Umra of Hudaibiya in Dhi-l-Qa&#8217;da when the pagans hindered him; 2. &#8216;Umra in the following year in Dhi-l-Qa&#8217;da after the peace treaty with them (the pagans); 3. &#8216;Umra from Al-Jr&#8217;rana where he distributed the war booty.&#8221; I think he meant the booty (of the battle) of Hunain. I asked, &#8220;How many times did he perform Hajj?&#8221; He (Anas) replied, &#8220;Once. &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 7:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Qatada:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Anas (about the Prophet&#8217;s &#8216;Umra) and he replied, &#8220;The Prophet performed &#8216;Umra when the pagans made him return, and Umra of al-Hudaibiya (the next year), and another &#8216;Umra in Dhi-l-Qa&#8217;da, and another &#8216;Umra in combination with his Hajj.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 8:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hammam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet performed four &#8216;Umra (three) in Dhi-l-Qa&#8217;da except the (one) &#8216;Umra which he performed with his Hajj: His &#8216;Umra from Al-hudaibiya, and the one of the following year, and the one from Al-Jr&#8217;rana where he distributed the booty (of the battle) of Hunain, and another &#8216;Umra with his Hajj.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 9:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Ishaq:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Masruq, &#8216;Ata&#8217; and Mujahid (about the &#8216;Umra of Allah&#8217;s Apostle). They said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle had performed &#8216;Umra in Dhi-l-Qa&#8217;da before he performed Hajj.&#8221; I heard Al-Bara&#8217; bin &#8216;Azib saying, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle had performed &#8216;Umra in Dhi-l-Qa&#8217;da twice before he performed Hajj.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 10:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ata:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Ibn &#8216;Abbas saying, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked an Ansari woman (Ibn &#8216;Abbas named her but &#8216;Ata&#8217; forgot her name), &#8216;What prevented you from performing Hajj with us?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;We have a camel and the father of so-and-so and his son (i.e. her husband and her son) rode it and left one camel for us to use for irrigation.&#8217; He said (to her), &#8216;Perform &#8216;Umra when Ramadan comes, for &#8216;Umra in Ramadan is equal to Hajj (in reward),&#8217; or said something similar.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 11:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We set out along with Allah&#8217;s Apostle shortly before the appearance of the new moon (crescent) of the month of Dhi-l-Hijja and he said to us, &#8220;Whoever wants to assume Ihram for Hajj may do so; and whoever wants to assume Ihram for &#8216;Umra may do so. Hadn&#8217;t I brought the Hadi (animal for sacrificing) (with me), I would have assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra.&#8221; (&#8216;Aisha added,): So some of us assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra while the others for Hajj. I was amongst those who assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra. The day of &#8216;Arafat approached and I was still menstruating. I complained to the Prophet (about that) and he said, &#8220;Abandon your &#8216;Umra, undo and comb your hair, and assume Ihram for Hajj;.&#8221; When it was the night of Hasba, he sent &#8216;Abdur Rahman with me to At-Tan&#8217;im and I assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra (and performed it) in lieu of my missed &#8216;Umra.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 12:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amr bin Aus:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdul Rahman bin Abu Bakr told me that the Prophet had ordered him to let &#8216;Aisha ride behind him and to make he perform &#8216;Umra from At-Tan&#8217;im.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 13:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet and his companions assumed Ihram for Hajj and none except the Prophet and Talha had the Hadi with them. &#8216;Ali had come from Yemen and he had the Hadi with him. He (&#8216;Ali) said, &#8220;I have assumed Ihram with an intention like that of Allah&#8217;s Apostle has assumed it.&#8221; The Prophet ordered his companions to intend the Ihram with which they had come for &#8216;Umra, to perform the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba (and between Safa and Marwa), to get their hair cut short and then to finish their Ihram with the exception of those who had the Hadi with them. They asked, &#8220;Shall we go to Mina and the private organs of some of us are dribbling (if we finish Ihram and have sexual relations with our wives)?&#8221; The Prophet heard that and said, &#8220;Had I known what I know now, I would not have brought the Hadi. If I did not have the Hadi with me I would have finished my Ihram.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha got her menses and performed all the ceremonies (of Hajj) except the Tawaf . So when she became clean from her menses, and she had performed the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, she said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! You (people) are returning with both Hajj and &#8216;Umra and I am returning only with Hajj!&#8221; So, he ordered &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin Abu Bakr to go with her to At-Tan&#8217;im. Thus she performed &#8216;Umra after the Hajj in the month of Dhi-l-Hijja. Suraqa bin Malik bin Ju&#8217;sham met the Prophet at Al-&#8216;Aqaba (Jamrat-ul &#8216;Aqaba) while the latter was stoning it and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Is this permissible only for you?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;No, it is for ever (i.e. it is permissible for all Muslims to perform &#8216;Umra before Hajj.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 14:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We set out with Allah&#8217;s Apostle shortly before the appearance of the new moon of Dhi-l-Hiija and he said, &#8220;Whoever wants to assume Ihram for &#8216;Umra may do so, and whoever wants to assume Ihram for Hajj may do so. Had not I brought the Hadi with me, I would have assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra.&#8221; Some of the people assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra while others for Hajj. I was amongst those who had assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra. I got my menses before entering Mecca, and was menstruating till the day of &#8216;Arafat. I complained to Allah&#8217;s Apostle about it, he said, &#8220;Abandon your &#8216;Umra, undo and comb your hair, and assume Ihram for Hajj.&#8221; So, I did that accordingly. When it was the night of Hasba (day of departure from Mina), the Prophet sent &#8216;Abdur Rahman with me to At-Tanim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sub-narrator adds: He (&#8216;AbdurRahman) let her ride behind him. And she assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra in lieu of the abandoned one. Aisha completed her Hajj and &#8216;Umra, and no Hadi, Sadaqa (charity), or fasting was obligatory for her.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 15:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Aswad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The people are returning after performing the two Nusuks (i.e. Hajj and &#8216;Umra) but I am returning with one only?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Wait till you become clean from your menses and then go to At-Tan&#8217;im, assume Ihram (and after performing &#8216;Umra) join us at such-and-such a place. But it (i.e. the reward if &#8216;Umra) is according to your expenses or the hardship (which you will undergo while performing it).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 16:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We set out assuming the Ihram for Hajj in the months of Hajj towards the sacred precincts of Hajj. We dismounted at Sarif and the Prophet said to his companions, &#8220;Whoever has not got the Hadi with him and likes to make it as &#8216;Umra, he should do it, but he who has got the Hadi with him should not do it.&#8221; The Prophet and some of his wealthy companions had the Hadi with them, so they did not finish Ihram after performing the &#8216;Umra. The Prophet came to me while I was weeping. He asked me the reason for it. I replied, &#8220;I have heard of what you have said to your companions and I cannot do the &#8216;Umra.&#8221; He asked me, &#8220;What is the matter with you?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I am not praying.&#8221; He said, &#8220;There is no harm in it as you are one of the daughters of Adam and the same is written for you as for others. So, you should perform Hajj and I hope that Allah will enable you to perform the &#8216;Umra as well.&#8221; So, I carried on till we departed from Mina and halted at Al-Mahassab. The Prophet called &#8216;Abdur-Rahman and said, &#8220;Go out of the sanctuary with your sister and let her assume Ihram for &#8216;Umra, and after both of you have finished the Tawaf I will be waiting for you at this place.&#8221; We came back at mid-night and the Prophet asked us, &#8220;Have you finished?&#8221; I replied in the affirmative. He announced the departure and the people set out for the journey and some of them had performed the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba before the morning prayer, and after that the Prophet set out for Medina.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 17:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Safwan bin Ya&#8217;la bin Umaiya from his father who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;A man came to the Prophet while he was at Ji&#8217;rana. The man was wearing a cloak which had traces of Khaluq or Sufra (a kind of perfume). The man asked (the Prophet ), &#8216;What do you order me to perform in my &#8216;Umra?&#8217; So, Allah inspired the Prophet divinely and he was screened by a place of cloth. I wished to see the Prophet being divinely inspired. &#8216;Umar said to me, &#8216;Come! Will you be pleased to look at the Prophet while Allah is inspiring him?&#8217; I replied in the affirmative. &#8216;Umar lifted one corner of the cloth and I looked at the Prophet who was snoring. (The sub-narrator thought that he said: The snoring was like that of a camel). When that state was over, the Prophet asked, &#8220;Where is the questioner who asked about &#8216;Umra? Put off your cloak and wash away the traces of Khaluq from your body and clean the Sufra (yellow color) and perform in your Umra what you perform in your Hajj (i.e. the Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba and the Sa&#8217;i between Safa and Marwa). &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 18:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hisham Ibn &#8216;Urwa from his father who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While I was a youngster, I asked &#8216;Aisha the wife of the Prophet. &#8220;What about the meaning of the Statement of Allah;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al Marwa, are among the symbols of Allah. So, it is not harmful if those who perform Hajj or &#8216;Umra of the House (Ka&#8217;ba at Mecca) to perform the going (Tawaf) between them? (2.158) I understand (from that) that there is no harm if somebody does not perform the Tawaf between them.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha replied, &#8220;No, for if it were as you are saying, then the recitation would have been like this: &#8216;It is not harmful not to perform Tawaf between them.&#8217; This verse was revealed in connection with the Ansar who used to assume the Ihram for the idol Manat which was put beside a place called Qudaid and those people thought it not right to perform the Tawaf of As-Safa and Al-Marwa. When Islam came, they asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about that, and Allah revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa Are among the symbols of Allah. So, it is not harmful of those who perform Hajj or &#8216;Umra of the House (Ka&#8217;ba at Mecca) to perform the going (Tawaf) between them.&#8221; (2.158) Sufyan and Abu Muawiya added from Hisham (from &#8216;Aisha): &#8220;The Hajj or &#8216;Umra of the person who does not perform the going (Tawaf) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa is incomplete in Allah&#8217;s sight.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 19:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Isma&#8217;il:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullah bin Abu Aufa said: &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle performed &#8216;Umra and we too performed &#8216;Umra along with him. When he entered Mecca he performed the Tawaf (of Ka&#8217;ba) and we too performed it along with him, and then he came to the As-Safa and Al-Marwa (i.e. performed the Sai) and we also came to them along with him. We were shielding him from the people of Mecca lest they may hit him with an arrow.&#8221; A friend of his asked him (i.e. &#8216;Abdullah bin Aufa), &#8220;Did the Prophet enter the Ka&#8217;ba (during that &#8216;Umra)?&#8221; He replied in the negative. Then he said, &#8220;What did he (the Prophet ) say about Khadija?&#8221; He (Abdullah bin Aufa) said, &#8220;(He said) &#8216;Give Khadija the good tidings that she will have a palace made of Qasab in Paradise and there will be neither noise nor any trouble in it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 20:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amr bin Dinar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We asked Ibn &#8216;Umar whether a man who had performed the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba but had not performed the Tawaf between As-Safa and Al-Marwa yet, was permitted to have sexual relation with his wife. He replied, &#8220;The Prophet arrived (at Mecca) and circumambulated the Ka&#8217;ba seven times and then offered a two Rak&#8217;at prayer behind Maqam-lbrahim and then performed the going (Tawaf) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa (seven times) (and verily, in Allah&#8217;s Apostle you have a good example.&#8221; And we asked Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah (the same question) and he replied, &#8220;He should not go near her till he has finished the going (Tawaf) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 21:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ashari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I came to the Prophet at Al-Batha&#8217; while his camel was kneeling down and he asked me, &#8220;Have you intended to perform the Hajj?&#8221; I replied in the affirmative. He asked me, &#8216;With what intention have you assumed Ihram?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I have assumed Ihram with the same intention as that of the Prophet. He said, &#8220;You have done well. Perform the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and (the Sai) between As-safa and Al-Marwa and then finish the Ihram.&#8221; So, I performed the Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba and the Sai) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa and then went to a woman of the tribe of Qais who cleaned my head from lice. Later I assumed the Ihram for Hajj. I used to give the verdict of doing the same till the caliphate of &#8216;Umar who said, &#8220;If you follow the Holy Book then it orders you to remain in the state of Ihram till you finish from Hajj, if you follow the Prophet then he did not finish his Ihram till the Hadi (sacrifice) had reached its place of slaughtering (Hajj-al-Qiran).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 22:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Aswad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullah the slave of Asma bint Abu Bakr, told me that he used to hear Asma&#8217;, whenever she passed by Al-Hajun, saying, &#8220;May Allah bless His Apostle Muhammad. Once we dismounted here with him, and at that time we were traveling with light luggage; we had a few riding animals and a little food ration. I, my sister, &#8216;Aisha, Az-Zubair and such and such persons performed &#8216;Umra, and when we had passed our hands over the Ka&#8217;ba (i.e. performed Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba and between As-Safa and Al-Marwa) we finished our lhram. Later on we assumed Ihram for Hajj the same evening.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 23:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle returned from a Ghazwa, Hajj or &#8216;Umra, he used to say Takbir thrice at every elevation of the ground and then would say, &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah; He is One and has no partner. All the kingdoms is for Him, and all the praises are for Him, and He is Omnipotent. We are returning with repentance, worshipping, prostrating, and praising our Lord. He has kept up His promise and made His slave victorious, and He Alone defeated all the clans of (non-believers).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 24:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet arrived at Mecca, some boys of the tribe of Bani &#8216;Abdul Muttalib went to receive him, and the Prophet made one of them ride in front of him and the other behind him.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 25:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle left for Mecca, he used to pray in the mosque of Ash-Shajra, and when he returned (to Medina), he used to pray in the middle of the valley of Dhul-Hulaifa and used to pass the night there till morning.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 28:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Humaid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas said, &#8220;Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle returned from a journey, he, on seeing the high places of Medina, would make his she-camel proceed faster; and if it were another animal, even then he used to make it proceed faster.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Humaid that the Prophet used to make it proceed faster out of his love for Medina.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 29:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As above, but mentioned &#8220;the walls of Medina&#8221; instead of &#8220;the high places of Medina. Al-Harith bin Umar agrees with Anas.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 30:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Ishaq:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Al-Bara&#8217; saying, &#8220;The above Verse was revealed regarding us, for the Ansar on returning from Hajj never entered their houses through the proper doors but from behind. One of the Ansar came and entered through the door and he was taunted for it. Therefore, the following was revealed: &#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It is not righteousness That you enter the houses from the back, But the righteous man is He who fears Allah, Obeys His order and keeps away from What He has forbidden So, enter houses through the proper doors.&#8221; (2.189)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 31:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Traveling is a kind of torture as it prevents one from eating, drinking and sleeping properly. So, when one&#8217;s needs are fulfilled, one should return quickly to one&#8217;s family.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 32:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Aslam from his father:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was with Ibn &#8216;Umar on the way to Mecca, and he got the news that Safiya bint Abu Ubaid was seriously ill. So, he hastened his pace, and when the twilight disappeared, he dismounted and offered the Maghrib and &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayers together. Then he said, &#8220;I saw that whenever the Prophet had to hasten when traveling, he would delay the Maghrib prayer and join them together (i.e. offer the Maghrib and the Isha prayers together).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.022.289"></a>Volume 2, Book 22, Number 289:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Kuraib Maula Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah bin Abbas said that he had passed a night in the house of Maimuna the mother of the faithful believers , who was his aunt. He said, &#8220;I slept across the bed, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle along with his wife slept lengthwise. Allah&#8217;s Apostle slept till mid-night or slightly before or after it. Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle woke up, sat, and removed the traces of sleep by rubbing his hands over his face. Then he recited the last ten verses of Surat-Al Imran (2). Then he went towards a hanging leather water-container and performed a perfect ablution and then stood up for prayer.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin Abbas added, &#8220;I got up and did the same as Allah&#8217;s Apostle had done and then went and stood by his side. Allah&#8217;s Apostle then put his right hand over my head and caught my right ear and twisted it. He offered two Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat and then offered one Raka Witr. Then he lay down till the Muadh-dhin came and then he prayed two light Rakat and went out and offered the early morning (Fajr) prayer.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">We used to greet the Prophet while he was praying and he used to answer our greetings.

<p style="text-align:justify;">In the life-time of the Prophet we used to speak while praying, and one of us would tell his needs to his companions, till the verse, &#8216;Guard strictly your prayers (2.238) was revealed. After that we were ordered to remain silent while praying.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet went out to affect a reconciliation between the tribes of Bani &#8216;Amr bin &#8216;Auf and the time of the prayer became due; Bilal went to Abu Bakr and said, &#8220;The Prophet is detained. Will you lead the people in the prayer?&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;Yes, if you wish.&#8221; So Bilal pronounced the Iqama and Abu Bakr led the prayer. In the meantime the Prophet came crossing the rows (of the praying people) till he stood in the first row and the people started clapping. Abu Bakr never looked hither and thither during the prayer but when the people clapped too much, he looked back and saw the Prophet in the (first) row. The Prophet waved him to remain at his place, but Abu Bakr raised both his hands and sent praises to Allah and then retreated and the Prophet went forward and led the prayer. (See Hadith No. 295 &amp; 296)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Masud:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We used to say the greeting, name and greet each other in the prayer. Allah&#8217;s Apostle heard it and said:&#8211;&#8220;Say, &#8216;At-tahiyyatu lil-lahi was-salawatu wat-taiyibatu . Assalamu &#8216;Alaika aiyuha-n-Nabiyu wa-rahmatu-l-lahi wa-barakatuhu. _ Assalamu alaina wa-&#8216;ala &#8216;ibadi-l-lahi as-salihin.. Ashhadu an la ilaha illa-l-lah wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan &#8216;abdu hu wa Rasuluh. (All the compliments are for Allah and all the prayers and all the good things (are for Allah). Peace be on you, O Prophet, and Allah&#8217;s mercy and blessings (are on you). And peace be on us and on the good (pious) worshipers of Allah. I testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is His slave and Apostle.) So, when you have said this, then you have surely sent the greetings to every good (pious) worship per of Allah, whether he be in the Heaven or on the Earth . &#8220;</p>

Abu Bakr tried to come back thinking that Allah&#8217;s Apostle wanted to come out for the prayer. The attention of the Muslims was diverted from the prayer because they were delighted to see the Prophet. The Prophet waved his hand to them to complete their prayer, then he went back into the room and let down the curtain. The Prophet expired on that very day.</p>

My mother (is calling me) and (I am offering) my prayer. (What shall I do?)&#8217; She said, &#8216;O Allah! Do not let Juraij die till he sees the faces of prostitutes.&#8217; A shepherdess used to come by his hermitage for grazing her sheep and she gave birth to a child. She was asked whose child that was, and she replied that it was from Juraij and that he had come out from his hermitage. Juraij said, &#8216;Where is that woman who claims that her child is from me?&#8217; (When she was brought to him along with the child), Juraij asked the child, &#8216;O Babus, who is your father?&#8217; The child replied, &#8216;The shepherd.&#8217; &#8221; (See Hadith No 662.

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet once offered the prayer and said, &#8220;Satan came in front of me and tried to interrupt my prayer, but Allah gave me an upper hand on him and I choked him. No doubt, I thought of tying him to one of the pillars of the mosque till you get up in the morning and see him. Then I remembered the statement of Prophet Solomon, &#8216;My Lord ! Bestow on me a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me.&#8217; Then Allah made him (Satan) return with his head down (humiliated).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">We were at Al-Ahwaz fighting the AlHaruriya (tribe). While I was at the bank of a river a man was praying and the reins of his animal were in his hands and the animal was struggling and he was following the animal. (Shu&#8217;ba, a sub-narrator, said that man was Abu Barza al-Aslaml). A man from the Khawarij said, &#8220;O Allah! Be harsh to this sheik.&#8221; And when the sheik (Abu Barza) finished his prayer, he said, &#8220;I heard your remark. No doubt, I participated with Allah&#8217;s Apostle in six or seven or eight holy battles and saw his leniency, and no doubt, I would rather retain my animal than let it return to its stable, as it would cause me much trouble. &#8220;</p>

Then he bowed, and after finishing, he prostrated and did the same in the second Raka and then said, &#8220;These (lunar and solar eclipses) are two of the signs of Allah and if you see them, pray till the eclipse is over. No doubt, while standing at this place I saw everything promised to me by Allah and I saw (Paradise) and I wanted to pluck a bunch (of grapes) therefrom, at the time when you saw me stepping forward. No doubt, I saw Hell with its different parts destroying each other when you saw me retreating and in it I saw &#8216;Amr bin Luhai who started the tradition of freeing animals (set them free) in the name of idols.&#8221;</p>

So I felt so sorry that only Allah knows it and I said to myself,, &#8216;Perhaps Allah&#8217;s Apostle is angry because I did not come quickly, then again I greeted him but he did not reply. I felt even more sorry than I did the first time. Again I greeted him and he returned the greeting and said, &#8220;The thing which prevented me from returning the greeting was that I was praying.&#8221; And at that time he was on his Rahila and his face was not towards the Qibla.</p>

Will you lead the people in prayer?&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;Yes, if you wish.&#8221; So Bilal pronounced the Iqama and Abu Bakr went forward and the people said Takbir.

Abu Bakr raised both his hands, praised Allah and retreated till he stood in the row and Allah&#8217;s Apostle went forward and led the people in the prayer. When he had finished the prayer, he addressed the people and said, &#8220;O people! Why did you start clapping when something happened to you in the prayer? Clapping is for women. Whenever one is confronted with something unusual in the prayer one should say, &#8216;Sub Han Allah&#8217;.&#8221; Then the Prophet looked towards Abu Bakr and asked, &#8220;What prevented you from leading the prayer when I beckoned you to carry on?&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;It does not befit the son of Al Quhafa to lead the prayer in the presence of Allah&#8217;s Apostle</p>

Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar were amongst those who were present, but they dared not talk to him about that (because of excessive respect for him), and those who were in a hurry went out. They said, &#8220;Has the prayer been reduced?&#8221; A man who was called DhulYadain by the Prophet said (to the Prophet), &#8220;Has the prayer been reduced or have you forgotten?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Neither have I forgotten, nor has the prayer been reduced.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Certainly you have forgotten.&#8221; So the Prophet offered two more Rakat and performed Tashm and then said Takbir and performed a prostration of Sahu like his ordinary prostration or a bit longer and then raised his head and said Takbir and then put his head down and performed a prostration like his ordinary prostration or a bit longer, and then raised his head and said Takbir.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I was sent to Aisha by Ibn Abbas, Al-Miswar bin Makhrama and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Azhar . They told me to greet her on their behalf and to ask her about the offering of the two Rakat after the &#8216;Asr prayer and to say to her, &#8220;We were informed that you offer those two Rakat and we were told that the Prophet had forbidden offering them.&#8221; Ibn Abbas said, &#8220;I along with &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab used to beat the people whenever they offered them.&#8221; I went to Aisha and told her that message. &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;Go and ask Um Salama about them.&#8221; So I returned and informed them about her statement. They then told me to go to Um Salama with the same question with which t sent me to &#8216;Aisha. Um Salama replied, &#8220;I heard the Prophet forbidding them. Later I saw him offering them immediately after he prayed the &#8216;Asr prayer. He then entered my house at a time when some of the Ansari women from the tribe of Bani Haram were sitting with me, so I sent my slave girl to him having said to her, &#8216;Stand beside him and tell him that Um Salama says to you, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have heard you forbidding the offering of these (two Rakat after the &#8216;Asr prayer) but I have seen you offering them.&#8221; If he waves his hand then wait for him.&#8217; The slave girl did that. The Prophet beckoned her with his hand and she waited for him. When he had finished the prayer he said, &#8220;O daughter of Bani Umaiya! You have asked me about the two Rakat after the &#8216;Asr prayer. The people of the tribe of &#8216;Abdul-Qais came to me and made me busy and I could not offer the two Rakat after the Zuhr prayer. These (two Rakat that I have just prayed) are for those (missed) ones.</p>

Bilal went to Abu Bakr and said to him, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle has been delayed (there) and the time of prayer is due. So will you lead the people in prayer?&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Yes, if you wish.&#8221; Bilal pronounced the Iqama and Abu Bakr, went forward and said Takbir for the people. In the mean-time Allah&#8217;s Apostle came crossing the rows (of the praying people) and stood in the (first) row and the people started clapping. Abu Bakr, would never glance side-ways in his prayer but when the people clapped much he looked back and (saw) Allah&#8217;s Apostle . Allah&#8217;s Apostle beckoned him to carry on the prayer. Abu Bakr raised his hands and thanked Allah, and retreated till he reached the (first) row. Allah&#8217;s Apostle went forward and led the people in the prayer. When he completed the prayer he faced the people and said, &#8220;O people! Why did you start clapping when something unusual happened to you in the prayer? Clapping is only for women. So whoever amongst you comes across something in the prayer should say, &#8216;Subhan-Allah&#8217; for there is none who will not turn round on hearing him saying Subhan-Allah. O Ab-u Bakr! What prevented you from leading the people in the prayer when I beckoned you to do so?&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;How dare the son of Abu Quhafa lead the prayer in the presence of Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 327:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Asma&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I went to &#8216;Aisha and she was standing praying and the people, too, were standing (praying). So I said, &#8220;What is the matter with the people?&#8221; She beckoned with her head towards the sky.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8220;(Is there) a sign?&#8221; She nodded intending to say, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 328:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha the wife of the Prophet:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle during his illness prayed in his house sitting, whereas some people followed him standing, but the Prophet beckoned them to sit down. On completion of the prayer he said, &#8220;The Imam is to be followed. So, bow when he bows, and raise your head when he raises his head.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 657 Vol 1 for taking the verdict).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent an army towards the east coast  and appointed Abu &#8216;Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah as their chief, and the army consisted of  three-hundred men including myself. We marched on till we reached a place where our food  was about to finish. Abu- &#8216;Ubaida ordered us to collect all the journey food and it was  collected. My (our) journey food was dates. Abu &#8216;Ubaida kept on giving us our daily ration  in small amounts from it, till it was exhausted. The share of everyone of us used to be  one date only.&#8221; I said, &#8220;How could one date benefit you?&#8221; Jabir replied,  &#8220;We came to know its value when even that too finished.&#8221; Jabir added, &#8220;When  we reached the sea-shore, we saw a huge fish which was like a small mountain. The army ate  from it for eighteen days. Then Abu &#8216;Ubaida ordered that two of its ribs be fixed and they  were fixed in the ground. Then he ordered that a she-camel be ridden and it passed under  the two ribs (forming an arch) without touching them.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Salama: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once the journey food diminished and the people were  reduced to poverty. They went to the Prophet and asked his permission to slaughter their  camels, and he agreed. &#8216;Umar met them and they told him about it, and he said, &#8220;How  would you survive after slaughtering your camels?&#8221; Then he went to the Prophet and  said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! How would they survive after slaughtering their  camels?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered &#8216;Umar, &#8220;Call upon the people to bring what has  remained of their food.&#8221; A leather sheet was spread and al I the journey food was  collected and heaped over it. Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up and invoked Allah to bless it, and  then directed all the people to come with their utensils, and they started taking from it  till all of them got what was sufficient for them. Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said, &#8220;I  testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and I am His Apostle. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Rafi bin Khadij: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We used to offer the &#8216;Asr prayer with the Prophet and  slaughter a camel, the meat of which would be divided in ten parts. We would eat the  cooked meat before sunset. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Musa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;When the people of Ash&#8217;ari tribe  ran short of food during the holy battles, or the food of their families in Medina ran  short, they would collect all their remaining food in one sheet and then distribute it  among themselves equally by measuring it with a bowl.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 667: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that Abu Bakr As-Siddiq wrote to him the law of Zakat which  was made obligatory by Allah&#8217;s Apostle. He wrote: &#8216;Partners possessing joint property  (sheep) have to pay its Zakat equally. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 668: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abaya bin Rafa&#8217;a bin Raft&#8217; bin Khadij: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My grandfather said, &#8220;We were in the company of the  Prophet at Dhul-Hulaifa. The people felt hungry and captured some camels and sheep (as  booty). The Prophet was behind the people. They hurried and slaughtered the animals and  put their meat in pots and started cooking it. (When the Prophet came) he ordered the pots  to be upset and then he distributed the animals (of the booty), regarding ten sheep as  equal to one camel. One of the camels fled and the people ran after it till they were  exhausted. At that time there were few horses. A man threw an arrow at the camel, and  Allah stopped the camel with it. The Prophet said, &#8220;Some of these animals are like  wild animals, so if you lose control over one of these animals, treat it in this way (i.e.  shoot it with an arrow).&#8221; Before distributing them among the soldiers my grandfather  said, &#8220;We may meet the enemies in the future and have no knives; can we slaughter the  animals with reeds?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Use whatever causes blood to flow, and  eat the animals if the name of Allah has been mentioned on slaughtering them. Do not  slaughter with teeth or fingernails and I will tell you why: It is because teeth are bones  (i.e. cannot cut properly) and fingernails are the tools used by the Ethiopians (whom we  should not imitate for they are infidels).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 669: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet decreed that one should not eat two dates  together at a time unless he gets the permission from his companions (sharing the meal  with him). </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.044.670"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 670: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabala: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;While at Medina we were struck with famine. Ibn  Az-Zubair used to provide us with dates as our food. Ibn &#8216;Umar used to pass by us and say,  &#8220;Don&#8217;t eat two dates together at a time as the Prophet has forbidden eating two dates  together at a time (in a gathering) unless one takes the permission of one&#8217;s companion  brother.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 671: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Nafi: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;If one  manumits his share of a jointly possessed slave, and can afford the price of the other  shares according to the adequate price of the slave, the slave will be completely  manumitted; otherwise he will be partially manumitted.&#8217; &#8221; (Aiyub, a sub-narrator is  not sure whether the saying &#8221; &#8230; otherwise he will be partially manumitted&#8221; was  said by Nafi&#8217; or the Prophet.) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 672: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever manumits his share of a  jointly possessed slave, it is imperative for him to get that slave manumitted completely  by paying the remaining price, and if he does not have sufficient money to manumit him,  then the price of the slave should be estimated justly, and he is to be allowed to work  and earn the amount that will manumit him (without overburdening him)&#8221;. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 673: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated An-Nu&#8217;man bin Bashir: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The example of the person abiding  by Allah&#8217;s order and restrictions in comparison to those who violate them is like the  example of those persons who drew lots for their seats in a boat. Some of them got seats  in the upper part, and the others in the lower. When the latter needed water, they had to  go up to bring water (and that troubled the others), so they said, &#8216;Let us make a hole in  our share of the ship (and get water) saving those who are above us from troubling them.  So, if the people in the upper part left the others do what they had suggested, all the  people of the ship would be destroyed, but if they prevented them, both parties would be  safe.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 674: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Urwa bin Az-Zubair: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That he had asked &#8216;Aisha about the meaning of the Statement  of Allah: &#8220;If you fear that you shall not Be able to deal justly With the orphan  girls, then Marry (Other) women of your choice Two or three or four.&#8221; (4.3) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>She said, &#8220;O my nephew! This is about the orphan girl  who lives with her guardian and shares his property. Her wealth and beauty may tempt him  to marry her without giving her an adequate Mahr (bridal-money) which might have been  given by another suitor. So, such guardians were forbidden to marry such orphan girls  unless they treated them justly and gave them the most suitable Mahr; otherwise they were  ordered to marry any other woman.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha further said, &#8220;After that verse the  people again asked the Prophet (about the marriage with orphan &#8216;girls), so Allah revealed  the following verses:&#8211; &#8216;They ask your instruction Concerning the women. Say: Allah  Instructs you about them And about what is Recited unto you In the Book, concerning The  orphan girls to whom You give not the prescribed portions and yet whom you Desire to  marry&#8230;&#8221; (4.127) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>What is meant by Allah&#8217;s Saying:&#8211; &#8216;And about what is  Recited unto you is the former verse which goes:&#8211; &#8216;If you fear that you shall not Be able  to deal justly With the orphan girls, then Marry (other) women of your choice.&#8217; (4.3)  &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s saying in the other verse:&#8211;&#8216;Yet whom you desire to marry&#8217;  (4.127) means the desire of the guardian to marry an orphan girl under his supervision  when she has not much property or beauty (in which case he should treat her justly). The  guardians were forbidden to marry their orphan girls possessing property and beauty  without being just to them, as they generally refrain from marrying them (when they are  neither beautiful nor wealthy).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked Abu Minhal about money exchange from hand to hand.

Take the pledge of allegiance from him.&#8221; But he  said, &#8220;He is still too young for the pledge,&#8221; and passed his hand on his (i.e.  &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s) head and invoked for Allah&#8217;s blessing for him. Zuhra bin Ma&#8217;bad stated that  he used to go with his grandfather, &#8216;Abdullah bin Hisham, to the market to buy foodstuff.  Ibn &#8216;Umar and Ibn Az-Zubair would meet him and say to him, &#8220;Be our partner, as the  Prophet invoked Allah to bless you.&#8221; So, he would be their partner, and very often he  would win a camel&#8217;s load and send it home. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet (along with his companions) reached Mecca in  the morning of the fourth of Dhul-Hijja assuming Ihram for Hajj only. So when we arrived  at Mecca, the Prophet ordered us to change our intentions of the Ihram for&#8217;Umra and that  we could finish our Ihram after performing the &#8216;Umra and could go to our wives (for sexual  intercourse). The people began talking about that. Jabir said surprisingly, &#8220;Shall we  go to Mina while semen is dribbling from our male organs?&#8221; Jabir moved his hand while  saying so. When this news reached the Prophet he delivered a sermon and said, &#8220;I have  been informed that some peoples were saying so and so; By Allah I fear Allah more than you  do, and am more obedient to Him than you. If I had known what I know now, I would not have  brought the Hadi (sacrifice) with me and had the Hadi not been with me, I would have  finished the Ihram.&#8221; At that Suraqa bin Malik stood up and asked &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! Is this permission for us only or is it forever?&#8221; The Prophet replied,  &#8220;It is forever.&#8221; In the meantime &#8216;Ali bin Abu Talib came from Yemen and was  saying Labbaik for what the Prophet has intended. (According to another man, &#8216;Ali was  saying Labbaik for Hajj similar to Allah&#8217;s Apostle&#8217;s). The Prophet told him to keep on the  Ihram and let him share the Hadi with him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 44, Number 684: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abaya bin Rifaa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My grandfather, Rafi bin Khadij said, &#8220;We were in the  valley of Dhul-Hulaifa of Tuhama in the company of the Prophet and had some camels and  sheep (of the booty). The people hurried (in slaughtering the animals) and put their meat  in the pots and started cooking. Allah&#8217;s Apostle came and ordered them to upset the pots,  and distributed the booty considering one camel as equal to ten sheep. One of the camels  fled and the people had only a few horses, so they got worried. (The camel was chased and)  a man slopped the camel by throwing an arrow at it. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Some of these  animals are untamed like wild animals, so if anyone of them went out of your control, then  you should treat it as you have done now.&#8217; &#8221; My grandfather said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! We fear that we may meet our enemy tomorrow and we have no knives, could we  slaughter the animals with reeds?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes, or you can use what  would make blood flow (slaughter) and you can eat what is slaughtered and the Name of  Allah is mentioned at the time of slaughtering. But don&#8217;t use teeth or fingernails (in  slaughtering). I will tell you why, as for teeth, they are bones, and fingernails are used  by Ethiopians for slaughtering. (See Hadith 668) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Marwan and al-Miswar bin Makhrama: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(from the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle) When Suhail bin Amr agreed to the Treaty (of  Hudaibiya), one of the things he stipulated then, was that the Prophet should return to  them (i.e. the pagans) anyone coming to him from their side, even if he was a Muslim; and  would not interfere between them and that person. The Muslims did not like this condition  and got disgusted with it. Suhail did not agree except with that condition. So, the  Prophet agreed to that condition and returned Abu Jandal to his father Suhail bin &#8216;Amr.  Thenceforward the Prophet returned everyone in that period (of truce) even if he was a  Muslim. During that period some believing women emigrants including Um Kalthum bint Uqba  bin Abu Muait who came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and she was a young lady then. Her relative came  to the Prophet and asked him to return her, but the Prophet did not return her to them for  Allah had revealed the following Verse regarding women: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O you who believe! When the believing women come to you as emigrants. Examine  them, Allah knows best as to their belief, then if you know them for true believers, Send  them not back to the unbelievers, (for) they are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers,  Nor are the unbelievers lawful (husbands) for them (60.10) </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Urwa: Aisha told me, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to examine them according to  this Verse: &#8220;O you who believe! When the believing women come to you, as emigrants  test them . . . for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221; (60.10-12) Aisha said,  &#8220;When any of them agreed to that condition Allah&#8217;s Apostle would say to her, &#8216;I have  accepted your pledge of allegiance.&#8217; He would only say that, but, by Allah he never  touched the hand of any women (i.e. never shook hands with them) while taking the pledge  of allegiance and he never took their pledge of allegiance except by his words  (only).&#8221; </p>

The camel became so fast as it had never been before.  The Prophet then said, &#8220;Sell it to me for one Uqiyya (of gold).&#8221; I said,  &#8220;No.&#8221; He again said, &#8220;Sell it to me for one Uqiyya (of gold).&#8221; I sold  it and stipulated that I should ride it to my house. When we reached (Medina) I took that  camel to the Prophet and he gave me its price. I returned home but he sent for me (and  when I went to him) he said, &#8220;I will not take your camel. Take your camel as a gift  for you.&#8221; (Various narrations are mentioned here with slight variations in  expressions relating the condition that Jabir had the right to ride the sold camel up to  Medina). </p>

The people told me that it was obligatory that my son  should be stoned to death, so in lieu of that I ransomed my son by paying one hundred  sheep and a slave girl. Then I asked the religious scholars about it, and they informed me  that my son must be lashed one hundred lashes, and be exiled for one year, and the wife of  this (man) must be stoned to death.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;By Him in Whose  Hands my soul is, I will judge between you according to Allah&#8217;s Laws. The slave-girl and  the sheep are to be returned to you, your son is to receive a hundred lashes and be exiled  for one year. You, Unais, go to the wife of this (man) and if she confesses her guilt,  stone her to death.&#8221; Unais went to that woman next morning and she confessed. Allah&#8217;s  Apostle ordered that she be stoned to death. </p>

Moses then violated the agreement for the first time  because of forgetfulness, then Moses promised that if he asked Al-Khadir about anything,  the latter would have the right to desert him. Moses abided by that condition and on the  third occasion he intentionally asked Al-Khadir and caused that condition to be applied.

She said, &#8220;I presented the offer to them, but  they refused unless the Wala&#8217; would be for them.&#8221; When the Prophet heard that and  &#8216;Aisha told him about It, he said to her, &#8220;Buy Buraira and let them stipulate that  her Wala&#8217; will be for them, as the Wala&#8217; is for the manumitted.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha did so. After  that Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up amidst the people, Glorified and Praised Allah and said,  &#8220;What is wrong with some people who stipulate things which are not in Allah&#8217;s Laws?  Any condition which is not in Allah&#8217;s Laws is invalid even if there were a hundred such  conditions. Allah&#8217;s Rules are the most valid and Allah&#8217;s Conditions are the most solid.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Miswar bin Makhrama and Marwan: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(whose narrations attest each other) Allah&#8217;s Apostle set out at the time of  Al-Hudaibiya (treaty), and when they proceeded for a distance, he said, &#8220;Khalid bin  Al-Walid leading the cavalry of Quraish constituting the front of the army, is at a place  called Al-Ghamim, so take the way on the right.&#8221; By Allah, Khalid did not perceive  the arrival of the Muslims till the dust arising from the march of the Muslim army reached  him, and then he turned back hurriedly to inform Quraish. The Prophet went on advancing  till he reached the Thaniyya (i.e. a mountainous way) through which one would go to them  (i.e. people of Quraish). The she-camel of the Prophet sat down. The people tried their  best to cause the she-camel to get up but in vain, so they said, &#8220;Al-Qaswa&#8217; (i.e. the  she-camel&#8217;s name) has become stubborn! Al-Qaswa&#8217; has become stubborn!&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;Al-Qaswa&#8217; has not become stubborn, for stubbornness is not her habit, but she  was stopped by Him Who stopped the elephant.&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;By the Name of Him  in Whose Hands my soul is, if they (i.e. the Quraish infidels) ask me anything which will  respect the ordinances of Allah, I will grant it to them.&#8221; </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet then rebuked the she-camel and she got up. The Prophet changed his way till  he dismounted at the farthest end of Al-Hudaibiya at a pit (i.e. well) containing a little  water which the people used in small amounts, and in a short while the people used up all  its water and complained to Allah&#8217;s Apostle; of thirst. The Prophet took an arrow out of  his arrow-case and ordered them to put the arrow in that pit. By Allah, the water started  and continued sprouting out till all the people quenched their thirst and returned with  satisfaction. While they were still in that state, Budail bin Warqa-al-Khuza&#8217;i came with  some persons from his tribe Khuza&#8217;a and they were the advisers of Allah&#8217;s Apostle who  would keep no secret from him and were from the people of Tihama. Budail said, &#8220;I  left Kab bin Luai and &#8216;Amir bin Luai residing at the profuse water of Al-Hudaibiya and  they had milch camels (or their women and children) with them, and will wage war against  you, and will prevent you from visiting the Kaba.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;We  have not come to fight anyone, but to perform the &#8216;Umra. No doubt, the war has weakened  Quraish and they have suffered great losses, so if they wish, I will conclude a truce with  them, during which they should refrain from interfering between me and the people (i.e.  the &#8216;Arab infidels other than Quraish), and if I have victory over those infidels, Quraish  will have the option to embrace Islam as the other people do, if they wish; they will at  least get strong enough to fight. But if they do not accept the truce, by Allah in Whose  Hands my life is, I will fight with them defending my Cause till I get killed, but (I am  sure) Allah will definitely make His Cause victorious.&#8221; Budail said, &#8220;I will  inform them of what you have said.&#8221; So, he set off till he reached Quraish and said,  &#8220;We have come from that man (i.e. Muhammad) whom we heard saying something which we  will disclose to you if you should like.&#8221; Some of the fools among Quraish shouted  that they were not in need of this information, but the wiser among them said,  &#8220;Relate what you heard him saying.&#8221; Budail said, &#8220;I heard him saying  so-and-so,&#8221; relating what the Prophet had told him. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Urwa bin Mas&#8217;ud got up and said, &#8220;O people! Aren&#8217;t you the sons? They said,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He added, &#8220;Am I not the father?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He  said, &#8220;Do you mistrust me?&#8221; They said, &#8220;No.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you  know that I invited the people of &#8216;Ukaz for your help, and when they refused I brought my  relatives and children and those who obeyed me (to help you)?&#8221; They said,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Well, this man (i.e. the Prophet) has offered you a  reasonable proposal, you&#8217;d better accept it and allow me to meet him.&#8221; They said,  &#8220;You may meet him.&#8221; So, he went to the Prophet and started talking to him. The  Prophet told him almost the same as he had told Budail. Then Urwa said, &#8220;O Muhammad!  Won&#8217;t you feel any scruple in extirpating your relations? Have you ever heard of anyone  amongst the Arabs extirpating his relatives before you? On the other hand, if the reverse  should happen, (nobody will aid you, for) by Allah, I do not see (with you) dignified  people, but people from various tribes who would run away leaving you alone.&#8221; Hearing  that, Abu Bakr abused him and said, &#8220;Do you say we would run and leave the Prophet  alone?&#8221; Urwa said, &#8220;Who is that man?&#8221; They said, &#8220;He is Abu  Bakr.&#8221; Urwa said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hands my life is, were it not for  the favor which you did to me and which I did not compensate, I would retort on you.&#8221;  Urwa kept on talking to the Prophet and seizing the Prophet&#8217;s beard as he was talking  while Al-Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba was standing near the head of the Prophet, holding a sword and  wearing a helmet. Whenever Urwa stretched his hand towards the beard of the Prophet,  Al-Mughira would hit his hand with the handle of the sword and say (to Urwa), &#8220;Remove  your hand from the beard of Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; Urwa raised his head and asked,  &#8220;Who is that?&#8221; The people said, &#8220;He is Al-Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba.&#8221; Urwa  said, &#8220;O treacherous! Am I not doing my best to prevent evil consequences of your  treachery?&#8221; </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Before embracing Islam Al-Mughira was in the company of some people. He killed them and  took their property and came (to Medina) to embrace Islam. The Prophet said (to him,  &#8220;As regards your Islam, I accept it, but as for the property I do not take anything  of it. (As it was taken through treason). Urwa then started looking at the Companions of  the Prophet. By Allah, whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle spat, the spittle would fall in the hand  of one of them (i.e. the Prophet&#8217;s companions) who would rub it on his face and skin; if  he ordered them they would carry his orders immediately; if he performed ablution, they  would struggle to take the remaining water; and when they spoke to him, they would lower  their voices and would not look at his face constantly out of respect. Urwa returned to  his people and said, &#8220;O people! By Allah, I have been to the kings and to Caesar,  Khosrau and An-Najashi, yet I have never seen any of them respected by his courtiers as  much as Muhammad is respected by his companions. By Allah, if he spat, the spittle would  fall in the hand of one of them (i.e. the Prophet&#8217;s companions) who would rub it on his  face and skin; if he ordered them, they would carry out his order immediately; if he  performed ablution, they would struggle to take the remaining water; and when they spoke,  they would lower their voices and would not look at his face constantly out of  respect.&#8221; Urwa added, &#8220;No doubt, he has presented to you a good reasonable  offer, so please accept it.&#8221; A man from the tribe of Bani Kinana said, &#8220;Allow me  to go to him,&#8221; and they allowed him, and when he approached the Prophet and his  companions, Allah&#8217;s Ap le I said, &#8220;He is so-and-so who belongs to the tribe that  respects the Budn (i.e. camels of the sacrifice). So, bring the Budn in front of  him.&#8221; So, the Budn were brought before him and the people received him while they  were reciting Talbiya. When he saw that scene, he said, &#8220;Glorified be Allah! It is  not fair to prevent these people from visiting the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; When he returned to his  people, he said, &#8216;I saw the Budn garlanded (with colored knotted ropes) and marked (with  stabs on their backs). I do not think it is advisable to prevent them from visiting the  Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; Another person called Mikraz bin Hafs got up and sought their permission to  go to Muhammad, and they allowed him, too. When he approached the Muslims, the Prophet  said, &#8220;Here is Mikraz and he is a vicious man.&#8221; Mikraz started talking to the  Prophet and as he was talking, Suhail bin Amr came. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Suhail bin Amr came, the Prophet said, &#8220;Now the matter has become easy.&#8221;  Suhail said to the Prophet &#8220;Please conclude a peace treaty with us.&#8221; So, the  Prophet called the clerk and said to him, &#8220;Write: By the Name of Allah, the most  Beneficent, the most Merciful.&#8221; Suhail said, &#8220;As for &#8216;Beneficent,&#8217; by Allah, I  do not know what it means. So write: By Your Name O Allah, as you used to write  previously.&#8221; The Muslims said, &#8220;By Allah, we will not write except: By the Name  of Allah, the most Beneficent, the most Merciful.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Write: By  Your Name O Allah.&#8221; Then he dictated, &#8220;This is the peace treaty which Muhammad,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle has concluded.&#8221; Suhail said, &#8220;By Allah, if we knew that you are  Allah&#8217;s Apostle we would not prevent you from visiting the Kaba, and would not fight with  you. So, write: &#8220;Muhammad bin Abdullah.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;By Allah! I am  Apostle of Allah even if you people do not believe me. Write: Muhammad bin Abdullah.&#8221;  (Az-Zuhri said, &#8220;The Prophet accepted all those things, as he had already said that  he would accept everything they would demand if it respects the ordinance of Allah, (i.e.  by letting him and his companions perform &#8216;Umra.)&#8221; The Prophet said to Suhail,  &#8220;On the condition that you allow us to visit the House (i.e. Ka&#8217;ba) so that we may  perform Tawaf around it.&#8221; Suhail said, &#8220;By Allah, we will not (allow you this  year) so as not to give chance to the &#8216;Arabs to say that we have yielded to you, but we  will allow you next year.&#8221; So, the Prophet got that written. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Suhail said, &#8220;We also stipulate that you should return to us whoever comes to  you from us, even if he embraced your religion.&#8221; The Muslims said, &#8220;Glorified be  Allah! How will such a person be returned to the pagans after he has become a Muslim?  While they were in this state Abu- Jandal bin Suhail bin &#8216;Amr came from the valley of  Mecca staggering with his fetters and fell down amongst the Muslims. Suhail said, &#8220;O  Muhammad! This is the very first term with which we make peace with you, i.e. you shall  return Abu Jandal to me.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;The peace treaty has not been  written yet.&#8221; Suhail said, &#8220;I will never allow you to keep him.&#8221; The  Prophet said, &#8220;Yes, do.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I won&#8217;t do.: Mikraz said, &#8220;We allow  you (to keep him).&#8221; Abu Jandal said, &#8220;O Muslims! Will I be returned to the  pagans though I have come as a Muslim? Don&#8217;t you see how much I have suffered?&#8221; </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Jandal had been tortured severely for the Cause of Allah. Umar bin Al-Khattab said,  &#8220;I went to the Prophet and said, &#8216;Aren&#8217;t you truly the Apostle of Allah?&#8217; The Prophet  said, &#8216;Yes, indeed.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Isn&#8217;t our Cause just and the cause of the enemy unjust?&#8217; He  said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Then why should we be humble in our religion?&#8217; He said, &#8216;I am  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and I do not disobey Him, and He will make me victorious.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Didn&#8217;t  you tell us that we would go to the Ka&#8217;ba and perform Tawaf around it?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes, but  did I tell you that we would visit the Ka&#8217;ba this year?&#8217; I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;So you  will visit it and perform Tawaf around it?&#8217; &#8221; Umar further said, &#8220;I went to Abu  Bakr and said, &#8216;O Abu Bakr! Isn&#8217;t he truly Allah&#8217;s Prophet?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; I said,  &#8216;Then why should we be humble in our religion?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Indeed, he is Allah&#8217;s Apostle  and he does not disobey his Lord, and He will make him victorious. Adhere to him as, by  Allah, he is on the right.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Was he not telling us that we would go to the Kaba  and perform Tawaf around it?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes, but did he tell you that you would go to the  Ka&#8217;ba this year?&#8217; I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8220;You will go to Ka&#8217;ba and perform Tawaf  around it.&#8221; (Az-Zuhri said, &#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;I performed many good deeds as  expiation for the improper questions I asked them.&#8217; &#8220;) </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the writing of the peace treaty was concluded, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to his  companions, &#8220;Get up and&#8217; slaughter your sacrifices and get your head shaved.&#8221; By  Allah none of them got up, and the Prophet repeated his order thrice. When none of them  got up, he left them and went to Um Salama and told her of the people&#8217;s attitudes towards  him. Um Salama said, &#8220;O the Prophet of Allah! Do you want your order to be carried  out? Go out and don&#8217;t say a word to anybody till you have slaughtered your sacrifice and  call your barber to shave your head.&#8221; So, the Prophet went out and did not talk to  anyone of them till he did that, i.e. slaughtered the sacrifice and called his barber who  shaved his head. Seeing that, the companions of the Prophet got up, slaughtered their  sacrifices, and started shaving the heads of one another, and there was so much rush that  there was a danger of killing each other. Then some believing women came (to the Prophet  ); and Allah revealed the following Divine Verses:&#8211; </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O you who believe, when the believing women come to you as emigrants examine them  . . .&#8221; (60.10) </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar then divorced two wives of his who were infidels. Later on Muawiya bin Abu Sufyan  married one of them, and Safwan bin Umaya married the other. When the Prophet returned to  Medina, Abu Basir, a new Muslim convert from Quraish came to him. The Infidels sent in his  pursuit two men who said (to the Prophet ), &#8220;Abide by the promise you gave us.&#8221;  So, the Prophet handed him over to them. They took him out (of the City) till they reached  Dhul-Hulaifa where they dismounted to eat some dates they had with them. Abu Basir said to  one of them, &#8220;By Allah, O so-and-so, I see you have a fine sword.&#8221; The other  drew it out (of the scabbard) and said, &#8220;By Allah, it is very fine and I have tried  it many times.&#8221; Abu Bair said, &#8220;Let me have a look at it.&#8221; </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the other gave it to him, he hit him with it till he died, and his companion ran  away till he came to Medina and entered the Mosque running. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw him  he said, &#8220;This man appears to have been frightened.&#8221; When he reached the Prophet  he said, &#8220;My companion has been murdered and I would have been murdered too.&#8221;  Abu Basir came and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, by Allah, Allah has made you fulfill  your obligations by your returning me to them (i.e. the Infidels), but Allah has saved me  from them.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Woe to his mother! what excellent war kindler he  would be, should he only have supporters.&#8221; When Abu Basir heard that he understood  that the Prophet would return him to them again, so he set off till he reached the  seashore. Abu Jandal bin Suhail got himself released from them (i.e. infidels) and joined  Abu Basir. So, whenever a man from Quraish embraced Islam he would follow Abu Basir till  they formed a strong group. By Allah, whenever they heard about a caravan of Quraish  heading towards Sham, they stopped it and attacked and killed them (i.e. infidels) and  took their properties. The people of Quraish sent a message to the Prophet requesting him  for the Sake of Allah and Kith and kin to send for (i.e. Abu Basir and his companions)  promising that whoever (amongst them) came to the Prophet would be secure. So the Prophet  sent for them (i.e. Abu Basir&#8217;s companions) and Allah I revealed the following Divine  Verses: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And it is He Who Has withheld their hands from you and your hands From them in  the midst of Mecca, After He made you the victorious over them. . . . the unbelievers had  pride and haughtiness, in their hearts . . . the pride and haughtiness of the time of  ignorance.&#8221; (48.24-26) And their pride and haughtiness was that they did not confess  (write in the treaty) that he (i.e. Muhammad) was the Prophet of Allah and refused to  write: &#8220;In the Name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the Most Merciful,&#8221; and  prevented the Mushriks from visiting the Ka&#8217;ba. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Az-Zuhri: Urwa said, &#8220;Aisha told me that Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to examine  the women emigrants. We have been told also that when Allah revealed the order that the  Muslims should return to the pagans what they had spent on their wives who emigrated  (after embracing Islam) and that the Mushriks should not. keep unbelieving women as their  wives, &#8216;Umar divorced two of his wives, Qariba, the daughter of Abu Urhaiya and the  daughter of Jarwal Al-Khuza&#8217;i. Later on Mu&#8217;awlya married Qariba and Abu Jahm married the  other.&#8221; </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the pagans refused to pay what the Muslims had spent on their wives, Allah  revealed: &#8220;And if any of your wives have gone from you to the unbelievers and you  have an accession (By the coming over of a woman from the other side) (Then pay to those  whose wives have gone) The equivalent of what they had spent (On their Mahr).&#8221;  (60.11) </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allah ordered that the Muslim whose wife, has gone, should be given, as a  compensation of the Mahr he had given to his wife, from the Mahr of the wives of the  pagans who had emigrated deserting their husbands. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We do not know any of the women emigrants who deserted Islam after embracing it. We  have also been told that Abu Basir bin Asid Ath-Thaqafi came to the Prophet as a Muslim  emigrant during the truce. Al-Akhnas bin Shariq wrote to the Prophet requesting him to  return Abu Basir. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Amra: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aisha said that Buraira came to seek her help in the writing of her emancipation.  &#8216;Aisha said to her, &#8220;If you wish, I will pay your masters (your price) and the wala&#8217;  will be for me.&#8221; When Allah&#8217;s Apostle came, she told him about it. The Prophet said  to her, &#8220;Buy her (i.e. Buraira) and manumit her, for the Wala is for the one who  manumits.&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle ascended the pulpit and said, &#8220;What about those  people who stipulate conditions which are not in Allah&#8217;s Laws? Whoever stipulates such  conditions as are not in Allah&#8217;s Laws, then those conditions are invalid even if he  stipulated a hundred such conditions.&#8221; </p>
