<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet sent Muadh to Yemen, he said to him,  &#8220;You are going to a nation from the people of the Scripture, so let the first thing  to which you will invite them, be the Tauhid of Allah. If they learn that, tell them that  Allah has enjoined on them, five prayers to be offered in one day and one night. And if  they pray, tell them that Allah has enjoined on them Zakat of their properties and it is  to be taken from the rich among them and given to the poor. And if they agree to that,  then take from them Zakat but avoid the best property of the people.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Mu&#8217;adh bin Jabal: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;O Mu&#8217;adh! Do you know what Allah&#8217;s  Right upon His slaves is?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know best.&#8221; The  Prophet said, &#8220;To worship Him (Allah) Alone and to join none in worship with Him  (Allah). Do you know what their right upon Him is?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Allah and His  Apostle know best.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Not to punish them (if they do so).&#8221;  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man heard another man reciting (in the prayers): &#8216;Say (O  Muhammad): &#8220;He is Allah, the One.&#8221; (112.1) And he recited it repeatedly. When it  was morning, he went to the Prophet and informed him about that as if he considered that  the recitation of that Sura by itself was not enough. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;By Him  in Whose Hand my life is, it is equal to one-third of the Quran.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet sent (an army unit) under the command of a man  who used to lead his companions in the prayers and would finish his recitation with (the  Sura 112): &#8216;Say (O Muhammad): &#8220;He is Allah, the One.&#8221; &#8216; (112.1) When they  returned (from the battle), they mentioned that to the Prophet. He said (to them),  &#8220;Ask him why he does so.&#8221; They asked him and he said, &#8220;I do so because it  mentions the qualities of the Beneficent and I love to recite it (in my prayer).&#8221; The  Prophet; said (to them), &#8220;Tell him that Allah loves him&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jarir bin &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 93, Number 474: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Usama bin Zaid: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were with the Prophet when suddenly there came to him a  messenger from one of his daughters who was asking him to come and see her son who was  dying. The Prophet said (to the messenger), &#8220;Go back and tell her that whatever Allah  takes is His, and whatever He gives is His, and everything with Him has a limited fixed  term (in this world). So order her to be patient and hope for Allah&#8217;s reward.&#8221; But  she sent the messenger to the Prophet again, swearing that he should come to her. So the  Prophets got up, and so did Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada and Mu&#8217;adh bin Jabal (and went to her). When  the child was brought to the Prophet his breath was disturbed in his chest as if it were  in a water skin. On that the eyes of the Prophet . became flooded with tears, whereupon  Sa&#8217;d said to him, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What is this?&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;This is mercy which Allah has put in the heart of His slaves, and Allah bestows His  mercy only on those of His slaves who are merciful (to others).&#8221; (See Hadith No. 373,  Vol. 2) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The keys of the unseen are five and  none knows them but Allah: (1) None knows what is in the womb, but Allah: (2) None knows  what will happen tomorrow, but Allah; (3) None knows when it will rain, but Allah; (4)  None knows where he will die, but Allah (knows that); (5) and none knows when the Hour  will be established, but Allah.&#8221; </font></p>

All the  Praises are for You; You are the Maintainer of the Heaven and the Earth and whatever is in  them. All the Praises are for You; You are the Light of the Heavens and the Earth. Your  Word is the Truth, and Your Promise is the Truth, and the Meeting with You is the Truth,  and Paradise is the Truth, and the (Hell) Fire is the Truth, and the Hour is the Truth. O  Allah! I surrender myself to You, and I believe in You and I depend upon You, and I repent  to You and with You (Your evidences) I stand against my opponents, and to you I leave the  judgment (for those who refuse my message). O Allah! Forgive me my sins that I did in the  past or will do in the future, and also the sins I did in secret or in public. You are my  only God (Whom I worship) and there is no other God for me (i.e. I worship none but  You).&#8221; </font></p>

You are not calling a deaf or an absent person,  but you are calling One Who Hears, Sees, and is very near.&#8221; Then he came to me while  I was saying in my heart, &#8220;La hawla wala quwwatta illa billah (There is neither might  nor power but with Allah).&#8221; He said, to me, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdullah bin Qais!

When I see  my Lord, I will fall down in (prostration) before Him and He will leave me (in  prostration) as long as He wishes, and then it will be said to me, &#8216;O Muhammad! Raise your  head and speak, for you will be listened to; and ask, for you will be granted (your  request); and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.&#8217; I will then raise my  head and praise my Lord with certain praises which He has taught me, and then I will  intercede.

By Allah, I have  more Ghira than he, and Allah has more Ghira than I, and because of Allah&#8217;s Ghira, He has  made unlawful Shameful deeds and sins (illegal sexual intercourse etc.) done in open and  in secret. And there is none who likes that the people should repent to Him and beg His  pardon than Allah, and for this reason He sent the warners and the givers of good news.  And there is none who likes to be praised more than Allah does, and for this reason, Allah  promised to grant Paradise (to the doers of good).&#8221; &#8216;Abdul Malik said, &#8220;No  person has more Ghira than Allah.&#8221; </font></p>

Accept the good news,  as Bani Tamim have refused it. &#8221; They said, &#8220;We accept it, for we have come to  you to learn the Religion. So we ask you what the beginning of this universe was.&#8221;  The Prophet said &#8220;There was Allah and nothing else before Him and His Throne was over  the water, and He then created the Heavens and the Earth and wrote everything in the  Book.&#8221; Then a man came to me and said, &#8216;O Imran! Follow your she-camel for it has run  away!&#8221; So I set out seeking it, and behold, it was beyond the mirage!

Should we not inform the people of that?&#8221; He said, &#8220;There are  one-hundred degrees in Paradise which Allah has prepared for those who carry on Jihad in  His Cause. The distance between every two degrees is like the distance between the sky and  the Earth, so if you ask Allah for anything, ask Him for the Firdaus, for it is the last  part of Paradise and the highest part of Paradise, and at its top there is the Throne of  Beneficent, and from it gush forth the rivers of Paradise.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When &#8216;Ali was in Yemen, he sent some gold in its ore to the  Prophet. The Prophet distributed it among Al-Aqra&#8217; bin Habis Al-Hanzali who belonged to  Bani Mujashi, &#8216;Uyaina bin Badr Al-Fazari, &#8216;Alqama bin &#8216;Ulatha Al-&#8216;Amiri, who belonged to  the Bani Kilab tribe and Zaid AI-Khail At-Ta&#8217;i who belonged to Bani Nabhan. So the Quraish  and the Ansar became angry and said, &#8220;He gives to the chiefs of Najd and leaves  us!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I just wanted to attract and unite their hearts (make  them firm in Islam).&#8221; Then there came a man with sunken eyes, bulging forehead, thick  beard, fat raised cheeks, and clean-shaven head, and said, &#8220;O Muhammad! Be afraid of  Allah! &#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Who would obey Allah if I disobeyed Him? (Allah). He  trusts me over the people of the earth, but you do not trust me?&#8221; A man from the  people (present then), who, I think, was Khalid bin Al-Walid, asked for permission to kill  him, but the Prophet prevented him. When the man went away, the Prophet said, &#8220;Out of  the offspring of this man, there will be people who will recite the Quran but it will not  go beyond their throats, and they will go out of Islam as an arrow goes out through the  game, and they will kill the Muslims and leave the idolators.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ata&#8217; bin Yazid Al-Laithi: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On the authority of Abu Huraira: The people said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Do you have any difficulty in seeing the moon on a full moon night?&#8221; They said,  &#8220;No, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Do you have any difficulty in seeing the  sun when there are no clouds?&#8221; They said, &#8220;No, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; He said,  &#8220;So you will see Him, like that. Allah will gather all the people on the Day of  Resurrection, and say, &#8216;Whoever worshipped something (in the world) should follow (that  thing),&#8217; so, whoever worshipped the sun will follow the sun, and whoever worshiped the  moon will follow the moon, and whoever used to worship certain (other false) deities, he  will follow those deities. And there will remain only this nation with its good people (or  its hypocrites). (The sub-narrator, Ibrahim is in doubt.) Allah will come to them and say,  &#8216;I am your Lord.&#8217; They will (deny Him and) say, &#8216;We will stay here till our Lord comes,  for when our Lord comes, we will recognize Him.&#8217; So Allah will come to them in His  appearance which they know, and will say, &#8216;I am your Lord.&#8217; They will say, &#8216;You are our  Lord,&#8217; so they will follow Him. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then a bridge will be laid across Hell (Fire)&#8217; I and my  followers will be the first ones to go across it and none will speak on that Day except  the Apostles. And the invocation of the Apostles on that Day will be, &#8216;O Allah, save!  Save!&#8217; In Hell (or over The Bridge) there will be hooks like the thorns of As-Sa&#8217;dan  (thorny plant). Have you seen As-Sa&#8217;dan? &#8221; They replied, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle!&#8221; He said, &#8220;So those hooks look like the thorns of As-Sa&#8217;dan, but none  knows how big they are except Allah. Those hooks will snap the people away according to  their deeds. Some of the people will stay in Hell (be destroyed) because of their (evil)  deeds, and some will be cut or torn by the hooks (and fall into Hell) and some will be  punished and then relieved. When Allah has finished His Judgments among the people, He  will take whomever He will out of Hell through His Mercy. He will then order the angels to  take out of the Fire all those who used to worship none but Allah from among those whom  Allah wanted to be merciful to and those who testified (in the world) that none has the  right to be worshipped but Allah. The angels will recognize them in the Fire by the marks  of prostration (on their foreheads), for the Fire will eat up all the human body except  the mark caused by prostration as Allah has forbidden the Fire to eat the mark of  prostration. They will come out of the (Hell) Fire, completely burnt and then the water of  life will be poured over them and they will grow under it as does a seed that comes in the  mud of the torrent. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then Allah will finish the judgments among the people, and  there will remain one man facing the (Hell) Fire and he will be the last person among the  people of Hell to enter Paradise. He will say, &#8216;O my Lord! Please turn my face away from  the fire because its air has hurt me and its severe heat has burnt me.&#8217; So he will invoke  Allah in the way Allah will wish him to invoke, and then Allah will say to him, &#8216;If I  grant you that, will you then ask for anything else?&#8217; He will reply, &#8216;No, by Your Power,  (Honor) I will not ask You for anything else.&#8217; He will give his Lord whatever promises and  covenants Allah will demand. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So Allah will turn his face away from Hell (Fire). When he  will face Paradise and will see it, he will remain quiet for as long as Allah will wish  him to remain quiet, then he will say, &#8216;O my Lord! Bring me near to the gate of Paradise.&#8217;  Allah will say to him, &#8216;Didn&#8217;t you give your promises and covenants that you would never  ask for anything more than what you had been given? Woe on you, O Adam&#8217;s son! How  treacherous you are!&#8217; He will say, &#8216;O my lord,&#8217; and will keep on invoking Allah till He  says to him, &#8216;If I give what you are asking, will you then ask for anything else?&#8217; He will  reply, &#8216;No, by Your (Honor) Power, I will not ask for anything else.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then he will give covenants and promises to Allah and then  Allah will bring him near to the gate of Paradise. When he stands at the gate of Paradise,  Paradise will be opened and spread before him, and he will see its splendor and pleasures  whereupon he will remain quiet as long as Allah will wish him to remain quiet, and then he  will say, O my Lord! Admit me into Paradise.&#8217; Allah will say, &#8216;Didn&#8217;t you give your  covenants and promises that you would not ask for anything more than what you had been  given?&#8217; Allah will say, &#8216;Woe on you, O Adam&#8217;s son! How treacherous you are! &#8216; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The man will say, &#8216;O my Lord! Do not make me the most  miserable of Your creation,&#8217; and he will keep on invoking Allah till Allah will laugh  because of his sayings, and when Allah will laugh because of him, He will say to him,  &#8216;Enter Paradise,&#8217; and when he will enter it, Allah will say to him, &#8216;Wish for anything.&#8217;  So he will ask his Lord, and he will wish for a great number of things, for Allah Himself  will remind him to wish for certain things by saying, &#8216;(Wish for) so-and-so.&#8217; When there  is nothing more to wish for, Allah will say, &#8216;This is for you, and its equal (is for you)  as well.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall we see our Lord on  the Day of Resurrection?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Do you have any difficulty in seeing the sun  and the moon when the sky is clear?&#8221; We said, &#8220;No.&#8221; He said, &#8220;So you  will have no difficulty in seeing your Lord on that Day as you have no difficulty in  seeing the sun and the moon (in a clear sky).&#8221; The Prophet then said, &#8220;Somebody  will then announce, &#8216;Let every nation follow what they used to worship.&#8217; So the companions  of the cross will go with their cross, and the idolators (will go) with their idols, and  the companions of every god (false deities) (will go) with their god, till there remain  those who used to worship Allah, both the obedient ones and the mischievous ones, and some  of the people of the Scripture. Then Hell will be presented to them as if it were a  mirage. Then it will be said to the Jews, &#8220;What did you use to worship?&#8217; They will  reply, &#8216;We used to worship Ezra, the son of Allah.&#8217; It will be said to them, &#8216;You are  liars, for Allah has neither a wife nor a son. What do you want (now)?&#8217; They will reply,  &#8216;We want You to provide us with water.&#8217; Then it will be said to them &#8216;Drink,&#8217; and they  will fall down in Hell (instead). Then it will be said to the Christians, &#8216;What did you  use to worship?&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>They will reply, &#8216;We used to worship Messiah, the son of  Allah.&#8217; It will be said, &#8216;You are liars, for Allah has neither a wife nor a son. What: do  you want (now)?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;We want You to provide us with water.&#8217; It will be said to  them, &#8216;Drink,&#8217; and they will fall down in Hell (instead). When there remain only those who  used to worship Allah (Alone), both the obedient ones and the mischievous ones, it will be  said to them, &#8216;What keeps you here when all the people have gone?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;We  parted with them (in the world) when we were in greater need of them than we are today, we  heard the call of one proclaiming, &#8216;Let every nation follow what they used to worship,&#8217;  and now we are waiting for our Lord.&#8217; Then the Almighty will come to them in a shape other  than the one which they saw the first time, and He will say, &#8216;I am your Lord,&#8217; and they  will say, &#8216;You are not our Lord.&#8217; And none will speak: to Him then but the Prophets, and  then it will be said to them, &#8216;Do you know any sign by which you can recognize Him?&#8217; They  will say. &#8216;The Shin,&#8217; and so Allah will then uncover His Shin whereupon every believer  will prostrate before Him and there will remain those who used to prostrate before Him  just for showing off and for gaining good reputation. These people will try to prostrate  but their backs will be rigid like one piece of a wood (and they will not be able to  prostrate). Then the bridge will be laid across Hell.&#8221; We, the companions of the  Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What is the bridge?&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>He said, &#8220;It is a slippery (bridge) on which there are  clamps and (Hooks like) a thorny seed that is wide at one side and narrow at the other and  has thorns with bent ends. Such a thorny seed is found in Najd and is called As-Sa&#8217;dan.  Some of the believers will cross the bridge as quickly as the wink of an eye, some others  as quick as lightning, a strong wind, fast horses or she-camels. So some will be safe  without any harm; some will be safe after receiving some scratches, and some will fall  down into Hell (Fire). The last person will cross by being dragged (over the  bridge).&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;You (Muslims) cannot be more pressing in claiming  from me a right that has been clearly proved to be yours than the believers in interceding  with Almighty for their (Muslim) brothers on that Day, when they see themselves safe. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>They will say, &#8216;O Allah! (Save) our brothers (for they)  used to pray with us, fast with us and also do good deeds with us.&#8217; Allah will say, &#8216;Go  and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the weight of one  (gold) Dinar.&#8217; Allah will forbid the Fire to burn the faces of those sinners. They will go  to them and find some of them in Hell (Fire) up to their feet, and some up to the middle  of their legs. So they will take out those whom they will recognize and then they will  return, and Allah will say (to them), &#8216;Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you  find faith equal to the weight of one half Dinar.&#8217; They will take out whomever they will  recognize and return, and then Allah will say, &#8216;Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose  heart you find faith equal to the weight of an atom (or a smallest ant), and so they will  take out all those whom they will recognize.&#8221; Abu Sa&#8217;id said: If you do not believe  me then read the Holy Verse:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Surely! Allah wrongs not even of the weight of an atom (or  a smallest ant) but if there is any good (done) He doubles it.&#8217; (4.40) The Prophet added,  &#8220;Then the prophets and Angels and the believers will intercede, and (last of all) the  Almighty (Allah) will say, &#8216;Now remains My Intercession. He will then hold a handful of  the Fire from which He will take out some people whose bodies have been burnt, and they  will be thrown into a river at the entrance of Paradise, called the water of life. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>They will grow on its banks, as a seed carried by the  torrent grows. You have noticed how it grows beside a rock or beside a tree, and how the  side facing the sun is usually green while the side facing the shade is white. Those  people will come out (of the River of Life) like pearls, and they will have (golden)  necklaces, and then they will enter Paradise whereupon the people of Paradise will say,  &#8216;These are the people emancipated by the Beneficent. He has admitted them into Paradise  without them having done any good deeds and without sending forth any good (for  themselves).&#8217; Then it will be said to them, &#8216;For you is what you have seen and its  equivalent as well.'&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 93, Number 532v: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The believers will be kept  (waiting) on the Day of Resurrection so long that they will become worried and say,  &#8220;Let us ask somebody to intercede far us with our Lord so that He may relieve us from  our place. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then they will go to Adam and say, &#8216;You are Adam, the  father of the people. Allah created you with His Own Hand and made you reside in His  Paradise and ordered His angels to prostrate before you, and taught you the names of all  things will you intercede for us with your Lord so that He may relieve us from this place  of ours? Adam will say, &#8216;I am not fit for this undertaking.&#8217; He will mention his mistakes  he had committed, i.e., his eating off the tree though he had been forbidden to do so. He  will add, &#8216;Go to Noah, the first prophet sent by Allah to the people of the Earth.&#8217; The  people will go to Noah who will say, &#8216;I am not fit for this undertaking&#8217; He will mention  his mistake which he had done, i.e., his asking his Lord without knowledge.&#8217; He will say  (to them), &#8216;Go to Abraham, Khalil Ar-Rahman.&#8217; They will go to Abraham who will say, &#8216;I am  not fit for this undertaking. He would mention three words by which he told a lie, and say  (to them). &#8216;Go to Moses, a slave whom Allah gave the Torah and spoke to, directly and  brought near Him, for conversation.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>They will go to Moses who will say, &#8216;I am not fit for this  undertaking. He will mention his mistake he made, i.e., killing a person, and will say (to  them), &#8216;Go to Jesus, Allah&#8217;s slave and His Apostle, and a soul created by Him and His  Word.&#8217; (Be: And it was.) They will go to Jesus who will say, &#8216;I am not fit for this  undertaking but you&#8217;d better go to Muhammad the slave whose past and future sins have been  forgiven by Allah.&#8217; So they will come to me, and I will ask my Lord&#8217;s permission to enter  His House and then I will be permitted. When I see Him I will fall down in prostration  before Him, and He will leave me (in prostration) as long as He will, and then He will  say, &#8216;O Muhammad, lift up your head and speak, for you will be listened to, and intercede,  for your intercession will be accepted, and ask (for anything) for it will be granted:&#8217;  Then I will raise my head and glorify my Lord with certain praises which He has taught me.  Allah will put a limit for me (to intercede for a certain type of people) I will take them  out and make them enter Paradise.&#8221; (Qatada said: I heard Anas saying that), the  Prophet said, &#8220;I will go out and take them out of Hell (Fire) and let them enter  Paradise, and then I will return and ask my Lord for permission to enter His House and I  will be permitted. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When I will see Him I will fall down in prostration before  Him and He will leave me in prostration as long as He will let me (in that state), and  then He will say, &#8216;O Muhammad, raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to, and  intercede, for your intercession will be accepted, and ask, your request will be granted.&#8217;  &#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;So I will raise my head and glorify and praise Him as He  has taught me. Then I will intercede and He will put a limit for me (to intercede for a  certain type of people). I will take them out and let them enter Paradise.&#8221; (Qatada  added: I heard Anas saying that) the Prophet said, &#8216;I will go out and take them out of  Hell (Fire) and let them enter Paradise, and I will return for the third time and will ask  my Lord for permission to enter His house, and I will be allowed to enter. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When I see Him, I will fall down in prostration before Him,  and will remain in prostration as long as He will, and then He will say, &#8216;Raise your head,  O Muhammad, and speak, for you will be listened to, and intercede, for your intercession  will be accepted, and ask, for your request will be granted.&#8217; So I will raise my head and  praise Allah as He has taught me and then I will intercede and He will put a limit for me  (to intercede for a certain type of people). I will take them out and let them enter  Paradise.&#8221; (Qatada said: I heard Anas saying that) the Prophet said, &#8220;So I will  go out and take them out of Hell (Fire) and let them enter Paradise, till none will remain  in the Fire except those whom Quran will imprison (i.e., those who are destined for  eternal life in the fire).&#8221; The narrator then recited the Verse:&#8211; &#8220;It may be  that your Lord will raise you to a Station of Praise and Glory.&#8217; (17.79) The narrator  added: This is the Station of Praise and Glory which Allah has promised to your Prophet. </font></p>

You are the Truth, and  Your saying is the Truth, and Your promise is the Truth, and the meeting with You is the  Truth, and Paradise is the Truth, and the (Hell) Fire is the Truth. O Allah! I surrender  myself to You, and believe in You, and I put my trust in You (solely depend upon). And to  You I complain of my opponents and with Your Evidence I argue. So please forgive the sins  which I have done in the past or I will do in the future, and also those (sins) which I  did in secret or in public, and that which You know better than I.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Time has come back to its original  state which it had when Allah created the Heavens and the Earth, the year is twelve  months, of which four are sacred; (and out of these four) three are in succession, namely,  Dhul-Qa&#8217;da, Dhul-Hijja and Muharram, and (the fourth one) Rajab Mudar which is between  Jumad (Ath-Tham) and Sha&#8217;ban.&#8221; The Prophet then asked us, &#8220;Which month is  this?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know (it) better.&#8221; He kept quiet so  long that we thought he might call it by another name. Then he said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it  Dhul-Hijja?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He asked &#8220;What town is this?&#8221; We  said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know (it) better.&#8217; Then he kept quiet so long that we  thought he might call it by another name. He then said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the (forbidden)  town (Mecca)?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He asked, &#8220;What is the day today?&#8221;  We said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know (it) better. Then he kept quiet so long that we  thought that he might call it by another name. Then he said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the Day of  An-Nahr (slaughtering of sacrifices)?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then he said,  &#8220;Your blood (lives), your properties,&#8221; (the sub narrator Muhammad, said: I think  he also said): &#8220;..and your honor) are as sacred to one another like the sanctity of  this Day of yours, in this town of yours, in this month of yours. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>You shall meet your Lord and He will ask you about your  deeds. Beware! Don&#8217;t go astray after me by striking the necks of one another. Lo! It is  incumbent upon those who are present to inform it to those who are absent for perhaps the  informed one might comprehend it (understand it) better than some of the present  audience.&#8221; Whenever the sub-narrator Muhammad mentioned that statement, he would say,  &#8220;The Prophet said the truth.&#8221;) And then the Prophet added, &#8220;No doubt!  Haven&#8217;t I conveyed Allah&#8217;s Message to you! No doubt! Haven&#8217;t I conveyed Allah&#8217;s Message to  you?&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ud: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle the true and truly inspired, narrated to  us, &#8220;The creation of everyone of you starts with the process of collecting the  material for his body within forty days and forty nights in the womb of his mother. Then  he becomes a clot of thick blood for a similar period (40 days) and then he becomes like a  piece of flesh for a similar period. Then an angel is sent to him (by Allah) and the angel  is allowed (ordered) to write four things; his livelihood, his (date of) death, his deeds,  and whether he will be a wretched one or a blessed one (in the Hereafter) and then the  soul is breathed into him. So one of you may do (good) deeds characteristic of the people  of Paradise so much that there is nothing except a cubit between him and Paradise but then  what has been written for him decides his behavior and he starts doing (evil) deeds  characteristic of the people of Hell (Fire) and (ultimately) enters Hell (Fire); and one  of you may do (evil) deeds characteristic of the people of Hell (Fire) so much so that  there is nothing except a cubit between him and Hell (Fire), then what has been written  for him decides his behavior and he starts doing (good) deeds characteristic of the people  of Paradise and ultimately) enters Paradise.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 430, Vol. 4) </font></p>

To Him belongs what is before us and what is  behind us..&#8217; (19.64) So this was the answer to Muhammad. </font></p>

The people  of the Torah were given the Torah and they acted upon it till midday, and then they were  worn out and were given for their labor, one Qirat each. Then the people of the Gospel  were given the Gospel and they acted upon it till the time of the &#8216;Asr prayer, and then  they were worn out and were given (for their labor), one Qirat each. Then you people were  given the Quran and you acted upon it till sunset and so you were given two Qirats each  (double the reward of the previous nations).&#8221; Then the people of the Torah said, &#8216;O  our Lord! These people have done a little labor (much less than we) but have taken a  greater reward.&#8217; Allah said, &#8216;Have I withheld anything from your reward?&#8217; They said, &#8216;No.&#8217;  Then Allah said, &#8216;That is My Favor which I bestow on whom I wish.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Yes, Our Slave Khadir is more learned than you&#8217; Moses  asked Allah how to meet him ( Khadir) So Allah made the fish as a sign for him and it was  said to him, &#8216;When you lose the fish, go back (to the place where you lose it) and you  will meet him.&#8217; So Moses went on looking for the sign of the fish in the sea. The boy  servant of Moses (who was accompanying him) said to him, &#8216;Do you remember (what happened)  when we betook ourselves to the rock? I did indeed forget to tell you (about) the fish.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;That is what we have been seeking.&#8221; Sa they went back  retracing their footsteps. (18.64). So they both found Kadir (there) and then happened  what Allah mentioned about them (in the Quran)!&#8217; (See 18.60-82) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Neither say your prayer aloud, nor say it in a low tone.&#8217;  (17.110) That is, &#8216;Do not say your prayer so loudly that the pagans can hear you, nor say  it in such a low tone that your companions do not hear you.&#8217; But seek a middle course  between those (extremes), i.e., let your companions hear, but do not relate the Qur&#8217;an  loudly, so that they may learn it from you. </font></p>

It will be said, &#8216;O,  Muhammad, raise your head and speak, for you will be listened to, and ask, for you will be  granted (your request); and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.&#8217; I will  say, &#8216;O Lord, my followers!&#8217; Then He will say, &#8216;Go and take out (all those) in whose  hearts there is faith even to the lightest, lightest mustard seed. (Take them) out of the  Fire.&#8217; I will go and do so.&#8221;&#8216; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When we left Anas, I said to some of my companions,  &#8220;Let&#8217;s pass by Al-Hasan who is hiding himself in the house of Abi Khalifa and request  him to tell us what Anas bin Malik has told us.&#8221; So we went to him and we greeted him  and he admitted us. We said to him, &#8220;O Abu Said! We came to you from your brother  Anas Bin Malik and he related to us a Hadith about the intercession the like of which I  have never heard.&#8221; He said, &#8220;What is that?&#8221; Then we told him of the Hadith  and said, &#8220;He stopped at this point (of the Hadith).&#8221; He said, &#8220;What  then?&#8221; We said, &#8220;He did not add anything to that.&#8221; He said, Anas related  the Hadith to me twenty years ago when he was a young fellow. I don&#8217;t know whether he  forgot or if he did not like to let you depend on what he might have said.&#8221; We said,  &#8220;O Abu Said ! Let us know that.&#8221; He smiled and said, &#8220;Man was created  hasty. I did not mention that, but that I wanted to inform you of it. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Anas told me the same as he told you and said that the  Prophet added, &#8216;I then return for a fourth time and praise Him similarly and prostrate  before Him me the same as he &#8216;O Muhammad, raise your head and speak, for you will be  listened to; and ask, for you will be granted (your request): and intercede, for your  intercession will be accepted .&#8217; I will say, &#8216;O Lord, allow me to intercede for whoever  said, &#8216;None has the right to be worshiped except Allah.&#8217; Then Allah will say, &#8216;By my  Power, and my Majesty, and by My Supremacy, and by My Greatness, I will take out of Hell  (Fire) whoever said: &#8216;None has the right to be worshipped except Allah.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

I am the King!'&#8221; I  saw the Prophet smiling till his premolar teeth became visible expressing his amazement  and his belief in what he had said.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The night Allah&#8217;s Apostle was taken for a journey from the  sacred mosque (of Mecca) Al-Ka&#8217;ba: Three persons came to him (in a dreamy while he was  sleeping in the Sacred Mosque before the Divine Inspiration was revealed to Him. One of  them said, &#8220;Which of them is he?&#8221; The middle (second) angel said, &#8220;He is  the best of them.&#8221; The last (third) angle said, &#8220;Take the best of them.&#8221;  Only that much happened on that night and he did not see them till they came on another  night, i.e. after The Divine Inspiration was revealed to him. (Fateh-Al-Bari Page 258,  Vol. 17) and he saw them, his eyes were asleep but his heart was not&#8212;-and so is the case  with the prophets: their eyes sleep while their hearts do not sleep. So those angels did  not talk to him till they carried him and placed him beside the well of Zam-Zam. From  among them Gabriel took charge of him. Gabriel cut open (the part of his body) between his  throat and the middle of his chest (heart) and took all the material out of his chest and  abdomen and then washed it with Zam-Zam water with his own hands till he cleansed the  inside of his body, and then a gold tray containing a gold bowl full of belief and wisdom  was brought and then Gabriel stuffed his chest and throat blood vessels with it and then  closed it (the chest). He then ascended with him to the heaven of the world and knocked on  one of its doors. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The dwellers of the Heaven asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; He said,  &#8220;Gabriel.&#8221; They said, &#8220;Who is accompanying you?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Muhammad.&#8221; They said, &#8220;Has he been called?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes&#8221;  They said, &#8220;He is welcomed.&#8221; So the dwellers of the Heaven became pleased with  his arrival, and they did not know what Allah would do to the Prophet on earth unless  Allah informed them. The Prophet met Adam over the nearest Heaven. Gabriel said to the  Prophet, &#8220;He is your father; greet him.&#8221; The Prophet greeted him and Adam  returned his greeting and said, &#8220;Welcome, O my Son! O what a good son you are!&#8221;  Behold, he saw two flowing rivers, while he was in the nearest sky. He asked, &#8220;What  are these two rivers, O Gabriel?&#8221; Gabriel said, &#8220;These are the sources of the  Nile and the Euphrates.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then Gabriel took him around that Heaven and behold, he saw  another river at the bank of which there was a palace built of pearls and emerald. He put  his hand into the river and found its mud like musk Adhfar. He asked, &#8220;What is this,  O Gabriel?&#8221; Gabriel said, &#8220;This is the Kauthar which your Lord has kept for  you.&#8221; Then Gabriel ascended (with him) to the second Heaven and the angels asked the  same questions as those on the first Heaven, i.e., &#8220;Who is it?&#8221; Gabriel replied,  &#8220;Gabriel&#8221;. They asked, &#8220;Who is accompanying you?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Muhammad.&#8221; They asked, &#8220;Has he been sent for?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then they said, &#8220;He is welcomed.&#8221; Then he (Gabriel) ascended with  the Prophet to the third Heaven, and the angels said the same as the angels of the first  and the second Heavens had said. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then he ascended with him to the fourth Heaven and they  said the same; and then he ascended with him to the fifth Heaven and they said the same;  and then he ascended with him to the sixth Heaven and they said the same; then he ascended  with him to the seventh Heaven and they said the same. On each Heaven there were prophets  whose names he had mentioned and of whom I remember Idris on the second Heaven, Aaron on  the fourth Heavens another prophet whose name I don&#8217;t remember, on the fifth Heaven,  Abraham on the sixth Heaven, and Moses on the seventh Heaven because of his privilege of  talking to Allah directly. Moses said (to Allah), &#8220;O Lord! I thought that none would  be raised up above me.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>But Gabriel ascended with him (the Prophet) for a distance  above that, the distance of which only Allah knows, till he reached the Lote Tree (beyond  which none may pass) and then the Irresistible, the Lord of Honor and Majesty approached  and came closer till he (Gabriel) was about two bow lengths or (even) nearer. (It is said  that it was Gabriel who approached and came closer to the Prophet. (Fate Al-Bari Page 263,  264, Vol. 17). Among the things which Allah revealed to him then, was: &#8220;Fifty prayers  were enjoined on his followers in a day and a night.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then the Prophet descended till he met Moses, and then  Moses stopped him and asked, &#8220;O Muhammad ! What did your Lord en join upon you?&#8221;  The Prophet replied,&#8221; He enjoined upon me to perform fifty prayers in a day and a  night.&#8221; Moses said, &#8220;Your followers cannot do that; Go back so that your Lord  may reduce it for you and for them.&#8221; So the Prophet turned to Gabriel as if he wanted  to consult him about that issue. Gabriel told him of his opinion, saying, &#8220;Yes, if  you wish.&#8221; So Gabriel ascended with him to the Irresistible and said while he was in  his place, &#8220;O Lord, please lighten our burden as my followers cannot do that.&#8221;  So Allah deducted for him ten prayers where upon he returned to Moses who stopped him  again and kept on sending him back to his Lord till the enjoined prayers were reduced to  only five prayers. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then Moses stopped him when the prayers had been reduced to  five and said, &#8220;O Muhammad! By Allah, I tried to persuade my nation, Bani Israel to  do less than this, but they could not do it and gave it up. However, your followers are  weaker in body, heart, sight and hearing, so return to your Lord so that He may lighten  your burden.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet turned towards Gabriel for advice and Gabriel  did not disapprove of that. So he ascended with him for the fifth time. The Prophet said,  &#8220;O Lord, my followers are weak in their bodies, hearts, hearing and constitution, so  lighten our burden.&#8221; On that the Irresistible said, &#8220;O Muhammad!&#8221; the  Prophet replied, &#8220;Labbaik and Sa&#8217;daik.&#8221; Allah said, &#8220;The Word that comes  from Me does not change, so it will be as I enjoined on you in the Mother of the  Book.&#8221; Allah added, &#8220;Every good deed will be rewarded as ten times so it is  fifty (prayers) in the Mother of the Book (in reward) but you are to perform only five (in  practice).&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet returned to Moses who asked, &#8220;What have  you done?&#8221; He said, &#8220;He has lightened our burden: He has given us for every good  deed a tenfold reward.&#8221; Moses said, &#8220;By Allah! I tried to make Bani Israel  observe less than that, but they gave it up. So go back to your Lord that He may lighten  your burden further.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Moses! By Allah, I feel shy of  returning too many times to my Lord.&#8221; On that Gabriel said, &#8220;Descend in Allah&#8217;s  Name.&#8221; The Prophet then woke while he was in the Sacred Mosque (at Mecca). </font></p>

What else could be better than  that?&#8217; He will say, &#8216;I bestow My Pleasure on you and will never be angry with you after  that.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

On that Allah will say (to him),  &#8220;Take, here you are, O son of Adam, for nothing satisfies you.&#8217; &#8220;On that the  bedouin said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Such man must be either from Quraish or from Ansar,  for they are farmers while we are not.&#8221; On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle smiled . </font></p>

Allah has told you that the people of the Scriptures have changed some of  Allah&#8217;s Books and distorted it and wrote something with their own hands and said, &#8216;This is  from Allah, so as to have a minor gain for it. Won&#8217;t the knowledge that has come to you  stop you from asking them? No, by Allah, we have never seen a man from them asking you  about that (the Book Al-Qur&#8217;an ) which has been revealed to you. </font></p>

He said, &#8220;The Prophet used to undergo great difficulty in receiving the  Divine Inspiration and used to move his lips.&#8217; Ibn &#8216;Abbas said (to Sa&#8217;id), &#8220;I move  them (my lips) as Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to move his lips.&#8221; And Said said (to me),  &#8220;I move my lips as I saw Ibn &#8216;Abbas moving his lips,&#8221; and then he moved his  lips. So Allah revealed:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;(O Muhammad!) Do not move your tongue concerning (the  Qur&#8217;an) to make haste therewith. It is for Us to collect it and give you (O Muhammad) the  ability to recite it. (i.e., to collect it in your chest and then you recite it).&#8217;  (75.16-17) But when We have recited it, to you (O Muhammad through Gabriel) then follow  you its recital.&#8217; (75.18) This means, &#8220;You should listen to it and keep quiet and  then it is upon Us to make you recite it.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The narrator added, &#8220;So Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to listen  whenever Gabriel came to him, and when Gabriel left, the Prophet would recite the Qur&#8217;an  as Gabriel had recited it to him.&#8221; </font></p>

The people of the Torah were given  the Torah and they acted on it till midday and then they were unable to carry on. And they  were given (a reward equal to) one Qirat each.

Once, while we were sitting with Abu Musa Al-Ash&#8217;ari,  there was brought to him a meal which contained chicken meat, and there was sitting beside  him, a man from the tribe of Bani Taimul-lah who looked like one of the Mawali. Abu Musa  invited the man to eat but the man said, &#8220;I have seen chicken eating some dirty  things, and I have taken an oath not to eat chicken.&#8221; Abu Musa said to him,  &#8220;Come along, let me tell you something in this regard. Once I went to the Prophet  with a few men from Ash&#8217;ariyyin and we asked him for mounts. The Prophet said, By Allah, I  will not mount you on anything; besides I do not have anything to mount you on.&#8217; Then a  few camels from the war booty were brought to the Prophet, and he asked about us, saying,  &#8216;Where are the group of Ash&#8217;ariyyin?&#8217; So he ordered for five fat camels to be given to us  and then we set out. We said, &#8216;What have we done? Allah&#8217;s Apostle took an oath that he  would not give us anything to ride and that he had nothing for us to ride, yet he provided  us with mounts. We made Allah&#8217;s Apostle forget his oath! By Allah, we will never be  successful.&#8217; So we returned to him and reminded him of his oath. He said, &#8216;I have not  provided you with the mount, but Allah has done so. By Allah, I may take an oath to do  something, but on finding something else which is better, I do that which is better and  make the expiation for my oath.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;Allah said, &#8216;Who are most  unjust than those who try to create something like My creation? I challenge them to create  even a smallest ant, a wheat grain or a barley grain.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Musa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8216;The example of a believer who recites  the Qur&#8217;an is that of a citron (a citrus fruit) which is good in taste and good in smell.  And the believer who does not recite the Quran is like a date which has a good taste but  no smell. And the example of an impious person who recites the Qur&#8217;an is that of Ar-Rihana  (an aromatic plant) which smells good but is bitter in taste. And the example of an  impious person who does not recite the Quran is that of a colocynth which is bitter in  taste and has no smell.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Some people asked the Prophet regarding the soothsayers. He  said, &#8220;They are nothing.&#8221; They said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Some of their  talks come true.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;That word which happens to be true is what  a Jinn snatches away by stealth (from the Heaven) and pours it in the ears of his friend  (the foreteller) with a sound like the cackling of a hen. The soothsayers then mix with  that word, one hundred lies.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;There will emerge from the East  some people who will recite the Qur&#8217;an but it will not exceed their throats and who will  go out of (renounce) the religion (Islam) as an arrow passes through the game, and they  will never come back to it unless the arrow, comes back to the middle of the bow (by  itself) (i.e., impossible). The people asked, &#8220;What will their signs be?&#8221; He  said, &#8220;Their sign will be the habit of shaving (of their beards). (Fateh Al-Bari,  Page 322, Vol. 17th) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;(There are) two words which are  dear to the Beneficent (Allah) and very light (easy) for the tongue (to say), but very  heavy in weight in the balance. They are: &#8216;Subhan Allah wa-bi hamdihi&#8217; and &#8216;Subhan Allah  Al-&#8216;Azim.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 673, Vol. 8). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We came to the Prophet and we were young men nearly of  equal ages and we stayed with him for twenty nights. Allah&#8217;s Apostle was a very kind man  and when he realized our longing for our families, he asked us about those whom we had  left behind. When we informed him, he said, &#8220;Go back to your families and stay with  them and teach them (religion) and order them (to do good deeds). The Prophet mentioned  things some of which I remembered and some I did not. Then he said, &#8220;Pray as you have  seen me praying, and when it is the time of prayer, one of you should pronounce the call  (Adhan) for the prayer and the eldest of you should lead the prayer. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 91, Number 353: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Mas&#8217;ud: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The (call for prayer) Adhan of  Bilal should not stop anyone of you from taking his Suhur for he pronounces the Adhan in  order that whoever among you is praying the night prayer, may return (to eat his Suhur)  and whoever among you is sleeping, may get up, for it is not yet dawn (when it is like  this).&#8221; (Yahya, the sub-narrator stretched his two index fingers side ways). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Bilal pronounces the Adhan at night  so that you may eat and drink till Ibn Um Maktum pronounces the Adhan (for the Fajr  prayer).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 91, Number 355: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet led us in Zuhr prayer and prayer five Rakat.  Somebody asked him whether the prayer had been increased.&#8221; He (the Prophet ) said,  &#8220;And what is that?&#8221; They (the people) replied, &#8220;You have prayed five  Rakat.&#8221; Then the Prophet offered two prostrations (of Sahu) after he had finished his  prayer with the Taslim. </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.091.356"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 91, Number 356: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle finished his prayer after offerings two  Rakat only. Dhul-Yaddain asked him whether the prayer had been reduced, or you had  forgotten?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Is Dhul-Yaddain speaking the truth?&#8221; The  people said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up and performed another two  Rakat and then finished prayer with Taslim, and then said the Takbir and performed a  prostration similar to or longer than his ordinary prostrations; then he raised his head,  said Takbir and prostrated and then raised his head (Sahu prostrations). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 91, Number 357: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While the people were at Quba offering the morning prayer,  suddenly a person came to them saying, &#8220;Tonight Divine Inspiration has been revealed  to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and he has been ordered to face the Ka&#8217;ba (in prayers): therefore you  people should face it.&#8221; There faces were towards Sham, so they turned their faces  towards the Ka&#8217;ba (at Mecca). </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.091.358"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 91, Number 358: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara&#8217;: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah&#8217;s Apostle arrived at Medina, he prayed facing  Jerusalem for sixteen or seventeen months but he wished that he would be ordered to face  the Ka&#8217;ba. So Allah revealed: &#8212; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Verily! We have seen the turning of your face towards the  heaven; surely we shall turn you to a prayer direction (Qibla) that shall please you.&#8217;  (2.144) Thus he was directed towards the Ka&#8217;ba. A man prayed the &#8216;Asr prayer with the  Prophet and then went out, and passing by some people from the Ansar, he said, &#8220;I  testify. that I have prayed with the Prophet and he (the Prophet) has prayed facing the  Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; Thereupon they, who were bowing in the &#8216;Asr prayer, turned towards the Ka&#8217;ba.  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 91, Number 359: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I used to offer drinks prepared from infused dates to Abu  Talha Al-Ansari, Abu &#8216;Ubada bin Al Jarrah and Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b. Then a person came to them  and said, &#8220;All alcoholic drinks have been prohibited.&#8221; Abii Talha then said,  &#8220;O Anas! Get up and break all these jars.&#8221; So I got up and took a mortar  belonging to us, and hit the jars with its lower part till they broke. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 91, Number 360: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Hudhaifa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said to the people of Najran, &#8220;I will send  to you an honest person who is really trustworthy.&#8221; The Companion, of the Prophet  each desired to be that person, but the Prophet sent Abu &#8216;Ubaida. </font></p>

O  people! Neither you will have any disgrace nor will you regret.&#8221; They said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Between you and us there are the infidels of the tribe of Mudar, so  please order us to do something good (religious deeds) that by acting on them we may enter  Paradise, and that we may inform (our people) whom we have left behind, about it.&#8221;  They also asked (the Prophet) about drinks. He forbade them from four things and ordered  them to do four things. He ordered them to believe in Allah, and asked them, &#8220;Do you  know what is meant by belief in Allah?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know  best.&#8221; He said, &#8221;To testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah,  the One, Who has no partners with Him, and that Muhammad is Allah&#8217;s Apostle; and to offer  prayers perfectly and to pay Zakat.&#8221; (the narrator thinks that fasting in Ramadan is  included), &#8220;and to give one-fifth of the war booty (to the state).&#8221; Then he  forbade four (drinking utensils): Ad-Duba&#8217;, Al-Hantam, Al-Mazaffat and An-Naqir, or  probably, Al-Muqaiyar. And then the Prophet said, &#8220;Remember all these things by heart  and preach it to those whom you have left behind.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sahl bin Sa&#8217;d As-Sa&#8217;idi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Uwaimir Al-&#8216;Ajlani came to &#8216;Asim bin &#8216;Adi and said, &#8220;If a man found another man with his wife and killed him, would you sentence the husband to death (in Qisas,) i.e., equality in punishment)? O &#8216;Asim! Please ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle about this matter on my behalf.&#8221; &#8216;Asim asked the Prophet but the Prophet disliked the question and disapproved of it. &#8216;Asim returned and informed &#8216;Uwaimir that the Prophet disliked that type of question. &#8216;Uwaimir said, &#8220;By Allah, I will go (personally) to the Prophet.&#8221; &#8216;Uwaimir came to the Prophet when Allah had already revealed Qur&#8217;anic Verses (in that respect), after &#8216;Asim had left (the Prophet ). So the Prophet said to &#8216;Uwaimir, &#8220;Allah has revealed Qur&#8217;anic Verses regarding you and your wife.&#8221; The Prophet then called for them, and they came and carried out the order of Lian.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then &#8216;Uwaimir said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Now if I kept her with me, I would be accused of telling a lie.&#8221; So &#8216;Uwaimir divorced her although the Prophet did not order him to do so. Later on this practice of divorcing became the tradition of couples involved in a case of Li&#8217;an. The Prophet said (to the people). &#8220;Wait for her! If she delivers a red short (small) child like a Wahra (a short red animal). then I will be of the opinion that he (&#8216;Uwaimir) has told a lie but if she delivered a black big-eyed one with big buttocks, then I will be of the opinion that he has told the truth about her.&#8221; &#8216;Ultimately she gave birth to a child that proved the accusation.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 408:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Malik bin Aus An-Nasri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I proceeded till I entered upon &#8216;Umar (and while I was sitting there), his gate-keeper Yarfa came to him and said, &#8221; &#8216;Uthman, &#8216;Abdur-Rahman, Az-Zubair and Sa&#8217;d ask your permission to come in.&#8221; &#8216;Umar allowed them. So they entered, greeted, and sat down. (After a while the gatekeeper came) and said, &#8220;Shall I admit &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas?&#8221; &#8216;Umar allowed them to enter. Al-&#8216;Abbas said &#8220;O Chief of the believers! Judge between me and the oppressor (&#8216;Ali).&#8221; Then there was a dispute (regarding the property of Bani Nadir) between them (&#8216;Abbas and &#8216;Ali). &#8216;Uthman and his companions said, &#8220;O Chief of the Believers! Judge between them and relieve one from the other.&#8221; Umar said, &#8220;Be patient! beseech you by Allah, with Whose permission the Heaven and the Earth Exist! Do you know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Our property is not to be inherited, and whatever we leave is to be given in charity,&#8217; and by this Allah&#8217;s Apostle meant himself?&#8221; On that the group said, &#8220;He verily said so.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then faced &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas and said, &#8220;I beseech you both by Allah, do you both know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said so?&#8221; They both replied, &#8220;Yes&#8221;. &#8216;Umar then said, &#8220;Now I am talking to you about this matter (in detail) . Allah favored Allah&#8217;s Apostle with some of this wealth which He did not give to anybody else, as Allah said: &#8216;What Allah bestowed as Fai (Booty on His Apostle for which you made no expedition&#8230; &#8216; (59.6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So that property was totally meant for Allah&#8217;s Apostle, yet he did not collect it and ignore you, nor did he withhold it with your exclusion, but he gave it to you and distributed it among you till this much of it was left behind, and the Prophet, used to spend of this as the yearly expenditures of his family and then take what remained of it and spent it as he did with (other) Allah&#8217;s wealth. The Prophet did so during all his lifetime, and I beseech you by Allah, do you know that?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then addressed &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas, saying, &#8220;I beseech you both by Allah, do you know that?&#8221; Both of them replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;Then Allah took His Apostle unto Him. Abu Bakr then said &#8216;I am the successor of Allah&#8217;s Apostle&#8217; and took over all the Prophet&#8217;s property and disposed of it in the same way as Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to do, and you were present then.&#8221; Then he turned to &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas and said, &#8220;You both claim that Abu Bakr did so-and-so in managing the property, but Allah knows that Abu Bakr was honest, righteous, intelligent, and a follower of what is right in managing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah took Abu Bakr unto Him, &#8216;I said: I am the successor of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr.&#8217; So I took over the property for two years and managed it in the same way as Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and Abu Bakr used to do. Then you both (&#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas) came to me and asked for the same thing! (O &#8216;Abbas! You came to me to ask me for your share from nephew&#8217;s property; and this (&#8216;Ali) came to me asking for his wives share from her father&#8217;s property, and I said to you both, &#8216;If you wish, I will place it in your custody on condition that you both will manage it in the same way as Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr did and as I have been doing since I took charge of managing it; otherwise, do not speak to me anymore about it.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then you both said, &#8216;Give it to us on that (condition).&#8217; So I gave it to you on that condition. Now I beseech you by Allah, did I not give it to them on that condition?&#8221; The group (whom he had been addressing) replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then addressed &#8216;Abbas and &#8216;Ali saying, &#8220;I beseech you both by Allah, didn&#8217;t I give you all that property on that condition?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then said, &#8220;Are you now seeking a verdict from me other than that? By Him with Whose Permission the Heaven and the Earth exists I will not give any verdict other than that till the Hour is established; and if you both are unable to manage this property, then you can hand it back to me, and I will be sufficient for it on your behalf.&#8221; (See, Hadith No. 326, Vol. 4)</p>

Blame your personal opinions in your religion. No doubt, I remember myself on the day of Abi Jandal; if I had the power to refuse the order of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, I would have refused it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Huraira said, &#8220;You people claim that Abu Huraira narrates many narrations of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. (Anyhow) with Allah will be our appointment. I was a poor man, and used to stick to Allah&#8217;s Apostle contented with what will fill my stomach, and the Muhajirin (emigrants) used to be busy trading in the markets, and the Ansar used to be busy looking after their properties. One-day I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;Who will spread his Rida&#8217; (a garment covering the upper part of the body) till I finished my speech and then fold it, (i.e. wrap it over your body), in which case he will never forget anything he had heard from me.&#8221; So I spread my garment which I was wearing; and by Him Who sent Muhammad with the Truth, ever since, I have never forgotten whatever I heard from him (the Prophet)&#8221; (See, Hadith No. 119, Vol. 1)</p>

I said to Jabir, &#8220;How can you swear by Allah?&#8221; Jabir said, &#8220;I have heard &#8216;Umar swearing by Allah regarding this matter in the presence of the Prophet and the Prophet did not disapprove of it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 92, Number 454:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Horses may be used for three purposes: For a man they may be a source of reward (in the Hereafter); for another, a means of protection; and for another, a source of sin. The man for whom they are a source of reward, is the one who keeps them for Allah&#8217;s Cause and ties them with long ropes and lets them graze in a pasture or garden. Whatever those long ropes allow them to eat of that pasture or garden, will be written as good deeds for him and if they break their ropes and run one or two rounds, then all their footsteps and dung will be written as good deeds for him, and if they pass a river and drink from it though he has had no intention of watering them, even then, that will be written as good deeds for him. So such horses are a source of reward for that man. For the man who keeps horses for his livelihood in order not to ask others for help or beg his bread, and at the same time he does not forget Allah&#8217;s right of what he earns through them and of their backs (that he presents it to be used in Allah&#8217;s Cause), such horses are a shelter for him (from poverty). For the man who keeps them just out of pride and for showing off, they are a source of sin.&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle was asked about donkeys. He said, &#8220;Allah has not revealed anything to me regarding them except this comprehensive Verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Then anyone who has done good, equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant) shall see it, and any one who has done evil, equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant) shall see it.&#8221; (99.7-8)</p>

The Prophet then asked for a meal (mastigures etc. to be put) and it was eaten over his table cloth, but the Prophet did not eat of it, as he had aversion to it. But if it had been illegal to eat, it would not have been eaten over his table cloth nor would he have ordered that (mastigures meat) to be eaten</p>

Detecting a bad smell from it, he asked about the dish and was informed of the kinds of vegetables in contained. He then said, &#8220;Bring it near,&#8221; and so it was brought near to one of his companions who was with him. When the Prophet saw it, he disliked eating it and said (to his companion), &#8220;Eat, for I talk in secret to ones whom you do not talk to.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ubaidullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Why do you ask the people of the scripture about anything while your Book (Quran) which has been revealed to Allah&#8217;s Apostle is newer and the latest? You read it pure, undistorted and unchanged, and Allah has told you that the people of the scripture (Jews and Christians) changed their scripture and distorted it, and wrote the scripture with their own hands and said, &#8216;It is from Allah,&#8217; to sell it for a little gain. Does not the knowledge which has come to you prevent you from asking them about anything? No, by Allah, we have never seen any man from them asking you regarding what has been revealed to you!&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">After the slanderers had given a forged statement against her, Allah&#8217;s Apostle called &#8216;Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration was delayed. He wanted to ask them and consult them about the question of divorcing me. Usama gave his evidence that was based on what he knew about my innocence, but &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;Allah has not put restrictions on you and there are many women other than her. Furthermore you may ask the slave girl who will tell you the truth.&#8221; So the Prophet asked Barira (my salve girl), &#8220;Have you seen anything that may arouse your suspicion?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;I have not seen anything more than that she is a little girl who sleeps, leaving the dough of her family (unguarded) that the domestic goats come and eat it.&#8221; Then the Prophet stood on the pulpit and said, &#8220;O Muslims! Who will help me against the man who has harmed me by slandering my wife? By Allah, I know nothing about my family except good.&#8221; The narrator added: Then the Prophet mentioned the innocence of &#8216;Aisha. (See Hadith No. 274, Vol. 6)</p>

Will you allow me to go to my parents&#8217; home?&#8221; He allowed her and sent a slave along with her. An Ansari man said, &#8220;Subhanaka! It is not right for us to speak about this. Subhanaka!

<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah in a gathering saying, &#8220;We, the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle assumed the state of Ihram to perform only Hajj without &#8216;Umra.&#8221; Jabir added, &#8220;The Prophet arrived (at Mecca) on the fourth of Dhul-Hijja. And when we arrived (in Mecca) the Prophet ordered us to finish the state of Ihram, saying, &#8220;Finish your lhram and go to your wives (for sexual relation).&#8221; Jabir added, &#8220;The Prophet did not oblige us (to go to our wives) but he only made that legal for us. Then he heard that we were saying, &#8220;When there remains only five days between us and the Day of Arafat he orders us to finish our Ihram by sleeping with our wives in which case we will proceed to &#8216;Arafat with our male organs dribbling with semen?&#8217; (Jabir pointed out with his hand illustrating what he was saying). Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up and said, &#8216;You (People) know that I am the most Allah-fearing, the most truthful and the best doer of good deeds (pious) from among you. If I had not brought the Hadi with me, I would have finished my Ihram as you will do, so finish your Ihram. If I had formerly known what I came to know lately, I would not have brought the Hadi with me.&#8217; So we finished our Ihram and listened to the Prophet and obeyed him.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 713, Vol. 2)</p>

Some of them said, &#8220;Come near so that Allah&#8217;s Apostle may write for you a writing after which you will not go astray,&#8221; while some of them said what &#8216;Umar said. When they made much noise and differed greatly before the Prophet, he said to them, &#8220;Go away and leave me.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas used to say, &#8220;It was a great disaster that their difference and noise prevented Allah&#8217;s Apostle from writing that writing for them.</p>

<h3 align="center">Good Manners and Form (Al-Adab)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.073.001"></a>Volume 8, Book 73, Number 1:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Walid bin &#8216;Aizar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Abi Amr &#8216;Ash-Shaibani saying, &#8220;The owner of this house.&#8221; he pointed to &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s house, &#8220;said, &#8216;I asked the Prophet &#8216;Which deed is loved most by Allah?&#8221; He replied, &#8216;To offer prayers at their early (very first) stated times.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Abdullah asked, &#8220;What is the next (in goodness)?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;To be good and dutiful to one&#8217;s parents,&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah asked, &#8220;What is the next (in goodness)?&#8221; The Prophet said, To participate in Jihad for Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah added, &#8220;The Prophet narrated to me these three things, and if I had asked more, he would have told me more.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 2:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Who is more entitled to be treated with the best companionship by me?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Your mother.&#8221; The man said. &#8220;Who is next?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Your mother.&#8221; The man further said, &#8220;Who is next?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Your mother.&#8221; The man asked for the fourth time, &#8220;Who is next?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Your father. &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 3:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man said to the Prophet, &#8220;Shall I participate in Jihad?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Are your parents living?&#8221; The man said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; the Prophet said, &#8220;Do Jihad for their benefit.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 4:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said. &#8220;It is one of the greatest sins that a man should curse his parents.&#8221; It was asked (by the people), &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! How does a man curse his parents?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;&#8216;The man abuses the father of another man and the latter abuses the father of the former and abuses his mother.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 5:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;While three persons were traveling, they were overtaken by rain and they took shelter in a cave in a mountain. A big rock fell from the mountain over the mouth of the cave and blocked it. They said to each other. &#8216;Think of such good (righteous) deeds which, you did for Allah&#8217;s sake only, and invoke Allah by giving reference to those deeds so that Allah may relieve you from your difficulty. one of them said, &#8216;O Allah! I had my parents who were very old and I had small children for whose sake I used to work as a shepherd. When I returned to them at night and milked (the sheep), I used to start giving the milk to my parents first before giving to my children. And one day I went far away in search of a grazing place (for my sheep), and didn&#8217;t return home till late at night and found that my parents had slept. I milked (my livestock) as usual and brought the milk vessel and stood at their heads, and I disliked to wake them up from their sleep, and I also disliked to give the milk to my children before my parents though my children were crying (from hunger) at my feet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this state of mine and theirs continued till the day dawned. (O Allah!) If you considered that I had done that only for seeking Your pleasure, then please let there be an opening through which we can see the sky.&#8217; So Allah made for them an opening through which they could see the sky. Then the second person said, &#8216;O Allah! I had a she-cousin whom I loved as much as a passionate man love a woman. I tried to seduce her but she refused till I paid her one-hundred Dinars So I worked hard till I collected one hundred Dinars and went to her with that But when I sat in between her legs (to have sexual intercourse with her), she said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s slave! Be afraid of Allah ! Do not deflower me except legally (by marriage contract). So I left her O Allah! If you considered that I had done that only for seeking Your pleasure then please let the rock move a little to have a (wider) opening.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allah shifted that rock to make the opening wider for them. And the last (third) person said &#8216;O Allah ! I employed a laborer for wages equal to a Faraq (a certain measure: of rice, and when he had finished his job he demanded his wages, but when I presented his due to him, he gave it up and refused to take it. Then I kept on sowing that rice for him (several times) till managed to buy with the price of the yield, some cows and their shepherd Later on the laborer came to me an said. &#8216;(O Allah&#8217;s slave!) Be afraid o Allah, and do not be unjust to me an give me my due.&#8217; I said (to him). &#8216;Go and take those cows and their shepherd. So he took them and went away. (So, O Allah!) If You considered that I had done that for seeking Your pleasure, then please remove the remaining part of the rock.&#8217; And so Allah released them (from their difficulty).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 6:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Mughira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah has forbidden you ( 1 ) to be undutiful to your mothers (2) to withhold (what you should give) or (3) demand (what you do not deserve), and (4) to bury your daughters alive. And Allah has disliked that (A) you talk too much about others ( B), ask too many questions (in religion), or (C) waste your property.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 7:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said thrice, &#8220;Shall I not inform you of the biggest of the great sins?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle&#8221; He said, &#8220;To join partners in worship with Allah: to be undutiful to one&#8217;s parents.&#8221; The Prophet sat up after he had been reclining and added, &#8220;And I warn you against giving forged statement and a false witness; I warn you against giving a forged statement and a false witness.&#8221; The Prophet kept on saying that warning till we thought that he would not stop.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 8:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle mentioned the greatest sins or he was asked about the greatest sins. He said, &#8220;To join partners in worship with Allah; to kill a soul which Allah has forbidden to kill; and to be undutiful or unkind to one&#8217;s parents.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;Shall I inform you of the biggest of the great sins? That is the forged statement or the false witness.&#8221; Shu&#8217;ba (the sub-narrator) states that most probably the Prophet said, &#8220;the false witness.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 9:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Asma&#8217; bint Abu Bakr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My mother came to me, hoping (for my favor) during the lifetime of the Prophet asked the Prophet, &#8220;May I treat her kindly?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Uyaina said, &#8220;Then Allah revealed: &#8216;Allah forbids you not with regards to those who fought not against you because of religion, and drove you not out from your homes, that you should show them kindness and deal justly with them.&#8217;&#8230;&#8230;.(60.8)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 10:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Sufyan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That Heraclius sent for him and said, &#8220;What did he, i.e. the Prophet order you?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;He orders us to offer prayers; to give alms; to be chaste; and to keep good relations with our relatives.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 11:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My father, seeing a silken cloak being sold, said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Buy this and wear it on Fridays and when the foreign delegates pay a visit to you.&#8221; He said, &#8220;This is worn only by that person who will have no share in the Hereafter.&#8221; Later a few silken cloaks were given to the Prophet as a gift, and he sent one of those cloaks to &#8216;Umar. &#8216;Umar said (to the Prophet), &#8220;How can I wear it while you have said about it what you said?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I did not give it to you to wear but to sell or to give to someone else to wear.&#8221; So &#8216;Umar sent it to his (pagan) brother who was from the inhabitants of Mecca before he (&#8216;Umar&#8217;s brother) embraced Islam.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 12:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Aiyub Al-Ansari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Inform me of a deed which will make me enter Paradise.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;What is the matter with him? What is the matter with him?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;He has something to ask (what he needs greatly).&#8221; The Prophet said (to him), (In order to enter Paradise) you should worship Allah and join none in worship with Him: You should offer prayers perfectly, give obligatory charity (Zakat), and keep good relations with your Kith and kin.&#8221; He then said, &#8220;Leave it!&#8221; (The sub-narrator said, &#8220;It seems that the Prophet was riding his she camel.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 13:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jubair bin Mut&#8217;im:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That he heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;The person who severs the bond of kinship will not enter Paradise.&#8221;</p>
<hr>

When that person had left, &#8216;Aisha said (to the Prophet). &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! When you saw that man, you said so-and-so about him, then you showed him a kind and polite behavior, and you enjoyed his company?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O &#8216;Aisha! Have you ever seen me speaking a bad and dirty language?

An example of such disclosure is that a person commits a sin at night and though Allah screens it from the public, then he comes in the morning, and says, &#8216;O so-and-so, I did such-and-such (evil) deed yesterday,&#8217; though he spent his night screened by his Lord (none knowing about his sin) and in the morning he removes Allah&#8217;s screen from himself.&#8221;</p>

He will say, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Then Allah will say: Did you commit such and such sin? He will say, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; So Allah will make him confess (all his sins) and He will say, &#8216;I screened them (your sins) for you in the world, and today I forgive them for you.&#8221;&#8216;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) that she was told that &#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair (on hearing that she was selling or giving something as a gift) said, &#8220;By Allah, if &#8216;Aisha does not give up this, I will declare her incompetent to dispose of her wealth.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Did he (&#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair) say so?&#8221; They (people) said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;I vow to Allah that I will never speak to Ibn Az-Zubair.&#8221; When this desertion lasted long, &#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair sought intercession with her, but she said, &#8220;By Allah, I will not accept the intercession of anyone for him, and will not commit a sin by breaking my vow.&#8221; When this state of affairs was prolonged on Ibn Az-Zubair (he felt it hard on him), he said to Al-Miswar bin Makhrama and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Aswad bin &#8216;Abu Yaghuth, who were from the tribe of Bani Zahra, &#8220;I beseech you, by Allah, to let me enter upon &#8216;Aisha, for it is unlawful for her to vow to cut the relation with me.&#8221; So Al-Miswar and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman, wrapping their sheets around themselves, asked &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s permission saying, &#8220;Peace and Allah&#8217;s Mercy and Blessings be upon you! Shall we come in?&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;Come in.&#8221; They said, &#8220;All of us?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Yes, come in all of you,&#8221; not knowing that Ibn Az-Zubair was also with them. So when they entered, Ibn Az-Zubair entered the screened place and got hold of &#8216;Aisha and started requesting her to excuse him, and wept. Al-Miswar and &#8216;Abdur Rahman also started requesting her to speak to him and to accept his repentance. They said (to her), &#8220;The Prophet forbade what you know of deserting (not speaking to your Muslim Brethren), for it is unlawful for any Muslim not to talk to his brother for more than three nights (days).&#8221; So when they increased their reminding her (of the superiority of having good relation with Kith and kin, and of excusing others&#8217; sins), and brought her down to a critical situation, she started reminding them, and wept, saying, &#8220;I have made a vow, and (the question of) vow is a difficult one.&#8221; They (Al-Miswar and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman) persisted in their appeal till she spoke with &#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair and she manumitted forty slaves as an expiation for her vow. Later on, whenever she remembered her vow, she used to weep so much that her veil used to become wet with her tears.</p>

Why don&#8217;t you accept your meals of hospitality from us?&#8221; (He said to me), &#8220;Bring your meal.&#8221; I brought it to him, and he put his hand in it, saying, &#8220;In the name of Allah.

Abu Bakr said, &#8220;All that happened was from Satan.&#8221; So he asked for the meals and ate of it, and so did they. Whenever they took a handful of the meal, the meal grew (increased) from underneath more than that mouthful. He said (to his wife), &#8220;O, sister of Bani Firas!

The Prophet said, &#8220;Let the older (among you) speak first.&#8221; So they spoke about the case of their (murdered) friend. The Prophet said, &#8220;Will fifty of you take an oath whereby you will have the right to receive the blood money of your murdered man,&#8221; (or said, &#8220;..your companion&#8221;). They said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The murder was a thing we did not witness.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Then the Jews will release you from the oath, if fifty of them (the Jews) should take an oath to contradict your claim.&#8221; They said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! They are disbelievers (and they will take a false oath).&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle himself paid the blood money to them.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Inform me of a tree which resembles a Muslim, giving its fruits at every season by the permission of its Lord, and the leaves of which do not fall.&#8221; I thought of the date-palm tree, but I disliked to speak because Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar were present there. When nobody spoke, the Prophet said, &#8220;It is the date-palm tree&#8221; When I came out with my father, I said, &#8220;O father! It came to my mind that it was the date-palm tree.&#8221; He said, &#8220;What prevented you from saying it?&#8221; Had you said it, it would have been more dearer to me than such-and-such a thing (fortune).&#8221; I said, &#8220;Nothing prevented me but the fact that neither you nor Abu Bakr spoke, so I disliked to speak (in your presence).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 169:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salama bin Al-Aqwa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We went out with Allah&#8217;s Apostle to Khaibar and we travelled during the night. A man amongst the people said to &#8216;Amir bin Al-Aqwa&#8217;, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you let us hear your poetry?&#8221; &#8216;Amir was a poet, and so he got down and started (chanting Huda) reciting for the people, poetry that keep pace with the camel&#8217;s foot steps, saying, &#8220;O Allah! Without You we would not have been guided on the right path, neither would we have given in charity, nor would we have prayed. So please forgive us what we have committed. Let all of us be sacrificed for Your cause and when we meet our enemy, make our feet firm and bestow peace and calmness on us and if they (our enemy) will call us towards an unjust thing we will refuse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The infidels have made a hue and cry to ask others help against us. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Who is that driver (of the camels)?&#8221; They said, &#8220;He is &#8216;Amir bin Al-Aqwa.&#8221;&#8216; He said, &#8220;May Allah bestow His mercy on him.&#8221; A man among the people said, Has Martyrdom been granted to him, O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! Would that you let us enjoy his company longer.&#8221; We reached (the people of) Khaibar and besieged them till we were stricken with severe hunger but Allah helped the Muslims conquer Khaibar. In the evening of its conquest the people made many fires. Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked, &#8220;What are those fires? For what are you making fires?&#8221; They said, &#8220;For cooking meat.&#8221; He asked, &#8220;What kind of meat?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Donkeys&#8217; meat.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Throw away the meat and break the cooking pots.&#8221; A man said, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall we throw away the meat and wash the cooking pots?&#8221; He said, &#8220;You can do that too.&#8221; When the army files aligned in rows (for the battle), &#8216;Amir&#8217;s sword was a short one, and while attacking a Jew with it in order to hit him, the sharp edge of the sword turned back and hit &#8216;Amir&#8217;s knee and caused him to die.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Muslims returned (from the battle), Salama said, Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw me pale and said, &#8216;What is wrong with you?&#8221;&#8216; I said, &#8220;Let my parents be sacrificed for you! The people claim that all the deeds of Amir have been annulled.&#8221; The Prophet asked, &#8220;Who said so?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;So-and-so and so-and-so and Usaid bin Al-Hudair Al-Ansari said, &#8216;Whoever says so is telling a lie. Verily, &#8216;Amir will have double reward.&#8221;&#8216; (While speaking) the Prophet put two of his fingers together to indicate that, and added, &#8220;He was really a hard-working man and a Mujahid (devout fighter in Allah&#8217;s Cause) and rarely have there lived in it (i.e., Medina or the battle-field) an &#8220;Arab like him.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah&#8217;s Apostle entered the garden, he started hiding behind the trunks of the date-palms intending to hear something from Ibn Saiyad before the latter could see him. Ibn Saiyad was Lying on his bed, covered with a velvet sheet from where his mumur were heard. Ibn Saiyad&#8217;s mother saw the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Saf (the nickname of Ibn Saiyad)! Here is Muhammad!&#8221; Ibn Saiyad stopped his murmuring. The Prophet said, &#8220;If his mother had kept quiet, then I would have learnt more about him.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah added: Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up before the people (delivering a sermon), and after praising and glorifying Allah as He deserved, he mentioned the Ad-Dajjal saying, &#8220;I warn you against him, and there has been no prophet but warned his followers against him. Noah warned his followers against him but I am telling you about him, something which no prophet has told his people of, and that is: Know that he is blind in one eye where as Allah is not so.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 226:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Usama bin Zaid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That Allah&#8217;s Apostle rode over a donkey covered with a Fadakiya (velvet sheet) and Usama was riding behind him. He was visiting Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada (who was sick) in the dwelling place of Bani Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj and this incident happened before the battle of Badr. They proceeded till they passed by a gathering in which &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul was present., and that was before &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubat embraced Islam. In that gathering there were Muslims, pagan idolators and Jews, and among the Muslims there was &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a cloud of dust raised by (the movement of ) the animal covered that gathering, &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai covered his nose with his garment and said, &#8220;Do not cover us with dust.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle greeted them, stopped, dismounted and invited them to Allah (i.e. to embrace Islam) and recited to them the Holy Qur&#8217;an. On that &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul said to him, &#8220;O man! There is nothing better than what you say, if it is the truth. So do not trouble us with it in our gatherings, but if somebody comes to you, you can preach to him.&#8221; On that &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha said &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Call on us in our gathering, for we love that.&#8221; So the Muslims, the pagans and the Jews started abusing one another till they were about to fight with one another. Allah&#8217;s Apostle kept on quietening them till all of them became quiet, and then Allah&#8217;s Apostle rode his animal and proceeded till he entered upon Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Sa&#8217;d! Didn&#8217;t you hear what Abu Habab said?&#8221; (meaning &#8216;Abdullah bin Unbar). &#8220;He said so-and-so.&#8221; Sa&#8217;d bin Ubada said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Let my father be sacrificed for you ! Excuse and forgive him for, by Him Who revealed to you the Book, Allah sent the Truth which was revealed to you at the time when the people of this town had decided to crown him (&#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai) as their ruler.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when Allah had prevented that with the Truth He had given you, he was choked by that, and that caused him to behave in such an impolite manner which you had noticed.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle excused him. (It was the custom of) Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his companions to excuse the pagans and the people of the scripture (Christians and Jews) as Allah ordered them, and they used to be patient when annoyed (by them). Allah said: &#8216;You shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who received the Scripture before you&#8230;..and from the pagans (3.186)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said: &#8216;Many of the people of the scripture wish that if they could turn you away as disbelievers after you have believed. &#8230;. (2.109) So Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to apply what Allah had ordered him by excusing them till he was allowed to fight against them. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle had fought the battle of Badr and Allah killed whomever He killed among the chiefs of the infidels and the nobles of Quraish, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his companions had returned with victory and booty, bringing with them some of the chiefs of the infidels and the nobles of the Quraish as captives. &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul and the pagan idolators who were with him, said, &#8220;This matter (Islam) has now brought out its face (triumphed), so give Allah&#8217;s Apostle the pledge of allegiance (for embracing Islam.)&#8221;. Then they became Muslims.</p>

Sometimes they tell something which comes out to be true.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;That word which comes to be true is what a jinx snatches away by stealing and then pours it in the ear of his fore-teller with a sound similar to the cackle of a hen, and then they add to it one-hundred lies.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 233:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That he heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying. &#8220;Then there was a pause in the revelation of the Divine Inspiration to me. Then while I was walking all of a sudden I heard a voice from the sky, and I raised my sight towards the sky and saw the same angel who had visited me in the cave of Hira,&#8217; sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 234:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once I stayed overnight at the house of Maimuna and the Prophet was there with her. When it was the last third of the night, or some part of the night, the Prophet got up looking towards the sky and recited: &#8216;Verily! In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of Night and Day, there are indeed signs for men of u understanding.&#8217; (3.190)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 235:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That he was in the company of the Prophet in one of the gardens of Medina and in the hand of the Prophet there was a stick, and he was striking (slowly) the water and the mud with it. A man came (at the gate of the garden) and asked permission to enter. The Prophet said, &#8220;Open the gate for him and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise. &#8220;I went, and behold! It was Abu Bakr. So I opened the gate for him and informed him of the glad tidings of entering Paradise. Then another man came and asked permission to enter. The Prophet said, &#8220;Open the gate for him and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise.&#8221; Behold! It was &#8216;Umar. So I opened the gate for him and gave him the glad tidings of entering Paradise. Then another man came and asked permission to enter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet was sitting in a leaning posture, so he sat up and said, &#8220;Open the gate for him and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise with a calamity which will befall him or which will take place.&#8221; I went, and behold ! It was Uthman. So I opened the gate for him and gave him the glad tidings of entering Paradise and also informed him of what the Prophet had said (about a calamity). &#8216;Uthman said, &#8220;Allah Alone Whose Help I seek (against that calamity).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 236:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were with the Prophet in a funeral procession, and he started scraping the ground with a small stick and said, &#8220;There is none amongst you but has been assigned a place (either) in Paradise and (or) in the Hell-Fire.&#8221; The people said (to him), &#8220;Should we not depend upon it?&#8221; He said: carry on doing (good) deeds, for everybody will find easy such deeds as will lead him to his destined place. He then recited: &#8220;As for him who gives (in charity) and keeps his duty to Allah..&#8221; (92.5)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 237:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Um Salama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(One night) the Prophet woke up and said, &#8220;Subhan Allah ! How many treasures have been (disclosed) sent down! And how many afflictions have been descended! Who will go and wake the sleeping lady-occupants up of these dwellings (for praying)?&#8221; (He meant by this his wives.) The Prophet added, &#8220;A well-dressed soul (person) in this world may be naked in the &#8220;Hereafter.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I asked the Prophet, &#8216;Have you divorced your wives?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Allahu Akbar.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 238:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Safiya bint Huyai:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The wife of the Prophet that she went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle while he was in Itikaf (staying in the mosque) during the last ten nights of the month of Ramadan. She spoke to him for an hour (a while) at night and then she got up to return home. The Prophet got up to accompany her, and when they reached the gate of the mosque opposite the dwelling place of Um Salama, the wife of the Prophet, two Ansari men passed by, and greeting Allah&#8217;s Apostle , they quickly went ahead. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to them, &#8220;Do not be in a hurry She is Safiya, the daughter of Huyai.&#8221; They said, &#8220;Subhan Allah! O Allah&#8217;s Apostle (how dare we suspect you).&#8221; That was a great thing for both of them. The Prophet then said, &#8220;Satan runs in the body of Adam&#8217;s son (i.e. man) as his blood circulates in it, and I was afraid that he (Satan) might insert an evil thought in your hearts.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 239:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Mughaffal Al-Muzani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet forbade the throwing of stones (with the thumb and the index or middle finger), and said &#8220;It neither hunts a game nor kills (or hurts) an enemy, but it gouges out an eye or breaks a tooth.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 240:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Two men sneezed before the Prophet. The Prophet said to one of them, &#8220;May Allah bestow His Mercy on you,&#8221; but he did not say that to the other. On being asked (why), the Prophet said, &#8220;That one praised Allah (at the time of sneezing), while the other did not praise Allah.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 241:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet ordered us to do seven (things) and forbade us from seven (other things): He ordered us to pay a visit to the sick, to follow funeral possessions, to say: May Allah be merciful to you to a sneezer, &#8211; if he says: Praise be to Allah, to accept invitation (invitation to a wedding banquet), to return greetings, to help the oppressed, and to help others to fulfill their oaths (provided it was not sinful). And he forbade us from seven (things): to wear golden rings or golden bangles, to wear silk (cloth), Dibaj, Sundus and Mayathir.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 242:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah likes sneezing and dislikes yawning, so if someone sneezes and then praises Allah, then it is obligatory on every Muslim who heard him, to say: May Allah be merciful to you (Yar-hamuka-l-lah). But as regards yawning, it is from Satan, so one must try one&#8217;s best to stop it, if one says &#8216;Ha&#8217; when yawning, Satan will laugh at him.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 243:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8221; If anyone of you sneezes, he should say &#8216;Al-Hamdulillah&#8217; (Praise be to Allah), and his (Muslim) brother or companion should say to him, &#8216;Yar-hamuka-l-lah&#8217; (May Allah bestow his Mercy on you). When the latter says &#8216;Yar-hamuka-llah&#8221;, the former should say, &#8216;Yahdikumul-lah wa Yuslih balakum&#8217; (May Allah give you guidance and improve your condition).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 244:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Two men sneezed before the Prophet and he said Tashmit to one of them, while he did not say Tashmit to the other. So that man said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! You said Tashmit to that fellow but you did not say Tashmit to me. &#8220;The Prophet said, &#8220;That man praised Allah, but you did not praise Allah.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 73, Number 245:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah loves sneezing but dislikes yawning; so if anyone of you sneezes and then praises Allah, every Muslim who hears him (praising Allah) has to say Tashmit to him. But as regards yawning, it is from Satan, so if one of you yawns, he should try his best to stop it, for when anyone of you yawns, Satan laughs at him.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah created Adam in his complete  shape and form (directly), sixty cubits (about 30 meters) in height. When He created him,  He said (to him), &#8220;Go and greet that group of angels sitting there, and listen what  they will say in reply to you, for that will be your greeting and the greeting of your  offspring.&#8221; Adam (went and) said, &#8216;As-Salamu alaikum (Peace be upon you).&#8217; They  replied, &#8216;AsSalamu-&#8216;Alaika wa Rahmatullah (Peace and Allah&#8217;s Mercy be on you) So they  increased &#8216;Wa Rahmatullah&#8217; The Prophet added &#8216;So whoever will enter Paradise, will be of  the shape and form of Adam.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Al-Fadl bin &#8216;Abbas rode behind the Prophet as his companion  rider on the back portion of his she camel on the Day of Nahr (slaughtering of sacrifice,  10th Dhul-Hijja) and Al-Fadl was a handsome man. The Prophet stopped to give the people  verdicts. In the meantime, a beautiful woman From the tribe of Khath&#8217;am came, asking the  verdict of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Al-Fadl started looking at her as her beauty attracted him.  The Prophet looked behind while Al-Fadl was looking at her; so the Prophet held out his  hand backwards and caught the chin of Al-Fadl and turned his face (to the owner sides in  order that he should not gaze at her. She said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The obligation of  Performing Hajj enjoined by Allah on His worshipers, has become due (compulsory) on my  father who is an old man and who cannot sit firmly on the riding animal. Will it be  sufficient that I perform Hajj on his behalf?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When we prayed with the Prophet we used to say: As-Salam be  on Allah from His worshipers, As-Salam be on Gabriel, As-Salam be on Michael, As-Salam be  on so-and-so. When the Prophet finished his prayer, he faced us and said, &#8220;Allah  Himself is As-Salam (Peace), so when one sits in the prayer, one should say,  &#8216;At-Tahiyatu-lillahi Was-Salawatu, Wat-Taiyibatu, As-Salamu &#8216;Alaika aiyuhan-Nabiyyu wa  Rah-matul-lahi wa Barakatuhu, As-Salamu &#8216;Alaina wa &#8216;ala &#8216;Ibadillahi assalihin, for if he  says so, then it will be for all the pious slave of Allah in the Heavens and the Earth.  (Then he should say), &#8216;Ash-hadu an la ilaha illalllahu wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan &#8216;Abduhu  wa rasulu-hu,&#8217; and then he can choose whatever speech (i.e. invocation) he wishes &#8221;  (See Hadith No. 797, Vol. 1) </font></p>

In the morning, the Prophet was a bride-groom of her and he Invited the people, who  took their meals and went away, but a group of them remained with Allah&#8217;s Apostle and they  prolonged their stay. Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up and went out, and I too, went out along with  him till he came to the lintel of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s dwelling place. Allah&#8217;s Apostle thought that  those people had left by then, so he returned, and I too, returned with him till he  entered upon Zainab and found that they were still sitting there and had not yet gone. The  Prophet went out again, and so did I with him till he reached the lintel of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s  dwelling place, and then he thought that those people must have left by then, so he  returned, and so did I with him, and found those people had gone.

Usama bin  Zaid was his companion rider, and he was going to pay a visit to Sa&#8217;d bin Ubada (who was  sick) at the dwelling place of Bani Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj, and this incident happened  before the battle of Badr. The Prophet passed by a gathering in which there were Muslims  and pagan idolators and Jews, and among them there was &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul, and  there was &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha too. When a cloud of dust raised by the animal covered that  gathering, &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai covered his nose with his Rida (sheet) and said (to the  Prophet), &#8220;Don&#8217;t cover us with dust.&#8221; The Prophet greeted them and then stopped,  dismounted and invited them to Allah (i.e., to embrace Islam) and also recited to them the  Holy Quran. &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai&#8217; bin Salul said, &#8220;O man! There is nothing better than  what you say, if what you say is the truth. So do not trouble us in our gatherings. Go  back to your mount (or house,) and if anyone of us comes to you, tell (your tales) to  him.&#8221; On that &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha said, &#8220;(O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!) Come to us and  bring it(what you want to say) in our gatherings, for we love that.&#8221; So the Muslims,  the pagans and the Jews started quarreling till they were about to fight and clash with  one another. The Prophet kept on quietening them (till they all became quiet). He then  rode his animal, and proceeded till he entered upon Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada, he said, &#8220;O  Sa&#8217;d, didn&#8217;t you hear what Abu Habbab said? (He meant &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai). He said  so-and-so.&#8221; Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Excuse and forgive him,  for by Allah, Allah has given you what He has given you. The people of this town decided  to crown him (as their chief) and make him their king. But when Allah prevented that with  the Truth which He had given you, it choked him, and that was what made him behave in the  way you saw him behaving.&#8221; So the Prophet excused him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ali: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent me, Az-Zubair bin Al-Awwam and Abu  Marthad Al-Ghanawi, and all of us were horsemen, and he said, &#8220;Proceed till you reach  Rawdat Khakh, where there is a woman from the pagans carrying a letter sent by Hatib bin  Abi Balta&#8217;a to the pagans (of Mecca).&#8221; So we overtook her while she was proceeding on  her camel at the same place as Allah&#8217;s Apostle told us. We said (to her) &#8220;Where is  the letter which is with you?&#8221; She said, &#8220;I have no letter with me.&#8221; So we  made her camel kneel down and searched her mount (baggage etc) but could not find  anything. My two companions said, &#8220;We do not see any letter.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I  know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not tell a lie. By Allah, if you (the lady) do not bring out  the letter, I will strip you of your clothes&#8217; When she noticed that I was serious, she put  her hand into the knot of her waist sheet, for she was tying a sheet round herself, and  brought out the letter. So we proceeded to Allah&#8217;s Apostle with the letter. The Prophet  said (to Habib), &#8220;What made you o what you have done, O Hatib?&#8221; Hatib replied,  &#8220;I have done nothing except that I believe in Allah and His Apostle, and I have not  changed or altered (my religion). But I wanted to do the favor to the people (pagans of  Mecca) through which Allah might protect my family and my property, as there is none among  your companions but has someone in Mecca through whom Allah protects his property (against  harm). The Prophet said, &#8220;Habib has told you the truth, so do not say to him  (anything) but good.&#8221; &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab said, &#8220;Verily he has betrayed Allah,  His Apostle, and the believers! Allow me to chop his neck off!&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;O &#8216;Umar! What do you know; perhaps Allah looked upon the Badr warriors and said, &#8216;Do  whatever you like, for I have ordained that you will be in Paradise.'&#8221; On that &#8216;Umar  wept and said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know best.&#8221; </font></p>

When the letter was read, its contents were as follows: &#8216;In the name of Allah, the  Beneficent, the Merciful. From Muhammad, Allah&#8217;s slave and His Apostle to Heraclius, the  Chief of Byzantines: Peace be upon him who follows the right path (guidance)!

Peace be on us and on the pious slaves of Allah, I testify  that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and I also testify that Muhammad is  Allah&#8217;s slave and His Apostle.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Ali bin Abu Talib came out of the house of the Prophet  during his fatal ailment. The people asked (&#8216;Ali), &#8220;O Abu Hasan! How is the health of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle this morning?&#8221; &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;This morning he is better, with the  grace of Allah.&#8221; Al-&#8216;Abbas held Ali by the hand and said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see him  (about to die)? By Allah, within three days you will be the slave of the stick (i.e.,  under the command of another ruler). By Allah, I think that Allah&#8217;s Apostle will die from  his present ailment, for I know the signs of death on the faces of the offspring of &#8216;Abdul  Muttalib. So let us go to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to ask him who will take over the Caliphate. If  the authority is given to us, we will know it, and if it is given to somebody else we will  request him to recommend us to him. &#8221; &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;By Allah! If we ask Allah&#8217;s  Apostle for the rulership and he refuses, then the people will never give it to us.  Besides, I will never ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle for it.&#8221; (See Hadith No 728, Vol 5) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was walking with the Prophet at the Hurra of Medina  in the evening, the mountain of Uhud appeared before us. The Prophet said, &#8220;O Abu  Dhar! I would not like to have gold equal to Uhud (mountain) for me, unless nothing of it,  not even a single Dinar remains of it with me, for more than one day or three days, except  that single Dinar which I will keep for repaying debts. I will spend all of it (the whole  amount) among Allah&#8217;s slaves like this and like this and like this.&#8221; The Prophet  pointed out with his hand to illustrate it and then said, &#8220;O Abu Dhar!&#8221; I  replied, &#8220;Labbaik wa Sa&#8217;daik, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; He said, &#8220;Those who have  much wealth (in this world) will be the least rewarded (in the Hereafter) except those who  do like this and like this (i.e., spend their money in charity).&#8221; Then he ordered me,  &#8220;Remain at your place and do not leave it, O Abu Dhar, till I come back.&#8221; He  went away till he disappeared from me. Then I heard a voice and feared that something  might have happened to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and I intended to go (to find out) but I  remembered the statement of Allah&#8217;s Apostle that I should not leave, my place, so I kept  on waiting (and after a while the Prophet came), and I said to him, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle, I heard a voice and I was afraid that something might have happened to you, but  then I remembered your statement and stayed (there). The Prophet said, &#8220;That was  Gabriel who came to me and informed me that whoever among my followers died without  joining others in worship with Allah, would enter Paradise.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! Even if he had committed illegal sexual intercourse and theft?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Even if he had committed illegal sexual intercourse and theft &#8216; </font></p>

I asked, &#8216;What makes you  laugh, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Some people of my followers were displayed before me  as warriors fighting for Allah&#8217;s Cause and sailing over this sea, kings on the thrones,&#8217;  or said, &#8216;like kings on the thrones.&#8217; I (Um Haram) said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Invoke Allah  that He may make me one of them.&#8217; He said, You will be amongst the first ones.&#8221; It is  said that Um Haram sailed over the sea at the time of Muawiya, and on coming out of the  sea, she fell down from her riding animal and died. </font></p>

<h3 align="center"><font>Saying Something under Compulsion(Ikraah) </font></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.085.073">Volume 9, Book 85, Number 73: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abi Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet used to invoke Allah in his prayer, &#8220;O  Allah! Save &#8216;Aiyash bin Abi Rabi&#8217;a and Salama bin Hisham and Al-Walid bin Al-Walid; O  Allah! Save the weak among the believers; O Allah! Be hard upon the tribe of Mudar and  inflict years (of famine) upon them like the (famine) years of Joseph.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.085.074"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 85, Number 74: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whoever possesses the  (following) three qualities will have the sweetness of faith (1): The one to whom Allah  and His Apostle becomes dearer than anything else; (2) Who loves a person and he loves him  only for Allah&#8217;s Sake; (3) who hates to revert to atheism (disbelief) as he hates to be  thrown into the Fire.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.085.075"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 85, Number 75: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Qais: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Sa&#8217;id bin Zaid saying, &#8220;I have seen myself  tied and forced by &#8216;Umar to leave Islam (Before &#8216;Umar himself embraced Islam). And if the  mountain of Uhud were to collapse for the evil which you people had done to &#8216;Uthman, then  Uhud would have the right to do so.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 202, Vol. 5) </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.085.076"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 85, Number 76: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Khabbab bin Al-Art: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We complained to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (about our state) while he  was leaning against his sheet cloak in the shade of the Ka&#8217;ba. We said, &#8220;Will you ask  Allah to help us? Will you invoke Allah for us?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Among those who were  before you a (believer) used to be seized and, a pit used to be dug for him and then he  used to be placed in it. Then a saw used to be brought and put on his head which would be  split into two halves. His flesh might be combed with iron combs and removed from his  bones, yet, all that did not cause him to revert from his religion. By Allah! This  religion (Islam) will be completed (and triumph) till a rider (traveler) goes from San&#8217;a&#8217;  (the capital of Yemen) to Hadramout fearing nobody except Allah and the wolf lest it  should trouble his sheep, but you are impatient.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 191, Vol. 5) </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.085.077"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 85, Number 77: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While we were in the mosque, Allah&#8217;s Apostle came out to us  and said, &#8220;Let us proceed to the Jews.&#8221; So we went along with him till we  reached Bait-al-Midras (a place where the Torah used to be recited and all the Jews of the  town used to gather). The Prophet stood up and addressed them, &#8220;O Assembly of Jews!  Embrace Islam and you will be safe!&#8221; The Jews replied, &#8220;O Aba-l-Qasim! You have  conveyed Allah&#8217;s message to us.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;That is what I want (from  you).&#8221; He repeated his first statement for the second time, and they said, &#8220;You  have conveyed Allah&#8217;s message, O Aba-l-Qasim.&#8221; Then he said it for the third time and  added, &#8220;You should Know that the earth belongs to Allah and His Apostle, and I want  to exile you fro,,, this land, so whoever among you owns some property, can sell it,  otherwise you should know that the Earth belongs to Allah and His Apostle.&#8221; (See  Hadith No. 392, Vol. 4) </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.085.078"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 85, Number 78: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Khansa&#8217; bint Khidam Al-Ansariya: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That her father gave her in marriage when she was a matron  and she disliked that marriage. So she came and (complained) to the Prophets and he  declared that marriage invalid. (See Hadith No. 69, Vol. 7) </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.085.079"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 85, Number 79: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked the Prophet, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Should the  women be asked for their consent to their marriage?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; I  said, &#8220;A virgin, if asked, feels shy and keeps quiet.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Her  silence means her consent.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.085.080"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 85, Number 80: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man from the Ansar made his slave, a Mudabbar. And apart  from that slave he did not have any other property. This news reached Allah&#8217;s Apostle and  he said, &#8220;Who will buy that slave from me?&#8221; So Nu&#8217;aim bin An-Nahham bought him  for 800 Dirham. Jabir added: It was a coptic (Egyptian) slave who died that year. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.085.081"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 85, Number 81: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>wished, for they had more right to dispose of her than her  own relativ </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.085.082"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 85, Number 82: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;(The Prophet) Abraham migrated  with his wife Sarah till he reached a town where there was a king or a tyrant who sent a  message, to Abraham, ordering him to send Sarah to him. So when Abraham had sent Sarah,  the tyrant got up, intending to do evil with her, but she got up and performed ablution  and prayed and said, &#8216;O Allah ! If I have believed in You and in Your Apostle, then do not  empower this oppressor over me.&#8217; So he (the king) had an epileptic fit and started moving  his legs violently. &#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.085.083"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 85, Number 83: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;A Muslim is a brother of  another Muslim. So he should neither oppress him nor hand him over to an oppressor. And  whoever fulfilled the needs of his brother, Allah will fulfill his needs.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.085.084"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 85, Number 84: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Help your brother whether he is  an oppressor or an oppressed,&#8221; A man said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I will help him  if he is oppressed, but if he is an oppressor, how shall I help him?&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;By preventing him from oppressing (others), for that is how to help him.&#8221;  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;For every prophet there is one  (special invocation (that will not be rejected) with which he appeals (to Allah), and I  want to keep such an invocation for interceding for my followers in the Hereafter.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that the Prophet said, &#8220;For every prophet there is an  invocation that surely will be responded by Allah,&#8221; (or said), &#8220;For every  prophet there was an invocation with which he appealed to Allah, and his invocation was  accepted (in his lifetime), but I kept my (this special) invocation to intercede for my  followers on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 75, Number 318: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Shaddad bin Aus: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said &#8220;The most superior way of asking for  forgiveness from Allah is: &#8216;Allahumma anta Rabbi la ilaha illa anta, Anta Khalaqtani wa  ana abduka, wa ana &#8216;ala ahdika wa wa&#8217;dika mastata&#8217;tu, A&#8217;udhu bika min Sharri ma sana&#8217;tu,  abu&#8217;u Laka bini&#8217;matika &#8216;alaiya, wa Abu Laka bidhanbi faghfirli innahu la yaghfiru  adhdhunuba illa anta.&#8221; The Prophet added. &#8220;If somebody recites it during the day  with firm faith in it, and dies on the same day before the evening, he will be from the  people of Paradise; and if somebody recites it at night with firm faith in it, and dies  before the morning, he will be from the people of Paradise.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 75, Number 319: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying.&#8221; By Allah! I ask for  forgiveness from Allah and turn to Him in repentance more than seventy times a day.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 75, Number 320: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Harith bin Suwaid: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ud related to us two narrations: One from  the Prophet and the other from himself, saying: A believer sees his sins as if he were  sitting under a mountain which, he is afraid, may fall on him; whereas the wicked person  considers his sins as flies passing over his nose and he just drives them away like  this.&#8221; Abu Shihab (the sub-narrator) moved his hand over his nose in illustration.  (Ibn Mas&#8217;ud added): Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Allah is more pleased with the repentance  of His slave than a man who encamps at a place where his life is jeopardized, but he has  his riding beast carrying his food and water. He then rests his head and sleeps for a  short while and wakes to find his riding beast gone. (He starts looking for it) and  suffers from severe heat and thirst or what Allah wished (him to suffer from). He then  says, &#8216;I will go back to my place.&#8217; He returns and sleeps again, and then (getting up), he  raises his head to find his riding beast standing beside him.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Allah is more pleased with the  repentance of His slave than anyone of you is pleased with finding his camel which he had  lost in the desert. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet used to pray eleven Rakat in the late part of  the night, and when dawn appeared, he would offer two Rakat and then lie on his right side  till the Muadhdhin came to inform him (that the morning prayer was due). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara bin &#8216;Azib: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to me, &#8220;When you want to go to  bed, perform ablution as you do for prayer, then lie down on your right side and say:  &#8216;Allahumma aslamtu wajhi ilaika, wa fauwadtu Amri ilaika wa aljatu zahri ilaika, raghbatan  wa rahbatan ilaika, lamalja&#8217;a wa la manja mink a ill a ilaika. Amantu bikitabi kalladhi  anzalta wa bi nabiyyikal-ladhi arsalta&#8217;. If you should die then (after reciting this) you  will die on the religion of Islam (i.e., as a Muslim); so let these words be the last you  say (before going to bed)&#8221; While I was memorizing it, I said, &#8220;Wa  birasiulikal-ladhi arsalta (in Your Apostle whom You have sent).&#8217; The Prophet said,  &#8220;No, but say: Wa binabiyyi-kalladhi arsalta (in Your Prophet whom You have  sent).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet went to bed, he would say: &#8220;Bismika  amutu wa ahya.&#8221; and when he got up he would say:&#8221; Al-hamdu lillahil-ladhi ahyana  ba&#8217;da ma amatana wa ilaihin-nushur.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Hudhaifa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet went to bed at night, he would put his  hand under his cheek and then say, &#8220;Allahumma bismika amutu wa ahya,&#8221; and when  he got up, he would say, &#8220;Al-Hamdu lil-lahi al-ladhi ahyana ba&#8217;da ma amatana, wa  ilaihi an-nushur.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah&#8217;s Apostle went to bed, he used to sleep on his  right side and then say, &#8220;All-ahumma aslamtu nafsi ilaika, wa wajjahtu wajhi ilaika,  wa fauwadtu Amri ilaika, wa alja&#8217;tu zahri ilaika, raghbatan wa rahbatan ilaika. La Malja&#8217;a  wa la manja minka illa ilaika. Amantu bikitabika al-ladhi anzalta wa nabiyyika al-ladhi  arsalta!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 75, Number 328: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>One night I slept at the house of Maimuna. The Prophet woke  up, answered the call of nature, washed his face and hands, and then slept. He got up  (late at night), went to a water skin, opened the mouth thereof and performed ablution not  using much water, yet he washed all the parts properly and then offered the prayer. I got  up and straightened my back in order that the Prophet might not feel that I was watching  him, and then I performed the ablution, and when he got up to offer the prayer, stood on  his left. He caught hold of my ear and brought me over to his right side. He offered  thirteen Rak&#8217;at in all and then lay down and slept till he started blowing out his breath  as he used to do when he slept. In the meantime Bilal informed the Prophet of the  approaching time for the (Fajr) prayer, and the Prophet offered the Fajr (Morning) prayer  without performing new ablution. He used to say in his invocation, Allaihumma ij&#8217;al fi  qalbi nuran wa fi basari nuran, wa fi sam&#8217;i nuran, wa&#8217;an yamini nuran, wa&#8217;an yasari nuran,  wa fawqi nuran, wa tahti nuran, wa amami nuran, wa khalfi nuran, waj&#8217;al li nuran.&#8221;  Kuraib (a sub narrator) said, &#8220;I have forgotten seven other words, (which the Prophet  mentioned in this invocation). I met a man from the offspring of Al-&#8216;Abbas and he narrated  those seven things to me, mentioning, &#8216;(Let there be light in) my nerves, my flesh, my  blood, my hair and my body,&#8217; and he also mentioned two other things.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 75, Number 329: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet got up at night to offer the night prayer,  he used to say: &#8220;Allahumma laka-l-hamdu; Anta nuras-samawati wal ardi wa man fihinna.  Wa laka-l-hamdu; Anta qaiyim as-samawati wal ardi wa man fihinna. Wa laka-l-hamdu;  Anta-l-,haqqun, wa wa&#8217;daka haqqun, wa qauluka haqqun, wa liqauka haqqun, wal-jannatu  haqqun, wannaru haqqun, was-sa atu haqqun, wan-nabiyyuna huqqun, Mahammadun haqqun,  Allahumma laka aslamtu, wa Alaika tawakkaltu, wa bika amantu, wa ilaika anabtu, wa bika  Khasamtu, wa ilaika hakamtu, faghfirli ma qaddamtu wa ma akh-khartu, wa ma asrartu, wa ma  a&#8217;lantu.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ali: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Fatima complained about the blisters on her hand because of  using a mill-stone. She went to ask the Prophet for servant, but she did not find him (at  home) and had to inform &#8216;Aisha of her need. When he came, &#8216;Aisha informed him about it.  Ali added: The Prophet came to us when we had gone to our beds. When I was going to get  up, he said, &#8220;&#8216;Stay in your places,&#8221; and sat between us, till I felt the  coolness of the feet on my chest. The Prophet then said, &#8220;Shall I not tell you of a  thing which is better for you than a servant? When you (both) go to your beds, say &#8216;Allahu  Akbar&#8217; thirty-four times, and &#8216;Subhan Allah&#8217; thirty-three times, &#8216;Alhamdu &#8216;illah&#8217;  thirty-three times, for that is better for you than a servant.&#8221; Ibn Sirin said,  &#8220;Subhan Allah&#8217; (is to be said for) thirty-four times.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle went to bed, he used to blow on  his hands while reciting the Mu&#8217;auwidhat ( i.e. Suratal-Falaq and Surat-an-Nas, 113 and  114) and then pass his hands over his body, </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;When anyone of you go to bed, he  should shake out his bed with the inside of his waist sheet, for he does not know what has  come on to it after him, and then he should say: &#8216;Bismika Rabbi wada&#8217;tu Janbi wa bika  arfa&#8217;uhu, In amsakta nafsi farhamha wa in arsaltaha fahfazha bima tahfazu bihi  ibadakas-salihin.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The most superior way of asking for  forgiveness from Allah is: &#8216;Allahumma anta Rabbi la ilaha illa anta.

And if he  recites it in the morning, and if he should die on the same day, he will have the same  fate.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Bakr As-Siddiq said to the Prophet, &#8220;Teach me an  invocation with which I may invoke (Allah) in my prayer.&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Say: Allahumma inni zalamtu nafsi zulman kathiran wala yaghfirudh-dhunuba illa anta,  Faghfirli maghfiratan min indika war-hamni, innaka antalGhafur-Rahim.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We used to say in the prayer: &#8216;AsSalam be on Allah,  As-Salam be on so-and so.&#8217; So one day the Prophet said to us, &#8220;Allah Himself is  As-Salam; when anyone of you sits during his prayer, he should say: &#8216;At-tah,  iyyatu-lillahi,&#8217; up to &#8216;As-Salihin,&#8217; (All the compliments are for Allah &#8230;righteous  people) for when he recites this, then he says his Salam to all the righteous people  present in the heavens and on the earth. Then he should say, &#8216;I testify that none has the  right to be worshipped except Allah, and that Muhammad is His slave and His Apostle,&#8217; and  then he can select whatever he likes to celebrate (Allah&#8217;s) Praises.&#8221; </font></p>

The rich people  have got the highest degrees of prestige and the permanent pleasures (in this life and the  life to come in the Hereafter).&#8221; He said, &#8220;How is that?&#8221; They said,  &#8220;The rich pray as we pray, and strive in Allah&#8217;s Cause as we do, and spend from their  surplus wealth in charity, while we have no wealth (to spend likewise).&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Shall I not tell you a thing, by doing which, you will catch up with those who are  ahead of you and supersede those who will come after you; and nobody will be able to do  such a good deed as you do except the one who does the same (deed as you do). That deed is  to recite &#8216;Subhan Allah ten times, and &#8216;Al-Hamdulillah ten times, and &#8216;AllahuAkbar&#8217; ten  times after every prayer.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(the freed slave of Al-Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba) Al-Mughira wrote  to Muawiya bin Abu Sufyan that Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to say at the end of every prayer  after the Taslim, &#8220;La ilaha illa-l-lahu wahdahu la sharika lahu; lahu-l-mulk wa  lahu-l-hamd, wahuwa &#8216;ala kulli shai&#8217;n qadir.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Salama bin Al-Akwa&#8217;: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We went out with the Prophet to Khaibar. A man among the  people said, &#8220;O &#8216;Amir! Will you please recite to us some of your poetic verses?&#8221;  So &#8216;Amir got down and started chanting among them, saying, &#8220;By Allah! Had it not been  for Allah, we would not have been guided.&#8221; &#8216;Amir also said other poetic verses which  I do not remember. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Who is this (camel) driver?&#8221; The  people said, &#8220;He is &#8216;Amir bin Al-Akwa&#8217;,&#8221; He said, &#8220;May Allah bestow His  Mercy on him.&#8221; A man from the People said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Would that you  let us enjoy his company longer.&#8221; When the people (Muslims) lined up, the battle  started, and &#8216;Amir was struck with his own sword (by chance) by himself and died. In the  evening, the people made a large number of fires (for cooking meals). Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said, &#8220;What is this fire? What are you making the fire for?&#8221; They said,  &#8220;For cooking the meat of donkeys.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Throw away what is in the pots  and break the pots!&#8221; A man said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! May we throw away what is  in them and wash them?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Never mind, you may do so.&#8221; (See Hadith  No. 509, Vol. 5). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to me. &#8220;Will you relieve me from  Dhi-al-Khalasa? &#8221; Dhi-al-Khalasa was an idol which the people used to worship and it  was called Al-Ka&#8217;ba al Yamaniyya. I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle I am a man who can&#8217;t sit  firm on horses.&#8221; So he stroked my chest (with his hand) and said, &#8220;O Allah! Make  him firm and make him a guiding and well-guided man.&#8221; So I went out with fifty (men)  from my tribe of Ahrnas. (The sub-narrator, Sufyan, quoting Jarir, perhaps said, &#8220;I  went out with a group of men from my nation.&#8221;) and came to Dhi-al-Khalasa and burnt  it, and then came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have not come to you  till I left it like a camel with a skin disease.&#8221; The Prophet then invoked good upon  Ahmas and their cavalry (fighters). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Preach to the people once a week,  and if you won&#8217;t, then preach them twice, but if you want to preach more, then let it be  three times (a week only), and do not make the people fed-up with this Qur&#8217;an. If you come  to some people who are engaged in a talk, don&#8217;t start interrupting their talk by  preaching, lest you should cause them to be bored. You should rather keep quiet, and if  they ask you, then preach to them at the time when they are eager to hear what you say.  And avoid the use of rhymed prose in invocation for I noticed that Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his  companions always avoided it.&#8221; </font></p>

It kept on raining till the next Friday when the  same man or another man got up and said (to the Prophet), &#8220;Invoke Allah to withhold  the rain from us, for we have been drowned (with heavy rain ).&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;O Allah! Let it rain around us and not on us.&#8221; Then the clouds started  dispersing around Medina and rain ceased to fall on the people of Medina. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said to Abu Talha, &#8220;Choose one of your  boys to serve me.&#8221; So Abu Talha took me (to serve the Prophet ) by giving me a ride  behind him (on his camel). So I used to serve Allah&#8217;s Apostle whenever he stayed  somewhere. I used to hear him saying, &#8220;O Allah! I seek refuge with you (Allah) from  (worries) care and grief, from incapacity and laziness, from miserliness and cowardice,  from being heavily in debt and from being overpowered by other men.&#8221; I kept on  serving him till he returned from (the battle of) Khaibar. He then brought Safiya, the  daughter of Huyay whom he had got (from the booty). I saw him making a kind of cushion  with a cloak or a garment for her. He then let her ride behind him. When we reached a  place called As-Sahba&#8217;, he prepared (a special meal called) Hais, and asked me to invite  the men who (came and) ate, and that was the marriage banquet given on the consummation of  his marriage to her. Then he proceeded till the mountain of Uhud appeared, whereupon he  said, &#8220;This mountain loves us and we love it.&#8221; When he approached Medina, he  said, &#8220;O Allah! I make the land between its (i.e., Medina&#8217;s) two mountains a  sanctuary, as the prophet Abraham made Mecca a sanctuary. O Allah! Bless them (the people  of Medina) in their Mudd and the Sa&#8217; (units of measuring).&#8221; </font></p>

When they went away and the  Prophet entered upon me, I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Two old ladies..&#8221; and told  him the whole story. He said, &#8220;They told the truth; the dead are really punished, to  the extent that all the animals hear (the sound resulting from) their punishment.&#8221;  Since then I always saw him seeking refuge with Allah from the punishment of the grave in  his prayers. </font></p>

Shall I give  2/3 of my property in charity?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Then 1/2 of it?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Even  1/3 is too much, for, to leave your inheritors wealthy is better than to leave them in  poverty, begging from people. And (know that) whatever you spend in Allah&#8217;s Cause, you  will get reward for it, even for the morsel of food which you put in your wife&#8217;s mouth.&#8217; I  said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Will I be left behind my companions (in Mecca)?&#8217; He said, &#8216;If  you remain behind, whatever good deed you will do for Allah&#8217;s Sake, will raise and upgrade  you to a higher position (in Allah&#8217;s Sight). May be you will live longer so that some  people may benefit by you, and some e others (pagans) may get harmed by you. O Allah!  Complete the migration of my companions and do not turn them on their heels; But (we pity)  the poor Sa&#8217;d bin Khaula (not the above mentioned Sa&#8217;d) (died in Mecca)&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle lamented (or pitied) for him as he died in Mecca.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that Allah&#8217;s Apostle was affected by magic, so much that he  used to think that he had done something which in fact, he did not do, and he invoked his  Lord (for a remedy). Then (one day) he said, &#8220;O &#8216;Aisha!) Do you know that Allah has  advised me as to the problem I consulted Him about?&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! What&#8217;s that?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Two men came to me and one of them sat at my  head and the other at my feet, and one of them asked his companion, &#8216;What is wrong with  this man?&#8217; The latter replied, &#8216;He is under the effect of magic.&#8217; The former asked, &#8216;Who  has worked magic on him?&#8217; The latter replied, &#8216;Labid bin Al-A&#8217;sam.&#8217; The former asked,  &#8216;With what did he work the magic?&#8217; The latter replied, &#8216;With a comb and the hair, which  are stuck to the comb, and the skin of pollen of a date-palm tree.&#8217; The former asked,  &#8216;Where is that?&#8217; The latter replied, &#8216;It is in Dharwan.&#8217; Dharwan was a well in the  dwelling place of the (tribe of) Bani Zuraiq. Allah&#8217;s Apostle went to that well and  returned to &#8216;Aisha, saying, &#8216;By Allah, the water (of the well) was as red as the infusion  of Hinna, (1) and the date-palm trees look like the heads of devils.&#8217; &#8216;Aisha added,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me and informed me about the well. I asked the Prophet, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle, why didn&#8217;t you take out the skin of pollen?&#8217; He said, &#8216;As for me, Allah has cured  me and I hated to draw the attention of the people to such evil (which they might learn  and harm others with).&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet said, &#8220;Sami&#8217; al-lahu Liman hamidah  (Allah heard him who sent his praises to Him)&#8221; in the last Rak&#8217;a of the &#8216;Isha&#8217;  prayer, he used to invoke Allah, saying, &#8220;O Allah! Save &#8216;Aiyash bin Abi Rabi&#8217;a; O  Allah! Save Al-Walid bin Al-Walid; O Allah! Save the weak people among the believers; O  Allah! Be hard on the Tribe of Mudar; O Allah!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet sent a Sariya (an army detachment) consisting  of men called Al-Qurra&#8217;, and all of them were martyred. I had never seen the Prophet so  sad over anything as he was over them. So he said Qunut (invocation in the prayer) for one  month in the Fajr prayer, invoking for Allah&#8217;s wrath upon the tribe of &#8216;Usaiya, and he  used to say, &#8220;The people of &#8216;Usaiya have disobeyed Allah and His Apostle.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah says, How it would have been if they saw Me?&#8217; The  angels reply, &#8216;If they saw You, they would worship You more devoutly and celebrate Your  Glory more deeply, and declare Your freedom from any resemblance to anything more often.&#8217;  Allah says (to the angels), &#8216;What do they ask Me for?&#8217; The angels reply, &#8216;They ask You for  Paradise.&#8217; Allah says (to the angels), &#8216;Did they see it?&#8217; The angels say, &#8216;No!

They did not see it.&#8217; Allah says, How it  would have been if they saw it?&#8217; The angels say, &#8216;If they saw it they would flee from it  with the extreme fleeing and would have extreme fear from it.&#8217; Then Allah says, &#8216;I make  you witnesses that I have forgiven them.&#8221;&#8216; Allah&#8217;s Apostle added, &#8220;One of the  angels would say, &#8216;There was so-and-so amongst them, and he was not one of them, but he  had just come for some need.&#8217; Allah would say, &#8216;These are those people whose companions  will not be reduced to misery.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

The Prophet added, &#8216;And whoever among you fulfills his pledge, his reward is with Allah; and whoever commits something of such sins and receives the legal punishment for it, that will be considered as the expiation for that sin, and whoever commits something of such sins and Allah screens him, it is up to Allah whether to excuse or punish him.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever the Prophet was given an option between two things, he used to select the easier of the tow as long as it was not sinful; but if it was sinful, he would remain far from it.

The nations before you went astray because if a noble person committed theft, they used to leave him, but if a weak person among them committed theft, they used to inflict the legal punishment on him.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.086.085">Volume 9, Book 86, Number 85: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8216;O people! The reward of deeds depends  upon the intentions, and every person will get the reward according to what he has  intended. So, whoever emigrated for Allah and His Apostle, then his emigration was for  Allah and His Apostle, and whoever emigrated to take worldly benefit or for a woman to  marry, then his emigration was for what he emigrated for.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah does not accept prayer of  anyone of you if he does Hadath (passes wind) till he performs the ablution (anew).&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.086.087"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 87: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That Abu Bakr wrote for him, Zakat regulations which  Allah&#8217;s Apostle had made compulsory, and wrote that one should neither collect various  portions (of the property) nor divide the property into various portions in order to avoid  paying Zakat. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 88: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Talha bin &#8216;Ubaidullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A bedouin with unkempt hair came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and  said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Tell me what Allah has enjoined on me as regards  prayers.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;You have to offer perfectly the five (compulsory)  prayers in a day and a night (24 hrs.), except if you want to perform some extra optional  prayers.&#8221; The bedouin said, &#8220;Tell me what Allah has enjoined on me as regards  fasting.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;You have to observe fast during the month of  Ramadan except if you fast some extra optional fast.&#8221; The bedouin said, &#8220;Tell me  what Allah has enjoined on me as regard Zakat.&#8221; The Prophet then told him the Islamic  laws and regulations whereupon the bedouin said, &#8220;By Him Who has honored you, I will  not perform any optional deeds of worship and I will not leave anything of what Allah has  enjoined on me.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;He will be successful if he has told the  truth (or he will enter Paradise if he said the truth).&#8221; And some people said,  &#8220;The Zakat for one-hundred and twenty camels is two Hiqqas, and if the Zakat payer  slaughters the camels intentionally or gives them as a present or plays some other trick  in order to avoid the Zakat, then there is no harm (in it) for him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 89: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;On the Day of Resurrection the  Kanz (Treasure or wealth of which, Zakat has not been paid) of anyone of you will appear  in the shape of a huge bald headed poisonous male snake and its owner will run away from  it, but it will follow him and say, &#8216;I am your Kanz.'&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;By  Allah, that snake will keep on following him until he stretches out his hand and let the  snake swallow it.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle added, &#8220;If the owner of camels does not pay  their Zakat, then, on the Day of Resurrection those camels will come to him and will  strike his face with their hooves.&#8221; Some people said: Concerning a man who has  camels, and is afraid that Zakat will be due so he sells those camels for similar camels  or for sheep or cows or money one day before Zakat becomes due in order to avoid payment  of their Zakat cunningly! &#8220;He has not to pay anything.&#8221; The same scholar said,  &#8220;If one pays Zakat of his camels one day or one year prior to the end of the year (by  the end of which Zakat becomes due), his Zakat will be valid.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.086.090t"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 90t: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada Al-Ansari sought the verdict of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle regarding a vow made by his mother who had died before fulfilling it. Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said, &#8220;Fulfill it on her behalf.&#8221; Some people said, &#8220;If the number  of camels reaches twenty, then their owner has to pay four sheep as Zakat; and if their  owner gives them as a gift or sells them in order to escape the payment of Zakat cunningly  before the completion of a year, then he is not to pay anything, and if he slaughters them  and then dies, then no Zakat is to be taken from his property.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.086.090"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 90: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Nafi narrated to me that &#8216;Abdullah said that Allah&#8217;s  Apostle forbade the Shighar. I asked Nafi&#8217;, &#8220;What is the Shighar?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;It is to marry the daughter of a man and marry one&#8217;s daughter to that man (at the  same time) without Mahr (in both cases); or to marry the sister of a man and marry one&#8217;s  own sister to that man without Mahr.&#8221; Some people said, &#8220;If one, by a trick,  marries on the basis of Shighar, the marriage is valid but its condition is illegal.&#8221;  The same scholar said regarding Al-Mut&#8217;a, &#8220;The marriage is invalid and its condition  is illegal.&#8221; Some others said, &#8220;The Mut&#8217;a and the Shighar are permissible but  the condition is illegal.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.086.091"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 91: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Muhammad bin &#8216;Ali: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Ali was told that Ibn &#8216;Abbas did not see any harm in the  Mut&#8217;a marriage. &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle forbade the Mut&#8217;a marriage on the Day of  the battle of Khaibar and he forbade the eating of donkey&#8217;s meat.&#8221; Some people said,  &#8220;If one, by a tricky way, marries temporarily, his marriage is illegal.&#8221; Others  said, &#8220;The marriage is valid but its condition is illegal.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;One should not prevent others  from watering their animals with the surplus of his water in order to prevent them from  benefiting by the surplus of grass.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.086.094"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 94: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man mentioned to the Prophet that he had always been  cheated in bargains. The Prophet said, &#8220;Whenever you do bargain, say, &#8216;No  cheating.'&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.086.095"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 95: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Urwa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That he asked &#8216;Aisha regarding the Verse: &#8216;If you fear that  you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls, marry (other) women of your  choice.&#8217; (4.3) &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;It is about an orphan girl under the custody of her  guardian who being attracted by her wealth and beauty wants to marry her with Mahr less  than other women of her status. So such guardians were forbidden to marry them unless they  treat them justly by giving them their full Mahr. Then the people sought the verdict of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle for such cases, whereupon Allah revealed: &#8216;They ask your instruction  concerning women..&#8217; (4.127) (The sub-narrator then mentioned the Hadith.) </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.086.097"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 97: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Um Salama: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;I am only a human being, and you  people have disputes. May be some one amongst you can present his case in a more eloquent  and convincing manner than the other, and I give my judgment in his favor according to  what I hear. Beware! If ever I give (by error) somebody something of his brother&#8217;s right  then he should not take it as I have only, given him a piece of Fire.&#8221; (See Hadith  No. 638. Vol. 3) </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.086.098"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 98: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;A virgin should not be married till  she is asked for her consent; and the matron should not be married till she is asked  whether she agrees to marry or not.&#8221; It was asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! How will  she(the virgin) express her consent?&#8221; He said, &#8220;By keeping silent.&#8221; Some  people said, &#8220;If a virgin is not asked for her consent and she is not married, and  then a man, by playing a trick presents two false witnesses that he has married her with  her consent and the judge confirms his marriage as a true one, and the husband knows that  the witnesses were false ones, then there is no harm for him to consummate his marriage  with her and the marriage is regarded as valid.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.086.099"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 99: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Qasim: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A woman from the offspring of Ja&#8217;far was afraid lest her  guardian marry her (to somebody) against her will. So she sent for two elderly men from  the Ansar, &#8216;AbdurRahman and Mujammi&#8217;, the two sons of Jariya, and they said to her,  &#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid, for Khansa&#8217; bint Khidam was given by her father in marriage against  her will, then the Prophet cancelled that marriage.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 78) </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.086.100"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 100: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Haraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;A lady slave should not be  given in marriage until she is consulted, and a virgin should not be given in marriage  until her permission is granted.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;How will she express her  permission?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;By keeping silent (when asked her  consent).&#8221; Some people said, &#8220;If a man, by playing a trick, presents two false  witnesses before the judge to testify that he has married a matron with her consent and  the judge confirms his marriage, and the husband is sure that he has never married her  (before), then such a marriage will be considered as a legal one and he may live with her  as husband.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;It is essential to have the  consent of a virgin (for the marriage). I said, &#8220;A virgin feels shy.&#8221; The  Prophet; said, &#8220;Her silence means her consent.&#8221; Some people said, &#8220;If a man  falls in love with an orphan slave girl or a virgin and she refuses (him) and then he  makes a trick by bringing two false witnesses to testify that he has married her, and then  she attains the age of puberty and agrees to marry him and the judge accepts the false  witness and the husband knows that the witnesses were false ones, he may consummate his  marriage.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 102: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to like sweets and also used to like  honey, and whenever he finished the &#8216;Asr prayer, he used to visit his wives and stay with  them. Once he visited Hafsa and remained with her longer than the period he used to stay,  so I enquired about it. It was said to me, &#8220;A woman from her tribe gave her a leather  skin containing honey as a present, and she gave some of it to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to  drink.&#8221; I said, &#8220;By Allah, we will play a trick on him.&#8221; So I mentioned the  story to Sauda (the wife of the Prophet) and said to her, &#8220;When he enters upon you,  he will come near to you whereupon you should say to him, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Have you  eaten Maghafir?&#8217; He will say, &#8216;No.&#8217; Then you say to him, &#8216;What is this bad smell? &#8216; And it  would be very hard on Allah&#8217;s Apostle that a bad smell should be found on his body. He  will say, &#8216;Hafsa has given me a drink of honey.&#8217; Then you should say to him, &#8216;Its bees  must have sucked from the Al-&#8216;Urfut (a foul smelling flower).&#8217; I too, will tell him the  same. And you, O Saifya, say the same.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So when the Prophet entered upon Sauda (the following  happened). Sauda said, &#8220;By Him except Whom none has the right to be worshipped, I was  about to say to him what you had told me to say while he was still at the gate because of  fear from you. But when Allah &#8216;s Apostle came near to me, I said to him, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! Have you eaten Maghafir?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;No.&#8217; I said, &#8216;What about this smell?&#8217; He  said, &#8216;Hafsa has given me a drink of honey.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Its bees must have sucked  Al-&#8216;Urfut.&#8217; &#8221; When he entered upon me, I told him the same as that, and when he  entered upon Safiya, she too told him the same. So when he visited Hafsa again, she said  to him, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall I give you a drink of it (honey)?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;I have no desire for it.&#8221; Sauda said, Subhan Allah! We have deprived him of it  (honey).&#8221; I said to her, &#8220;Be quiet!&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 103: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amir bin Rabi&#8217;a: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab left for Sham, and when he reached a  placed called Sargh, he came to know that there was an outbreak of an epidemic (of plague)  in Sham. Then &#8216;AbdurRahman bin &#8216;Auf told him that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;If you hear  the news of an outbreak of an epidemic (plague) in a certain place, do not enter that  place: and if the epidemic falls in a place while you are present in it, do not leave that  place to escape from the epidemic.&#8221; So &#8216;Umar returned from Sargh. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 104: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Amir bin Sa&#8217;d bin Abi Waqqas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That he heard Usama bin Zaid speaking to Sa&#8217;d, saying,  &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle mentioned the plague and said, &#8216;It is a means of punishment with  which some nations were punished and some of it has remained, and it appears now and then.  So whoever hears that there is an outbreak of plague in some land, he should not go to  that land, and if the plague breaks out in the land where one is already present, one  should not run away from that land, escaping from the plague.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 105: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The one who takes back his gift is  like a dog swallowing its own vomit, and we (believers) should not act according to this  bad example.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.086.106"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 106: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet has decreed that preemption is valid in all  cases where the real estate concerned has not been divided, but if the boundaries are  established and the ways are made, then there is no preemption. A man said,  &#8220;Preemption is only for the neighbor,&#8221; and then he makes invalid what he has  confirmed. He said, &#8220;If someone wants to buy a house and being afraid that the  neighbor (of the house) may buy it through preemption, he buys one share out of one  hundred shares of the house and then buys the rest of the house, then the neighbor can  only have the right of preemption for the first share but not for the rest of the house;  and the buyer may play such a trick in this case.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.086.107"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 107: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Amr bin Ash-Sharid: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Al-Miswar bin Makhrama came and put his hand on my shoulder  and I accompanied him to Sa&#8217;d. Abu Rafi&#8217; said to Al-Miswar, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you order this  (i.e. Sa&#8217;d) to buy my house which is in my yard?&#8221; Sa&#8217;d said, &#8220;I will not offer  more than four hundred in installments over a fixed period.&#8221; Abu Rafi said, &#8220;I  was offered five hundred cash but I refused. Had I not heard the Prophet saying, &#8216;A  neighbor is more entitled to receive the care of his neighbor,&#8217; I would not have sold it  to you.&#8221; The narrator said, to Sufyan: Ma&#8217;mar did not say so. Sufyan said, &#8220;But  he did say so to me.&#8221; Some people said, &#8220;If someone wants to sell a house and  deprived somebody of the right of preemption, he has the right to play a trick to render  the preemption invalid. And that is by giving the house to the buyer as a present and  marking its boundaries and giving it to him. The buyer then gives the seller one-thousand  Dirham as compensation in which case the preemptor loses his right of preemption.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Amr bin Ash-Sharid: Abu Rafi&#8217; said that Sa&#8217;d  offered him four hundred Mithqal of gold for a house. Abu Rafi &#8216; said, &#8220;If I had not  heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;A neighbor has more right to be taken care of by his  neighbor,&#8217; then I would not have given it to you.&#8221; Some people said, &#8220;If one has  bought a portion of a house and wants to cancel the right of preemption, he may give it as  a present to his little son and he will not be obliged to take an oath.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.086.108"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 108: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Humaid As-Sa&#8217;idi: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle appointed a man called Ibn Al-Lutabiyya to  collect the Zakat from Bani Sulaim&#8217;s tribe. When he returned, the Prophet called him to  account. He said (to the Prophet, &#8216;This is your money, and this has been given to me as a  gift.&#8221; On that, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you stay in your father&#8217;s and  mother&#8217;s house to see whether you will be given gifts or not if you are telling the  truth?&#8221; Then the Prophet addressed us, and after praising and glorifying Allah, he  said: &#8220;Amma Ba&#8217;du&#8221;, I employ a man from among you to manage some affair of what  Allah has put under my custody, and then he comes to me and says, &#8216;This is your money and  this has been given to me as a gift. Why didn&#8217;t he stay in his father&#8217;s and mother&#8217;s home  to see whether he will be given gifts or not? By Allah, not anyone of you takes a thing  unlawfully but he will meet Allah on the Day of Resurrection, carrying that thing. I do  not want to see any of you carrying a grunting camel or a mooing cow or a bleating sheep  on meeting Allah.&#8221; Then the Prophet raised both his hands till the whiteness of his  armpits became visible, and he said, &#8220;O Allah! Haven&#8217;t I have conveyed (Your  Message)?&#8221; The narrator added: My eyes witnessed and my ears heard (that Hadith). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 86, Number 109: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Rafi&#8217;: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The neighbor has more right to be  taken care of by his neighbor (than anyone else).&#8221; Some men said, &#8220;If one wants  to buy a house for 20,000 Dirhams then there is no harm to play a trick to deprive  somebody of preemption by buying it (just on paper) with 20,000 Dirhams but paying to the  seller only 9,999 Dirhams in cash and then agree with the seller to pay only one Dinar in  cash for the rest of the price (i.e. 10,001 Dirhams). If the preemptor offers 20,000  Dirhams for the house, he can buy it otherwise he has no right to buy it (by this trick he  got out of preemption). If the house proves to belong to somebody else other than the  seller, the buyer should take back from the seller what he has paid, i.e., 9,999 Dirhams  and one Dinar, because if the house proves to belong to somebody else, so the whole  bargain (deal) is unlawful. If the buyer finds a defect in the house and it does not  belong to somebody other than the seller, the buyer may return it and receive 20,000  Dirhams (instead of 9999 Dirham plus one Dinar) which he actually paid.&#8217; Abu &#8216;Abdullah  said, &#8220;So that man allows (some people) the playing of tricks amongst the Muslims  (although) the Prophet said, &#8216;In dealing with Muslims one should not sell them sick  (animals) or bad things or stolen things.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(the wife of the Prophet) Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;No  calamity befalls a Muslim but that Allah expiates some of his sins because of it, even  though it were the prick he receives from a thorn.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri and Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;No fatigue, nor disease, nor  sorrow, nor sadness, nor hurt, nor distress befalls a Muslim, even if it were the prick he  receives from a thorn, but that Allah expiates some of his sins for that.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Kab: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The example of a believer is that  of a fresh tender plant, which the wind bends lt sometimes and some other time it makes it  straight. And the example of a hypocrite is that of a pine tree which keeps straight till  once it is uprooted suddenly. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 70, Number 547: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The example of a believer is  that of a fresh tender plant; from whatever direction the wind comes, it bends it, but  when the wind becomes quiet, it becomes straight again. Similarly, a believer is afflicted  with calamities (but he remains patient till Allah removes his difficulties.) And an  impious wicked person is like a pine tree which keeps hard and straight till Allah cuts  (breaks) it down when He wishes.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 558, Vol. 9.) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I visited the Prophet during his ailments and he was  suffering from a high fever. I said, &#8220;You have a high fever. Is it because you will  have a double reward for it?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, for no Muslim is afflicted with any  harm but that Allah will remove his sins as the leaves of a tree fall down.&#8221; </font></p>

How shall I dispose of (distribute) my  property?&#8221; He did not reply till the Verse of inheritance was revealed. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah&#8217;s Apostle emigrated to Medina, Abu Bakr and  Bilal got a fever. I entered upon them and asked, &#8220;O my father! How are you? O Bilal!  How are you?&#8221; Whenever fever attacked Abu Bakr, he would recite the following poetic  verses: &#8216;Everybody is staying alive among his people, yet death is nearer to him than his  shoe laces.&#8221; And whenever the fever deserted Bilal, he would recite (two poetic  lines): &#8216;Would that I could stay overnight in a valley wherein I would be surrounded by  Idhkhir and Jalil (two kinds of good smelling grass). Would that one day I would drink of  the water of Majinna and would that Shama and Tafil (two mountains at Mecca) would appear  to me.&#8217; Then I came and informed Allah&#8217;s Apostle about that, whereupon he said, &#8220;O  Allah! Make us love Medina as much or more than we love Mecca. O Allah! Make it healthy  and bless its Mudd and Sa for us, and take away its fever and put it in Al&#8217;Juhfa.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Usama bin Zaid said that while he. Sad and Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b  were with the Prophet a daughter of the Prophet sent a message to him, saying. &#8216;My  daughter is dying; please come to us.&#8221; The Prophet sent her his greetings and added  &#8220;It is for Allah what He takes, and what He gives; and everything before His sight  has a limited period. So she should hope for Allah&#8217;s reward and remain patient.&#8221; She  again sent a message, beseeching him by Allah, to come. So the Prophet got up. and so did  we (and went there). The child was placed on his lap while his breath was irregular. Tears  flowed from the eyes of the Prophet. Sad said to him, &#8220;What is this, O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle?&#8221; He said. &#8220;This Is Mercy which Allah has embedded in the hearts of  whomever He wished of His slaves. And Allah does not bestow His Mercy, except on the  merciful among His slaves. (See Hadith No. 373 Vol. 2) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet rode a donkey having a saddle with a Fadakiyya  velvet covering. He mounted me behind him and went to visit Sad bin &#8216;Ubada, and that had  been before the battle of Badr. The Prophet proceeded till he passed by a gathering in  which &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul was present, and that had been before &#8216;Abdullah  embraced Islam. The gathering comprised of Muslims, polytheists, i.e., isolators and Jews.  &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha was also present in that gathering. When dust raised by the donkey  covered the gathering, &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai covered his nose with his upper garment and  said, &#8220;Do not trouble us with dust.&#8221; The Prophet greeted them, stopped and  dismounted. Then he invited them to Allah (i.e., to embrace Islam) and recited to them  some verses of the Holy Qur&#8217;an. On that, &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai said, &#8220;O man ! There is  nothing better than what you say if it is true. Do not trouble us with it in our  gathering, but return to your house, and if somebody comes to you, teach him there.&#8221;  On that &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha said, Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Bring your teachings to our  gathering, for we love that.&#8221; So the Muslims, the pagans and the Jews started abusing  each other till they were about to fight. The Prophet kept on quietening them till they  became calm. Thereupon the Prophet mounted his animal and proceeded till he entered upon  Sad bin Ubada. He said to him &#8220;O Sad! Have you not heard what Abu Hubab (i.e.,  &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai) said?&#8221; Sad said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Excuse and forgive him, for  Allah has given you what He has given you. The people of this town (Medina decided  unanimously to crown him and make him their chief by placing a turban on his head, but  when that was prevented by the Truth which Allah had given you he (&#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai) was  grieved out of jealously, and that was the reason which caused him to behave in the way  you have seen.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 70, Number 572: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to visit me during my ailment which  had been aggravated during Hajjat-al-Wada&#8217;. I said to him, &#8220;You see how sick I am. I  have much property but have no heir except my only daughter May I give two thirds of my  property in charity?&#8221;! He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Half of it?&#8221; He  said, &#8220;No.&#8221; I said &#8220;One third?&#8221; He said, &#8220;One third is too much,  for to leave your heirs rich is better than to leave them poor, begging of others. Nothing  you spend seeking Allah&#8217;s pleasure but you shall get a reward for it, even for what you  put in the mouth of your wife.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 70, Number 573: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah&#8217;s Apostle was on his death-bed and in the house  there were some people among whom was &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab, the Prophet said, &#8220;Come,  let me write for you a statement after which you will not go astray.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said,  &#8220;The Prophet is seriously ill and you have the Qur&#8217;an; so the Book of Allah is enough  for us.&#8221; The people present in the house differed and quarrelled. Some said &#8220;Go  near so that the Prophet may write for you a statement after which you will not go  astray,&#8221; while the others said as Umar said. When they caused a hue and cry before  the Prophet, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Go away!&#8221; Narrated &#8216;Ubaidullah: Ibn &#8216;Abbas  used to say, &#8220;It was very unfortunate that Allah&#8217;s Apostle was prevented from writing  that statement for them because of their disagreement and noise.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 70, Number 574: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated As-Sa&#8217;ib: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My aunt took me to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! My nephew is- ill.&#8221; The Prophet touched my head with his hand and  invoked Allah to bless me. He then performed ablution and I drank of the remaining water  of his ablution and then stood behind his back and saw &#8220;Khatam An-Nubuwwa&#8221; (The  Seal of Prophethood) between his shoulders like a button of a tent. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 70, Number 575: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;None of you should wish for death  because of a calamity befalling him; but if he has to wish for death, he should say:  &#8220;O Allah! Keep me alive as long as life is better for me, and let me die if death is  better for me.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 70, Number 576: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Qais bin Abi Hazim: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We went to pay a visit to Khabbab (who was sick) and he had  been branded (cauterized) at seven places in his body. He said, &#8220;Our companions who  died (during the lifetime of the Prophet) left (this world) without having their rewards  reduced through enjoying the pleasures of this life, but we have got (so much) wealth that  we find no way to spend It except on the construction of buildings Had the Prophet not  forbidden us to wish for death, I would have wished for it.&#8217; We visited him for the second  time while he was building a wall. He said, A Muslim is rewarded (in the Hereafter) for  whatever he spends except for something that he spends on building.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 70, Number 577: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;The good deeds of any  person will not make him enter Paradise.&#8221; (i.e., None can enter Paradise through his  good deeds.) They (the Prophet&#8217;s companions) said, &#8216;Not even you, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8217; He  said, &#8220;Not even myself, unless Allah bestows His favor and mercy on me.&#8221; So be  moderate in your religious deeds and do the deeds that are within your ability: and none  of you should wish for death, for if he is a good doer, he may increase his good deeds,  and if he is an evil doer, he may repent to Allah.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard the Prophet , who was resting against me, saying,  &#8220;O Allah! Excuse me and bestow Your Mercy on me and let me join with the highest  companions (in Paradise).&#8221; See Qur&#8217;an (4.69) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle paid a visit to a patient, or a  patient was brought to him, he used to invoke Allah, saying, &#8220;Take away the disease,  O the Lord of the people!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet came to me while I was ill. He performed  ablution and threw the remaining water on me (or said, &#8220;Pour it on him) &#8221; When I  came to my senses I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have no son or father to be my heir,  so how will be my inheritance?&#8221; Then the Verse of inheritance was revealed. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah&#8217;s Apostle emigrated to Medina, Abu Bakr and  Bilal had a fever. I entered upon them and said, &#8220;O my father! How are you? O Bilal!  How are you?&#8221; Whenever Abu Bakr got the fever he used to say, &#8220;Everybody is  staying alive with his people, yet death is nearer to him than his shoe laces.&#8221; And  when fever deserted Bilal, he would recite (two poetic verses): &#8220;Would that I could  stay overnight in a valley wherein I would be surrounded by Idhkhir and Jalil (two kinds  of good smelling grass). Would that one day I could drink of the water of Majinna, and  would that Shama and Tafil (two mountains at Mecca) would appear to me!&#8221; I went to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and informed him about that. He said, &#8220;O Allah! Make us love Medina  as much or more than we love Mecca, and make it healthy, and bless its Sa and its Mudd,  and take away its fever and put it in Al-Juhfa.&#8221; (See Hadith No 558) . </font></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Book 78:</p>
<h3 align="center">Oaths and Vows</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.078.618"></a>Volume 8, Book 78, Number 618:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr As-Siddiq had never broken his oaths till Allah revealed the expiation for the oaths. Then he said, &#8220;If I take an oath to do something and later on I find something else better than the first one, then I do what is better and make expiation for my oath.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 619:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Samura:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Samura! Do not seek to be a ruler, because if you are given authority for it, then you will be held responsible for it, but if you are given it without asking for it, then you will be helped in it (by Allah): and whenever you take an oath to do something and later you find that something else is better than the first, then do the better one and make expiation for your oath.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 620:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I went to the Prophet along with a group of Al-Ash&#8217;ariyin in order to request him to provide us with mounts. He said, &#8220;By Allah, I will not provide you with mounts and I haven&#8217;t got anything to mount you on.&#8221; Then we stayed there as long as Allah wished us to stay, and then three very nice looking she-camels were brought to him and he made us ride them. When we left, we, or some of us, said, &#8220;By Allah, we will not be blessed, as we came to the Prophet asking him for mounts, and he swore that he would not give us any mounts but then he did give us. So let us go back to the Prophet and remind him (of his oath).&#8221; When we returned to him (and reminded him of the fact), he said, &#8220;I did not give you mounts, but it is Allah Who gave you. By Allah, Allah willing, if I ever take an oath to do something and then I find something else than the first, I will make expiation for my oath and do the thing which is better (or do something which is better and give the expiation for my oath).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle employed an employee (to collect Zakat). The employee returned after completing his job and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

What about an employee whom we employ and then he comes and says, &#8216;This amount (of Zakat) is for you, and this (amount) was given to me as a present&#8217;? Why didn&#8217;t he stay at the house of his father and mother to see if he would be given presents or not? By Him in Whose Hand Muhammad&#8217;s soul is, none of you will steal anything of it (i.e. Zakat) but will bring it by carrying it over his neck on the Day of Resurrection. If it has been a camel, he will bring it (over his neck) while it will be grunting, and if it has been a cow, he will bring it (over his neck), while it will be mooing; and if it has been a sheep, he will bring it (over his neck) while it will be bleeding.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;I have preached you (Allah&#8217;s Message).&#8221; Abu Humaid said, &#8220;Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle raised his hands so high that we saw the whiteness of his armpits.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a relation of love and brotherhood between this tribe of Jarm and Al-Ash&#8217;ariyin. Once we were with Abu Musa Al-Ash&#8217;ari, and then a meal containing chicken was brought to Abu Musa, and there was present, a man from the tribe of Taimillah who was of red complexion as if he were from non-Arab freed slaves. Abu Musa invited him to the meal. He said, &#8220;I have seen chickens eating dirty things, so I deemed it filthy and took an oath that I would never eat chicken.&#8221; On that, Abu Musa said, &#8220;Get up, I will narrate to you about that. Once a group of the Ash&#8217;ariyin and I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and asked him to provide us with mounts; he said, &#8216;By Allah, I will never give you any mounts nor do I have anything to mount you on.&#8217; Then a few camels of war booty were brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle , and he asked about us, saying, &#8216;Where are the Ash-&#8216;ariyin?&#8217; He then ordered five nice camels to be given to us, and when we had departed, we said, &#8216;What have we done? Allah&#8217;s Apostle had taken the oath not to give us any mounts, and that he had nothing to mount us on, and later he gave us that we might ride? Did we take advantage of the fact that Allah&#8217;s Apostle had forgotten his oath? By Allah, we will never succeed.&#8217; So we went back to him and said to him, &#8216;We came to you to give us mounts, and you took an oath that you would not give us any mounts and that you had nothing to mount us on.&#8217; On that he said, &#8216;I did not provide you with mounts, but Allah did. By Allah, if I take an oath to do something, and then find something else better than it, I do that which is better and make expiation for the dissolution of the oath.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

As regards these three (acts of Hajj), thought so-and-so.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Do, and there is no harm,&#8221; concerning all those matters on that day. And so, on that day, whatever question he was asked, he said, &#8220;Do it, do it, and there is no harm therein.&#8221;</p>

They (the people) said, &#8220;It is Abu Israil who has vowed that he will stand and never sit down, and he will never come in the shade, nor speak to anybody, and will fast.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Order him to speak and let him come in the shade, and make him sit down, but let him complete his fast.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 696:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that he was asked about a man who had vowed that he would fast all the days of his life then the day of &#8216;Id al Adha or &#8216;Id-al-Fitr came. &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar said: You have indeed a good example in Allah&#8217;s Apostle. He did not fast on the day of &#8216;Id al Adha or the day of &#8216;Id-al-Fitr, and we do not intend fasting on these two days.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 697:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ziyad bin Jubair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was with Ibn &#8216;Umar when a man asked him, &#8220;I have vowed to fast every Tuesday or Wednesday throughout my life and if the day of my fasting coincided with the day of Nahr (the first day of &#8216;Id-al-Adha), (What shall I do?)&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Allah has ordered the vows to be fulfilled, and we are forbidden to fast on the day of Nahr.&#8221; The man repeated his question and Ibn &#8216;Umar repeated his former answer, adding nothing more.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 78, Number 698:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We went out in the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the day of (the battle of) Khaibar, and we did not get any gold or silver as war booty, but we got property in the form of things and clothes. Then a man called Rifa&#8217;a bin Zaid, from the tribe of Bani Ad-Dubaib, presented a slave named Mid&#8217;am to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Allah&#8217;s Apostle headed towards the valley of Al-Qura, and when he was in the valley of Al-Qura an arrow was thrown by an unidentified person, struck and killed Mid&#8217;am who was making a she-camel of Allah&#8217;s Apostle kneel down. The people said, &#8220;Congratulations to him (the slave) for gaining Paradise.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;No! By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, for the sheet which he stole from the war booty before its distribution on the day of Khaibar, is now burning over him.&#8221; When the people heard that, a man brought one or two Shiraks (leather straps of shoes) to the Prophet. The Prophet said, &#8220;A Shirak of fire, or two Shiraks of fire.&#8221;</p>

Were it not for some men who dislike to be left behind and for whom I do not  have means of conveyance, I would not stay away (from any Holy Battle). I would love to be  martyred in Allah&#8217;s Cause and come to life and then get, martyred and then come to life  and then get martyred and then get resurrected and then get martyred. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Huraira said, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;By Him in  Whose Hand my life is, I would love to fight in Allah&#8217;s Cause and then get martyred and  then resurrected (come to life) and then get martyred and then resurrected (come to life)  and then get martyred, and then resurrected (come to life) and then get martyred and then  resurrected (come to life).&#8221; Abu Huraira used to repeat those words three times and I  testify to it with Allah&#8217;s Oath. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;If I had gold equal to the mountain  of Uhud, I would love that, before three days had passed, not a single Dinar thereof  remained with me if I found somebody to accept it excluding some amount that I would keep  for the payment of my debts.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;If I had formerly known hat I  came to know lately, I would not have driven the Hadi with me and would have finished the  state of Ihram along with the people when they finished it </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 90, Number 336: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were in the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and we assumed  the state of Ihram of Hajj and arrived at Mecca on the fourth of Dhul-Hijja. The Prophet  ordered us to perform the Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba and (Sa&#8217;i) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa  and use our lhram just for &#8216;Umra, and finish the state of Ihram unless we had our Hadi  with us. None of us had the Hadi with him except the Prophet and Talha. 1AIj came from  Yemen and brought the Hadi with him. &#8216;Ali said, &#8216;I had assumed the state of Ihram with the  same intention as that with which Allah&#8217;s Apostle had assumed it. The people said,  &#8220;How can we proceed to Mina and our male organs are dribbling?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said, &#8220;If I had formerly known what I came to know latterly, I would not have brought  the Hadi, and had there been no Hadi with me, I would have finished my Ihram.&#8221; Suraqa  (bin Malik) met the Prophet while he was throwing pebbles at the Jamrat-al-&#8216;Aqaba, and  asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Is this (permitted) for us only?&#8221; The Prophet  replied. &#8220;No, it is forever&#8221; &#8216;Aisha had arrived at Mecca while she was  menstruating, therefore the Prophet ordered her to perform all the ceremonies of Hajj  except the Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba, and not to perform her prayers unless and until she  became clean . When they encamped at Al-Batha, &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! You  are proceeding after performing both Hajj and &#8216;Umra while I am proceeding with Hajj  only?&#8221; So the Prophet ordered &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr As-Siddiq to go with her to  At-Tan&#8217;im, and so she performed the &#8216;Umra in Dhul-Hijja after the days of the Hajj. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 90, Number 337: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>One night the Prophet was unable to sleep and said,  &#8220;Would that a righteous man from my companions guarded me tonight.&#8221; Suddenly we  heard the clatter of arms, whereupon the Prophet said, &#8220;Who is it?&#8221; It was said,  &#8220;I am Sa&#8217;d, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have come to guard you.&#8221; The Prophet then slept  so soundly that we heard him snoring. Abu &#8216;Abdullah said: &#8216;Aisha said: Bilal said,  &#8220;Would that I but stayed overnight in a valley with Idhkhir and Jalil (two kinds of  grass) around me (i.e., in Mecca).&#8221; Then I told that to the Prophet . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 90, Number 338: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Not to wish to be the like  except of two men. A man whom Allah has given the (knowledge of the) Qur&#8217;an and he recites  it during the hours of night and day and the one who wishes says: If I were given the same  as this (man) has been given, I would do what he does, and a man whom Allah has given  wealth and he spends it in the just and right way, in which case the one who wishes says,  &#8216;If I were given the same as he has been given, I would do what he does.&#8217; &#8221; (See  Hadith No. 543 and 544, Vol 6) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>If I had not heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;You should not  long for death,&#8221; I would have longed (for it). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Qais: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We went to pay a visit to Khabbab bin Al-Art and he had got  himself branded at seven spots over his body. He said, &#8220;If Allah&#8217;s Apostle had not  forbidden us to invoke Allah for death, I would have invoked for it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(the Maula of &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Azhar) Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said, &#8220;None of you should long for death, for if he is a good man, he may increase  his good deeds, and if he is an evil-doer, he may stop the evil deeds and repent.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara&#8217; bin &#8216;Azib: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet was carrying earth with us on the day of the  battle of Al-Ahzab (confederates) and I saw that the dust was covering the whiteness of  his abdomen, and he (the Prophet ) was saying, &#8220;(O Allah) ! Without You, we would not  have been guided, nor would we have given in charity, nor would we have prayed. So (O  Allah!) please send tranquility (Sakina) upon us as they, (the chiefs of the enemy tribes)  have rebelled against us. And if they intend affliction (i.e. want to frighten us and  fight against us) then we would not (flee but withstand them). And the Prophet used to  raise his voice with it. (See Hadith No. 430 and 432, Vol. 5) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 90, Number 343: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Abi Aufa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Do not long for meeting your  enemy, and ask Allah for safety (from all sorts of evil).&#8221; (See Hadith No. 266, Vol.  4) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Qasim bin Muhammad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn &#8216;Abbas mentioned the case of a couple on whom the  judgment of Lian has been passed. &#8216;Abdullah bin Shaddad said, &#8220;Was that the lady in  whose case the Prophet said, &#8220;If I were to stone a lady to death without a proof  (against her)?&#8217; &#8220;Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;No! That was concerned with a woman who  though being a Muslim used to arouse suspicion by her outright misbehavior.&#8221; (See  Hadith No. 230, Vol.7) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>One night the Prophet delayed the Isha&#8217; prayer whereupon  &#8216;Umar went to him and said, &#8220;The prayer, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The women and children  had slept.&#8221; The Prophet came out with water dropping from his head, and said,  &#8220;Were I not afraid that it would be hard for my followers (or for the people), I  would order them to pray Isha prayer at this time.&#8221; (Various versions of this Hadith  are given by the narrators with slight differences in expression but not in content). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet fasted Al-Wisal on the last days of the month.  Some people did the same, and when the news reached the Prophet he said, &#8220;If the  month had been prolonged for me, then I would have fasted Wisal for such a long time that  the most exaggerating ones among you would have given up their exaggeration. I am not like  you; my Lord always makes me eat and drink.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle forbade Al-Wisal. The people said (to him),  &#8220;But you fast Al-&#8216;Wisal,&#8221; He said, &#8220;Who among you is like me? When I sleep  (at night), my Lord makes me eat and drink. But when the people refused to give up  Al-Wisal, he fasted Al-Wisal along with them for two days and then they saw the crescent  whereupon the Prophet said, &#8220;If the crescent had not appeared I would have fasted for  a longer period,&#8221; as if he intended to punish them herewith. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked the Prophet about the wall (outside the Ka&#8217;ba).  &#8220;Is it regarded as part of the Ka&#8217;ba?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; I said,  &#8220;Then why didn&#8217;t the people include it in the Ka&#8217;ba?&#8221; He said, &#8220;(Because)  your people ran short of money.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;Then why is its gate so high?&#8221;  He replied, &#8221;Your people did so in order to admit to it whom they would and forbid whom  they would. Were your people not still close to the period of ignorance, and were I not  afraid that their hearts might deny my action, then surely I would include the wall in the  Ka&#8217;ba and make its gate touch the ground.&#8221; </font></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Book 87: </font></p>
<h3 align="center"><font>Interpretation of Dreams </font></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.087.111">Volume 9, Book 87, Number 111: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The commencement of the Divine Inspiration to Allah&#8217;s  Apostle was in the form of good righteous (true) dreams in his sleep. He never had a dream  but that it came true like bright day light. He used to go in seclusion (the cave of) Hira  where he used to worship(Allah Alone) continuously for many (days) nights. He used to take  with him the journey food for that (stay) and then come back to (his wife) Khadija to take  his food like-wise again for another period to stay, till suddenly the Truth descended  upon him while he was in the cave of Hira. The angel came to him in it and asked him to  read. The Prophet replied, &#8220;I do not know how to read.&#8221; (The Prophet added),  &#8220;The angel caught me (forcefully) and pressed me so hard that I could not bear it  anymore. He then released me and again asked me to read, and I replied, &#8220;I do not  know how to read,&#8221; whereupon he caught me again and pressed me a second time till I  could not bear it anymore. He then released me and asked me again to read, but again I  replied, &#8220;I do not know how to read (or, what shall I read?).&#8221; Thereupon he  caught me for the third time and pressed me and then released me and said, &#8220;Read: In  the Name of your Lord, Who has created (all that exists). Has created man from a clot.  Read and Your Lord is Most Generous&#8230;up to&#8230;.. ..that which he knew not.&#8221; (96.15) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle returned with the Inspiration, his  neck muscles twitching with terror till he entered upon Khadija and said, &#8220;Cover me!  Cover me!&#8221; They covered him till his fear was over and then he said, &#8220;O Khadija,  what is wrong with me?&#8221; Then he told her everything that had happened and said, &#8216;I  fear that something may happen to me.&#8221; Khadija said, &#8216;Never! But have the glad  tidings, for by Allah, Allah will never disgrace you as you keep good reactions with your  Kith and kin, speak the truth, help the poor and the destitute, serve your guest  generously and assist the deserving, calamity-afflicted ones.&#8221; Khadija then  accompanied him to (her cousin) Waraqa bin Naufal bin Asad bin &#8216;Abdul &#8216;Uzza bin Qusai.  Waraqa was the son of her paternal uncle, i.e., her father&#8217;s brother, who during the  Pre-Islamic Period became a Christian and used to write the Arabic writing and used to  write of the Gospels in Arabic as much as Allah wished him to write. He was an old man and  had lost his eyesight. Khadija said to him, &#8220;O my cousin! Listen to the story of your  nephew.&#8221; Waraqa asked, &#8220;O my nephew! What have you seen?&#8221; The Prophet  described whatever he had seen. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Waraqa said, &#8220;This is the same Namus (i.e., Gabriel,  the Angel who keeps the secrets) whom Allah had sent to Moses. I wish I were young and  could live up to the time when your people would turn you out.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle  asked, &#8220;Will they turn me out?&#8221; Waraqa replied in the affirmative and said:  &#8220;Never did a man come with something similar to what you have brought but was treated  with hostility. If I should remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then I  would support you strongly.&#8221; But after a few days Waraqa died and the Divine  Inspiration was also paused for a while and the Prophet became so sad as we have heard  that he intended several times to throw himself from the tops of high mountains and every  time he went up the top of a mountain in order to throw himself down, Gabriel would appear  before him and say, &#8220;O Muhammad! You are indeed Allah&#8217;s Apostle in truth&#8221;  whereupon his heart would become quiet and he would calm down and would return home. And  whenever the period of the coming of the inspiration used to become long, he would do as  before, but when he used to reach the top of a mountain, Gabriel would appear before him  and say to him what he had said before.

So, if someone has a dream which he  dislikes, he should not tell it to others, but get up and offer a prayer.&#8221; He added,  &#8220;He (Abu Huraira) hated to see a Ghul (i.e., iron collar around his neck in a dream)  and people liked to see fetters (on their feet in a dream). The fetters on the feet  symbolizes one&#8217;s constant and firm adherence to religion.&#8221; And Abu &#8216;Abdullah said,  &#8220;Ghuls (iron collars) are used only for necks.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Um Al-&#8216;Ala an Ansari woman who had given the Pledge of  allegiance to Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;&#8216;Uthman bin Maz&#8217;un came in our share when the  Ansars drew lots to distribute the emigrants (to dwell) among themselves, He became sick  and we looked after (nursed) him till he died. Then we shrouded him in his clothes.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to us, I (addressing the dead body) said, &#8220;May Allah&#8217;s Mercy be  on you, O Aba As-Sa&#8217;ib! I testify that Allah has honored you.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8216;How  do you know that?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;I do not know, by Allah.&#8217; He said, &#8216;As for him, death has  come to him and I wish him all good from Allah. By Allah, though I am Allah&#8217;s Apostle, I  neither know what will happen to me, nor to you.'&#8221; Um Al-&#8216;Ala said, &#8220;By Allah, I  will never attest the righteousness of anybody after that.&#8221; She added, &#8220;Later I  saw in a dream, a flowing spring for &#8216;Uthman. So I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and mentioned  that to him. He said, &#8216;That is (the symbol of) his good deeds (the reward for) which is  going on for him.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Men from the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to see  dreams during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and they used to narrate those dreams to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Allah&#8217;s Apostle would interpret them as Allah wished. I was a young man  and used to stay in the mosque before my wedlock. I said to myself, &#8220;If there were  any good in myself, I too would see what these people see.&#8221; So when I went to bed one  night, I said, &#8220;O Allah! If you see any good in me, show me a good dream.&#8221; So  while I was in that state, there came to me (in a dream) two angels. In the hand of each  of them, there was a mace of iron, and both of them were taking me to Hell, and I was  between them, invoking Allah, &#8220;O Allah! I seek refuge with You from Hell.&#8221; Then  I saw myself being confronted by another angel holding a mace of iron in his hand. He said  to me, &#8220;Do not be afraid, you will be an excellent man if you only pray more  often.&#8221; So they took me till they stopped me at the edge of Hell, and behold, it was  built inside like a well and it had side posts like those of a well, and beside each post  there was an angel carrying an iron mace. I saw therein many people hanging upside down  with iron chains, and I recognized therein some men from the Quraish. Then (the angels)  took me to the right side. I narrated this dream to (my sister) Hafsa and she told it to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;No doubt, &#8216;Abdullah is a good man.&#8221;  (Nafi&#8217; said, &#8220;Since then &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar used to pray much.) </font></p>

I said, &#8220;O Allah! If there is any good for me with You, then show me a dream  so that Allah&#8217;s Apostle may interpret it for me.&#8221; So I slept and saw (in a dream) two  angels came to me and took me along with them, and they met another angel who said to me,  &#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid, you are a good man.&#8221; They took me towards the Fire, and  behold, it was built inside like a well, and therein I saw people some of whom I  recognized, and then the angels took me to the right side. In the morning, I mentioned  that dream to Hafsa. Hafsa told me that she had mentioned it to the Prophet and he said,  &#8220;&#8216;Abdullah is a righteous man if he only prays more at night.&#8221; (Az-Zuhri said,  &#8220;After that, &#8216;Abdullah used to pray more at night.&#8221;) </font></p>

And I saw cows (being slaughtered) there, but the reward given by Allah is better (than  worldly benefits). Behold, those cows proved to symbolize the believers (who were killed)  on the Day (of the battle) of Uhud, and the good (which I saw in the dream) was the good  and the reward and the truth which Allah bestowed upon us after the Badr battle. (or the  Battle of Uhud) and that was the victory bestowed by Allah in the Battle of Khaibar and  the conquest of Mecca) . </font></p>

Am I right or wrong?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;You  are right in some of it and wrong in some.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet!  By Allah, you must tell me in what I was wrong.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Do not  swear.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 87, Number 171: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Samura bin Jundub: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle very often used to ask his companions,  &#8220;Did anyone of you see a dream?&#8221; So dreams would be narrated to him by those  whom Allah wished to tell. One morning the Prophet said, &#8220;Last night two persons came  to me (in a dream) and woke me up and said to me, &#8216;Proceed!&#8217; I set out with them and we  came across a man Lying down, and behold, another man was standing over his head, holding  a big rock. Behold, he was throwing the rock at the man&#8217;s head, injuring it. The rock  rolled away and the thrower followed it and took it back. By the time he reached the man,  his head returned to the normal state. The thrower then did the same as he had done  before. I said to my two companions, &#8216;Subhan Allah! Who are these two persons?&#8217; They said,  &#8216;Proceed!&#8217; So we proceeded and came to a man Lying flat on his back and another man  standing over his head with an iron hook, and behold, he would put the hook in one side of  the man&#8217;s mouth and tear off that side of his face to the back (of the neck) and similarly  tear his nose from front to back and his eye from front to back. Then he turned to the  other side of the man&#8217;s face and did just as he had done with the other side. He hardly  completed this side when the other side returned to its normal state. Then he returned to  it to repeat what he had done before. I said to my two companions, &#8216;Subhan Allah! Who are  these two persons?&#8217; They said to me, &#8216;Proceed!&#8217; So we proceeded and came across something  like a Tannur (a kind of baking oven, a pit usually clay-lined for baking bread).&#8221; I  think the Prophet said, &#8220;In that oven t here was much noise and voices.&#8221; The  Prophet added, &#8220;We looked into it and found naked men and women, and behold, a flame  of fire was reaching to them from underneath, and when it reached them, they cried loudly.  I asked them, &#8216;Who are these?&#8217; They said to me, &#8216;Proceed!&#8217; And so we proceeded and came  across a river.&#8221; I think he said, &#8220;&#8230;. red like blood.&#8221; The Prophet added,  &#8220;And behold, in the river there was a man swimming, and on the bank there was a man  who had collected many stones. Behold. while the other man was swimming, he went near him.  The former opened his mouth and the latter (on the bank) threw a stone into his mouth  whereupon he went swimming again. He returned and every time the performance was repeated,  I asked my two companions, &#8216;Who are these (two) persons?&#8217; They replied, &#8216;Proceed!  Proceed!&#8217; And we proceeded till we came to a man with a repulsive appearance, the most  repulsive appearance, you ever saw a man having! Beside him there was a fire and he was  kindling it and running around it. I asked my companions, &#8216;Who is this (man)?&#8217; They said  to me, &#8216;Proceed! Proceed!&#8217; So we proceeded till we reached a garden of deep green dense  vegetation, having all sorts of spring colors. In the midst of the garden there was a very  tall man and I could hardly see his head because of his great height, and around him there  were children in such a large number as I have never seen. I said to my companions, &#8216;Who  is this?&#8217; They replied, &#8216;Proceed! Proceed!&#8217; So we proceeded till we came to a majestic  huge garden, greater and better than I have ever seen! My two companions said to me, &#8216;Go  up and I went up&#8217; The Prophet added, &#8220;So we ascended till we reached a city built of  gold and silver bricks and we went to its gate and asked (the gatekeeper) to open the  gate, and it was opened and we entered the city and found in it, men with one side of  their bodies as handsome as the handsomest person you have ever seen, and the other side  as ugly as the ugliest person you have ever seen. My two companions ordered those men to  throw themselves into the river. Behold, there was a river flowing across (the city), and  its water was like milk in whiteness. Those men went and threw themselves in it and then  returned to us after the ugliness (of their bodies) had disappeared and they became in the  best shape.&#8221; The Prophet further added, &#8220;My two companions (angels) said to me,  &#8216;This place is the Eden Paradise, and that is your place.&#8217; I raised up my sight, and  behold, there I saw a palace like a white cloud! My two companions said to me, &#8216;That  (palace) is your place.&#8217; I said to them, &#8216;May Allah bless you both! Let me enter it.&#8217; They  replied, &#8216;As for now, you will not enter it, but you shall enter it (one day) I said to  them, &#8216;I have seen many wonders tonight. What does all that mean which I have seen?&#8217; They  replied, &#8216;We will inform you: As for the first man you came upon whose head was being  injured with the rock, he is the symbol of the one who studies the Quran and then neither  recites it nor acts on its orders, and sleeps, neglecting the enjoined prayers. As for the  man you came upon whose sides of mouth, nostrils and eyes were torn off from front to  back, he is the symbol of the man who goes out of his house in the morning and tells so  many lies that it spreads all over the world. And those naked men and women whom you saw  in a construction resembling an oven, they are the adulterers and the adulteresses;, and  the man whom you saw swimming in the river and given a stone to swallow, is the eater of  usury (Riba) and the bad looking man whom you saw near the fire kindling it and going  round it, is Malik, the gatekeeper of Hell and the tall man whom you saw in the garden, is  Abraham and the children around him are those children who die with Al-Fitra (the Islamic  Faith).&#8221; The narrator added: Some Muslims asked the Prophet, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  What about the children of pagans?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;And also the children  of pagans.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;My two companions added, &#8216;The men you saw half  handsome and half ugly were those persons who had mixed an act that was good with another  that was bad, but Allah forgave them.'&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;And those who invoke not with Allah, any other god. Nor  kill, such life as Allah has forbidden except for just cause nor commit illegal sexual  intercourse. And whoever does this shall receive the punishment.&#8217; (25.68) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Miqdad bin &#8216;Amr Al-Kindi: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>An ally of Bani Zuhra who took part in the battle of Badr  with the Prophet, that he said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! If I meet an unbeliever and we  have a fight, and he strikes my hand with the sword and cuts it off, and then takes refuge  from me under a tree, and says, &#8216;I have surrendered to Allah (i.e. embraced Islam),&#8217; may I  kill him after he has said so?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Do not kill him.&#8221;  Al-Miqdad said, &#8220;But O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He had chopped off one of my hands and he  said that after he had cut it off. May I kill him?&#8221; The Prophet said. &#8220;Do not  kill him for if you kill him, he would be in the position in which you had been before you  kill him, and you would be in the position in which he was before he said the  sentence.&#8221; The Prophet also said to Al-Miqdad, &#8220;If a faithful believer conceals  his faith (Islam) from the disbelievers, and then when he declares his Islam, you kill  him, (you will be sinful). Remember that you were also concealing your faith (Islam) at  Mecca before.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent us (to fight) against Al-Huraqa (one  of the sub-tribes) of Juhaina. We reached those people in the morning and defeated them.

When we reached (Medina),  this news reached the Prophet. He said to me, &#8220;O Usama! You killed him after he had  said, &#8216;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah?&#8221;&#8216; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! He said so in order to save himself.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;You killed him  after he had said, &#8216;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah.&#8221; The Prophet kept  on repeating that statement till I wished I had not been a Muslim before that day. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the year of the Conquest of Mecca, the tribe of Khuza&#8217;a  killed a man from the tribe of Bam Laith in revenge for a killed person belonging to them  in the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up saying, &#8220;Allah held  back the (army having) elephants from Mecca, but He let His Apostle and the believers  overpower the infidels (of Mecca). Beware! (Mecca is a sanctuary)! Verily! Fighting in  Mecca was not permitted for anybody before me, nor will it be permitted for anybody after  me; It was permitted for me only for a while (an hour or so) of that day. No doubt! It is  at this moment a sanctuary; its thorny shrubs should not be uprooted; its trees should not  be cut down; and its Luqata (fallen things) should not be picked up except by the one who  would look for its owner. And if somebody is killed, his closest relative has the right to  choose one of two things, i.e., either the Blood money or retaliation by having the killer  killed.&#8221; Then a man from Yemen, called Abu Shah, stood up and said, &#8220;Write that)  for me, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said (to his companions), &#8220;Write  that for Abu Shah.&#8221; Then another man from Quraish got up, saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! Except Al-Idhkhir (a special kind of grass) as we use it in our houses and for  graves.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Except Al-idhkkir.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>For the children of Israel the punishment for crime was  Al-Qisas only (i.e., the law of equality in punishment) and the payment of Blood money was  not permitted as an alternate. But Allah said to this nation (Muslims): &#8216;O you who  believe! Qisas is prescribed for you in case of murder, &#8230;..(up to) &#8230;end of the Verse.  (2.178) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn &#8216;Abbas added: Remission (forgiveness) in this Verse,  means to accept the Blood-money in an intentional murder. Ibn &#8216;Abbas added: The Verse:  &#8216;Then the relatives should demand Blood-money in a reasonable manner.&#8217; (2.178) means that  the demand should be reasonable and it is to be compensated with handsome gratitude. </font></p>

If fifty of them testified that a married man had committed illegal sexual intercourse in  Damascus but they had not seen him (doing so), would you stone him?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;No.&#8221; I said, &#8220;If fifty of them testified that a man had committed theft in  Hums, would you cut off his hand though they did not see him?&#8221; He replied,  &#8220;No.&#8221; I said, &#8220;By Allah, Allah&#8217;s Apostle never killed anyone except in one  of the following three situations: (1) A person who killed somebody unjustly, was killed  (in Qisas,) (2) a married person who committed illegal sexual intercourse and (3) a man  who fought against Allah and His Apostle and deserted Islam and became an apostate.&#8221;  Then the people said, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t Anas bin Malik narrate that Allah&#8217;s Apostle cut off the  hands of the thieves, branded their eyes and then, threw them in the sun?&#8221; I said,  &#8220;I shall tell you the narration of Anas. Anas said: &#8220;Eight persons from the  tribe of &#8216;Ukl came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and gave the Pledge of allegiance for Islam (became  Muslim). The climate of the place (Medina) did not suit them, so they became sick and  complained about that to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. He said (to them ), &#8220;Won&#8217;t you go out with  the shepherd of our camels and drink of the camels&#8217; milk and urine (as medicine)?&#8221;  They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; So they went out and drank the camels&#8217; milk and urine, and  after they became healthy, they killed the shepherd of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and took away all  the camels. This news reached Allah&#8217;s Apostle , so he sent (men) to follow their traces  and they were captured and brought (to the Prophet). He then ordered to cut their hands  and feet, and their eyes were branded with heated pieces of iron, and then he threw them  in the sun till they died.&#8221; I said, &#8220;What can be worse than what those people  did? They deserted Islam, committed murder and theft.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then &#8216;Anbasa bin Said said, &#8220;By Allah, I never heard a  narration like this of today.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O &#8216;Anbasa! You deny my narration?&#8221;  &#8216;Anbasa said, &#8220;No, but you have related the narration in the way it should be  related. By Allah, these people are in welfare as long as this Sheikh (Abu Qilaba) is  among them.&#8221; I added, &#8220;Indeed in this event there has been a tradition set by  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. The narrator added: Some Ansari people came to the Prophet and discussed  some matters with him, a man from amongst them went out and was murdered. Those people  went out after him, and behold, their companion was swimming in blood. They returned to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said to him, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, we have found our companion who  had talked with us and gone out before us, swimming in blood (killed).&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle went out and asked them, &#8220;Whom do you suspect or whom do you think has killed  him?&#8221; They said, &#8220;We think that the Jews have killed him.&#8221; The Prophet sent  for the Jews and asked them, &#8220;Did you kill this (person)?&#8221; They replied,  &#8220;No.&#8221; He asked the Al-Ansars, &#8220;Do you agree that I let fifty Jews take an  oath that they have not killed him?&#8221; They said, &#8220;It matters little for the Jews  to kill us all and then take false oaths.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Then would you like to  receive the Diya after fifty of you have taken an oath (that the Jews have killed your  man)?&#8221; They said, &#8220;We will not take the oath.&#8221; Then the Prophet himself  paid them the Diya (Blood-money).&#8221; The narrator added, &#8220;The tribe of Hudhail  repudiated one of their men (for his evil conduct) in the Pre-lslamic period of Ignorance.  </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then, at a place called Al-Batha&#8217; (near Mecca), the man  attacked a Yemenite family at night to steal from them, but a. man from the family noticed  him and struck him with his sword and killed him. The tribe of Hudhail came and captured  the Yemenite and brought him to &#8216;Umar during the Hajj season and said, &#8220;He has killed  our companion.&#8221; The Yemenite said, &#8220;But these people had repudiated him (i.e.,  their companion).&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Let fifty persons of Hudhail swear that they had  not repudiated him.&#8221; So forty-nine of them took the oath and then a person belonging  to them, came from Sham and they requested him to swear similarly, but he paid  one-thousand Dirhams instead of taking the oath. They called another man instead of him  and the new man shook hands with the brother of the deceased. Some people said, &#8220;We  and those fifty men who had taken false oaths (Al-Qasama) set out, and when they reached a  place called Nakhlah, it started raining so they entered a cave in the mountain, and the  cave collapsed on those fifty men who took the false oath, and all of them died except the  two persons who had shaken hands with each other. They escaped death but a stone fell on  the leg of the brother of the deceased and broke it, whereupon he survived for one year  and then died.&#8221; I further said, &#8220;&#8216;Abdul Malik bin Marwan sentenced a man to  death in Qisas (equality in punishment) for murder, basing his judgment on Al-Qasama, but  later on he regretted that judgment and ordered that the names of the fifty persons who  had taken the oath (Al-Qasama), be erased from the register, and he exiled them in  Sham.&#8221; </font></p>

So when Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw him, he said (to him), &#8220;If  I had been sure that you were looking at me (through the door), I would have poked your  eye with this (sharp iron bar).&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle added, &#8220;The asking for  permission to enter has been enjoined so that one may not look unlawfully (at what there  is in the house without the permission of its people).&#8221; </font></p>

While I was  passing by the Jews, I heard him saying, &#8216;By Him Who chose Moses above all the human  beings.&#8217; I said (protestingly), &#8216;Even above Muhammad?&#8217; So I became furious and slapped  him.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Do not give me preference to other prophets, for the  people will become unconscious on the Day of Resurrection and I will be the first to gain  conscious, and behold, I will Find Moses holding one of the pillars of the Throne (of  Allah). Then I will not know whether he has become conscious before me or he has been  exempted because of his unconsciousness at the mountain (during his worldly life) which he  received.&#8221; </font></p>

The dearest of his property to him was Bairuha garden which was  facing the (Prophet&#8217;s) Mosque. Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to enter it and drink of its good  fresh water. When the Holy Verse:&#8211; &#8216;By no means shall you attain righteousness unless you  spend (in charity) of that which you love.&#8217; (3.92) was revealed, Abu Talha got up and  said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah says: By no means shall you attain righteousness  unless you spend of that which you love,&#8217; and the dearest of my property to me is the  Bairuha garden and I want to give it in charity in Allah&#8217;s Cause, seeking to be rewarded  by Allah for that. So you can spend it, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, where-ever Allah instructs you.  &#8216; Allah s Apostle said, &#8220;Good! That is a perishable (or profitable) wealth&#8221;  (&#8216;Abdullah is in doubt as to which word was used.) He said, &#8220;I have heard what you  have said but in my opinion you&#8217;d better give it to your kith and kin.&#8221; On that Abu  Talha said, &#8220;I will do so, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; Abu Talha distributed that garden  among his kith and kin and cousins. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle, the truthful and truly-inspired, said,  &#8220;Each one of you collected in the womb of his mother for forty days, and then turns  into a clot for an equal period (of forty days) and turns into a piece of flesh for a  similar period (of forty days) and then Allah sends an angel and orders him to write four  things, i.e., his provision, his age, and whether he will be of the wretched or the  blessed (in the Hereafter). Then the soul is breathed into him. And by Allah, a person  among you (or a man) may do deeds of the people of the Fire till there is only a cubit or  an arm-breadth distance between him and the Fire, but then that writing (which Allah has  ordered the angel to write) precedes, and he does the deeds of the people of Paradise and  enters it; and a man may do the deeds of the people of Paradise till there is only a cubit  or two between him and Paradise, and then that writing precedes and he does the deeds of  the people of the Fire and enters it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 594: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah puts an angel in charge of  the uterus and the angel says, &#8216;O Lord, (it is) semen! O Lord, (it is now ) a clot! O  Lord, (it is now) a piece of flesh.&#8217; And then, if Allah wishes to complete its creation,  the angel asks, &#8216;O Lord, (will it be) a male or a female? A wretched (an evil doer) or a  blessed (doer of good)? How much will his provisions be? What will his age be?&#8217; So all  that is written while the creature is still in the mother&#8217;s womb.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 595: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Imran bin Husain: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Can the people of  Paradise be known (differentiated) from the people of the Fire; The Prophet replied,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;Why do people (try to) do (good) deeds?&#8221; The  Prophet said, &#8220;Everyone will do the deeds for which he has been created to do or he  will do those deeds which will be made easy for him to do.&#8221; (i.e. everybody will find  easy to do such deeds as will lead him to his destined place for which he has been  created). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet ; was asked about the offspring of the pagans.  He said, &#8220;Allah knows what they would have done (were they to live).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle was asked about the offspring of the  pagans. He said, &#8220;Allah knows what they would have done (were they to live).&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;No child  is born but has the Islamic Faith, but its parents turn it into a Jew or a Christian. It  is as you help the animals give birth. Do you find among their offspring a mutilated one  before you mutilate them yourself?&#8221; The people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What do  you think about those (of them) who die young?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah knows  what they would have done (were they to live).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;No woman should ask for the  divorce of her sister (Muslim) so as to take her place, but she should marry the man  (without compelling him to divorce his other wife), for she will have nothing but what  Allah has written for her.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Usama: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once while I was with the Prophet and Sa&#8217;d, Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b  and Mu&#8217;adh were also sitting with him, there came to him a messenger from one of his  daughters, telling him that her child was on the verge of death. The Prophet told the  messenger to tell her, &#8220;It is for Allah what He takes, and it is for Allah what He  gives, and everything has its fixed time (limit). So (she should) be patient and look for  Allah&#8217;s reward.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 600: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That while he was sitting with the Prophet a man from the  Ansar came and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We get slave girls from the war captives and  we love property; what do you think about coitus interruptus?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said,  &#8220;Do you do that? It is better for you not to do it, for there is no soul which Allah  has ordained to come into existence but will be created.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.077.601"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 601: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Hudhaifa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet once delivered a speech in front of us wherein  he left nothing but mentioned (about) everything that would happen till the Hour. Some of  us stored that our minds and some forgot it. (After that speech) I used to see events  taking place (which had been referred to in that speech) but I had forgotten them (before  their occurrence). Then I would recognize such events as a man recognizes another man who  has been absent and then sees and recognizes him. </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.077.602"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 602: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ali: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While we were sitting with the Prophet who had a stick with  which he was scraping the earth, he lowered his head and said, &#8220;There is none of you  but has his place assigned either in the Fire or in Paradise.&#8221; Thereupon a man from  the people said, &#8220;Shall we not depend upon this, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;No, but carry on and do your deeds, for everybody finds it easy to do such  deeds (as will lead him to his place).&#8221; The Prophet then recited the Verse: &#8216;As for  him who gives (in charity) and keeps his duty to Allah..&#8217; (92.5) </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.077.603"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 603: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We witnessed along with Allah&#8217;s Apostle the Khaibar  (campaign). Allah&#8217;s Apostle told his companions about a man who claimed to be a Muslim,  &#8220;This man is from the people of the Fire.&#8221; When the battle started, the man  fought very bravely and received a great number of wounds and got crippled. On that, a man  from among the companions of the Prophet came and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Do you  know what the man you described as of the people of the Fire has done? He has fought very  bravely for Allah&#8217;s Cause and he has received many wounds.&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;But he is indeed one of the people of the Fire.&#8221; Some of the Muslims were about  to have some doubt about that statement. So while the man was in that state, the pain  caused by the wounds troubled him so much that he put his hand into his quiver and took  out an arrow and committed suicide with it. Off went some men from among the Muslims to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah has made your statement true.  So-and-so has committed suicide.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Bilal! Get up and  announce in public: None will enter Paradise but a believer, and Allah may support this  religion (Islam) with a wicked man.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.077.604"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 604: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl bin Sa&#8217;d: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>There was a man who fought most bravely of all the Muslims  on behalf of the Muslims in a battle (Ghazwa) in the company of the Prophet. The Prophet  looked at him and said. &#8220;If anyone would like to see a man from the people of the  Fire, let him look at this (brave man).&#8221; On that, a man from the People (Muslims)  followed him, and he was in that state i.e., fighting fiercely against the pagans till he  was wounded, and then he hastened to end his life by placing his sword between his breasts  (and pressed it with great force) till it came out between his shoulders. Then the man  (who was watching that person) went quickly to the Prophet and said, &#8220;I testify that  you are Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The Prophet asked him, &#8220;Why do you say that?&#8221; He  said, &#8220;You said about so-and-so, &#8216;If anyone would like to see a man from the people  of the Fire, he should look at him.&#8217; He fought most bravely of all of us on behalf of the  Muslims and I knew that he would not die as a Muslim (Martyr). So when he got wounded, he  hastened to die and committed suicide.&#8221; There-upon the Prophet said, &#8220;A man may  do the deeds of the people of the Fire while in fact he is one of the people of Paradise,  and he may do the deeds of the people of Paradise while in fact he belongs to the people  of Fire, and verily, (the rewards of) the deeds are decided by the last actions  (deeds)&#8221;. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet forbade vowing and said, &#8220;In fact, vowing  does not prevent anything, but it makes a miser to spend his property.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 606: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said (that Allah said), &#8220;Vowing does not  bring to the son of Adam anything I have not already written in his fate, but vowing is  imposed on him by way of fore ordainment. Through vowing I make a miser spend of his  wealth.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 607: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Musa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While we were with Allah&#8217;s Apostle in a holy battle, we  never went up a hill or reached its peak or went down a valley but raised our voices with  Takbir. Allah&#8217;s Apostle came close to us and said, &#8220;O people! Don&#8217;t exert yourselves,  for you do not call a deaf or an absent one, but you call the All-Listener, the  All-Seer.&#8221; The Prophet then said, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdullah bin Qais! Shall I teach you a  sentence which is from the treasures of Paradise? ( It is): &#8216;La haula wala quwata illa  billah. (There is neither might nor power except with Allah).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 608: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That the Prophet said, &#8220;No Caliph is appointed but has  two groups of advisors: One group advises him to do good and urges him to adopt it, and  the other group advises him to do bad and urges him to adopt it; and the protected is the  one whom Allah protects.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 609: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I did not see anything so resembling minor sins as what Abu  Huraira said from the Prophet, who said, &#8220;Allah has written for the son of Adam his  inevitable share of adultery whether he is aware of it or not: The adultery of the eye is  the looking (at something which is sinful to look at), and the adultery of the tongue is  to utter (what it is unlawful to utter), and the innerself wishes and longs for (adultery)  and the private parts turn that into reality or refrain from submitting to the  temptation.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.077.610"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 610: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(regarding the Verse) &#8220;And We granted the vision  (Ascension to the heavens &#8220;Miraj&#8221;) which We showed you (O Muhammad as an actual  eye witness) but as a trial for mankind.&#8217; (17.60): Allah&#8217;s Apostle actually saw with his  own eyes the vision (all the things which were shown to him) on the night of his Night  Journey to Jerusalem (and then to the heavens). The cursed tree which is mentioned in the  Qur&#8217;an is the tree of Az-Zaqqum. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.077.611"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 611: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Adam and Moses argued with each  other. Moses said to Adam. &#8216;O Adam! You are our father who disappointed us and turned us  out of Paradise.&#8217; Then Adam said to him, &#8216;O Moses! Allah favored you with His talk (talked  to you directly) and He wrote (the Torah) for you with His Own Hand. Do you blame me for  action which Allah had written in my fate forty years before my creation?&#8217; So Adam  confuted Moses, Adam confuted Moses,&#8221; the Prophet added, repeating the Statement  three times. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 612: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Warrad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(the freed slave of Al-Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba) Muawiya wrote to  Mughira. &#8216;Write to me what you heard the Prophet saying after his prayer.&#8217; So Al-Mughira  dictated to me and said, &#8220;I heard the Prophet saying after the prayer, &#8216;None has the  right to be worshipped but Allah Alone Who has no partner. O Allah! No-one can withhold  what You give, and none can give what You withhold, and the fortune of a man of means is  useless before You (i.e., only good deeds are of value).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 613: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Take refuge with Allah from the  difficulties of severe calamities, from having an evil end and a bad fate and from the  malicious joy of your enemies.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 614: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When taking an oath, the Prophet very often used to say,  &#8220;No, by Him Who turns the hearts.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 615: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said to Ibn Saiyad, &#8220;I have kept for you a  secret.&#8221; Ibn Saiyad said, &#8220;Ad-Dukh.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Keep quiet,  for you cannot go beyond your limits (or you cannot exceed what has been foreordained for  you).&#8221; On that, &#8216;Umar said (to the Prophet ), &#8220;Allow me to chop off his  neck!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Leave him, for if he is he (i.e., Ad-Dajjal), then you  will not be able to overcome him, and if he is not, then you gain no good by killing  him.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 616: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about the plague. He said,  &#8220;That was a means of torture which Allah used to send upon whom-so-ever He wished,  but He made it a source of mercy for the believers, for anyone who is residing in a town  in which this disease is present, and remains there and does not leave that town, but has  patience and hopes for Allah&#8217;s reward, and knows that nothing will befall him except what  Allah has written for him, then he will get such reward as that of a martyr.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 77, Number 617: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara&#8217; bin &#8216;Azib: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I saw the Prophet on the Day of (the battle of) Al-Khandaq,  carrying earth with us and saying, &#8220;By Allah, without Allah we would not have been  guided, neither would we have fasted, nor would we have prayed. O Allah! Send down Sakina  (calmness) upon us and make our feet firm when we meet (the enemy). The pagans have  rebelled against us, but if they want to put us in affliction (i.e., fight us) we refuse  (to flee).&#8221; (See Hadith No. 430, Vol. 5). </font></p>

He stood up, and after glorifying  and praising Allah as He deserved, said, &#8220;To proceed, I have come to know that some  of you men are narrating things which are neither in Allah&#8217;s Book, nor has been mentioned  by Allah&#8217;s Apostle . Such people are the ignorant among you. Beware of such vain desires  that mislead those who have them. I have heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;This matter (of  the caliphate) will remain with the Quraish, and none will rebel against them, but Allah  will throw him down on his face as long as they stick to the rules and regulations of the  religion (Islam).'&#8221; </font></p>

(During the campaign) he became angry with them and said, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t the Prophet  order you to obey me?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I order you to  collect wood and make a fire and then throw yourselves into it.&#8221; So they collected  wood and made a fire, but when they were about to throw themselves into, it they started  looking at each other, and some of them said, &#8220;We followed the Prophet to escape from  the fire. How should we enter it now?&#8221; So while they were in that state, the fire  extinguished and their commander&#8217;s anger abated. The event was mentioned to the Prophet  and he said, &#8220;If they had entered it (the fire) they would never have come out of it,  for obedience is required only in what is good.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 629.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said on the Day of (the battle of) Hunain,  &#8220;Whoever has killed an infidel and has a proof or a witness for it, then the salb  (arms and belongings of that deceased) will be for him.&#8221; I stood up to seek a witness  to testify that I had killed an infidel but I could not find any witness and then sat  down. Then I thought that I should mention the case to Allah&#8217;s Apostle I (and when I did  so) a man from those who were sitting with him said, &#8220;The arms of the killed person  he has mentioned, are with me, so please satisfy him on my behalf.&#8221; Abu Bakr said,  &#8220;No, he will not give the arms to a bird of Quraish and deprive one of Allah&#8217;s lions  of it who fights for the cause of Allah and His Apostle.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle I stood up  and gave it to me, and I bought a garden with its price, and that was my first property  which I owned through the war booty. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people of Hijaz said, &#8220;A judge should not pass a  judgment according to his knowledge, whether he was a witness at the time he was the judge  or before that&#8221; And if a litigant gives a confession in favor of his opponent in the  court, in the opinion of some scholars, the judge should not pass a judgment against him  till the latter calls two witnesses to witness his confession. And some people of Iraq  said, &#8220;A judge can pass a judgement according to what he hears or witnesses (the  litigant&#8217;s confession) in the court itself, but if the confession takes place outside the  court, he should not pass the judgment unless two witnesses witness the confession.&#8221;  Some of them said, &#8220;A judge can pass a judgement depending on his knowledge of the  case as he is trust-worthy, and that a witness is Required just to reveal the truth. The  judge&#8217;s knowledge is more than the witness.&#8221; Some said, &#8220;A judge can judge  according to his knowledge only in cases involving property, but in other cases he  cannot.&#8221; Al-Qasim said, &#8220;A judge ought not to pass a judgment depending on his  knowledge if other people do not know what he knows, although his knowledge is more than  the witness of somebody else because he might expose himself to suspicion by the Muslims  and cause the Muslims to have unreasonable doubt. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet sent my father and Mu&#8217;adh bin Jabal to Yemen  and said (to them), &#8220;Make things easy for the people and do not put hurdles in their  way, and give them glad tiding, and don&#8217;t let them have aversion (i.e. to make people to  hate good deeds) and you both should work in cooperation and mutual understanding&#8221;  Abu Musa said to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, &#8220;In our country a special alcoholic drink called  Al-Bit&#8217;, is prepared (for drinking).&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Every intoxicant is  prohibited. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet appointed a man from the tribe of Bani Asad,  called Ibn Al-Utabiyya to collect the Zakat. When he returned (with the money) he said (to  the Prophet), &#8220;This is for you and this has been given to me as a gift.&#8221; The  Prophet stood up on the pulpit (Sufyan said he ascended the pulpit), and after glorifying  and praising Allah, he said, &#8220;What is wrong with the employee whom we send (to  collect Zakat from the public) that he returns to say, &#8216;This is for you and that is for  me?&#8217; Why didn&#8217;t he stay at his father&#8217;s and mother&#8217;s house to see whether he will be given  gifts or not? By Him in Whose Hand my life is, whoever takes anything illegally will bring  it on the Day of Resurrection by carrying it over his neck: if it is a camel, it will be  grunting: if it is a cow, it will be mooing: and if it is a sheep it will be  bleating!&#8221; The Prophet then raised both his hands till we saw the whiteness of his  armpits (and he said), &#8220;No doubt! Haven&#8217;t I conveyed Allah&#8217;s Message?&#8221; And he  repeated it three times. </font></p>

Go back so  that your &#8216;Urafa&#8217; may submit your decision to us.&#8221; So the people returned and their  &#8216;Urafa&#8217; talked to them and then came back to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and told him that the people  had given their consent happily and permitted (their captives to be freed). </font></p>

(This is) my brother&#8217;s son whom my brother has asked me to take into my custody.&#8221;  &#8216;Abd bin Zam&#8217;a got up before him and said, (He is) my brother and the son of the slave  girl of my father, and was born on my father&#8217;s bed.&#8221; So they both submitted their  case before Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Sa&#8217;d said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! This boy is the son of my  brother and he entrusted him to me.&#8221; &#8216;Abd bin Zam&#8217;a said, &#8220;This boy is my  brother and the son of the slave girl of my father, and was born on the bed of my  father.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The boy is for you, O &#8216;Abd bin Zam&#8217;a!&#8221; Then  Allah&#8217;s Apostle further said, &#8220;The child is for the owner of the bed, and the stone  is for the adulterer,&#8221; He then said to Sauda bint Zam&#8217;a, &#8220;Veil (screen) yourself  before him,&#8221; when he saw the child&#8217;s resemblance to &#8216;Utba.

Saba&#8217;na! &#8221;  Khalid kept on killing some of them and taking some others as captives, and he gave a  captive to everyone of us and ordered everyone of us to kill his captive.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>There was some quarrel (sighting) among Bani &#8216;Amr, and when  this news reached the Prophet, he offered the Zuhr prayer and went to establish peace  among them. In the meantime the time of &#8216;Asr prayer was due, Bilal pronounced the Adhan  and then the Iqama for the prayer and requested Abu Bakr (to lead the prayer) and Abu Bakr  went forward. The Prophet arrived while Abu Bakr was still praying. He entered the rows of  praying people till he stood behind Abu Bakr in the (first) row. The people started  clapping, and it was the habit of Abu Bakr that whenever he stood for prayer, he never  glanced side-ways till he had finished it, but when Abu Bakr observed that the clapping  was not coming to an end, he looked and saw the Prophet standing behind him. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet beckoned him to carry on by waving his hand.  Abu Bakr stood there for a while, thanking Allah for the saying of the Prophet and then he  retreated, taking his steps backwards. When the Prophet saw that, he went ahead and led  the people in prayer. When he finished the prayer, he said, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! What  prevented you from carrying on with the prayer after I beckoned you to do so?&#8221; Abu  Bakr replied, &#8220;It does not befit the son of Abi Quhafa to lead the Prophet in  prayer.&#8221; Then the Prophet said to the people, &#8220;If some problem arises during  prayers, then the men should say, Subhan Allah!; and the women should clap.&#8221; (See  Hadith No. 652, Vol. 1) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 89, Number 301: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Zaid bin Thabit: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Bakr sent for me owing to the large number of  casualties in the battle of Al-Yamama, while &#8216;Umar was sitting with him. Abu Bakr said (to  me), &#8216;Umar has come to my and said, &#8216;A great number of Qaris of the Holy Quran were killed  on the day of the battle of Al-Yamama, and I am afraid that the casualties among the Qaris  of the Quran may increase on other battle-fields whereby a large part of the Quran may be  lost. Therefore I consider it advisable that you (Abu Bakr) should have the Qur&#8217;an  collected.&#8217; I said, &#8216;How dare I do something which Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not do?&#8217; &#8216;Umar  said, By Allah, it is something beneficial.&#8217; &#8216;Umar kept on pressing me for that till Allah  opened my chest for that for which He had opened the chest of &#8216;Umar and I had in that  matter, the same opinion as &#8216;Umar had.&#8221; Abu Bakr then said to me (Zaid), &#8220;You  are a wise young man and we do not have any suspicion about you, and you used to write the  Divine Inspiration for Allah&#8217;s Apostle. So you should search for the fragmentary scripts  of the Quran and collect it (in one Book).&#8221; Zaid further said: By Allah, if Abu Bakr  had ordered me to shift a mountain among the mountains from one place to another it would  not have been heavier for me than this ordering me to collect the Qur&#8217;an. Then I said (to  &#8216;Umar and Abu Bakr), &#8220;How can you do something which Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not  do?&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;By Allah, it is something beneficial.&#8221; Zaid added: So  he (Abu Bakr) kept on pressing me for that until Allah opened my chest for that for which  He had opened the chests of Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar, and I had in that matter, the same opinion  as theirs. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So I started compiling the Quran by collecting it from the  leafless stalks of the date-palm tree and from the pieces of leather and hides and from  the stones, and from the chests of men (who had memorized the Quran). I found the last  verses of Sirat-at-Tauba: (&#8220;Verily there has come unto you an Apostle (Muhammad) from  amongst yourselves&#8211;&#8216; (9.128-129) ) from Khuzaima or Abi Khuzaima and I added to it the  rest of the Sura. The manuscripts of the Quran remained with Abu Bakr till Allah took him  unto Him. Then it remained with &#8216;Umar till Allah took him unto Him, and then with Hafsa  bint &#8216;Umar. </font></p>

Then Muhaiyisa was informed that Abdullah had been killed and  thrown in a pit or a spring. Muhaiyisa went to the Jews and said, &#8220;By Allah, you have  killed my companion.&#8221; The Jews said, &#8220;By Allah, we have not killed him.&#8221;  Muhaiyisa then came back to his people and told them the story. He, his elder brother  Huwaiyisa and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Sahl came (to the Prophet) and he who had been at Khaibar,  proceeded to speak, but the Prophet said to Muhaiyisa, &#8220;The eldest! The eldest!&#8221;  meaning, &#8220;Let the eldest of you speak.&#8221; So Huwaiyisa spoke first and then  Muhaiyisa. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The Jews should either pay the blood money of your  (deceased) companion or be ready for war.&#8221; After that Allah&#8217;s Apostle wrote a letter  to the Jews in that respect, and they wrote that they had not killed him. Then Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said to Huwaiyisa, Muhaiyisa and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman, &#8220;Can you take an oath by  which you will be entitled to take the blood money?&#8221; They said, &#8220;No.&#8221; He  said (to them), &#8220;Shall we ask the Jews to take an oath before you?&#8221; They  replied, &#8220;But the Jews are not Muslims.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave them  one-hundred she-camels as blood money from himself. Sahl added: When those she-camels were  made to enter the house, one of them kicked me with its leg. </font></p>

The people said to me, &#8216;Your son is to be stoned to death,&#8217; so  I ransomed my son for one hundred sheep and a slave girl. Then I asked the religious  learned men and they said to me, &#8216;Your son has to receive one hundred lashes plus one year  of exile.&#8217; &#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I shall judge between you according to Allah&#8217;s  Book (Laws)! As for the slave girl and the sheep, it shall be returned to you, and your  son shall receive one-hundred lashes and be exiled for one year. O you, Unais!&#8221; The  Prophet addressed some man, &#8220;Go in the morning to the wife of this man and stone her  to death.&#8221; So Unais went to her the next morning and stoned her to death. </font></p>

I do not want to see any of you carrying a grunting camel or a  mooing cow or a bleating sheep on meeting Allah.&#8221; Then the Prophet raised both his  hands till I saw the whiteness of his armpits, and said, &#8220;(No doubt)!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Miswar bin Makhrama: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The group of people whom &#8216;Umar had selected as candidates  for the Caliphate gathered and consulted each other. Abdur-Rahman said to them, &#8220;I am  not going to compete with you in this matter, but if you wish, I would select for you a  caliph from among you.&#8221; So all of them agreed to let &#8216;Abdur-Rahman decide the case.  So when the candidates placed the case in the hands of &#8216;Abdur-Rahman, the people went  towards him and nobody followed the rest of the group nor obeyed any after him. So the  people followed &#8216;Abdur-Rahman and consulted him all those nights till there came the night  we gave the oath of allegiance to &#8216;Uthman. Al-Miswar (bin Makhrama) added: &#8216;Abdur-Rahman  called on me after a portion of the night had passed and knocked on my door till I got up,  and he said to me, &#8220;I see you have been sleeping! By Allah, during the last three  nights I have not slept enough. Go and call Az-Zubair and Sa&#8217;d.&#8217; So I called them for him  and he consulted them and then called me saying, &#8216;Call &#8216;Ali for me.&#8221; I called &#8216;Ali  and he held a private talk with him till very late at night, and then &#8216;Al, got up to leave  having had much hope (to be chosen as a Caliph) but &#8216;Abdur-Rahman was afraid of something  concerning &#8216;Ali. &#8216;Abdur-Rahman then said to me, &#8220;Call &#8216;Uthman for me.&#8221; I called  him and he kept on speaking to him privately till the Mu&#8217;adhdhin put an end to their talk  by announcing the Adhan for the Fajr prayer. When the people finished their morning prayer  and that (six men) group gathered near the pulpit, &#8216;Abdur-Rahman sent for all the  Muhajirin (emigrants) and the Ansar present there and sent for the army chief who had  performed the Hajj with &#8216;Umar that year. When all of them had gathered, &#8216;Abdur-Rahman  said, &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah,&#8221; and added, &#8220;Now  then, O &#8216;Ali, I have looked at the people&#8217;s tendencies and noticed that they do not  consider anybody equal to &#8216;Uthman, so you should not incur blame (by disagreeing).&#8221;  Then &#8216;Abdur-Rahman said (to &#8216;Uthman), &#8220;I gave the oath of allegiance to you on  condition that you will follow Allah&#8217;s Laws and the traditions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the  traditions of the two Caliphs after him.&#8221; So &#8216;Abdur-Rahman gave the oath of  allegiance to him, and so did the people including the Muhajirin (emigrants) and the Ansar  and the chiefs of the army staff and all the Muslims. </font></p>

(2) a man who gives a pledge of allegiance to an Imam (ruler) and gives it only for  worldly benefits, if the Imam gives him what he wants, he abides by his pledge, otherwise  he does not fulfill his pledge; (3) and a man who sells something to another man after the  &#8216;Asr prayer and swears by Allah (a false oath) that he has been offered so much for it  whereupon the buyer believes him and buys it although in fact, the seller has not been  offered such a price.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 838, Vol. 3) </font></p>

The Prophet  added: Whoever amongst you fulfill his pledge, his reward will be with Allah, and whoever  commits any of those sins and receives the legal punishment in this world for that sin,  then that punishment will be an expiation for that sin, and whoever commits any of those  sins and Allah does not expose him, then it is up to Allah if He wishes He will punish him  or if He wishes, He will forgive him.&#8221; So we gave the Pledge for that.

But if Muhammad is dead, Allah  nevertheless has kept the light amongst you from which you can receive the same guidance  as Allah guided Muhammad with that. And Abu Bakr is the companion of Allah&#8217;s Apostle He is  the second of the two in the cave. He is the most entitled person among the Muslims to  manage your affairs. Therefore get up and swear allegiance to him.&#8221; Some people had  already taken the oath of allegiance to him in the shed of Bani Sa&#8217;ida but the oath of  allegiance taken by the public was taken at the pulpit.

<h3 align="center">Al-Adha Festival Sacrifice (Adaahi)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.068.453"></a>Volume 7, Book 68, Number 453:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said (on the day of Idal-Adha), &#8220;The first thing we will do on this day of ours, is to offer the (&#8216;Id) prayer and then return to slaughter the sacrifice. Whoever does so, he acted according to our Sunna (tradition), and whoever slaughtered (the sacrifice) before the prayer, what he offered was just meat he presented to his family, and that will not be considered as Nusak (sacrifice).&#8221; (On hearing that) Abu Burda bin Niyar got up, for he had slaughtered the sacrifice before the prayer, and said, &#8220;I have got a six month old ram.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8216;Slaughter it (as a sacrifice) but it will not be sufficient for any-one else (as a sacrifice after you). Al-Bara&#8217; added: The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever slaughtered (the sacrifice) after the prayer, he slaughtered it at the right time and followed the tradition of the Muslims.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 454:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever slaughtered the sacrifice before the prayer, he just slaughtered it for himself, and whoever slaughtered it after the prayer, he slaughtered it at the right time and followed the tradition of the Muslims.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 455:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Uqba bin &#8216;Amir Al-Juhani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that the Prophet distributed among his companions some animals for sacrifice (to be slaughtered on &#8216;Id-al-Adha). &#8216;Uqba&#8217;s share was a Jadha&#8217;a (a six month old goat). &#8216;Uqba said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I get in my share of Jadha&#8217;a (a six month old ram).&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Slaughter it as a sacrifice.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 456:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that the Prophet entered upon her when she had her menses at Sarif before entering Mecca, and she was weeping (because she was afraid that she would not be able to perform the Hajj). The Prophet said, &#8220;What is wrong with you? Have you got your period?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;This is a matter Allah has decreed for all the daughters of Adam, so perform all the ceremonies of Hajj like the others, but do not perform the Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added: When we were at Mina, beef was brought to me and I asked, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; They (the people) said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle has slaughtered some cows as sacrifices on behalf of his wives.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 457:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said on the day of Nahr, &#8220;Whoever has slaughtered his sacrifice before the prayer, should repeat it (slaughter another sacrifice).&#8221; A man got up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! This is a day on which meat is desired.&#8221; He then mentioned his neighbors saying, &#8220;I have a six month old ram which is to me better than the meat of two sheep.&#8221; The Prophet allowed him to slaughter it as a sacrifice, but I do not know whether this permission was valid for other than that man or not. The Prophet then went towards two rams and slaughtered them, and then the people went towards some sheep and distributed them among themselves.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 458:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Time has come back to its original state which it had on the day Allah created the Heavens and the Earth. The year is twelve months, four of which are sacred, three of them are in succession, namely Dhul-Qa&#8217;da, Dhul Hijja and Muharram, (the fourth being) Rajab Mudar which is between Juma&#8217;da (ath-thamj and Sha&#8217;ban. The Prophet then asked, &#8220;Which month is this?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Allah and his Apostle know better.&#8221; He kept silent so long that we thought that he would call it by a name other than its real name. He said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the month of Dhul-Hijja?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Which town is this?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; He kept silent so long that we thought that he would call it t,y a name other than its real name. He said, &#8220;isn&#8217;t it the town (of Mecca)?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;What day is today?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; He kept silent so long that we thought that he would call it by a name other than its real name. He said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the day of Nahr?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He then said, &#8220;Your blood, properties and honor are as sacred to one another as this day of yours in this town of yours in this month of yours. You will meet your Lord, and He will ask you about your deeds. Beware! Do not go astray after me by cutting the necks of each other. It is incumbent upon those who are present to convey this message to those who are absent, for some of those to whom it is conveyed may comprehend it better than some of those who have heard it directly.&#8221; (Muhammad, the sub-narrator, on mentioning this used to say: The Prophet then said, &#8220;No doubt! Haven&#8217;t I delivered (Allah&#8217;s) Message (to you)? Haven&#8217;t I delivered Allah&#8217;s message (to you)?&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah (bin &#8216;Umar) used to slaughter his sacrifice at the slaughtering place (i.e the slaughtering place of the Prophet ) .

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 460:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to offer two rams as sacrifices, and I also used to offer two rams.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 461:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 462:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Uqba bin &#8216;Amir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that the Prophet gave him some sheep to distribute among his companions to slaughter as sacrifices (&#8216;Id&#8211;al&#8211;Adha). A kid was left and he told the Prophet of that whereupon he said to him, &#8220;Slaughter it as a sacrifice (on your behalf).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 463:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara&#8217; bin &#8216;Azib:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An uncle of mine called Abu Burda, slaughtered his sacrifice before the &#8216;Id prayer. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to him, &#8220;Your (slaughtered) sheep was just mutton (not a sacrifice).&#8221; Abu Burda said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have got a domestic kid.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Slaughter it (as a sacrifice) but it will not be permissible for anybody other than you&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;Whoever slaughtered his sacrifice before the (&#8216;Id) prayer, he only slaughtered for himself, and whoever slaughtered it after the prayer, he offered his sacrifice properly and followed the tradition of the Muslims.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 464:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Burda slaughtered (the sacrifice) before the (&#8216;Id) prayer whereupon the Prophet said to him, &#8220;Slaughter another sacrifice instead of that.&#8221; Abu Burda said, &#8220;I have nothing except a Jadha&#8217;a.&#8221; (Shu&#8217;ba said: Perhaps Abu Burda also said that Jadha&#8217;a was better than an old sheep in his opinion.) The Prophet said, &#8220;(Never mind), slaughter it to make up for the other one, but it will not be sufficient for anyone else after you.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 465:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet slaughtered two rams, black and white in color (as sacrifices), and I saw him putting his foot on their sides and mentioning Allah&#8217;s Name and Takbir (Allahu Akbar). Then he slaughtered them with his own hands.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle entered upon me at Sarif while I was weeping (because I was afraid that I would not be able to perform the ,Hajj). He said, &#8220;What is wrong with you? Have you got your period?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;This is a matter Allah has decreed for all the daughters of Adam, so perform the ceremonies of the Hajj as the pilgrims do, but do not perform the Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle slaughtered some cows as sacrifices on behalf of his wives.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 68, Number 467:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard the Prophet delivering a sermon, and he said (on the Day of &#8216;Id-Allah. a), &#8220;The first thing we will do on this day of ours is that we will offer the &#8216;Id prayer, then we will return and slaughter our sacrifices; and whoever does so, then indeed he has followed our tradition, and whoever slaughtered his sacrifice (before the prayer), what he offered was just meat that he presented to his family, and that was not a sacrifice.&#8221; Abu Burda got up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I slaughtered the sacrifice before the prayer and I have got a Jadha&#8217;a which is better than an old sheep.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Slaughter it to make up for that, but it will not be sufficient for anybody else after you.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever slaughtered the sacrifice before the &#8216;Id prayer, should repeat it (slaughter another one).&#8221; A man said &#8220;This is the day on which meat is desired.&#8221; Then he mentioned the need of his neighbors (for meat) and the Prophet seemed to accept his excuse. The man said, &#8220;I have a Jadha&#8217;a which is to me better than two sheep.&#8221; The Prophet allowed him (to slaughter it as a sacrifice). But I do not know whether this permission was general for all Muslims or not. The Prophet then went towards two rams and slaughtered them, and the people went towards their sheep and slaughtered them.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">One day Allah&#8217;s Apostle offered the &#8216;Id prayer and said, &#8220;Whoever offers our prayer and faces our Qibla should not slaughter the sacrifice till he finishes the &#8216;Id prayer.&#8221; Abu Burda bin Niyar got up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have already done it. The Prophet said, &#8220;That is something you have done before its due time.&#8221; Abu Burda said, &#8220;I have a Jadha&#8217;a which is better than two old sheep; shall I slaughter it?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes, but it will not be sufficient for anyone after you.&#8221;</p>

Masruq added, I heard the clapping of her hands behind the curtain. She said, &#8220;I used to twist the garlands for the Hadi of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and he used to send his Hadi to Ka&#8217;ba but he never used to regard as unlawful what was lawful for men to do with their wives till the people returned (from the Hajj).&#8221;</p>

<h3 align="center">Expiation for Unfulfilled Oaths</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.079.699"></a>Volume 8, Book 79, Number 699:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ka&#8217;b bin &#8216;Ujra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I came to the Prophet and he said to me, &#8220;Come near.&#8221; So I went near to him and he said, &#8220;Are your lice troubling you?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;(Shave your head and) make expiation in the form of fasting, Sadaqa (giving in charity), or offering a sacrifice.&#8221; (The sub-narrator) Aiyub said, &#8220;Fasting should be for three days, and the Nusuk (sacrifice) is to be a sheep, and the Sadaqa is to be given to six poor persons.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 700:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;I am ruined!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;What is the matter with you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I had sexual relation with my wife (while I was fasting) in Ramadan.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Have you got enough to manumit a slave?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Can you fast for two successive months?&#8221; The man said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Can you feed sixty poor persons?&#8221; The man said, &#8220;No.&#8221; Then the Prophet said to him, &#8220;Sit down,&#8221; and he sat down. Afterwards an &#8216;Irq, i.e., a big basket containing dates was brought to the Prophet and the Prophet said to him, &#8220;Take this and give it in charity.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;To poorer people than we?&#8221; On that, the Prophet smiled till his premolar teeth became visible, and then told him, &#8220;Feed your family with it.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 157, Vol 3)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 701:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;I am ruined!&#8221; The Prophet said to him, &#8220;What is the matter?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have done a sexual relation with my wife (while fasting) in Ramadan.&#8221; The Prophet said to him?&#8221; &#8220;Can you afford to manumit a slave?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Can you fast for two successive months?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Can you feed sixty poor persons?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; Then an Ansari man came with an Irq (a big basket full of dates). The Prophet said (to the man), &#8220;Take this (basket) and give it in charity.&#8221; That man said, &#8220;To poorer people than we, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle? By Him Who has sent you with the Truth! There is no house in between the two mountains (of the city of Medina) poorer than we.&#8221; So the Prophet said (to him), &#8220;Go and feed it to your family.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 702:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to the Prophets and said, &#8220;I am ruined!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;What is the matter with you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have done a sexual relation with my wife (while fasting) in Ramadan&#8221; The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Can you afford to manumit a slave?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Can you fast for two successive months?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Can you feed sixty poor persons?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have nothing.&#8221; Later on an Irq (big basket) containing dates was given to the Prophet, and the Prophet said (to him), &#8220;Take this basket and give it in charity.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;To poorer people than we? Indeed, there is nobody between its (i.e., Medina&#8217;s) two mountains who is poorer than we.&#8221; The Prophet then said, &#8220;Take it and feed your family with it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 703:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Ju&#8217;aid bin Abdur-Rahman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Sa&#8217;ib bin Yazid said, &#8220;The Sa&#8217; at the time of the Prophet was equal to one Mudd plus one-third of a Mudd of your time, and then it was increased in the time of Caliph &#8216;Umar bin &#8216;Abdul Aziz.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 704:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Umar used to give the Zakat of Ramadan (Zakat-al-Fitr) according to the Mudd of the Prophet, the first Mudd, and he also used to give things for expiation for oaths according to the Mudd of the Prophet. Abu Qutaiba said, &#8220;Malik said to us, &#8216;Our Mudd (i.e., of Medina) is better than yours and we do not see any superiority except in the Mudd of the Prophet!&#8217; Malik further said, to me, &#8216;If a ruler came to you and fixed a Mudd smaller than the one of the Prophet, by what Mudd would you measure what you give (for expiation or Zakat-al-Fitr?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;We would give it according to the Mudd of the Prophet&#8217; On that, Malik said, &#8216;Then, don&#8217;t you see that we have to revert to the Mudd of the Prophet ultimately?'&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 705:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Allah! Bestow Your Blessings on their measures, Sa&#8217; and Mudd (i.e., of the people of Medina) &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;If somebody manumits a Muslim slave, Allah will save from the Fire every part of his body for freeing the corresponding parts of the slave&#8217;s body, even his private parts will be saved from the Fire) because of freeing the slave&#8217;s private parts.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 707:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jabir said: An Ansari man made his slave a Mudabbar and he had no other property than him. When the Prophet heard of that, he said (to his companions), &#8220;Who wants to buy him (i.e., the slave) for me?&#8221; Nu&#8217;aim bin An-Nahham bought him for eight hundred Dirhams. I heard Jabir saying, &#8220;That was a coptic slave who died in the same year.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 708:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that she intended to buy Barira (a slave girl) and her masters stipulated that they would have her Wala&#8217;. When &#8216;Aisha mentioned that to the Prophet ; he said, &#8220;Buy her, for the Wala&#8217; is for the one who manumits.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 709:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ash&#8217;ari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle along with a group of people from (the tribe of) Al-Ash&#8217;ari, asking for mounts. The Prophet said, &#8220;By Allah, I will not give you anything to ride, and I have nothing to mount you on.&#8221; We stayed there as long as Allah wished, and after that, some camels were brought to the Prophet and he ordered that we be given three camels. When we set out, some of us said to others, &#8220;Allah will not bless us, as we all went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle asking him for mounts, and although he had sworn that he would not give us mounts, he did give us.&#8221; So we returned to the Prophet; and mentioned that to him. He said, &#8220;I have not provided you with mounts, but Allah has. By Allah, Allah willing, if I ever take an oath, and then see that another is better than the first, I make expiration for my (dissolved) oath, and do what is better and make expiration.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 710:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hammad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">the same narration above (i.e. 709), &#8220;I make expiation for my dissolved oath, and I do what is better, or do what is better and make expiation.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 711:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Prophet) Solomon said, &#8220;Tonight I will sleep with (my) ninety wives, each of whom will get a male child who will fight for Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221; On that, his companion (Sufyan said that his companion was an angel) said to him, &#8220;Say, &#8220;If Allah will (Allah willing).&#8221; But Solomon forgot (to say it). He slept with all his wives, but none of the women gave birth to a child, except one who gave birth to a halfboy. Abu Huraira added: The Prophet said, &#8220;If Solomon had said, &#8220;If Allah will&#8221; (Allah willing), he would not have been unsuccessful in his action, and would have attained what he had desired.&#8221; Once Abu Huraira added: Allah apostle said, &#8220;If he had accepted.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 712:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zahdam al-Jarmi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were sitting with Abu Musa Al-Ash&#8217;sari, and as there were ties of friendship and mutual favors between us and his tribe. His meal was presented before him and there was chicken meat in it. Among those who were present there was a man from Bani Taimillah having a red complexion as a non-Arab freed slave, and that man did not approach the meal. Abu Musa said to him, &#8220;Come along! I have seen Allah&#8217;s Apostle eating of that (i.e., chicken).&#8221; The man said, &#8220;I have seen it (chickens) eating something I regarded as dirty, and so I have taken an oath that I shall not eat (its meat) chicken.&#8221; Abu Musa said, &#8220;Come along! I will inform you about it (i.e., your oath).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once we went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle in company with a group of Ash&#8217;airiyin, asking him for mounts while he was distributing some camels from the camels of Zakat. (Aiyub said, &#8220;I think he said that the Prophet was in an angry mood at the time.&#8221;) The Prophet said, &#8216;By Allah! I will not give you mounts, and I have nothing to mount you on.&#8217; After we had left, some camels of booty were brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and he said, &#8220;Where are those Ash&#8217;ariyin? Where are those Ash&#8217;ariyin?&#8221; So we went (to him) and he gave us five very fat good-looking camels. We mounted them and went away, and then I said to my companions, &#8216;We went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to give us mounts, but he took an oath that he would not give us mounts, and then later on he sent for us and gave us mounts, perhaps Allah&#8217;s Apostle forgot his oath. By Allah, we will never be successful, for we have taken advantage of the fact that Allah&#8217;s Apostle forgot to fulfill his oath. So let us return to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to remind him of his oath.&#8217; We returned and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We came to you and asked you for mounts, but you took an oath that you would not give us mounts) but later on you gave us mounts, and we thought or considered that you have forgotten your oath.&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;Depart, for Allah has given you Mounts. By Allah, Allah willing, if I take an oath and then later find another thing better than that, I do what is better, and make expiation for the oath.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Samura:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;(O &#8216;Abdur-Rahman!) Do not seek to be a ruler, for, if you are given the authority of ruling without your asking for it, then Allah will help you; but if you are given it by your asking, then you will be held responsible for it (i.e. Allah will not help you ) . And if you take an oath to do something and later on find another thing, better than that, then do what is better and make expiation for (the dissolution of) your oath.&#8221;</p>

The climate of Medina did not suit them, so the Prophet ordered them to go  to the (herd of milch) camels of charity and to drink, their milk and urine (as a  medicine). They did so, and after they had recovered from their ailment (became healthy)  they turned renegades (reverted from Islam) and killed the shepherd of the camels and took  the camels away. The Prophet sent (some people) in their pursuit and so they were (caught  and) brought, and the Prophets ordered that their hands and legs should be cut off and  that their eyes should be branded with heated pieces of iron, and that their cut hands and  legs should not be cauterized, till they die. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A group of people from &#8216;Ukl (tribe) came to the Prophet and  they were living with the people of As-Suffa, but they became ill as the climate of Medina  did not suit them, so they said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Provide us with milk.&#8221; The  Prophet said, I see no other way for you than to use the camels of Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221;  So they went and drank the milk and urine of the camels, (as medicine) and became healthy  and fat. Then they killed the shepherd and took the camels away. When a help-seeker came  to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, he sent some men in their pursuit, and they were captured and brought  before mid day. The Prophet ordered for some iron pieces to be made red hot, and their  eyes were branded with them and their hands and feet were cut off and were not cauterized.  Then they were put at a place called Al-Harra, and when they asked for water to drink they  were not given till they died. (Abu Qilaba said, &#8220;Those people committed theft and  murder and fought against Allah and His Apostle.&#8221;) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A group of people from &#8216;Ukl (or &#8216;Uraina) tribe &#8212;-but I  think he said that they were from &#8216;Ukl came to Medina and (they became ill, so) the  Prophet ordered them to go to the herd of (Milch) she-camels and told them to go out and  drink the camels&#8217; urine and milk (as a medicine). So they went and drank it, and when they  became healthy, they killed the shepherd and drove away the camels. This news reached the  Prophet early in the morning, so he sent (some) men in their pursuit and they were  captured and brought to the Prophet before midday. He ordered to cut off their hands and  legs and their eyes to be branded with heated iron pieces and they were thrown at  Al-Harra, and when they asked for water to drink, they were not given water. (Abu Qilaba  said, &#8220;Those were the people who committed theft and murder and reverted to disbelief  after being believers (Muslims), and fought against Allah and His Apostle&#8221;). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Seven (people) will be shaded by  Allah by His Shade on the Day of Resurrection when there will be no shade except His  Shade. (They will be), a just ruler, a young man who has been brought up in the worship of  Allah, a man who remembers Allah in seclusion and his eyes are then flooded with tears, a  man whose heart is attached to mosques (offers his compulsory congregational prayers in  the mosque), two men who love each other for Allah&#8217;s Sake, a man who is called by a  charming lady of noble birth to commit illegal sexual intercourse with her, and he says,  &#8216;I am afraid of Allah,&#8217; and (finally), a man who gives in charity so secretly that his  left hand does not know what his right hand has given.&#8221; </font></p>

On that, Ibn Salam said to the Jew, &#8220;Lift up your hand.&#8221; Behold! The Divine  Verse of the Rajam was under his hand.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I used to teach (the Qur&#8217;an to) some people of the  Muhajirln (emigrants), among whom there was &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin &#8216;Auf. While I was in his  house at Mina, and he was with &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab during &#8216;Umar&#8217;s last Hajj, Abdur-Rahman  came to me and said, &#8220;Would that you had seen the man who came today to the Chief of  the Believers (&#8216;Umar), saying, &#8216;O Chief of the Believers! What do you think about  so-and-so who says, &#8216;If &#8216;Umar should die, I will give the pledge of allegiance to  such-and-such person, as by Allah, the pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr was nothing but a  prompt sudden action which got established afterwards.&#8217; &#8216;Umar became angry and then said,  &#8216;Allah willing, I will stand before the people tonight and warn them against those people  who want to deprive the others of their rights (the question of rulership).&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Abdur-Rahman said, &#8220;I said, &#8216;O Chief of the  believers! Do not do that, for the season of Hajj gathers the riff-raff and the rubble,  and it will be they who will gather around you when you stand to address the people. And I  am afraid that you will get up and say something, and some people will spread your  statement and may not say what you have actually said and may not understand its meaning,  and may interpret it incorrectly, so you should wait till you reach Medina, as it is the  place of emigration and the place of Prophet&#8217;s Traditions, and there you can come in touch  with the learned and noble people, and tell them your ideas with confidence; and the  learned people will understand your statement and put it in its proper place.&#8217; On that,  &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;By Allah! Allah willing, I will do this in the first speech I will deliver  before the people in Medina.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn Abbas added: We reached Medina by the end of the month  of Dhul-Hijja, and when it was Friday, we went quickly (to the mosque) as soon as the sun  had declined, and I saw Sa&#8217;id bin Zaid bin &#8216;Amr bin Nufail sitting at the corner of the  pulpit, and I too sat close to him so that my knee was touching his knee, and after a  short while &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab came out, and when I saw him coming towards us, I said to  Said bin Zaid bin &#8216;Amr bin Nufail &#8220;Today &#8216;Umar will say such a thing as he has never  said since he was chosen as Caliph.&#8221; Said denied my statement with astonishment and  said, &#8220;What thing do you expect &#8216;Umar to say the like of which he has never said  before?&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the meantime, &#8216;Umar sat on the pulpit and when the  callmakers for the prayer had finished their call, &#8216;Umar stood up, and having glorified  and praised Allah as He deserved, he said, &#8220;Now then, I am going to tell you  something which (Allah) has written for me to say. I do not know; perhaps it portends my  death, so whoever understands and remembers it, must narrate it to the others wherever his  mount takes him, but if somebody is afraid that he does not understand it, then it is  unlawful for him to tell lies about me. Allah sent Muhammad with the Truth and revealed  the Holy Book to him, and among what Allah revealed, was the Verse of the Rajam (the  stoning of married person (male &amp; female) who commits illegal sexual intercourse, and  we did recite this Verse and understood and memorized it. Allah&#8217;s Apostle did carry out  the punishment of stoning and so did we after him. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I am afraid that after a long time has passed, somebody  will say, &#8216;By Allah, we do not find the Verse of the Rajam in Allah&#8217;s Book,&#8217; and thus they  will go astray by leaving an obligation which Allah has revealed. And the punishment of  the Rajam is to be inflicted to any married person (male &amp; female), who commits  illegal sexual intercourse, if the required evidence is available or there is conception  or confession. And then we used to recite among the Verses in Allah&#8217;s Book: &#8216;O people! Do  not claim to be the offspring of other than your fathers, as it is disbelief  (unthankfulness) on your part that you claim to be the offspring of other than your real  father.&#8217; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Do not praise me excessively as Jesus, son of Marry  was praised, but call me Allah&#8217;s Slave and His Apostles.&#8217; (O people!) I have been informed  that a speaker amongst you says, &#8216;By Allah, if &#8216;Umar should die, I will give the pledge of  allegiance to such-and-such person.&#8217; One should not deceive oneself by saying that the  pledge of allegiance given to Abu Bakr was given suddenly and it was successful. No doubt,  it was like that, but Allah saved (the people) from its evil, and there is none among you  who has the qualities of Abu Bakr. Remember that whoever gives the pledge of allegiance to  anybody among you without consulting the other Muslims, neither that person, nor the  person to whom the pledge of allegiance was given, are to be supported, lest they both  should be killed. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>And no doubt after the death of the Prophet we were  informed that the Ansar disagreed with us and gathered in the shed of Bani Sa&#8217;da. &#8216;Ali and  Zubair and whoever was with them, opposed us, while the emigrants gathered with Abu Bakr.  I said to Abu Bakr, &#8216;Let&#8217;s go to these Ansari brothers of ours.&#8217; So we set out seeking  them, and when we approached them, two pious men of theirs met us and informed us of the  final decision of the Ansar, and said, &#8216;O group of Muhajirin (emigrants) ! Where are you  going?&#8217; We replied, &#8216;We are going to these Ansari brothers of ours.&#8217; They said to us, &#8216;You  shouldn&#8217;t go near them. Carry out whatever we have already decided.&#8217; I said, &#8216;By Allah, we  will go to them.&#8217; And so we proceeded until we reached them at the shed of Bani Sa&#8217;da.  Behold! There was a man sitting amongst them and wrapped in something. I asked, &#8216;Who is  that man?&#8217; They said, &#8216;He is Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada.&#8217; I asked, &#8216;What is wrong with him?&#8217; They  said, &#8216;He is sick.&#8217; After we sat for a while, the Ansar&#8217;s speaker said, &#8216;None has the  right to be worshipped but Allah,&#8217; and praising Allah as He deserved, he added, &#8216;To  proceed, we are Allah&#8217;s Ansar (helpers) and the majority of the Muslim army, while you,  the emigrants, are a small group and some people among you came with the intention of  preventing us from practicing this matter (of caliphate) and depriving us of it.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the speaker had finished, I intended to speak as I had  prepared a speech which I liked and which I wanted to deliver in the presence of Abu Bakr,  and I used to avoid provoking him. So, when I wanted to speak, Abu Bakr said, &#8216;Wait a  while.&#8217; I disliked to make him angry. So Abu Bakr himself gave a speech, and he was wiser  and more patient than I. By Allah, he never missed a sentence that I liked in my own  prepared speech, but he said the like of it or better than it spontaneously. After a pause  he said, &#8216;O Ansar! You deserve all (the qualities that you have attributed to yourselves,  but this question (of Caliphate) is only for the Quraish as they are the best of the Arabs  as regards descent and home, and I am pleased to suggest that you choose either of these  two men, so take the oath of allegiance to either of them as you wish. And then Abu Bakr  held my hand and Abu Ubada bin Abdullah&#8217;s hand who was sitting amongst us. I hated nothing  of what he had said except that proposal, for by Allah, I would rather have my neck  chopped off as expiator for a sin than become the ruler of a nation, one of whose members  is Abu Bakr, unless at the time of my death my own-self suggests something I don&#8217;t feel at  present.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>And then one of the Ansar said, &#8216;I am the pillar on which  the camel with a skin disease (eczema) rubs itself to satisfy the itching (i.e., I am a  noble), and I am as a high class palm tree! O Quraish. There should be one ruler from us  and one from you.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then there was a hue and cry among the gathering and their  voices rose so that I was afraid there might be great disagreement, so I said, &#8216;O Abu  Bakr! Hold your hand out.&#8217; He held his hand out and I pledged allegiance to him, and then  all the emigrants gave the Pledge of allegiance and so did the Ansar afterwards. And so we  became victorious over Sa&#8217;d bin Ubada (whom Al-Ansar wanted to make a ruler). One of the  Ansar said, &#8216;You have killed Sa&#8217;d bin Ubada.&#8217; I replied, &#8216;Allah has killed Sa&#8217;d bin  Ubada.&#8217; Umar added, &#8220;By Allah, apart from the great tragedy that had happened to us  (i.e. the death of the Prophet), there was no greater problem than the allegiance pledged  to Abu Bakr because we were afraid that if we left the people, they might give the Pledge  of allegiance after us to one of their men, in which case we would have given them our  consent for something against our real wish, or would have opposed them and caused great  trouble. So if any person gives the Pledge of allegiance to somebody (to become a Caliph)  without consulting the other Muslims, then the one he has selected should not be granted  allegiance, lest both of them should be killed.&#8221; </font></p>

Decide his case according to Allah&#8217;s Laws. My son was a laborer working  for this person, and he committed illegal sexual intercourse with his wife, and the people  told me that my son should be stoned to death, but I offered one-hundred sheep and a slave  girl as a ransom for him. Then I asked the religious learned people, and they told me that  my son should be flogged with one-hundred stripes and be exiled for one year.&#8221; The  Prophet said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I will judge you according to Allah&#8217;s  Laws. The sheep and the slave girl will be returned to you and your son will be flogged  one-hundred stripes and be exiled for one year. And you, O Unais!

He has  said the truth, the verse of the Rajam is in it (Torah).&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle  ordered that the two persons (guilty of illegal sexual intercourse) be stoned to death,  and so they were stoned, and I saw the man bending over the woman so as to protect her  from the stones. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira and Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;I beseech you to  judge us according to Allah&#8217;s Laws.&#8221; Then his opponent who was wiser than he, got up  and said, &#8220;He has spoken the truth. So judge us according to Allah&#8217;s Laws and please  allow me (to speak), O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Speak.&#8221; He  said, &#8220;My son was a laborer for the family of this man and he committed illegal  sexual intercourse with his wife, and I gave one-hundred sheep and a slave as a ransom  (for my son), but I asked the religious learned people (regarding this case), and they  informed me that my son should be flogged one-hundred stripes, and be exiled for one year,  and the wife of this man should be stoned (to death).&#8221;The Prophet said, &#8220;By Him  in Whose Hand my soul is, I will Judge you (in this case) according to Allah&#8217;s Laws. The  one-hundred (sheep) and the slave shall be returned to you and your son shall be flogged  one-hundred stripes and be exiled for one year. And O Unais! Go in the morning to the wife  of this man and ask her, and if she confesses, stone her to death.&#8221; She confessed and  he stoned her to death. </font></p>
