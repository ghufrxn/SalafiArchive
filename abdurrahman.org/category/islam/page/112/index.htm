Chapter 43
<p>Showing reverence to the Family of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)</p></h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Allah wishes only to remove Ar-Rijs (evil deeds and sins) from you, O members of the family (of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)), and to purify you with a thorough purification.&#8221;</b></span><b> (33:33)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And whosoever honours the Symbols of Allah, then it is truly from the piety of the heart.&#8221;</b></span><b> (22:32)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>346.</b> Yazid bin Haiyan reported: I went along with Husain bin Sabrah and `Amr bin Muslim to Zaid bin Arqam (May Allah be pleased with them) and, as we sat by his side, Husain said to him,<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;</span>Zaid, you acquired great merits, you saw Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), listened to him talking, fought by his side in (different) battles, and offered Salat (prayer) behind him. Zaid, you have indeed earned great merits. Could you narrate to us what you heard from Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)?&#8221; Zaid said, &#8220;By Allah! I have grown old and have almost spent up my age and I have forgotten some of the things which I remembered in connection with Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), so accept what I narrate to you, do not compel me to narrate what I fail to narrate&#8221;. He then said, &#8220;One day Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) stood up to deliver a Khutbah at a watering place known as Khumm between Makkah and Al-Madinah. He praised Allah, extolled Him, and exhorted (us) and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `Amma Ba`du. O people, I am a human being. I am about to receive a messenger (the angel of death) from my Rubb and I will respond to Allah&#8217;s Call, but I am leaving with you two weighty things: the first is the Book of Allah, in which there is right guidance and light, so hold fast to the Book of Allah and adhere to it.&#8217; He exhorted (us to hold fast) to the Book of Allah</span> and then said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `The second is the members of my household, I remind you (to be kind) to the members of my family. I remind you (to be kind) to the members of my family.</span> Husain said to Zaid, &#8220;Who are the members of his household, O Zaid? Aren&#8217;t his wives the members of his family?&#8221; Thereupon Zaid said, &#8220;His wives are the members of his family. (But here) the members of his family are those for whom Zakat is forbidden&#8221;.  He asked, &#8220;Who are they?&#8221; Zaid said, &#8220;Ali and the offspring of `Ali, `Aqil and the offspring of `Aqil and the offspring of Ja`far and the offspring of `Abbas.&#8221; Husain asked, &#8220;For all of them the acceptance of Zakat is forbidden?&#8221; Zaid (May Allah be pleased with him) said, &#8220;Yes&#8221;.</p>
<p>[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;I am leaving behind me two weighty things. One of them is the Book of Allah; that is the strong rope of Allah. Whosoever holds firmly to it, will be the guided, and whosoever leaves it goes astray&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>347.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) said:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Show reverence to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) by honouring the members of his family.&#8221;</span></p>

Chapter 54<br>
Excellence of Weeping out of Fear from Allah (Azza wa Jal)</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And they fall down on their faces weeping and it increases their humility.&#8221;</b></span><b> (17:109)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Do you then wonder at this recitation (the Qur&#8217;an)? And you laugh at it and weep not&#8221;.</b></span><b> (53:59-60)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>446.</b> Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to me:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Recite the Qur&#8217;an to me&#8221;</span>. I said<span style="color:#008000;">, &#8220;</span>O Messenger of Allah! Shall I recite the Qur&#8217;an to you, when it has been revealed to you?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;I love to hear it recited by others&#8221;</span>. So I recited to him a portion from Surat An-Nisa&#8217;. When I reached the Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">&#8220;How (will it be) then, when We bring from each nation a witness and We bring you (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) as a witness against these people?&#8221;.</span> (4:41)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Enough for now&#8221;.</span> When I looked at him I saw his eyes were shedding tears.<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>447.</b> Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) delivered a Khutbah to us the like of which I had never heard from him before. In the course of the Khutbah, he said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;If you knew what I know, you would laugh little and weep much&#8221;.</span> Thereupon those present covered their faces and began to sob.<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>448.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;One who weeps out of fear of Allah, will not enter the Hell till milk returns back in the udder; and the dust raised on account of fighting in the path of Allah and the smoke of Hell will never exist together&#8221;.</span><br>
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>449.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Seven people Allah will give them His Shade on the Day when there would be no shade but the Shade of His Throne (i.e., on the Day of  Resurrection): And they are: a just ruler; a youth who grew up with the worship of Allah; a person whose heart is attached to the mosques, two men who love and meet each other and depart from each other for the sake of Allah; a man whom an extremely beautiful woman seduces (for illicit relation), but he (rejects this offer and) says: `I fear Allah&#8217;; a man who gives in charity and conceals it (to such an extent) that the left hand does not know what the right has given; and a man who remembers Allah in solitude and his eyes become tearful&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>450.</b> `Abdullah bin Ash-Shikhkhir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> I came to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) when he was performing prayers. He was sobbing and his chest sounded like a boiling kettle.</span><br>
[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>451.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to Ubayy bin Ka`b (May Allah be pleased with him),<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah (SWT) has ordered me to recite to you Surat-Al-Baiyyinah</span> (98):<span style="color:#ff0000;"> `Those who disbelieve &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ubayy (May Allah be pleased with him) asked, &#8220;Did He name me?&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied in the affirmative. Whereupon Ubayy (May Allah be pleased with him) began to weep.<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>452.</b> Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: After the death of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), Abu Bakr said to `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them)<span style="color:#008000;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">:</span><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Let us visit Umm Aiman (May Allah be pleased with him) as Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to visit her.&#8221;</span> As we came to her, she wept. They (Abu Bakr and `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) said to her,<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;What makes you weep? Do you not know that what Allah has in store for His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) is better than (this worldly life)</span>?&#8221; She said,<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;I weep not because I am ignorant of the fact that what is in store for Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) (in the Hereafter) is better than this world, but I weep because the Revelation has ceased to come.</span>&#8221; This reply moved both of them to tears and they began to weep along with her.<br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>453.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: When the illness of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) became serious, he was asked about the leading of Salat  and he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Ask Abu Bakr to lead Salat.&#8221;</span> Whereupon, `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) said; &#8220;Abu Bakr is very tender hearted. He is bound to be overcome by weeping when he recites the Qur&#8217;an.&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) repeated,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Ask him (Abu Bakr) to lead Salat&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration: `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) said:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;When Abu Bakr stands in your place, he will not be able to recite the Noble Qur&#8217;an to the people on account of weeping.&#8221;</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>454.</b> Ibrahim bin `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf  reported: Food was brought to `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf (May Allah be pleased with him) when he was observing Saum (fast) and he said:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Mus`ab bin `Umair (May Allah be pleased with him) was martyred and he was better than me, but only one sheet was available to shroud him. It was so small that when his head was covered; his feet remained uncovered and if his feet were covered, his head remained uncovered. Then the bounties of this world have been bestowed upon us generously. I am afraid that the reward of our good deeds have been awarded to us in this world.&#8221; On this he began to sob and left the food untouched.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>455.</b> Abu Umamah Sudaiy bin `Ajlan Al-Bahili (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Nothing is dearer to Allah than two drops and two marks: A drop of tears shed out of fear of Allah and a drop of blood shed in Allah&#8217;s way. Regarding the two marks, they are: Marks left in the Cause of Allah and a mark left in observing one of the obligatory act of worship of Allah, the Exalted&#8221;.</span><br>
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>456.</b> Al-`Irbad bin Sariyah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> One day Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) delivered us a very eloquent Khutbah on account of which eyes shed tears and hearts became softened.</span><br>

Chapter 40<br>
Kind Treatment towards Parents and establishment of the ties of Blood<br>
Relationship</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Worship Allah and join none with Him (in worship); and do good to parents, kinsfolk, orphans, Al-Masakin (the poor), the neighbour who is near of kin, the neighbour who is a stranger, the companion by your side, the wayfarer (you meet), and those (slaves) whom your right hands possess&#8221;.</b></span><b> (4:36)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And fear Allah through Whom you demand (your mutual rights), and (do not cut the relations of) the wombs (kinship)&#8221;.</b></span><b> (4:1)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And those who join that which Allah has commanded to be joined (i.e., they are good to their relatives and do not sever the bond of kinship)&#8221;.</b></span><b> (13:21)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And we have enjoined on man to be good and dutiful to his parents&#8221;.</b></span><b> (29:8)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And your Rubb has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them but address them in terms of honour. And lower unto them the wing of submission and humility through mercy, and say: `My Rubb! Bestow on them Your Mercy as they did bring me up when I was young&#8221;.</b></span><b> (17:23,24)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And We have enjoined on man (to be dutiful and good) to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship upon weakness and hardship, and his weaning is in two years- give thanks to Me and to your parents&#8221;</b></span><b>. (31:14)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>312.</b> `Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I asked the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) , &#8220;Which of the deeds is loved most by Allah?&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Salat at its proper time.</span>&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What next?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Kindness to parents.</span>&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What next?&#8221; He replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Jihad in the way of Allah.&#8221;</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>313.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;No son can repay (the kindness shown by his father) unless he finds him a slave and buys him and emancipates him&#8221;.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>314.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He who believes in Allah and the Last Day, let him be hospitable to his guest; and he who believes in Allah and the Last Day, let him maintain good the ties of blood relationship; and he who believes in Allah and the Last Day, must speak good or remain silent&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>315.</b>  Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah created all the creatures and when He finished the task of His creation, Ar-Rahm (ties of relationship) said: `(O Allah) at this place I seek refuge with You against severing my ties.&#8217; Allah said: `That I treat with kindness those who treat you with kindness and sever ties with those who sever ties with you.&#8217; It said: `I am satisfied.&#8217; Allah said: `Then this is yours&#8221;</span>. Then Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;Recite this Ayah if you like:<span style="color:#ff0000;"> `Would you then, if you were given the authority, do mischief in the land, and sever your ties of kinship? Such are they whom Allah has cursed, so that He has made them deaf and blinded their sight&#8221;.</span> (47:22,23).<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The words in Al-Bukhari are: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah (SWT) says: `He who maintains good ties with you, I maintain good ties with him; and he who severs your ties, I sever ties with him&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>316.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A person came to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and asked, &#8220;Who among people is most deserving of my fine treatment?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Your mother&#8221;.</span> He again asked, &#8220;Who next?&#8221;<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Your mother&#8221;</span>, the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied again. He asked, &#8220;Who next?&#8221; He (the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) said again,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Your mother.</span>&#8221; He again asked, &#8220;Then who?&#8221; Thereupon he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;">&#8221; Then your father.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Who is most deserving of my fine treatment?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Your mother, then your mother, then your mother, then your father, then your nearest, then nearest&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>317.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;May he be disgraced! May he be disgraced! May he be disgraced, whose parents, one or both, attain old age during his life time, and he does not enter Jannah (by rendering being dutiful to them)&#8221;.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>318.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A man said to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam): &#8220;I have relatives with whom I try to keep the ties of relationship but they sever relations with me; and whom I treat kindly but they treat me badly, I am gentle with them but they are rough to me.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;If you are as you say, it is as if you are feeding them hot ashes, and you will be with a supporter against them from Allah as long as you continue to do so&#8221;.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>319.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He who desires ample provisions and his life be prolonged, should maintain good ties with his blood relations&#8221;.</span> [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>320.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Abu Talhah (May Allah be pleased with him) was the richest among the Ansar of Al-Madinah and possessed the largest property; and among his possessions what he loved most was his garden known as Bairuha&#8217; which was opposite the mosque, and Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) often visited it and drank from its fresh water. When this ayah was revealed:<span style="color:#ff0000;"> &#8220;By no means shall you attain Al-Birr (piety, righteousness &#8211; here it means Allah&#8217;s reward, i.e., Jannah), unless you spend (in Allah&#8217;s Cause) of that which you love,&#8221;</span> (3:92). Abu Talhah came to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), and said: &#8220;Allah says in His Book:<span style="color:#ff0000;"> `By no means shall you attain Al-Birr, unless you spend (in Allah&#8217;s Cause) of that which you love,</span>&#8216; and the dearest of my property is Bairuha&#8217; so I have given it as Sadaqah (charity) for Allah&#8217;s sake, and I anticipate its reward with Him; so spend it, O Messenger of Allah, as Allah guides you&#8221;. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Well-done! That is profitable property. I have heard what you have said, but I think you should spend it on your nearest relatives.</span>&#8221; So Abu Talhah distributed it among his nearest relatives and cousins.<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>321.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`as (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: A man came to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) of Allah and said, &#8220;I swear allegiance to you for emigration and Jihad, seeking reward from Allah.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Is any of your parents alive?</span>&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, both of them are alive.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) then asked,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Do you want to seek reward from Allah?</span>&#8221; He replied in the affirmative. Thereupon Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Go back to your parents and keep good company with them&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration it is reported that a person came to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and sought his permission to participate in Jihad. The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) asked,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Are your parents alive?</span>&#8221; He replied in the affirmative. The Prophet a(sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;(You should) consider their service as Jihad.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>322.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr Al-`as (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The person who perfectly maintains the ties of kinship is not the one who does it because he gets recompensed by his relatives (for being kind and good to them), but the one who truly maintains the bonds of kinship is the one who persists in doing so even though the latter has severed the ties of kinship with him&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>323.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The bond of relationship is suspending from the Throne, and says: `He who keeps good relations with me, Allah will keep connection with him, but whosoever severs relations with me, Allah will sever connection with him&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>324.</b> It has been narrated that Maimuna bint Al-Harith (May Allah be pleased with her) had set free a slave-girl without the Prophet&#8217;s permission. When her turn came (the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)  used to visit his wives in turns), she made mention of that to him saying, &#8220;Did you know I have set slave-girl free?&#8221; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Have you, indeed?&#8221;</span> She replied, &#8220;Yes&#8221;. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) then remarked,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Had you given her to your maternal uncles, you would have your reward increased&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>325.</b> Asma&#8217; bint Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (May Allah be pleased with her) said: My mother came to me while she was still a polytheist, so I asked Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), &#8220;My mother, who is ill-disposed to Islam, has come to visit me. Shall I maintain relations with her?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Yes, maintain relations with your mother&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>326.</b> Zainab Ath-Thaqafiyah (May Allah be pleased with her) the wife of `Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: When Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)<span style="color:#0000ff;"> told the women that they should give Sadaqah (charity), even if it should be some of their jewellery,</span> I returned to `Abdullah bin Mas`ud and said, &#8220;You are a man who does not possess much, and Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) has commanded us to give Sadaqah. So go and ask him if giving to you will serve the purpose; otherwise, I shall give it to someone else.&#8221; He asked me that I should better go myself. I went and found a woman of the Ansar at the door of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), waiting to ask a similar question as mine. The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was endowed with dignity, and so we could not go in. When Bilal (May Allah be pleased with him) came out to us, we said to him: &#8220;Go to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and tell him that there are two women at the door who have come to ask him whether it will serve them to give Sadaqah to their husbands and to orphans who are in their charge, but do not tell him who we are. Bilal (May Allah be pleased with him) went in and asked him, and Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)<span style="color:#0000ff;"> asked him who the women were.</span> When he told him that they were a woman of the Ansar and Zainab,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> he asked him which Zainab it was</span>, and when he was told it was the wife of `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;They will have a double reward, one for maintaining the ties of kinship and another for Sadaqah&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>327.</b> Abu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb (May Allah be pleased with him) mentioned Heraclius in a long Hadith and said: Heraclius asked me, &#8220;What does this Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) teach you?&#8221; I said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He orders us to worship Allah Alone and not to associate a thing with Him in worship, to discard what our ancestors said, to perform the Salat (prayer), speak the truth, and maintain the ties of kinship&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>328.</b> Abu Dharr (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;You will soon conquer a land where people deal with Qirat.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> And according to another version: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;You will soon conquer Egypt where Al-Qirat is frequently mentioned. So when you conquer it, treat its inhabitants well. For there lies upon you the responsibility because of blood ties or relationship (with them)&#8221;.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>329.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: When this Verse was revealed:<span style="color:#ff0000;"> &#8220;And warn your tribe (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) of near kindred&#8221;.</span> (26:214) Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) called the Quraish; when they gathered, he said to them:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O sons of `Abd Shams; O sons of Ka`b bin Lu&#8217;ai, rescue yourselves from the Fire! O sons of Murrah bin Ka`b, rescue yourselves from the Fire! O sons of `Abd Manaf, rescue yourselves from the Fire! O sons of `Abdul-Muttalib, rescue yourselves from the Fire! O Fatimah, rescue yourself from the Fire, for I have no power (to protect you) from Allah in anything except that I would sustain relationship with you&#8221;.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>330.</b> Abu Abdullah `Amr bin Al-`as (May Allah be pleased with them) said: I heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying openly not secretly,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The family of so-and-so (i.e., Abu Talib) are not my supporters. My supporter is Allah and the righteous believing people. But they (that family) have kinship (Rahm) with whom I will maintain good the ties of kinship&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>331.</b> Abu Ayyub Khalid bin Zaid Al-Ansari (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A man came to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and said, &#8220;Direct me to a deed which will admit me to Jannah and take me away from the Fire&#8221;. The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Worship Allah and associate no partner with Him, perform As-Salat, pay Zakat, and maintain the ties of kinship&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>332.</b> Salman bin `Amir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;When you break fast, you should do it with a date-fruit for there is blessing in it, and if you do not find a date-fruit, break it with water for it is pure.&#8221;</span> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) added:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Charity towards a poor person is charity, and towards a relation is both charity and maintaining the ties (of kinship)&#8221;.</span><br>
[Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>333.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: I had a wife whom I loved but `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) disliked her. He asked me to divorce her and when I refused, `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) went to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and mentioned the matter to him. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)<span style="color:#0000ff;"> asked me to divorce her.</span><br>
[At-Tirmidhi and Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>334.</b> Abud-Darda&#8217; (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A man came to me and said, &#8220;I have a wife whom my mother commands me to divorce&#8221;. I replied him that I had heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;A parent is the best of the gates of Jannah; so if you wish, keep to the gate, or lose it.&#8221;</span><br>

Chapter 46<br>
Excellence and Etiquette of Sincere love for the sake of Allah</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) is the Messenger of Allah. And those who are with him are severe against disbelievers, and merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and falling down prostrate (in prayer), seeking bounty from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure. The mark of them (i.e., of their Faith) is on their faces (foreheads) from the traces of prostration (during prayers). This is their description in the Taurat (Torah). But their description in the Injeel (Gospel) is like a (sown) seed which sends forth its shoot, then makes it strong, and becomes thick and it stands straight on its stem, delighting the sowers, that He may enrage the disbelievers with them. Allah has promised those among them who believe (i.e., all those who follow Islamic Monotheism, the religion of Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) till the Day of Resurrection) and do righteous good deeds, forgiveness and a mighty reward (i.e., Jannah).&#8217;</b></span><b>&#8216; (48:29)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And those who, before them, had homes (in Al-Madinah) and had adopted the Faith, &#8211; love those who emigrate to them&#8230;&#8221;</b></span><b> (59:9)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>375.</b> Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;There are three qualities whoever has them, will taste the sweetness of Iman: To love Allah and His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) more than anyone else; to love a slave (of Allah) only for (the sake of) Allah; and to abhor returning to infidelity after Allah has saved him from it as he would abhor to be thrown into the fire (of Hell)&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>376.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Seven are (the persons) whom Allah will give Shade of His Thrown on the Day when there would be no shade other than His Throne&#8217;s Shade: A just ruler; a youth who grew up worshipping Allah; a man whose heart is attached to mosques; two persons who love and meet each other and depart from each other for the sake of Allah; a man whom an extremely beautiful woman seduces (for illicit relation), but he (rejects this offer by saying): `I fear Allah&#8217;; a man who gives in charity and conceals it (to such an extent) that the left hand does not know what the right has given; and a person who remembers Allah in solitude and his eyes well up&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>377.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;On the Day of Resurrection, Allah, the Exalted, will say: `Where are those who have mutual love for the sake of My Glory? Today I shall shelter them in My Shade when there will be no shade except Mine&#8221;.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>378.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is! You will not enter Jannah until you believe, and you shall not believe until you love one another. May I inform you of something, if you do, you love each other. Promote greeting amongst you (by saying As-salamu `alaikum to one another)&#8221;.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>379.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;A man set out to visit a brother (in Faith) in another town and Allah sent an angel on his way. When the man met the angel, the latter asked him, &#8220;Where do you intend to go?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I intend to visit my brother in this town&#8221;. The angel said, &#8220;Have you done any favour to him?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No, I have no desire except to visit him because I love him for the sake of Allah, the Exalted, and Glorious.&#8221; Thereupon the angel said, &#8220;I am a messenger to you from Allah (to inform you) that Allah loves you as you love him (for His sake)&#8221;.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>380.</b> Al-Bara&#8217; bin `Azib (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said about the Ansar:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Only a believer loves them, and only a hypocrite hates them. Allah loves him who loves them and Allah hates him who hates them&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>381.</b> Mu`adh (bin Jabal) (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah, the Exalted, has said: `For those who love one another for the sake of My Glory, there will be seats of light (on the Day of Resurrection), and they will be envied by the Prophets and martyrs&#8221;.</span><br>
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>382.</b> Abu Idris Al-Khaulani (May Allah had mercy upon him) reported: I once entered the mosque in Damascus. I happened to catch sight of a young man who had bright teeth (i.e., he was always seen smiling). A number of people had gathered around him. When they differed over anything they would refer it to him and act upon his advice. I asked who he was and I was told that he was Mu`adh bin Jabal (May Allah be pleased with him) The next day I hastened to the mosque, but found that he had arrived before me and was busy in performing Salat. I waited until he finished, and then went to him from the front, greeted him with Salam and said to him,<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;</span>By Allah I love you.&#8221; He asked, &#8220;For the sake of Allah?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Yes, for the sake of Allah&#8221;. He again asked me, &#8220;Is it for Allah&#8217;s sake?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Yes, it is for Allah&#8217;s sake.&#8221; Then he took hold of my cloak, drew me to himself and said, &#8220;Rejoice,! I heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying<span style="color:#008000;">,</span><span style="color:#0000ff;"> `Allah, the Exalted, says: My love is due to those who love one another for My sake, meet one another for My sake, visit one another for My sake and spend in charity for My sake&#8221;.</span><br>
[Malik].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>383.</b> Abu Karimah Al-Miqdad bin Ma`dikarib (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;When a man loves his brother (for Allah sake) let him tell him that he loves him&#8221;.</span><br>
[At-Tirmidhi and Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>384.</b> Mu`adh<span style="color:#800000;"> (bin Jabal)</span> (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) held my hand and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O Mu`adh, By Allah, I love you and advise you not to miss supplicating after every Salat (prayer) saying: `Allahumma a`inni `ala dhikrika wa shukrika, wa husni `ibadatika,&#8217; (O Allah, help me remember You, expressing gratitude to You and worship You in the best manner)&#8221;.</span><br>
[Abu Dawud and An-Nasa&#8217;i].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>385.</b> Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A man was with the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) when another man passed by and the former said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! I love this man (for Allah&#8217;s sake)&#8221;. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) asked,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Have you informed him?&#8221;</span> He said, &#8220;No&#8221;. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) then said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Tell him (that you love him)&#8221;.</span> So he went up to the man and said to him<span style="color:#0000ff;">,</span> &#8220;I love you for the sake of Allah;&#8221; and the other replied, &#8220;May Allah, for Whose sake you love me, love you.&#8221;<br>

Chapter 28<br>
Covering Faults of the Muslims</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Verily, those who like that (the crime of) illegal sexual intercourse should be propagated among those who believe, they will have a painful torment in this world and in the Hereafter.&#8221;</b></span><b> (24:19)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>240.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah will cover up on the Day of Resurrection the defects (faults) of the one who covers up the faults of the others in this world&#8221;.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>241.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Every one of my followers will be forgiven except those who expose (openly) their wrongdoings. An example of this is that of a man who commits a sin at night which Allah has covered for him, and in the morning, he would say (to people): &#8220;I committed such and such sin last night,&#8217; while Allah had kept it a secret. During the night Allah has covered it up but in the morning he tears up the cover provided by Allah Himself.&#8221;</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>242.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah bepleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;When a slave-girl commits fornication and this fact of fornication has become evident, she must be given the penalty of (fifty) lashes without hurling reproaches at her; if she does it again, she must be given the penalty but she should not be rebuked. If she does it for the third time, he should sell her, even for a rope woven from hair (i.e., something worthless)&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>243.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah bepleased with him) reported: A man who had drunk wine was brought to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and he asked us to beat him; some struck him with their hands, some with their garments<span style="color:#800000;"> (making a whip)</span> and some with their sandals. When he (the drunkard) had gone, some of the people said: &#8220;May Allah disgrace you!&#8221; He (the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Do not say so. Do not help the devil against him&#8221;.</span><br>

Chapter 33<br>
Benevolent Treatment towards Orphans, Girls, the Weak, the Poor and the Humble<br>
Persons</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And lower your wings for the believers (be courteous to the fellow-believers)&#8221;.</b></span><b> (15:88)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And keep yourself (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) patiently with those who call on their Rubb (i.e., your companions who remember their Rubb with glorification, praising in prayers, and other righteous deeds) morning and afternoon, seeking His Face, and let not your eyes overlook them, desiring the pomp and glitter of the life of the world.&#8221;</b></span><b> (18:28)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Therefore, treat not the orphan with oppression. And repulse not the beggar.&#8221;</b></span><b> (93:9,10)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Have you seen him who denies the Recompense? That is he who repulses the orphan (harshly). And urges not the feeding of Al-Miskin (the poor)&#8221;.</b></span><b> (107:1-3)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>260.</b> Sa`d bin Abu Waqqas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Six of us were with the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) when the infidels said to him: &#8220;Drive these ones away, lest they should begin to venture against us&#8221;. The six were, myself, Ibn Mas`ud, a man of the Hudhail tribe, Bilal and two other men whose names I don&#8217;t know. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) thought what Allah wished him to think, and Allah revealed:<span style="color:#ff0000;"> &#8220;And turn not away those who invoke their Rubb, morning and afternoon seeking His Face.&#8221;</span> (6:52)<br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>261.</b> `Aidh bin `Amr Al-Muzani (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Abu Sufyan passed by Salman, Suhaib and Bilal and some other Companions  (May Allah be pleased with them). They said to him: &#8220;Did not the swords of Allah exact their due from the foes of Allah?&#8221; Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) said to them: &#8220;Do you speak like this to the chief of the Quraish and their master?&#8221; Then he went to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and related this to him. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Abu Bakr, perhaps you have angered them. If so, you have angered your Rubb&#8221;.</span> Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) went back to them  and said: &#8220;Brothers, did I offend you?&#8221; They replied: &#8220;No. May Allah forgive you, brother&#8221;.<br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>262.</b> Sahl bin Sa`d (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;I will be like this in Jannah with the person who takes care of an orphan&#8221;. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) raised his forefinger and middle finger by way of  illustration.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>263.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He who takes care of an orphan, whether he is his relative or a stranger, will be in Jannah with me like these two&#8221;. The narrator, Malik bin Anas raised his forefinger and middle finger for illustration.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>264.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;A Miskin (needy) is not the one who can be turned away with a date-fruit or two, or a morsel or two. The true Miskin is one who, despite his poverty, abstains from begging&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> In another narration Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8221; A Miskin is not the one who goes round begging from people and who can be turned away with a morsel or two, or a date-fruit or two. A true Miskin is he who does not find enough to suffice him, does not disclose his poverty so that he might be given alms, and does not stand up to beg&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>265.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;One who strives to help the widows and the poor is like the one who fights in the way of Allah</span>.&#8221; The narrator said: I think that he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) added also:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;I shall regard him as the one who stands up (for prayer) without rest and as the one who observes fasts continuously&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>266.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The worst food is the food of the marriage banquet from which those are left out who would like to come; and to which those are invited who refuse to come. He who rejects an invitation disobeys Allah and His Messenger&#8221;</span>.<br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> In another narration Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The worst food is the food of the marriage banquet to which the rich are invited and from which the poor are left out&#8221;.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>267.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Whoever supports two girls till they attain maturity, he and I will come on the Day of Resurrection like this&#8221;.</span> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) joined his fingers illustrating this<span style="color:#0000ff;">.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>268.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: A woman came to me with her two daughters. She asked me (for charity) but she found nothing with me except one date-fruit, so I gave it to her. She accepted it and then divided it between her two daughters and herself ate nothing out of that. She then got up and went out. When Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) came in, and I narrated to him the story, he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He who is involved (in the responsibility) of (bringing up) daughters, and he is benevolent towards them, they would become protection for him against Hell-fire&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>269.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: A poor woman came to me carrying her two daughters. I gave her three date-fruits. She gave a date to each of them and then she took up one date-fruit and brought that to her mouth to eat, but her daughters asked her that also. She then divided between them the date-fruit that she intended to eat. This (kind) treatment of her impressed me and I mentioned that to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) who said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8216;Verily, Allah has assured Jannah for her, because of (this act) of her,&#8221; or said, &#8220;He (SWT) has rescued her from Hell-Fire&#8221;.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>270.</b> Abu Shuraih Khuwailid bin `Amr Al-Khuza`i (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O Allah, I declare inviolable the rights of two weak ones: the orphans and women&#8221;.</span><br>
[An-Nasa&#8217;i].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>271.</b> Mus`ab bin Sa`d bin Abu Waqqas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Sa`d considered himself better than his inferiors, so the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to him,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;You are given help and provision because of your weak ones&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>272.</b> Abud-Darda (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Seek among your weak ones, for you are given provision and help only because of the weak amongst you.&#8221;</span><br>

Chapter 11<br>
The Struggle (in the Cause of Allah)</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;As for those who strive hard in Us (Our Cause), We will surely, guide them to Our paths (i.e., Allah&#8217;s religion &#8211; Islamic Monotheism). And verily, Allah is with the Muhsinun (gooddoers)&#8221;.</b></span><b> (29:69)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And worship your Rubb until there comes unto you the certainty (i.e., death)&#8221;.</b></span><b> (15:99)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And remember the Name of your Rubb and devote yourself to Him with a complete devotion.&#8221;</b></span><b> (73:8)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;So whosoever does good equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant), shall see it&#8221;.</b></span><b> (99:7)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And whatever good you send before you for yourselves (i.e., Nawafil &#8211; non-obligatory acts of worship: prayers, charity, fasting, Hajj and Umrah, etc.), you will certainly find it with Allah, better and greater in reward.&#8221;</b></span><b> (73:20)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And whatever you spend in good, surely, Allah knows it well.&#8221;</b></span><b> (2:273)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>95.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah the Exalted has said: &#8216;I will declare war against him who shows hostility to a pious worshipper of Mine. And the most beloved thing with which My slave comes nearer to Me is what I have enjoined upon him; and My slave keeps on coming closer to Me through performing Nawafil (prayer or doing extra deeds besides what is obligatory) till I love him. When I love him I become his hearing with which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes, and his leg with which he walks; and if he asks (something) from Me, I give him, and if he asks My Protection (refuge), I protect him&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>96.</b>   Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;Allah says:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8216; When a slave of Mine draws near to Me a span, I draw near to him a cubit; and if he draws near to Me a cubit, I draw near to him a fathom. And if he comes to Me walking, I go to him running.&#8221;&#8217;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>97.</b>  Ibn Abbas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;There are two blessings in which many people incur loss. (They are) health and free time (for doing good)&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>98.</b>  `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) would stand (in prayer) so long that the skin of his feet would crack. I asked him, &#8220;Why do you do this while your past and future sins have been forgiven?&#8221; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Should I not be a grateful slave of Allah?&#8221;</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>99.</b>  `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) said:<span style="color:#008000;"> With the start of the last ten days of Ramadan, Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) would pray all the night, and would keep his family awake for the prayers. He tied his lower garment (i.e., avoided sleeping with his wives) and devoted himself entirely to prayer and supplication.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>100.</b>  Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;A strong believer is better and dearer to Allah than a weak one, and both are good. Adhere to that which is beneficial for you. Keep asking Allah for help and do not refrain from it. If you are afflicted in any way, do not say: `If I had taken this or that step, it would have resulted into such and such,&#8217; but say only: `Allah so determined and did as He willed.&#8217; The word `if&#8217; opens the gates of satanic thoughts&#8221;.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>101.</b>  Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said.<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The (Hell) Fire is surrounded with all kinds of desires and passions, while Jannah is surrounded with adversities.&#8221;</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>102.</b>  Hudhaifah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I offered Salat (Tahajjud &#8211; optional night prayer) with the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) one night, and he started reciting (Surat) Al-Baqarah. I thought that he would bow at the end of one hundred Verses, but he continued reciting; I, then, thought that he would perhaps recite the whole (Surah) in a Rak`ah, but he proceeded on, and I thought he would perhaps bow on completing (this Surah); he then started (reciting Surat) An-Nisa&#8217;; he then started (Surat) Al-`Imran and his recitation was unhurried. And when he recited the Verses which referred to the Glory of Allah, he glorified Him (<span style="color:#0000ff;">by saying Subhan Allah &#8211; My Rubb, the Supreme is far removed from every imperfection</span>), the Great, and when he recited the Verses that mention supplication, he supplicated, and when he recited the Verses that mention seeking Refuge of the Rubb, he sought (His) Refuge. Then he bowed and said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">My Rubb, the Supreme is far removed from every imperfection (Subhana Rabbiyal-Azim);</span>&#8221; his bowing lasted about the same length of  time as his standing (and then on returning to the standing posture after Ruku<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">`</span>) he said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allah listened to him who praised Him (Sami` Allahu liman hamidah, Rabbana wa lakal hamd).</span>&#8221; Then he stood about the same length of time as he had spent in bowing. He then prostrated himself and said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">My Rubb, the Supreme is far removed from every imperfection (Subhana Rabbiyal-A`la),&#8221;</span> and his prostration lasted nearly the same length of time as his standing.<br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>103.</b>  Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) said:<span style="color:#008000;"> One night I joined the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) in his (optional) Salat. He prolonged the standing so much that I thought of doing something evil. He was asked: &#8220;What did you intend to do?&#8221; He replied: &#8220;To sit down and leave him&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>104.</b>  Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Three follow a dead body: members of his family, his possessions and his deeds. Two of them return and one remains with him. His family and his possessions return; his deeds remain with him&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>105.</b>  Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Jannah is nearer to anyone of you than your shoe-lace, and so is the (Hell) Fire&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>106.</b><span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">  </span>Rabi`ah bin Ka`b Al-Aslami (May Allah be pleased with him<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';"> (</span>a servant of the Messenger of Allah and also one of the people of As-Suffah) said: I used to spend my night in the company of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and used to put up water for his ablutions. One day he said to me,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Ask something of me.</span>&#8221; I said: &#8220;I request for your companionship in Jannah&#8221;. He inquired,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Is there anything else</span>?&#8221; I said, &#8220;That is all.&#8221; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Then help me in your request by multiplying your prostrations&#8221;.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>107.</b> Thauban  (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Perform Salah more often. For every prostration that you perform before Allah will raise your position one degree and will remit one of your sins&#8221;.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>108.</b> `Abdullah bin Busr Al-Aslami (May Allah be pleased with him) said: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The best of people is one whose life is long and his conduct is good&#8221;.</span><br>
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>109.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: My uncle Anas bin An-Nadr (May Allah be pleased with him) was absent from the battle of Badr and he said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! I was absent from the first battle you fought against the pagans, and if Allah let me participate in a battle against the pagans, Allah will see what I do.&#8221; So he encountered the day of  Uhud Battle. The Muslims left the positions (the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) told them to keep) and were defeated, he said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">O Allah! excuse these people (i.e., the Muslims) for what they have done, and I am clear from what the pagans have done</span>&#8220;. Then he went forward with his sword and met Sa`d bin Mu`adh (fleeing) and said to him:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;By the Rubb of the Ka`bah! I can smell the fragrance of Jannah from a place closer than Uhud Mount</span>&#8220;. Sa`d said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, what he did was beyond my power&#8221;. Anas said: &#8220;We saw over eighty wounds on his body caused by stabbing, striking and shooting of arrows and spears. We found that he was killed, and mutilated by the polytheists. Nobody was able to recognize him except his sister who recognized him by the tips of his fingers.&#8221; Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: &#8220;We believe that the Ayah<span style="color:#ff0000;"> `Among the believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Allah [i.e., they have gone out for Jihad (holy fighting), and showed not their backs to the disbelievers]&#8230;&#8217;</span> (33:23), refers to him and his like&#8221;.<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>110.</b> Abu Mas`ud `Uqbah bin `Amr Al-Ansari (May Allah be pleased with him) said: When the Ayah enjoining Sadaqah (charity) was revealed,* we used to carry loads on our backs to earn something that we could give away in charity. One person presented a considerable amount for charity and the hypocrites said: &#8220;He has done it to show off.&#8221; Another one gave away a few Sa` of dates and they said: &#8220;Allah does not stand in need of this person&#8217;s dates&#8221;. Thereupon, it was revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">&#8220;Those who defame such of the believers who give charity (in Allah&#8217;s Cause) voluntarily, and such who could not find to give charity (in Allah&#8217;s Cause) except what is available to them&#8230;&#8221;</span> (9:79)<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* This is the A&#8217;yah in which Allah says!<span style="color:#ff0000;"> &#8220;Take Sadaqah (alms) from their wealth in order to purify them and sanctify them with it, and suppliate Allah for them.</span>..&#8221; (9:103)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>111.</b> Abu Dharr (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah, the Exalted, and Glorious, said; &#8216;O My slaves, I have prohibited Myself injustice; and have made oppression unlawful for you, so do not oppress one another. O My slaves, all of you are liable to err except the one whom I guide on the Right Path, so seek guidance from Me so that I will guide you to the Right Path. O My slaves, all of you are hungry except the one whom I feed, so ask food from Me, I will feed you. O My slaves, all of you are naked except those whom I clothe, so ask clothing of Me and I shall clothe you. O My slaves, you commit sins night and day and I forgive all sins, so seek My forgiveness and I shall forgive you. O My slaves, you can neither do Me any harm nor can you do Me any good. O My slaves, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and jinn of you to be as pious as the most pious heart of any man of you, that would not increase My domain a thing. O My slaves, were the first of you, and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to be as wicked as the most wicked heart of any man of you, that would not decrease My domain in a thing. O My slaves, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to stand in one place and make a request of Me, and were I to give everyone what he requested, that would not decrease what I have, any more than a needle decrease the sea if put into it. O My slaves, it is but your deeds that I reckon for you and then recompense you for, so let him who finds good (i.e., in the Hereafter) praise Allah and let him who finds other than that blame no one but himself.&#8221;&#8217;.</span><br>

Chapter 6<br>
Piety</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;O you who believe! Fear Allah as He should be feared&#8221;.</b></span><b> (3:102)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;So, keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can&#8230;&#8221;</b></span><b> (64:16)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This second Verse explains the meaning of the first one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;O you who believe! Keep your duty to Allah and fear Him, and speak (always) the truth&#8221;.</b></span><b> (33:70)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;&#8230; And whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine&#8230;&#8221;</b></span><b> (65:2,3)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;If you obey and fear Allah, He will grant you Furqan [(a criterion to judge between right and wrong), or   (Makhraj, i.e., a way for you to get out from every difficulty)], and will expiate for you your sins, and forgive you; and Allah is the Owner of the great bounty&#8221;.</b></span><b> (8:29)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>69.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: It was asked, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Who is the most honourable amongst mankind?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The most honourable of them is one who is the most pious of them</span>.&#8221; They said, &#8220;We are not asking about this&#8221;. He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Then, the most honourable of men was Yusuf  (Joseph), the Prophet of Allah, the son of  Allah&#8217;s Prophet, who was the son of  the Prophet of Allah, who was the son of the Khalil of Allah (i.e., Ibrahim (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam))</span><span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">&#8216;</span> They said, &#8220;We are not asking you about this.&#8221; He enquired,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Are you then asking me about the classes of the Arabs? The best of them in the Pre-Islamic Period of  Ignorance are the best of them in Islam, provided they comprehend the religious knowledge&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>70.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The life of the world is sweet and green. Allah makes you generations succeeding one another so that He may try you in respect of your actions. So beware of the beguilements of the world and those of women. The first trial of Banu Israel was through women&#8221;.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>71.</b> `Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to say:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allahumma inni as&#8217;alukal-huda wat-tuqa wal-`afafa wal-ghina (O Allah! I ask You for guidance, piety, chastity and self-sufficiency)&#8221;.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>72.</b> `Adi bin Hatim At-Ta&#8217;i (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) say:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He who has taken an oath (to do something) but found something else better than that (which brings him closer to Allah), then he should do that which is better in piety (and he should expiate for the breaking of oath)&#8221;.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>73.</b> Abu Umamah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) during the sermon of the Farewell Pilgrimage saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Be mindful of your duty to Allah; perform your five daily Salat, observe Saum during the month (of Ramadan) , pay the Zakat on your properties and obey your leaders; (if you do so) you will enter the Jannah of your Rubb&#8221;.</span><br>

Chapter 1<br>
Sincerity and Significance of Intentions and all Actions, Apparent and Hidden</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allah, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him), and perform As-Salat (Iqamat-as-Salat) and give Zakat, and that is the right religion.&#8221;</b></span><b> (98:5)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah, but it is piety from you that reaches Him.&#8221;</b></span><b> (22:37)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Say (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) ): Whether you hide what is in your breasts or reveal it, Allah knows it</b></span><b>&#8220;. (3:29)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1</b>. Narrated &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab (May Allah be pleased with him), reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The deeds are considered by the intentions, and a person will get the reward according to his intention. So whoever emigrated for Allah and His Messenger, his emigration will be for Allah and His Messenger; and whoever emigrated for worldly benefits or for a woman to marry, his emigration would be for what he emigrated for</span>&#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>2</b>. Narrated &#8216;A`ishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;An army will raid the Ka`bah and when it reaches a desert land, all of them will be swallowed up by the earth.&#8221;</span> She asked<span style="color:#0000ff;">;</span> &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Why all of them?&#8221; He answered, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">All of them will be swallowed by the earth but they will be raised for Judgement according to their intentions.&#8221;</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>3.</b> A`ishah  (May Allah be pleased with her) narrated that the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;There is no emigration after the conquest (of Makkah) but only Jihad [(striving and fighting in the cause of Allah) will continue] and good intention.* So if you are summoned to fight, go forth.&#8221;</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">*. Intention according to An-Nawawi: It means that goodness which ceased to continue by the cessation of emigration can still be obtained by Jihad and by intending accomplishing good deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>4.  </b>Jabir bin Abdullah Al-Ansari (May Allah be pleasedwith them) reported: We accompanied the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) in an expedition when he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;There are some men in Al-Madinah who are with you wherever you march and whichever valley you cross. They have not joined you in person because of their illness.&#8221;</span> In another version he said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;They share the reward with you.&#8221;</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Bukhari from Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him): We were coming back from the battle of Tabuk with the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) when he remarked,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;There are people whom we left behind in Al-Madinah who accompanied us in spirit in every pass and valley we crossed. They remained behind for a valid excuse.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>5.</b>  Ma`n bin Yazid bin Akhnas (May Allah be pleased with them) (he, his father and his grandfather, all were Companions) reported: My father set aside some dinars for charity and gave them to a man in the mosque. I went to that man and took back those dinars. He said: &#8220;I had not intended you to be given.&#8221; So we went to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), and put forth the matter before him. He said to my father,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Yazid, you have been rewarded for what you intended.&#8221;</span> And he said to me,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Ma`n, you are entitled to what you have taken.&#8221;</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>6.</b> Abu Ishaq Sa`d bin Abu Waqqas (May Allah be pleased with him) (one of the ten who had been given the glad tidings of entry into Jannah) narrated: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) visited me in my illness which became severe in the year of Hajjat-ul-Wada` (Farewell Pilgrimage). I said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, you can see the pain which I am suffering and I am a man of means and there is none to inherit from me except one daughter. Should I give two-thirds of my property in charity?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;No&#8221;.</span> I asked him, &#8220;Then half?&#8221; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;No&#8221;.</span> Then I asked, &#8220;Can I give away one-third&#8221;. He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Give away one-third, and that is still too much. It is better to leave your heirs well-off than to leave them poor, begging people. You will not expend a thing in charity for the sake of Allah, but you will be rewarded for it; even the morsel of food which you feed your wife&#8221;.</span> I said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, would I survive my companions?&#8221; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;If you survive others and accomplish a thing for the sake of Allah, you would gain higher ranking and standing. You will survive them &#8230; your survival will be beneficial to people (the Muslim) and harmful to others (the enemies of Islam). You will survive others till the people will derive benefit from you, and others would be harmed by you.&#8221;</span> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) further said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O Allah, complete for my Companions their emigration and do not cause them to retract.&#8221;</span> Sa`d bin Khaulah was unfortunate<span style="color:#0000ff;">.</span> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) lamented his death as he died in Makkah.<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>7.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) narrated: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah does not look at your figures, nor at your attire but He looks at your hearts and accomplishments&#8221;.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>8.</b> Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that Messenger of Allah  (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was asked about who fights in the  battlefield out of valour, or out of  zeal, or out of  hypocrisy, which of this is considered as fighting in the cause of Allah? He said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He who fights in order that the Word of Allah remains the supreme, is considered as fighting in the cause of Allah&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>9.</b> Abu Bakrah Ath-Thaqafi (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;When two Muslims are engaged in a combat against each other with their sword&#8217;s and one is killed, both are doomed to Hell&#8221;.</span> I said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! As to the one who kills, it is understandable, but why the slain one?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He was eager to kill his opponent&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>10.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The reward for Salat performed by a person in congregation is more than 20 times greater than that of the Salat performed in one&#8217;s house or shop. When one performs Wudu&#8217; perfectly and then proceeds to the mosque with the sole intention of performing Salat, then for every step he takes towards the mosque, he is upgraded one degree in reward and one of his sins is eliminated until he enters the mosque, and when he enters the mosque, he is considered as performing Salat as long as it is the Salat which prevents him (from leaving the mosque); and the angels keep on supplicating Allah for him as long as he remains in his place of prayer. They say: &#8216;O Allah! have mercy on him; O Allah! forgive his sins; O Allah! accept his repentance&#8217;. This will carry on as long as he does not pass wind</span>&#8220;.<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>11.</b> `Abdullah bin `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported:  Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said that Allah, the Glorious, said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Verily, Allah (SWT) has ordered that the good and the bad deeds be written down. Then He explained it clearly how (to write): He who intends to do a good deed but he does not do it, then Allah records it for him as a full good deed, but if  he carries out his intention, then Allah the Exalted, writes it down for him as from ten to seven hundred folds, and even more. But if he intends to do an evil act and has not done it, then Allah writes it down with Him as a full good deed, but if he intends it and has done it, Allah writes it down as one bad deed&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>12.</b> `Abdullah bin `Umar bin Al-Khattab (May Allah be pleased with them) narrated that: He heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) as saying:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Three men, amongst those who came before you, set out until night came and they reached a cave, so they entered it. A rock fell down from the mountain and blocked the entrance of the cave. They said: `Nothing will save you from this unless you supplicate to Allah by virtue of a righteous deed you have done.&#8217; Thereupon, one of them said: `O Allah! I had parents who were old, and I used to offer them milk before any of my children or slaves. One day, I went far away in search of grazing and could not come back until they had slept. When I milked as usual and brought the drink I found them both asleep. I hated to disturb them and also disliked to give milk to my children before them. My children were crying out of hunger at my feet but I awaited with the bowl in my hand for them to wake up. When they awoke at dawn, they drank milk. O Allah! If  I did so to seek Your Pleasure, then deliver us from the distress caused by the rock&#8217;. The rock moved slightly but they were unable to escape. The next said: `O Allah! I had a cousin whom I loved more than any one else (in another version he said: as a man can love a woman). I wanted to have sexual intercourse with her but she refused. Hard pressed in a year of famine, she approached me. I gave her one hundred and twenty dinars on condition that she would yield herself to me. She agreed and when we got together (for sexual intercourse), she said: Fear Allah and do not break the seal unlawfully. I moved away from her in spite of the fact that I loved her most passionately; and I let her keep the money I had given her. O Allah! If I did that to seek Your Pleasure, then, remove the distress in which we are.&#8217; The rock moved aside a bit further but they were still unable to get out. The third one said: `O Allah! I hired some labourers and paid them their wages except one of them departed without taking his due. I invested his money in business and the business prospered greatly. After a long time, he came to me and said: O slave of Allah! Pay me my dues. I said: All that you see is yours &#8211; camels, cattle, goats and slaves. He said: O slave of Allah! Do not mock at me. I assured him that I was not joking. So he took all the things and went away. He spared nothing. O Allah! If  I did so seeking Your Pleasure, then relieve us of our distress.&#8217; The rock slipped aside and they got out walking freely&#8221;.</span><br>

Chapter 3<br>
Patience and Perseverance</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;O you who believe! Endure and be more patient..&#8221;</b></span><b>. (3:200)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And certainly, We shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits, but give glad tidings to As-Sabirun (the patient)&#8221;</b></span><b>.  (2:155)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Only those who are patient shall receive their reward in full, without reckoning.&#8221;</b></span><b> (39:10)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And verily, whosoever shows patience and forgives, that would truly be from the things recommended by Allah.&#8221;</b></span><b> (42:43)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Seek help in patience and As-Salat (the prayer). Truly, Allah is with As-Sabirun (the patient).&#8221;</b></span><b> (2:153)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And surely, We shall try you till We test those who strive hard (for the Cause of Allah) and As-Sabirun (the patient)&#8221;</b></span><b> (47:31)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are numerous Verses of the Noble Qur&#8217;an inculcating patience and extolling it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>25.</b> Abu Malik Al-Harith bin Asim Al-Ash`ar (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Wudu&#8217; is half of Salah; the utterance of  (Al-hamdu lillah &#8211; all praise belongs to Allah) fills the Scales of good actions; the utterance of (Subhan Allah wa Al-hamdu lillah) (Allah is far removed from every imperfection and all praise belongs to Allah) fills the space between the heavens and the earth, and Salat (prayer) is light; and charity is the proof of Faith; and endurance is light, and the Qur&#8217;an is a plea in your favour or against you. Every person departs; he either ransoms it or puts it into perdition&#8221;.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>26.</b> Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that: Certain people of the Ansar asked the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and he gave them; then they again asked him and he gave them until all what he possessed was exhausted. Then the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Whatever wealth I have, I will not withhold from you. Whosoever would be chaste and modest; Allah will keep him chaste and modest and whosoever would seek self-sufficiency, Allah will make him self-sufficient; and whosoever would be patient, Allah will give him patience, and no one is granted a gift better and more comprehensive than patience&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>27.</b> Abu Yahya Suhaib bin Sinan (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;How wonderful is the case of a believer; there is good for him in everything and this applies only to a believer. If prosperity attends him, he expresses gratitude to Allah and that is good for him; and if adversity befalls him, he endures it patiently and that is better for him&#8221;.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>28.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: When the last illness of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) made him unconscious, Fatimah (May Allah be pleased with her) exclaimed: &#8220;Ah, the distress of my dear father.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;There will be no distress for your father after today&#8221;</span>. When he died she said: &#8220;My father, Allah has called you back and you have responded to His Call. O father! Garden of Firdaus is your abode. O father! We announce to Jibril your death.&#8221; When he was buried, she said: &#8220;Are you satisfied now that you put earth over (the grave of) Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)?&#8221;<br>
[Al-Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>29.</b> Usamah bin Zaid (May Allah be pleased with them) narrated: The daughter of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) sent for him as her child was dying, but the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) returned the messenger and sent her good wishes saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Whatever Allah takes away or gives, belongs to Him, and everything with Him has a limited fixed term (in this world), and so she should be patient and anticipate Allah&#8217;s reward.&#8221;</span> She again sent for him adjuring him for the sake of Allah to come. The Messenger of Allah, accompanied with Sa`d bin `Ubadah, Mu`adh bin Jabal, Ubayy bin Ka`b, Zaid bin Thabit and some other men went to see her. The child was lifted up to the Messenger of Allah while his breath was disturbed in his chest. On seeing that, the eyes of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) streamed with tears. Sa`d said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! What is this?&#8221; He replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;It is compassion which Allah has placed in the hearts of His slaves, Allah is Compassionate only to those among His slaves who are compassionate</span> (to others)&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">  Another version says: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah shows compassion only to those among His slaves who are compassionate&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>30.</b> Suhaib (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;There lived a king before you and he had a court magician. As he (the magician) grew old, he said to the king: `I have grown old, so send me a young boy in order to teach him magic.&#8217; The king sent him a young boy to serve the purpose. And on his way (to the magician) the young boy met a monk to whom he listened to and liked it. It became his habit that on his way to the magician, he would meet the monk and sit there and would come to the magician (late). The magician used to beat him because of this delay. He complained about this to the monk who said to him: &#8216;When you feel afraid of the magician, say: Members of my family detained me. And when you fear your family, say: The magician detained me.&#8217; It so happened that there came a huge beast and it blocked the way of the people, and the young boy said: &#8216;I will know today whether the magician or the monk is better.&#8217; He picked up a stone and said: `O Allah, if the way of the monk is dearer to You than the way of the magician, bring about death to the animal so that the people be able to move about freely.&#8217; He threw that stone at it and killed it and the people began to move about freely. He then came to the monk and told him the story. The monk said: `Son, today you are superior to me. You have come to a stage where I feel that you would be soon put to a trial, and in case you are put to a trial, do not reveal me.&#8217; That young boy began to heal those born blind and the lepers and he, in fact, began to cure people from all kinds of illnesses. When a courtier of the king who had gone blind heard about him, he came to him with numerous gifts and said, `If you cure me, all these things will be yours.&#8217; He said, `I myself do not cure anyone. It is Allah, the Exalted, Alone Who cures; and if you affirm faith in Allah, I shall also supplicate to Allah to cure you.&#8217; This courtier affirmed his faith in Allah and Allah cured him. He came to the king and sat by his side as he used to sit before. The king said to him, `Who restored your eyesight?&#8217; He said, `My Rubb.&#8217; Thereupon he said, &#8216;Do you have another lord besides me?&#8217; He said, `My Rubb and your Rubb is Allah.&#8217; So the king kept torturing him untill he revealed the young boy. The young boy was thus summoned and the king said to him, &#8216;O boy, it has been conveyed to me that you have become so much proficient in your magic that you cure the blind and the lepers and you do such and such.&#8217; Thereupon he said, `I do not cure anyone; it is Allah Alone Who cures,&#8217; and the king took hold of him and began to torture him until he revealed of the monk. The monk was summoned and it was said to him: `You should turn back from your religion.&#8217; But he refused. The king sent for a saw, placed it in the middle of his head and cut him into two parts that fell down. Then the courtier of the king was brought forward and it was said to him: `Turn back from your religion.&#8217; He, too, refused, and the saw was placed in the midst of his head and he was torn into two parts. Then the boy was sent for and it was said to him: `Turn back from your religion.&#8217; He refused. The king then handed him over to a group of his courtiers, and said to them: `Take him to such and such mountain; make him climb up that mountain and when you reach its peak ask him to renounce his Faith. If he refuses to do so, push him to his death.&#8217; So they took him and made him climb up the mountain and he said: `O Allah, save me from them in any way you like,&#8217; and the mountain began to shake and they all fell down (dead) and that young boy came walking to the king. The king said to him, `What happened to your companions?&#8217; He said, `Allah has saved me from them.&#8217; He again handed him to some of his courtiers and said: `Take him and carry him in a boat and when you reach the middle of the sea, ask him to renounce his religion. If he does not renounce his religion throw him (into the water).&#8217; So they took him and he said: `O Allah, save me from them.&#8217; The boat turned upside down and they all drowned except the young boy who came walking to the king. The king said to him, `What happened to your companions?&#8217; He said, `Allah has saved me from them,&#8217; and he said to the king: `You cannot kill me until you do what I command you to do.&#8217; The king asked, `What is that?&#8217; He said, `Gather all people in one place and tie me up to the trunk of a tree, then take an arrow from my quiver and say: With the Name of Allah, the Rubb of the boy; then shoot me. If you do that you will be able to kill me.&#8217; `The king called the people in an open field and tied the young boy to the trunk of a tree. He took out an arrow from his quiver, fixed in the bow and said, `With the Name of Allah, the Rubb of the young boy,&#8217; he then shot the arrow and it hit the boy&#8217;s temple. The young boy placed his hand upon the temple where the arrow had hit him and died. The people then said: `We believe in the Rubb of this young boy.&#8217; The king was told: `Do you see what you were afraid of, by Allah it has taken place; all people have believed.&#8217; The king then commanded that trenches be dug and fire lit in them, and said: `He who would not turn back from his (the young boy&#8217;s) religion,  throw him in the fire&#8217; or `he would be ordered to jump into it.&#8217; They did so till a woman came with her child. She felt hesitant in jumping into the fire. The child said to her: `O mother! Endure (this ordeal) for you are on the Right Path&#8221;.</span><br>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>31.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) passed by a woman who was crying over a grave and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Fear Allah and be patient.&#8221;</span> She said, &#8220;Away from me! My calamity has not befallen you and you are not aware of it.&#8221; The woman was later told that it was the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) (who had advised her). She came to his door where she found no doorkeeper. She said, &#8220;(I am sorry) I did not know you.&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Patience is (becoming) only at the first (stroke) of grief&#8221;.</span><br>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>32.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah, the Exalted, says: &#8216;I have no reward other than Jannah for a believing slave of Mine who remains patient for My sake when I take away his beloved one from among the inhabitants of the world&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>33.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: I asked the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) about pestilence and he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;It is a punishment which Allah sends upon whomsoever He wills, but Allah has made it as a mercy to the believers. Anyone who remains in a town which is plagued with pestilence maintaining patience expecting the reward from Allah, and knowing that nothing will befall him other than what Allah has foreordained for him, he would receive a reward of Shaheed&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>34.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah, the Glorious and Exalted said: `When I afflict my slave in his two dear things (i.e., his eyes), and he endures patiently, I shall compensate him for them with Jannah.&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>35.</b> `Ata&#8217; bin Abu Rabah reported: Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) asked him whether he would like that he should show him a woman who is from the people Jannah. When he replied that he certainly would, he said, &#8220;This black woman, who came to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and said, `I suffer from epilepsy and during fits my body is exposed, so make supplication to Allah for me.&#8217; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8216;If you wish you endure it patiently and you be rewarded with Jannah, or if you wish, I shall make supplication to Allah to cure you?</span>&#8216; She said, &#8216;I shall endure it.&#8217; Then she added: `But my body is exposed, so pray to Allah that it may not happen.&#8217; He (Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) then supplicated for her&#8221;.<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>36.</b> `Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I can still recall as if I am seeing the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) resembling one of the Prophets whose people scourged him and shed his blood, while he wiped blood from his face, he said: &#8220;O Allah! Forgive my people, because they certainly do not know&#8221;.<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>37.</b> Abu Sa`id and Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Never a believer is stricken with a discomfort, an illness, an anxiety, a grief or mental worry or even the pricking of a thorn but Allah will expiate his sins on account of his patience&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>38.</b> Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I visited the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) when he was suffering fever. I said, &#8220;You seem to be suffering greatly, O Messenger of Allah.&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Yes, I suffer as much as two persons.&#8221;</span> I said, &#8220;Is that because you have a double reward?&#8221; He replied<span style="color:#0000ff;"> that that was so and then said, &#8220;No Muslim is afflicted by a harm, be it the pricking of a thorn or something more (painful than that), but Allah thereby causes his sins to fall away just as a tree sheds its leaves&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>39.</b>  Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He whom Allah intends good, He makes him to suffer from some affliction&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>40.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Let not one of you wish for death because of a misfortune which befalls him. If  he cannot help doing so, he should say: &#8216;O Allah, keep me alive as long as You know that life is better for me, and make me die when death is better for me&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>41.</b> Khabbab bin Al-Aratt (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: We complained to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) regarding the persecution inflicted upon us by the disbelievers while he was lying in the shade of the Ka`bah, having made a pillow of his cloak. We submitted: &#8220;Why do you not supplicate for our prevalence (over the opponents)?&#8221;. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Among those people before you, a man would be seized and held in a pit dug for him in the ground and he would be sawed into two halves from his head, and his flesh torn away from his bones with an iron comb; but, in spite of this, he would not wean away from his Faith. By Allah, Allah will bring this matter to its consummation until a rider will travel from San`a&#8217; to Hadramout fearing none except Allah, and except the wolf for his sheep, but you are in too much of a hurry&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is: He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) had placed his cloak under his head and we had been tortured by the polytheists.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>42.</b> Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: After the battle of Hunain, Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) favoured some people in the distribution of spoils<span style="color:#800000;"> (for consolation)</span>. He gave Al-Aqra` bin Habis and `Uyainah bin Hisn a hundred camels each and showed favour also to some more honourable persons among the Arabs. Someone said: &#8220;This division is not based on justice and it was not intended to win the Pleasure of Allah.&#8221; I said to myself: &#8220;By Allah! I will inform Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) of this.&#8221; I went to him and informed him. His face became red and he said, &#8220;Who will do justice if Allah and His Messenger do not?&#8221; Then he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;May Allah have mercy on (Prophet) Musa (Moses); he was caused more distress than this but he remained patient.</span>&#8221; Having heard this I said to myself: &#8220;I shall never convey anything of this kind to him in future&#8221;.<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>43.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;When Allah intends good for His slave, He punishes him in this world, but when He intends an evil for His slave, He does not hasten to take him to task but calls him to account on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;</span><br>
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>44.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: One of the sons of Abu Talhah (May Allah be pleased with him) was ailing. Abu Talhah went out and the boy died in his absence. When he came back, he inquired, &#8220;How is the boy?&#8221;. Umm Sulaim, the mother of the boy, replied, &#8220;Better than before&#8221;. Then she placed his evening meal before him and he ate it; and thereafter slept with her. At last, she said to him: &#8220;Arrange for the burial of the boy&#8221;. In the morning, Abu Talhah went to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and informed him of the event. He enquired,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Did you sleep together last night?&#8221;</span> Abu Talhah replied in the affirmative, on which the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) supplicated,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O Allah bless them.</span>&#8221; Thereafter, she gave birth to a boy. Abu Talhah said to me: &#8220;Take up the boy and carry him to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)&#8221;;  and he sent some dates with him. The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) enquired,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Is there anything with him?&#8221;</span> He said; &#8220;Yes, some dates&#8221;. The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) took a date, chewed it and put it in the mouth of the baby and rubbed the chewed date around the baby&#8217;s gum and named him `Abdullah.<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narration in Bukhari adds: Ibn `Uyainah relates that a man from the Ansar told him that he had seen nine sons of this `Abdullah, every one of whom had committed the Noble Qur&#8217;an to memory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narration of Muslim says: The son of Abu Talhah (May Allah be pleased with him) who was born of Umm Sulaim died. She (Umm Sulaim) said to the members of the family: &#8220;Do not tell Abu Talhah about his son until I mention it to him myself.&#8221; Abu Talhah came (home) and she gave him supper. He ate and drank. She then beautified herself the best way she ever did and he slept with her. When she saw that he was satisfied after sexual intercourse with her, she said, &#8220;O Abu Talhah! If some people borrow something from another family and then (the members of the family) ask for its return, would they refuse to give it back to them.&#8221; He said, &#8220;No&#8221;. She said, &#8220;Then hope reward for your son&#8221;. Abu Talhah got angry, and said; &#8220;You left me uninformed until I stained myself (with sexual intercourse) and then you told me about my son. &#8220;He went to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and informed him about the matter. Thereupon Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;May Allah bless the night you spent together!&#8221;</span> He (the narrator) said: She conceived. (One day) Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was in the course of a journey and she was along with him. When Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to come back to Al-Madinah from a journey, he would not enter it (during the night). When the people came near Al-Madinah, she felt labour pains. He (Abu Talhah) remained with her and Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) proceeded on. Abu Talhah said: &#8220;O Rubb, You know that I love to go along with Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) when he goes out and enter along with him when he enters, and I have been detained as You see.&#8221; Umm Sulaim then said: &#8220;O Abu Talhah, I do not feel (so much pain) as I was feeling earlier, so we better proceed on. So we proceeded on and she felt the labour of delivery as they reached (Al-Madinah). She gave birth to a male child. My mother said to me: &#8220;O Anas, none should suckle him until you go to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) tomorrow  morning.&#8221; The next morning I carried the baby with me to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), and narrated the rest of the story.<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>45.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The strong man is not one who is good at wrestling, but the strong man is one who controls himself in a fit of rage.&#8221;</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>46.</b> Sulaiman bin Surad (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I was sitting with the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) when two men began to quarrel and curse each other and the face of one of them turned red and the veins of his neck were swollen (from rage). Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;I know of a word, if he were to utter that, his rage would vanish and that is: A`udhu billahi minash-Shaitan nir-rajim (I seek refuge with Allah from Satan, the accursed).&#8221;</span> So they (Companions) said to him: &#8220;The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) tells you to utter: &#8216;I seek refuge with Allah from Satan, the accursed&#8221;.<br>
[Al-Bukhariand Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>47.</b> Mu`adh bin Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The one who suppresses anger and has the power to give effect to it, will be called out by Allah, the Exalted, to the forefront of the creatures on the Day of  Resurrection and he will be asked to choose any of the virgins (Hur) of his liking&#8221;.</span><br>
[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>48.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A man asked the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) for an advice and he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Do not get angry&#8221;</span>. The man repeated that several times and he replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Do not get angry&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>49.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;A Muslim, male or female, continues to remain under trial in respect of his life, property and offspring until he faces Allah, the Exalted, with no sin record&#8221;.</span><br>
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>50.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: &#8216;Uyainah bin Hisn came to Al-Madinah and stayed with his nephew Hurr bin Qais who was among those whom Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) showed favour to. The knowledgeable people (Qurra&#8217;), whether they were old or young, had the privilege of joining Umar&#8217;s council and he used to consult them. &#8216;Uyainah said to Hurr: &#8220;My nephew, the Leader of the Believers shows favour to you. Will you obtain permission for me to sit with him?&#8221; Hurr asked `Umar and he accorded permission. When `Uyainah came into the presence of `Umar, he addressed him thus: &#8220;O son of Khattab, you neither bestow much on us nor deal with us justly.&#8221; `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) got angry and was about to beat him up when Hurr said: &#8220;O Leader of the Believers, Allah said to His Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam):<span style="color:#ff0000;"> &#8216; Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the foolish (i.e., don&#8217;t punish them)</span>.&#8217; (7:199) This one is from the ignorants. When Hurr recited this, `Umar became quite motionless in his seat. He always adhered strictly to the Book of Allah.<br>
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>51.</b> Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;You will see after me favouritism and things which you will disapprove of.&#8221;</span> They submitted: &#8220;What do you order us to do (under such circumstances)?&#8221; He replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Discharge your obligations and ask your rights from Allah&#8221;.</span><br>

Do not long for encountering  the enemy and supplicate to Allah to grant you security. But when you face the enemy, show patience and steadfastness; and keep it in mind that Jannah lies under the shade of the swords.&#8221;</span> Then he invoked Allah, saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O Allah, Revealer of the Book, Disperser of the clouds, Defeater of the Confederates, put our enemy to rout and help us in over-powering them&#8221;.</span><br>

Chapter 5<br>
Watchfulness</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Who sees you (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) when you stand up (alone at night for Tahajjud prayers). And your movements among those who fall prostrate (to Allah in the five compulsory congregational prayers)&#8221;.</b></span><b> (26:218,219)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And He is with you (by His Knowledge) wheresoever you may be&#8221;.</b></span><b> (57:4)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Truly, nothing is hidden from Allah, in the earth or in the heaven&#8221;.</b></span><b> (3:5)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Verily, your Rubb is Ever Watchful (over them)&#8221;.</b></span><b> (89:14)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Allah knows the fraud of the eyes, and all that the breasts conceal&#8221;.</b></span><b> (40:19)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>60.</b> &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab (May Allah be pleased with them) said: Once we were sitting in the company of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) when there appeared a man dressed in very white clothes and having extraordinary black hair. No signs of fatigue of journey appeared on him and he was known to none of us. He sat down facing the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) leaning his knees against the knees of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and placing both of his palms over his two thighs and said, &#8220;O Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)! Tell me about Islam&#8221;. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Islam is to testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and that Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) is the Messenger of Allah; that you observe Salat (prayers), pay Zakat, observe Saum (fasting) of Ramadan and perform Hajj (pilgrimage) of the House, provided you have resources of making journey to it.&#8221;</span> He replied: &#8220;You have spoken the truth&#8221;. We were surprised to see that he had asked him and confirmed the correctness of the answers. He then enquired: &#8220;Tell me about Iman&#8221;. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said.<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;It is to believe in Allah, and His Books, and His Messengers and the Last Day and that you believe in foreordainment, its bad and good consequences.&#8221;</span> He said, &#8220;You have spoken the truth.&#8221; He then enquired: &#8220;Tell me about Ihsan.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;It is to worship Allah as if you are seeing Him; and although you do not see Him, He sees  you&#8221;</span>. He enquired: &#8220;Inform me about the Hour (i.e., the Day of Resurrection)&#8221;. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;I have no more knowledge thereof than you&#8221;</span>. He said, &#8220;Inform me about some of its signs&#8221;. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;They are &#8211; that a bondswoman gives birth to her own master, and that you will find the barefooted, naked, poor shepherds competing one another in the construction of higher buildings&#8221;.</span> Then he departed. The Messenger of Allah kept silent for a while then he said to me, &#8220;O `Umar! Do you know who the questioner was?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Allah and His Messenger know better&#8221;. The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He was Jibril (Gabriel); he came to you to teach you your religion&#8221;.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>61.</b> Abu Dharr and Mu`adh bin Jabal (May Allah be pleased with them) reported that: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Fear Allah wherever you are, do good deeds after doing bad ones, the former will wipe out the latter, and behave decently towards people&#8221;.</span><br>
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>62</b> Ibn Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) said: One day, I was riding behind the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) when he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O boy! I will instruct you in some matters. Be watchful of Allah (Commandments of Allah), He will preserve you. Safeguard His Rights, He will be ever with you. If you beg, beg of Him Alone; and if you need assistance, supplicate to Allah Alone for help. And remember that if all the people gather to benefit you, they will not be able to benefit you except that which Allah had foreordained (for you); and if all of them gather to do harm to you, they will not be able to afflict you with anything other than that which Allah had pre-destined against you. The pens had been lifted  and the ink had dried up&#8221;.</span><br>
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Another narration is: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Safeguard the Commandments of Allah, you will find Him before you. Remember Him in prosperity and He will remember you in adversity. Be sure that which you miss, was not to hit you; and what hits you, was never to miss you. Remember that the Help of Allah is obtained with patience, and relief emerges after distress, prosperity follows adversity, and hardship is followed by ease&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>63.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said:<span style="color:#008000;"> You indulge in (bad) actions which are more insignificant to you than a hair while we considered them at the time of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) to be great destroying sins</span>&#8220;.<br>
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>64.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8216;Verily, &#8216;Allah, the Exalted, becomes angry, and His Anger is provoked when a person does what Allah has declared unlawful&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>65.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said that: He heard the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;There were three men among the Banu Israel, one leper, one bald and one blind. Allah wanted to test them. He therefore, sent to them an angel who came to the leper and asked him what he would like best. He replied: &#8220;A good colour, a good skin and to be rid of what makes me loathsome to people&#8221;. He (the angel) rubbed him and his loathsomeness vanished and he was given a good colour and a good skin. He then asked him what type of property he would like best. The leper replied that he would like camels &#8211; [or perhaps he said cattle, for Ishaq (one of the subnarrator of the Hadith) was uncertain, either said: &#8216;Camels,&#8217; or: &#8216;Cattle&#8217;]. He was given a pregnant she-camel. The angel invoked for Allah&#8217;s Blessing on it. The angel then went to the bald man and asked him what he would like best and he replied: &#8220;Good hair and to be rid of what makes me loathsome to people&#8221;. The angel ran his hand over him and he was given good hair. He then asked him what property he would like best. He replied that he would like cattle, so he was given a pregnant cow. The angel invoked Allah&#8217;s Blessing on it. The angel then went to the blind man and asked him what he would like best, and he replied: &#8220;I wish that Allah restore my sight to me so that I may see people.&#8221; Thereupon the angel ran his hand over him and Allah restored his sight. The angel then asked what property he would like best. He replied that he would like sheep, so he was given a pregnant ewe. Flocks and herds were produced for the three men, the first having a valley full of camels, the second one, a valley full of cows and the third one full of sheep. Then the angel came in the form of a leper, to the one who had been a leper, and said: &#8220;I am a poor man and my resources have been exhausted in my journey, and my only means of reaching my destination are dependent on Allah and then on you, so I ask you by Him Who gave you the good colour, the good skin and the property, for a camel by which I may get to my destination&#8221;. He replied: &#8220;I have many dues to pay.&#8221; The angel then said: &#8220;I think I recognize you. Were you not a leper whom people found loathsome and a poor man to whom Allah gave property?&#8221; He replied: &#8220;I inherited this property through generations&#8221;. The angel said: &#8220;If you are telling a lie, may Allah return you to your former condition&#8221;. The angel went in the form of a bald man to the one who had been bald, and said the same as he had said to the former and received a similar reply. So he said: &#8220;If you are telling a lie, may Allah return you to your former condition&#8221;. The angel then went to the one who had been blind and said: &#8220;I am a poor traveller and my resources have been exhausted in my journey. My only means of reaching my destination are dependant on Allah and then on you, so I ask you by Him Who restored your eyesight for a sheep by which I may get to the end of my journey&#8221;. He replied: &#8220;Yes, I was blind. Allah restored my eyesight, so take what you wish and leave what you wish. I swear by Allah that I shall not argue with you today to return anything you take, as I give it for Allah&#8217;s sake&#8221;. The angel said: &#8220;Keep your property. You have all simply been put to a test, and Allah is pleased with you and displeased with both of your companions&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>66.</b> Shaddad bin Aus (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;A wise man is the one who calls himself to account (and refrains from doing evil deeds) and does noble deeds to benefit him after death; and the foolish person is the one who subdues himself to his temptations and desires and seeks from Allah the fulfillment of his vain desires&#8221;.</span><br>
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>67.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;It is from the excellence of (a believer&#8217;s) Islam that he should shun that which is of no concern to him&#8221;.</span><br>
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>68.</b> `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;No man shall be asked for the reason of  beating his wife&#8221;.</span><br>

Chapter 10<br>
Hastening to do Good Deeds</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;So hasten towards all that is good&#8221;.</b></span><b> (2:148)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And march forth in the way (which leads to) forgiveness from your Rubb, and for Jannah as wide as are the heavens and the earth, prepared for Al-Muttaqun (the pious)&#8221;.</b></span><b> (3:133)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>87.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Be prompt in doing good deeds (before you are overtaken) by turbulence which would be like a part of the dark night. A man would be a believer in the morning and turn to disbelief in the evening, or he would be a believer in the evening and turn disbeliever in the morning, and would sell his Faith for worldly goods.&#8221;</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>88.</b> `Uqbah bin Al-Harith (May Allah be pleased with him) said: Once I performed the &#8216;Asr prayer in Al-Madinah behind the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) got up quickly after finishing the prayer with Taslim, and stepping over the people, went to one of the rooms of his wives. The people were startled at his haste, and when he came out and saw their astonishment at his urgency he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;I recalled that there was left with me some gold which was meant for charity; I did not like to keep it any longer, so I gave orders that it should be distributed&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">    In another narration, Messenger of Allah said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;I had left some gold for Sadaqah in the house, and did not wish to keep it overnight&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>89.</b> Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> A man, said to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) during the battle of Uhud: &#8220;Tell me where I shall be if I am killed&#8221;. When he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied that he would be in Jannah, the man threw away some dates which he had in his hand and fought until he was killed</span>.<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>90.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: There came a man to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, which charity is the most rewardable?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;That you should give charity (in a state when you are) healthy and stingy and fear poverty, hoping to become rich (charity in such a state of health and mind is the best). And you must not defer (charity to such a length) that you are about to die and would be saying: &#8216;This is for so-and-so, and this for so-and-so.&#8217; Lo! It has already come into (the possession of) so-and-so&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>91.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) took up a sword on the day of the battle of Uhud and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Who will take this sword from me?&#8221;</span> Everyone stretched forth his hand saying: &#8220;I will take it; I will take it&#8221;. He (the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Who will take it with its full responsibility (i.e., to use it to fight Allah&#8217;s enemies with it)</span>?&#8221; The Companions hesitated. Abu Dujanah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: &#8220;I shall take it;&#8221; and with it he cracked the skulls of the pagans.<br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>92.</b> Az-Zubair bin `Adi said:<span style="color:#008000;"> We went to Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) and complained to him of suffering at the hands of Al-Hajjaj. He replied: &#8220;Show endurance, for no time will come but will be followed by one worse (than the present one) till you meet your Rubb. I heard this from your Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)</span>&#8220;.<br>
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>93.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Hasten to do good deeds before you are overtaken by one of the seven afflictions.&#8221; Then (giving a warning) he said, &#8220;Are you waiting for such poverty which will make you unmindful of devotion; or prosperity which will make you corrupt, or disease as will disable you, or such senility as will make you mentally unstable, or sudden death, or Ad-Dajjal who is the worst expected absent, or the Hour, and the Hour will be most grievous and most bitter&#8221;.</span><br>
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>94.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: On the day of the battle of Khaibar, Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;I shall hand over this banner to one who loves Allah and His Messenger, and Allah will give us victory through him.&#8221;</span> `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) said: &#8220;I had never longed for leadership but that day I expected that I might be called for. However, Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) called `Ali bin Abu Talib (May Allah be pleased with him) and handed the banner to him and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Go forth and do not turn around till Allah bestows victory upon you&#8221;.</span> (On hearing this) `Ali proceeded a little and then halted and without turning around inquired in a loud voice: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, for what shall I fight them?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Go on fighting till they affirm that none has the right to be worshiped but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. If they admit that, their lives and their properties will be secured, subject to their obligations according to Islam, and they will be answerable to Allah&#8221;.</span><br>

Chapter 9<br>
Pondering over the Great Creation of Allah, The passing away of Life of the<br>
World, the Horrors of the Day of Requital and Laxity of One&#8217;s Nafs</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;I exhort you to one (thing) only: that you stand up for Allah&#8217;s sake in pairs and singly, &#8211; and reflect (within yourselves the life history of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam))&#8221;.</b></span><b> (34:46)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Verily! in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day, there are indeed signs for men of understanding. Those who remember Allah (always, and in prayers) standing, sitting, and lying down on their sides, and think deeply about the creation of the heavens and the earth, (saying): &#8216;Our Rubb! You have not created (all) this without purpose, glory to You! (Exalted be You above all that they associate with You as partners)&#8221;.</b></span><b> (3:190,191)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Do they not look at the camels, how they are created? And at the heaven, how it is raised? And at the mountains, how they are rooted (and fixed firm)? And at the earth, how it is spread out? So remind them (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)), you are only a one who reminds&#8221;.</b></span><b> (88:17-21)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Have they not travelled through the earth, and seen..&#8221;.</b></span><b> (47:10)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ayat of the Qur&#8217;an and Ahadith on the subject are many. See for example Hadith No. 66 mentioned before.</p>

Firm Belief and Perfect Reliance on Allah</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And when the believers saw Al-Ahzab (the Confederates), they said: &#8216;This is what Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) had promised us, and Allah and His Messenger   (Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) had spoken the truth, and it only added to their Faith and to their submissiveness (to Allah)&#8221;.</b></span><b> (33:22)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Those (i.e., believers) unto whom the people (hypocrites) said, `Verily, the people (pagans) have gathered against you (a great army), therefore, fear them.&#8217; But it (only) increased them in Faith, and they said: `Allah (Alone) is Sufficient for us, and He is the Best Disposer of affairs (for us)&#8217;. So they returned with grace and bounty from Allah. No harm touched them; and they followed the good Pleasure of Allah. And Allah is the Owner of great bounty&#8221;.</b></span><b> (3:173,174)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And put your trust (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) in the Ever Living One Who dies not.&#8221;</b></span><b> (25:58)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And in Allah (Alone) let the believers, put their trust.&#8221;</b></span><b> (14:11)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;&#8230; Then when you have taken a decision, put your trust in Allah&#8230;&#8221;</b></span><b> (3:159)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him&#8221;.</b></span><b> (65:3)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;The believers are only those who, when Allah is mentioned, feel a fear in their hearts; and when His Verses (this Qur&#8217;an) are recited unto them, they (i.e., the Verses) increase their Faith; and they put their trust in their Rubb (Alone).&#8221;</b></span><b> (8:2)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>74.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;I was shown the past nations. I saw a Prophet who had a very small group (less than ten in total) with him, another Prophet who was accompanied by only one or two men and some did not have even one. Suddenly I was shown a huge crowd and I thought that they were my Ummah, but I was told: &#8216;This is Musa (Moses) and his people, but look towards the other side.&#8217; I looked and beheld a great assemblage. I was told: &#8216;These are your people and amongst them there are seventy thousand who shall enter Jannah without being taken to account or torment&#8221;. Then the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) stood up and went into his apartment, and the Companions began to guess who may be those people who would enter Jannah without any accounting or torment. Some said: &#8220;Probably, they are the ones who kept company with Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)&#8221;. Others said: &#8220;Probably, they are the ones who have been born as Muslims and have never associated anyone with Allah in worship&#8221;. Then Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) came out and asked, &#8220;What are you discussing?&#8221; So they told him. He then said, &#8220;They are those who do not make Ruqyah (blowing over themselves after reciting the Qur&#8217;an or some prayers and supplications the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to say) nor seek it, nor perceive omens (i.e., they are not pessimistic) but keep trust in their Rubb (Allah).&#8221; On this &#8216;Ukashah bin Mihsan stood up and asked: &#8220;Pray to Allah to make me one of them.&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;You are one of them.&#8221; Then another man stood up and asked the same thing. The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) answered, &#8220;&#8216;Ukashah has surpassed you&#8221;.</span><br>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>75.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported that the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to supplicate:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O Allah! To You I have submitted, and in You do I believe, and in You I put my trust, to You do I turn, and for You I argued. O Allah, I seek refuge with You through Your Power; there is none worthy of worship except You Alone; that You safeguard me against going astray. You are the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists; the One Who never dies, whereas human beings and jinn will all die&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>76.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) said:<span style="color:#008000;"> When (Prophet) Ibrahim (Abraham) was thrown into the fire, he said: &#8220;Allah (Alone) is sufficient for us, and, He is the Best Disposer of affairs.&#8221; So did Messenger of Allah Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) when he was told: &#8220;A great army of the pagans had gathered against him, so fear them&#8221;. But this (warning) only increased him and the Muslims in Faith and they said: &#8220;Allah (Alone) is sufficient for us, and He is the Best Disposer of affairs (for us)</span>&#8220;.<br>
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>77.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;A group of people (both men and women) whose hearts will be like the hearts of birds, will enter Jannah&#8221;.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">  It has been interpreted that such people are those who put their trust in Allah; another interpretation is that these people are tender-hearted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>78.</b> Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I went in an expedition along with the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) in the direction of  Najd. When Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) returned, I also returned with him. Then the mid-day sleep overtook us in a valley full of prickly shrubs. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) got down and the people scattered around seeking shade under the trees. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) hang up his sword on the branch of a tree. We were enjoying a sleep when Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) called us, and lo! There was a desert Arab bedouin near him. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;This man brandished my sword over me while I was asleep. I woke up and saw it in his hand unsheathed. He asked: `Who will protect you from me?&#8217; I replied: &#8216;Allah&#8217; &#8211; thrice&#8221;</span>. He did not punish him and sat down.<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">  In another narration, Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) said: We accompanied Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) in the campaign of Dhat-ur-Riqa`. We left Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) to take rest under a shady tree. One of the polytheists came to him. The sword of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was hanging on a tree. He drew it and said: &#8220;Are you afraid of me?&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;No&#8221;.</span> Then he said: &#8220;Who will then protect you from me?&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> And in a narration of Abu Bakr Al-Isma`ili<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">,</span> the polytheist asked: &#8220;Who will protect you from me?&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah.&#8221;</span> As soon as he said this, the sword fell down from his hand and Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) catching the sword, asked him,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Who will protect you from me.</span>&#8221; He said, &#8220;Please forgive me.&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;On condition you testify that there is none worthy of worship but Allah and that I am His Messenger.</span>&#8221; He said, &#8220;No, but I promise you that I shall not fight against you, nor shall I be with those who fight with you&#8221;. The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) let him go. He then went back to his companions and said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">I have come to you from one of the best of mankind</span>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>79.</b> `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;If you all depend on Allah with due reliance, He would certainly give you provision as He gives it to birds who go forth hungry in the morning and return with full belly at dusk&#8221;.</span><br>
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>80.</b> Al-Bara&#8217; bin `Azib (May Allah be pleased with them) said: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)<span style="color:#0000ff;"> asked me to recite whenever I go to bed: &#8220;Allahumma aslamtu nafsi ilaika, wa wajjahtu wajhi ilaika, wa fawwadtu amri ilaika, wal-ja&#8217;tu zahri ilaika, raghbatan wa rahbatan ilaika, la malja wa la manja minka illa ilaika. Amantu bikitabikal-ladhi anzalta, wa nabiyyikal-ladhi arsalta (O Allah! I have submitted myself to You, I have turned my face to You, entrusted my affairs to You; and committed my back to You out of desire for You and fear of You; expecting Your reward and fearing Your punishment). There is no refuge and no place of safety from You but with You. I believe in the Book You have revealed and in the Prophet You have sent.&#8221;</span> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said that if anyone recited these words and died that night, he would die in the true religion. In case he remains alive till morning, he will obtain good<span style="color:#0000ff;">.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">  In another narration: He reported Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) as saying:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;If you go to bed, perform the Salat Wudu&#8217;, lie down on your right side and say [the above Du`a (supplication)] and let these words be your last&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>81.</b> Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (May Allah bepleased with him) said: When Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and I were in the cave of Thaur and I saw the feet of the polytheists who were above us at the mouth of the cave (on the eve of the Emigration), I submitted: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! If one of them were to look down below his feet, he would see us&#8221;. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O Abu Bakr! What do you think of two whose third is Allah&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>82.</b> Umm Salamah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: Whenever the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)  stepped out of his house, he would say,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Bismillah, tawakkaltu `alallah. Allahumma inni a`udhu bika an adilla aw udalla, aw azilla aw uzalla, aw azlima aw uzlama, aw ajhala aw yujhala `alayya&#8221;. &#8220;[I go forth. (I begin with the Name of Allah, I trust in Allah; O Allah! I seek refuge in You from leaving or being led astray, or against slipping or being caused to slip; or doing injustice or being done injustice; or doing wrong or having wrong done to me)]&#8221;.</span><br>
[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi reported it. According to At-Tirmidhi<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">,</span> this Hadith is classified as Hasan Sahih. Its wording is from Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>83.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Whoever says (upon leaving his house): `Bismillah, tawakkaltu `alallah, wa la hawla wa la quwwata illa billah [I begin with the Name of Allah; I trust in Allah; there is no altering of conditions but by the Power of Allah],&#8217; it will be said to him: &#8216;You are guided, defended and protected.&#8217; The devil will go far away from him&#8221;.</span><br>
[Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa&#8217;i].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">  Abu Dawud reported it with this addition: &#8220;One devil will say to another: &#8216;How can you deal with a man who has been guided, defended and protected?&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>84.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: There were two brothers in the days of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). One of them used to attend the Prophet&#8217;s circle (to acquire knowledge) and the other used to earn their living). Once the latter complained to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) against the former (for not earning his living). He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Perhaps you are being provided because of him&#8221;.</span><br>

Chapter 2<br>
Repentance</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Scholars said: It is necessary to repent from every sin. If the offense involves the Right of Allah, not a human, then there are three condition to be met in order that repentance be accepted by Allah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- To desist from committing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- To feel sorry for committing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- To decide not to recommit it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Any repentance failing to meet any of these three conditions, would not be sound.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if the sin involves a human&#8217;s right, it requires a fourth condition, i.e., to absolve onself from such right. If it is a property, he should return  it to its rightful owner. If it is slandering or backbiting, one should ask the pardon of the offended.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should also repent from all sins. If he repents from some, his repentance would still be sound according to the people of sound knowledge. He should, however, repent from the rest. Scriptural proofs from the Book and the Sunnah and the consensus of the scholars support the incumbency of repentance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the, Exalted says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And all of you beg Allah to forgive you, O believers, that you may be successful&#8221;.</b></span><b> (24:31)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Seek the forgiveness of your Rubb, and turn to Him in repentance&#8221;.</b></span><b> (11:3)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;O you who believe! Turn to Allah with sincere repentance!&#8221;.</b></span><b> (66:8)</b></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>15</b> Anas bin Malik Al-Ansari (MayAllah be pleased with him) the servant of the Messenger of Allah narrated: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Verily, Allah is more delighted with the repentance of His slave than a person who lost his camel in a desert land and then finds it (unexpectedly)&#8221;</span>.<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> In another version of Muslim, he said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Verily, Allah is more pleased with the repentance of His slave than a person who has his camel in a waterless desert carrying his provision of food and drink and it is lost. He, having lost all hopes (to get that back), lies down in shade and is disappointed about his camel; when all of a sudden he finds that camel standing before him. He takes hold of its reins and then out of boundless joy blurts out: &#8216;O Allah, You are my slave and I am Your Rubb&#8217;.He commits this mistake out of extreme joy&#8221;.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>19.</b> Zirr bin Hubaish reported: I went to Safwan bin `Assal  (May Allah be pleased with him) to inquire about wiping with wet hands over light boots while performing Wudu&#8217;. He asked me, &#8220;What brings you here, Zirr?&#8221; I answered: &#8220;Search for knowledge&#8221;. He said, &#8220;Angels spread their wings for the seeker of knowledge out of  joy for what he seeks&#8221;. I told him, &#8220;I have some doubts in my mind regarding wiping of wet hands over light boots in the course of performing Wudu&#8217; after defecation or urinating. Now since you are one of the Companions of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), I have come to ask you whether you heard any saying of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) concerning it?&#8221;. He replied in the affirmative and said, &#8220;He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) instructed us that during a journey we need not take off our light boots for washing the feet up to three days and nights, except in case of major impurity (after sexual intercourse). In other cases such as sleeping, relieving oneself or urinating, the wiping of wet hands over light boots will suffice.&#8221; I, then, questioned him, &#8220;Did you hear him say anything about love and affection?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;We accompanied the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) in a journey when a bedouin called out in a loud voice, `O Muhammad.&#8217; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied him in the same tone,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `Here I am.</span>&#8216; I said to him (the bedouin), `Woe to you, lower your voice in his presence, because you are not allowed to do so.&#8217; He said, `By Allah! I will not lower my voice,&#8217; and then addressing the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) he said, `What about a person who loves people but has not found himself in their company.&#8217; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `On the Day of Resurrection, a person will be in the company of those whom he loves.</span>&#8216; The Messenger of Allah then kept on talking to us and in the course of his talk, he mentioned a gateway in the heaven, the width of which could be crossed by a rider in forty or seventy years&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">  Sufyan, one of the narrators of this tradition, said: &#8220;This gateway is in the direction of Syria. Allah created it on the day He created the heavens and the earth. It is open for repentance and will not be shut until the sun rises from that direction (i.e., the West) (on Doomsday)&#8221;.<br>
[At-Tirmidhi, who categorised it as Hadith Hasan Sahih]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>20</b>. Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Prophet of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;There was a man from among a nation before you who killed ninety-nine people and then made an inquiry about the most learned person on the earth. He was directed to a monk. He came to him and told him that he had killed ninety-nine people and asked him if there was any chance for his repentance to be accepted. He replied in the negative and the man killed him also completing one hundred. He then asked about the most learned man in the earth. He was directed to a scholar. He told him that he had killed one hundred people and asked him if there was any chance for his repentance to be accepted. He replied in the affirmative and asked, `Who stands between you and repentance? Go to such and such land; there (you will find) people devoted to prayer and worship of Allah, join them in worship, and do not come back to your land because it is an evil place.&#8217; So he went away and hardly had he covered half the distance when death overtook him; and there was a dispute between the angels of mercy and the angels of torment. The angels of mercy pleaded, &#8216;This man has come with a repenting heart to Allah,&#8217; and the angels of punishment argued, &#8216;He never did a virtuous deed in his life.&#8217; Then there appeared another angel in the form of a human being and the contending angels agreed to make him arbiter between them. He said, `Measure the distance between the two lands. He will be considered belonging to the land to which he is nearer.&#8217; They measured and found him closer to the land (land of piety) where he intended to go, and so the angels of mercy collected his soul&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> In another version:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He was found to be nearer to the locality of the pious by a cubit and was thus included among them&#8221;.</span> Another version says:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah commanded (the land which he wanted to leave) to move away and commanded the other land (his destination) to draw nearer and then He said: &#8220;Now measure the distance between them.&#8217; It was found that he was nearer to his goal by a hand&#8217;s span and was thus forgiven&#8221;.</span> It is also narrated that he drew closer by a slight movement on his chest<span style="color:#0000ff;">.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>21.</b> Abdullah bin Ka`b, who served as the guide of Ka`b bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) when he became blind, narrated: I heard Ka`b bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) narrating the story of his remaining behind instead of  joining Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) when he left for the battle of Tabuk. Ka`b said: &#8220;I accompanied Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) in every expedition which he undertook excepting the battle of Tabuk and the battle of Badr. As for the battle of Badr, nobody was blamed for remaining behind as Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and the Muslims, when they set out, had in mind only to intercept the caravan of the Quraish. Allah made them confront their enemies unexpectedly. I had the honour of being with Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) on the night of `Aqabah when we pledged our allegiance to Islam and it was dearer to me than participating in the battle of Badr, although Badr was more well-known among the people than that. And this is the account of my staying behind from the battle of Tabuk. I never had better means and more favourable circumstances than at the time of this expedition. And by Allah, I had never before possessed two riding-camels as I did during the time of this expedition. Whenever Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) decided to go on a campaign, he would not disclose his real destination till the last moment (of departure). But on this expedition, he set out in extremely hot weather; the journey was long and the terrain was waterless desert; and he had to face a strong army, so he informed the Muslims about the actual position so that they should make full preparation for the campaign. And the Muslims who accompanied Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) at that time were in large number but no proper record of them was maintained<span style="color:#800000;">.</span>&#8221; Ka`b (further) said: &#8220;Few were the persons who chose to remain absent believing that they could easily hide themselves (and thus remain undetected) unless Revelation from Allah, the Exalted, and Glorious (revealed relating to them). And Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) set out on this expedition when the fruit were ripe and their shade was sought. I had a weakness for them and it was during this season that Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and the Muslims made preparations. I also would set out in the morning to make preparations along with them but would come back having done nothing and said to myself: &#8216;I have means enough (to make preparations) as soon as I like&#8217;. And I went on doing this (postponing my preparations) till the time of departure came and it was in the morning that Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) set out along with the Muslims, but I had made no preparations. I would go early in the morning and come back, but with no decision. I went on doing so until they (the Muslims) hastened and covered a good deal of distance. Then I wished to march on and join them. Would that I had done that! But perhaps it was not destined for me. After the departure of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) whenever I went out, I was grieved to find no good example to follow but confirmed hypocrites or weak people whom Allah had exempted (from marching forth for Jihad). Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) made no mention of me until he reached Tabuk. While he was sitting with the people in Tabuk, he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `What happened to Ka`b bin Malik?&#8217;</span> A person from Banu Salimah said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, the (beauty) of his cloak and an appreciation of  his finery have detained him.&#8217; Upon this Mu`adh bin Jabal (MatAllah be pleased with him) admonished him and said to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam): &#8220;By Allah, we know nothing about him but good.&#8217; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), however, kept quiet. At that time he (the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) saw a person dressed in white and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `Be Abu Khaithamah.</span>&#8216; And was Abu Khaithamah Al-Ansari was the person who had contributed a Sa` of dates and was ridiculed by the hypocrites.&#8221; Ka`b bin Malik further said: &#8220;When the news reached me that Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was on his way back from Tabuk, I was greatly distressed. I thought of fabricating an excuse and asked myself how I would save myself from his anger the next day. In this connection, I sought the counsels of every prudent member of my family. When I was told that Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was about to arrive, all the wicked ideas vanished (from my mind) and I came to the conclusion that nothing but the truth could save me. So I decided to tell him the truth. It was in the morning that Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) arrived in Al-Madinah. It was his habit that whenever he came back from a journey, he would first go to the mosque and perform two Rak`ah (of optional prayer) and would then sit with the people. When he sat, those who had remained behind him began to put forward their excuses and take an oath before him. They were more than eighty in number. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) accepted their excuses on the very face of them and accepted their allegiance and sought forgiveness for them and left their insights to Allah, until I appeared before him. I greeted him and he smiled and there was a tinge of anger in that. He then said to me,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8216;Come forward&#8217;.</span> I went forward and I sat in front of him. He said to me,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `What kept you back? Could you not afford to go in for a ride?&#8217;</span> I said, &#8216;O Messenger of Allah, by Allah, if I were to sit before anybody else, a man of the world, I would have definitely saved myself from his anger on one pretext or the other and I have a gifted skill in argumentation, but, by Allah, I am fully aware that if I were to put forward before you a lame excuse to please you, Allah would definitely provoke your wrath upon me. In case, I speak the truth, you may be angry with me, but I hope that Allah would be pleased with me (and accept my repentance). By Allah, there is no valid excuse for me. By Allah, I never possessed so good means, and I never had such favourable conditions for me as I had when I stayed behind.&#8217; Thereupon, Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8216;This man spoke the truth, so get up (and wait) until Allah gives a decision about you.&#8217;</span> I left and some people of  Banu Salimah followed me. They said to me, `By Allah, we do not know that you committed a sin before. You, however, showed inability to put forward an excuse before Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) like those who stayed behind him. It would have been enough for the forgiveness of your sin that Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) would have sought forgiveness for you.&#8217; By Allah, they kept on reproaching me until I thought of going back to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and retract my confession. Then I said to them, &#8216;Has anyone else met the same fate?&#8217; They said, &#8216;Yes, two persons have met the same fate. They made the same statement as you did and the same verdict was delivered in their case.&#8217; I asked, `Who are they?&#8217; They said, &#8216;Murarah bin Ar-Rabi` Al-`Amri and Hilal bin Umaiyyah Al-Waqifi.&#8217; They mentioned these two pious men who had taken part in the battle of Badr and there was an example for me in them. I was confirmed in my original resolve. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) prohibited the Muslims to talk to the three of us from amongst those who had stayed behind. The people began to avoid us and their attitude towards us changed and it seemed as if the whole atmosphere had turned against us, and it was in fact the same atmosphere of which I was fully aware and in which I had lived (for a fairly long time). We spent fifty nights in this very state and my two friends confined themselves within their houses and spent (most of their) time weeping. As I was the youngest and the strongest, I would leave my house, attend the congregational Salat, move about in the bazaars, but none would speak to me. I would come to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) as he sat amongst (people) after the Salat, greet him and would ask myself whether or not his lips moved in response to my greetings. Then I would perform Salat near him and look at him stealthily. When I finish my Salat, he would look at me and when I would cast a glance at him he would turn away his eyes from me. When the harsh treatment of the Muslims to me continued for a (considerable) length of time, I walked and I climbed upon the wall of the garden of Abu Qatadah, who was my cousin, and I had a great love for him. I greeted him but, by Allah, he did not answer to my greeting. I said to him, `O Abu Qatadah, I adjure you in the Name of Allah, are you not aware that I love Allah and His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)?&#8217; I asked him the same question again but he remained silent. I again adjured him, whereupon he said, `Allah and His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) know better.&#8217; My eyes were filled with tears, and I came back climbing down the wall.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As I was walking in the bazaars of Al-Madinah, a man from the Syrian peasants, who had come to sell food grains in Al-Madinah, asked people to direct him to Ka`b bin Malik. People pointed towards me. He came to me and delivered a letter from the King of Ghassan, and as I was a scribe, I read that letter whose purport was: `It has been conveyed to us that your friend (the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) was treating you harshly. Allah has not created you for a place where you are to be degraded and where you cannot find your right place; so come to us and we shall receive you graciously.&#8217; As I read that letter I said: &#8216;This is too a trial,&#8217; so I put it to fire in an oven. When forty days had elapsed and Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) received no Revelation, there came to me a messenger of the Messenger of Allah and said, `Verily, Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) has commanded you to keep away from your wife.&#8217; I said, `Should I divorce her or what else should I do?&#8217; He said, `No, but only keep away from her and don&#8217;t have sexual contact with her.&#8217; The same message was sent to my companions. So, I said to my wife: &#8216;You better go to your parents and stay there with them until Allah gives the decision in my case.&#8217; The wife of Hilal bin Umaiyyah came to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and said: &#8216;O Messenger of Allah, Hilal bin Umaiyyah is a senile person and has no servant. Do you disapprove if I serve him?&#8217; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `No, but don&#8217;t let him have any sexual contact with you.</span>&#8216; She said, &#8216;By Allah, he has no such desire left in him. By Allah, he has been in tears since (this calamity) struck him.&#8217; Members of my family said to me, `You should have sought permission from Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) in regard to your wife. He has allowed the wife of Hilal bin Umaiyyah to serve him.&#8217; I said, &#8216;I would not seek permission from Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) for I do not know what Messenger of Allah might say in response to that, as I am a young man&#8217;. It was in this state that I spent ten more nights and thus fifty days had passed since people boycotted us and gave up talking to us. After I had offered my Fajr prayer on the early morning of the fiftieth day of this boycott on the roof of one of our houses, and had sat in the very state which Allah described as: `The earth seemed constrained for me despite its vastness&#8217;, I heard the voice of a proclaimer from the peak of the hill Sal` shouting at the top of his voice: &#8216;O Ka`b bin Malik, rejoice.&#8217; I fell down in prostration and came to know that there was (a message of) relief for me. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) had informed the people about the acceptance of our repentance by Allah after he had offered the Fajr prayer. So the people went on to give us glad tidings and some of them went to my companions in order to give them the glad tidings. A man spurred his horse towards me (to give the good news), and another one from the tribe of Aslam came running for the same purpose and, as he approached the mount, I received the good news which reached me before the rider did. When the one whose voice I had heard came to me to congratulate me, I took off my garments and gave them to him for the good news he brought to me. By Allah, I possessed nothing else (in the form of clothes) except these garments, at that time. Then I borrowed two garments, dressed myself and came to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) On my way, I met groups of people who greeted me for (the acceptance of) repentance and they said: &#8216;Congratulations for acceptance of your repentance.&#8217; I reached the mosque where Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was sitting amidst people. Talhah bin `Ubaidullah got up and rushed towards me, shook hands with me and greeted me. By Allah, no person stood up (to greet me) from amongst the Muhajirun besides him.&#8221; Ka`b said that he never forgot (this good gesture of) Talhah. Ka`b further said: &#8220;I greeted Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) with `As-salamu `alaikum&#8217; and his face was beaming with pleasure. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `Rejoice with the best day you have ever seen since your mother gave you birth.</span> &#8216;I said: `O Messenger of Allah! Is this (good news) from you or from Allah?&#8217; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `No, it is from Allah.</span>&#8216; And it was common with Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) that when ever he was happy, his face would glow as if it were a part of the moon and it was from this that we recognized it (his delight). As I sat before him, I said, I have placed a condition upon myself that if Allah accepts my Taubah, I would give up all of my property in charity for the sake of Allah and His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)!&#8217; Thereupon Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `Keep some property with you, as it is better for you.&#8217;</span> I said, &#8216;I shall keep with me that portion which is in Khaibar&#8217;. I added: &#8216;O Messenger of Allah! Verily, Allah has granted me salvation because of my truthfulness, and therefore, repentance obliges me to speak nothing but the truth as long as I am alive.&#8221; Ka`b added: &#8220;By Allah, I do not know anyone among the Muslims who has been granted truthfulness better than me since I said this to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). By Allah! Since the time I made a pledge of this to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), I have never intended to tell a lie, and I hope that Allah would protect me (against telling lies) for the rest of my life. Allah, the Exalted, the Glorious, revealed these Verses:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">&#8216;Allah has forgiven the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), the Muhajirun (Muslim Emigrants who left their homes and came to Al-Madinah) and the Ansar (Muslims of Al-Madinah) who followed him (Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) in the time of distress (Tabuk expedition), after the hearts of a party of them had nearly deviated (from the Right Path), but He accepted their repentance. Certainly, He is unto them full of kindness, Most Merciful. And (He did forgive also) the three who did not join [the Tabuk expedition and whose case was deferred (by the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) for Allah&#8217;s Decision] till for them the earth, vast as it is, was straitened and their ownselves were straitened to them, and they perceived that there is no fleeing from Allah, and no refuge but with Him. Then, He forgave them (accepted their repentance), that they might beg for His Pardon [repent (unto Him)]. Verily, Allah is the One Who forgives and accepts repentance, Most Merciful. O you who believe! Be afraid of Allah, and be with those who are true (in word and deeds).&#8221;</span> (9:117,118).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Ka`b said: &#8220;By Allah, since Allah guided me to Islam, there has been no blessing more significant for me than this truth of mine which I spoke to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), and if I were to tell a lie I would have been ruined as were ruined those who had told lies, for Allah described those who told lies with the worst description He ever attributed to anybody else, as He sent down the Revelation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"> They will swear by Allah to you (Muslims) when you return to them, that you may turn away from them. So turn away from them. Surely, they are Rijsun [i.e., Najasun (impure) because of their evil deeds], and Hell is their dwelling place &#8211; a recompense for that which they used to earn. They (the hypocrites) swear to you (Muslims) that you may be pleased with them, but if you are pleased with them, certainly Allah is not pleased with the people who are Al-Fa&#8217;siqun (rebellious, disobedient to Allah)&#8221;.</span> (9:95,96)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Ka`b further added: &#8220;The matter of the three of us remained pending for decision apart from the case of those who had made excuses on oath before Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and he accepted those, took fresh oaths of allegiance from them and supplicated for their forgiveness. The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) kept our matter pending till Allah decided it.<span style="color:#ff0000;"> The three whose matter was deferred have been shown mercy.</span> The reference here is not to our staying back from the expedition but to his delaying our matter and keeping it pending beyond the matter of those who made their excuses on oath which he accepted&#8221;.<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Another version adds: &#8220;Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) set out for Tabuk on Thursday. He used to prefer to set out on journey on Thursday.&#8221; Another version says: &#8220;Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to come back from a journey in the early forenoon and went straight to the mosque where he would perform two Rak`ah prayer. Afterwards he would seat himself there&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>22.</b>  Imran bin Al-Husain Al-Khuza`i (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A woman from the tribe Juhainah came to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) while she was pregnant from (Zina) adultery and said to him: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! I have committed an offense liable to Hadd (prescribed punishment), so exact the execution of the sentence.&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) called her guardian and said to him,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Treat her kindly. Bring her to me after the delivery of the child.&#8221;</span> That man complied with the orders. At last the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) commanded to carry out the sentence. Her clothes were secured around her and she was stoned to death. The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) led her funeral prayers. `Umar submitted: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! She committed Zina and you have performed funeral prayer for her?&#8221; He replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Verily, she made repentance which would suffice for seventy of the people of Al-Madinah if it is divided among them. Can there be any higher degree of  repentance than that she sacrificed her life voluntarily to win the Pleasure of Allah, the Exalted?&#8221;.</span><br>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>23.</b> Ibn &#8216;Abbas and Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;If a son of Adam were to own a valley full of gold, he would desire to have two. Nothing can fill his mouth except the earth (of the grave). Allah turns with mercy to him who turns to Him in repentance&#8221;.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>24.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah, the Exalted, smiles at two men, one of them killed the other and both will enter Jannah. The first is killed by the other while he is fighting in the Cause of Allah, and thereafter Allah will turn in mercy to the second and guide him to accept Islam and then he dies as a Shaheed (martyr) fighting in the Cause of Allah.&#8221;</span><br>

Chapter 4<br>
Truthfulness</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;O you who believe! Be afraid of Allah, and be with those who are true (in words and deeds)&#8221;.</b></span><b> (9:119)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;the men and women who are truthful (in their speech and deeds)..&#8221;.</b></span><b> (33:35)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;then if they had been true to Allah, it would have been better for them&#8221;.</b></span><b> (47:21)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>54.</b> Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Truth leads to piety and piety leads to Jannah. A man persists in speaking the truth till he is enrolled with Allah as a truthful. Falsehood leads to vice and vice leads to the Fire (Hell), and a person persists on telling lies until he is enrolled as a liar&#8221;.&#8217;</span><br>
[Agreed upon].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>55.</b> Hasan bin `Ali (May Allah be pleased with them) said: I remember (these words) from Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam):<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Give up what is doubtful to you for that which is not doubtful; for truth is peace of mind and falsehood is doubt&#8221;.</span><br>
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>56.</b> Abu Sufyan (May Allah be pleased with him) reported, in course of his detailed narration about Heraclius when the latter questioned him about the teachings of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) He said that: He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) told (us):<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Worship Allah Alone and do not associate a thing with Him; and give up all that your ancestors said. &#8220;</span>He also commands us to perform Salat (prayers), to speak the truth, to observe modesty and to strengthen the ties of kinship<span style="color:#0000ff;">.</span><br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>57.</b>  Abu Thabit from Sahl bin Hunaif (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He who asks Allah for martyrdom, Allah will raise him to the high status of the martyrs, even if he dies on his bed&#8221;.</span><br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>58.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;One of the earlier Prophets who was out on an expedition proclaimed among his people that no man should follow him who had married a woman with whom he wished to cohabit but had not yet done so, or who had built houses on which he had not yet put the roofs, or who had bought sheep or pregnant she-camels and was expecting them to produce young. He, then, went on the expedition and approached the town at the time of the &#8216;Asr prayer or little before it. He then told the sun that both it and he were under command and prayed Allah to hold it back for them, so it was held back till Allah gave him victory. He collected the spoils and it (meaning fire) came to devour these, but did not. He said that among the people there was a man who stole from the booty. He told them that a man from every tribe must swear allegiance to him, and when a man&#8217;s hand stuck to his, he said: &#8220;There is thief among you and every individual of your tribe must swear allegiance to me&#8221;. (In course of swearing of allegiance,) hands of two or three persons stuck to his hand. He said: &#8220;The thief is among you&#8221;. They brought him a head of gold like a cow&#8217;s head and when he laid it down, the fire came and devoured the spoils. Spoils were not allowed to anyone before us, then Allah allowed spoils to us as He saw our weakness and incapacity and allowed them to us&#8221;</span>.<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>59.</b> Hakim bin Hizam (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Both parties in a business transaction have a right to annul it so long as they have not separated; and if they tell the truth and make everything clear to each other (i.e., the seller and the buyer speak the truth, the seller with regard to what is purchased, and the buyer with regard to the money) they will be blessed in their transaction, but if they conceal anything and lie, the blessing on their transaction will be eliminated.&#8221;</span><br>

And as for those who have a yearning for error    they go after the allegorical verses seeking (to cause) dissension, by seeking to explain    them. And none knows their implications but Allah, and those who are sound in knowledge    say: We affirm our faith in everything which is from our Lord. It is only the persons of    understanding who really heed&#8221; (iii. 6). &#8216;A&#8217;isha (further) reported that Allah&#8217;s    Messenger (may peace be upon him) said (in connection with these verses): When you see    such verses, avoid them, for it is they whom Allah has pointed out (in the mentioned    verses).</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Urwa b. Zubair reported that &#8216;A&#8217;isha said to him: This    news has reached me that &#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Amr al-&#8216;As would pass by us during the Hajj season,    so you meet him and ask him (about religious matters) as he has acquired great knowledge    from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). I thus met him and asked him about things    which he narrated from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). And amongst these the    one he mentioned was that Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: Verily, Allah does    not take away knowledge from people directly but he takes away the scholars and    consequently takes away (knowledge) along with them and leaves amongst persons the    ignorant as their leaders who deliver religious verdicts without (adequate) knowledge and    themselves go astray and lead others astray. &#8216;Urwa said: When I narrated this to &#8216;A&#8217;isha,    she deemed it too much (to believe) and thus showed reluctance to accept that (as    perfectly true) and said to, &#8216;Urwa: Did he (&#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Amr) say to you that he had    heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) as saying: (&#8216;Urwa had forgotten to ask this    from &#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Amr). So when it was the next year, she (&#8216;A&#8217;isha) said to him (&#8216;Urwa):    Ibn Amr has come (for Hajj), so meet him. talk to him and ask him about this hadith that    he narrated to You (last year on the occasion of the Hajj) pertaining to knowledge. He    (&#8216;Urwa), said: So I met him, and asked about it and he narrated to me exactly like one    that he had narrated (to me) for the first time. So when I informed her (&#8216;A&#8217;isha) about    that, she said: I do not think but this that he has certainly told the truth and I find    that be has neither made any addition to it, nor missed anything from it.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Jarir b. Abdullah reported that some desert Arabs clad in    woollen clothes came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). He saw them in sad    plight as they had been hard pressed by need. He (the Holy Prophet) exhorted people to    give charity, but they showed some reluctance until (signs) of anger could be seen on his    face. Then a person from the Ansar came with a purse containing silver. Then came another    person and then other persons followed them in succession until signs of happiness could    be seen on his (sacred) face. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He    who introduced some good practice in Islam which was followed after him (by people) he    would be assured of reward like one who followed it, without their rewards being    diminished in any respect. And he who introduced some evil practice in Islam which had    been followed subsequently (by others), he would be required to bear the burden like that    of one who followed this (evil practice) without their&#8217;s being diminished in any respect.</font></p>

Thereupon Abu Bakr wept and he wept bitterly and said: Let our fathers and our mothers be taken as ransom for you. It was Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) who had been given the choice and Abu Bakr knew it better than us, and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) is reported to have said: Behold, of all people the most generous toward me in regard to his companionship and his property was Abu Bakr and were I to choose anyone as my bosom friend, I would have chosen Abu Bakr as my dear friend, but (for him) I cherish Islamic brotherliness and love. There shall be left open no window in the mosque except Abu Bakr&#8217;s window.</p>

He was a hypocrite and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said prayer over him that Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed the verse:&#8221; And never pray over any one of them that has died and never should you stand by his grave&#8221; (ix. 84).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Musa Ash&#8217;ari reported that he performed ablution in his house and then came out saying: I would remain with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) the whole day long. He came to the mosque, and asked about Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him). They (his Companions) said: He has gone in this direction. He (Abu Musa Ash&#8217;ari) said: I followed his steps asking about him until I came to Bi&#8217;r Aris (it is a well in the suburb of Medina). I sat by its wooden door until Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had relieved himself and then performed ablution. I went to him and he was sitting with his shanks uncovered hp to the knees and his legs dangl- ing in that well. I offered him salutations. I then came back and sat at the door as if I had been a chamberlain at the door of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) that day. There came Abu Bakr and knocked the door and I said: Who is it? He said: This is Abu Bakr. I said: Wait, please. I went and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, here is Abu Bakr seeking permission. Thereupon he said: Admit him and give him glad tidings of Paradise. I came and I said to Abu Bakr to get in (and also told him) that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was giving him the glad tidings of Paradise. Abu Bakr got in and sat on the right side of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and dangled his feet in the well as Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had done, and he uncovered his shanks. I then returned and sat there and I had left my brother as he had been performing ablution and he was to meet me and I said: If Allah would intend goodness for such and such he would intend goodness for his brother and He would bring him. I was thinking this that a person stirred the door. I said: Who is it. He said: This is Umar b., Khattab. I said: Wait. Then I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), greeted him and said: Here is &#8216;Umar seeking your. permission to get in. Thereupon he said: Let him come in and give him glad tid- ings of Paradise. I came to Umar and said: There is permission for you and glad tidings for you from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) for Paradise. He got in and sat on the left side of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) with his feet dangling in the well. I then returned and sat and said: If Allah would intend goodness for such and such (that is for his brother), He would bring him. And I was contemplat- ing over it that a man stirred the door and I said: Who is it? He said: This is Uthman b. Affan. I said: Wait, please. I then came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and informed him. and he said: Admit him and give him glad tidings (and inform) him of the turmoil which he shall have to face. I came and said: Get in, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) gives you the glad tidings of Paradise along with the trial which you shall have to face. He got in and saw the elevated plan round the well fully occupied. He sat on the other side. Sharik said that Sa&#8217;id b. al-Musayyib reported: I drew a conclusion from it that their groves would be (in this very state, the graves of Hadrat Abu Bakr, &#8216;Umar Faruq by the tide of the Holy Prophet [may peace be upon him] and the grave of Hadrat &#8216;Uthman away from their graves).</p>

Thereupon he said: His wives are the members of his family (but here) the members of his family are those for whom acceptance of Zakat is forbidden. And he said: Who are they? Thereupon he said: &#8216;Ali and the offspring of &#8216;Ali, &#8216;Aqil and the offspring of &#8216;Aqil and the offspring of Ja&#8217;far and the offspring of &#8216;Abbas.

She passed three days in this state until she fainted because of extreme hunger and at that time her son whose name was Umara stood up and served her drink and she began to curse Sa&#8217;d that Allah, the Exalted and Glorions, revealed these verses of the Holy Qur&#8217;an:&#8221; And We have enjoined upon a person goodness to his parents but if they contend with thee to associate (others) with Me of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not&#8221; (xxix. 8) ; Treat thein with customary good in this world&#8221; (xxxi. 15).

I picked that up and came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Bestow this sword upon me (as my share in the spoils of war) and you know my state. Thereupon he said: Return it to the place from where you picked it up. I went back until I decided to throw it in a store but my soul repulsed me so I came back and asked him to give that sword to me. He said in a loud voice to return it to the place from where I had picked it up. It was on this occasion that this verse was revealed:&#8221; They asked about the spoils of war&#8221; (viii. 1). He further said: I once fell ill and sent a message to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him). He visited me and I said to him: Permit me to distribute (in charity) my property as much as I like. He did not agree. I said: (Permit me to distribute) half of it. He did not agree. I said: (Permit me to distribute) the third part, whereupon he kept quiet and it was after this (that the distribution of one&#8217;s property in charity) to the extent of one-third was held valid. He further said: I came to a group of persons of the Ansir and Muhajirin and they said: Come, so that we may serve you wine, and it was before the use of wine had been prohibited. I went to them in a garden and there had been with them the roasted head of a camel and a small water-skin containing wine. I ate and drank along with them and there came under discussion the Ansr (Helpers) and Muhajirin (immigrants). I said: The immigrants are better than the Ansar, that a person picked up a portion of the head (of the camel and struck me with it that my nose was injured. I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and informed him of the situation that Aliah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed verses pertaining to wine:&#8221; Intoxicants and the games of chance and (sacrificing to) stones set up and (divining by) arrows are only an uncleanliness, the devil&#8217;s work&#8221; (v. 90).</p>

She ouaht permission to get in as he had been lying with me in my mantle. He gave her permission and she said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, verily, your wives have sent me to you in order to ask you to observe equity in case of the daughter of Abu Quhafa. She (&#8216;A&#8217;isha) said: I kept quiet. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to her (Fatima): 0 daughter, don&#8217;t you love whom I love? She said: Yes, (I do). Thereupon he said: I love this one. Fatima then stood up as she heard this from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and went to the wives of Allatt&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and informed them of what she had said to him and what Allah&#8217;s messenger (may peace be upon him) had said to her. Thereupon they said to her: We think that you have been of no avail to us. You may again go to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and tell him that his wives seek equity in case of the daughter of Abu Quhafa. Fitima said: By Allah, I will never talk to him about this matter. &#8216;A&#8217;isha (further) reported: The wives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) then sent Zainab b. jahsh, the wife of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him), and she was one who was somewhat equal in rank with me in the eyes of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and I have never seen a woman more advanced in religious piety than Zainab, more God-conscious, more truthful, more alive to the ties of blood, more generous and having more. sense of self-sacrifice in practical life and having more charitable disposition and thus more close to God, the Exalted, than her. She, however, lost temper very soon but was soon calm. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) permitted her to enter as she (&#8216;A&#8217;isha) was along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) in her mantle, in the same very state when Fatima had entered. She said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, your wives have sent me to you seeking equity in case of the daughter of Abu Quhafa. She then came to me and showed harshness to me and I was seeing the eyes of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) whether he would permit me. Zainab went on until I came to know that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) would not disapprove if I retorted. Then I exchanged hot words until I made her quiet. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) smiled and said: She is the daughter of Abu Bakr.

The first one said: My husband is a sort of the meat of a lean camel placed at the top of a hill, which it is difficult to climb up, nor (the meat) is good enough that one finds in oneself the urge to take it away (from the top of that mountain).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second one said: My husband (is so bad) that I am afraid I would not be able to describe his faults-both visible and invisible completely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third one said: My husband is a long-statured fellow (i. e. he lacks intelligence). If I give vent to my feelings about him, he would divorce me, and if I keep quiet I would be made to live in a state of suspense (neither completely abandoned by him nor entertained as wife).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth one said: My husband is like the night of Tihama (the night of Hijaz and Mecca), neither too cold nor hot, neither there is any fear of him nor grief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fifth one said: My husband is (like) a leopard as he enters the house, and behaves like a lion when he gets out, and he does not ask about that which he leaves in the house.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sixth one said: So far as my husband is concerned, he eats so much that nothing is left back and when he drinks he drinks that no drop is left behind. And when he lies down he wraps his body and does not touch me so that he may know my grief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The seventh one said: My husband is heavy in spirit, having no brightness in him, impotent, suffering from all kinds of conceivable diseases, heaving such rough manners that he may break my head or wound my body, or may do both.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eighth one said: My husband is as sweet as the sweet-smelling plant, and as soft as the softness of the hare.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ninth one said: My husband is the master of a lofty building, long-statured, having heaps of ashes (at his door) and his house is near the meeting place and the inn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tenth one said: My husband is Malik, and how fine Malik is, much above appreciation and praise (of mine). He has many folds of his camel, more in number than the pastures for them. When they (the camels) hear the sound of music they become sure that they are going to be slaughtered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eleventh one said: My husband is Abu Zara&#8217;. How fine Abu Zara&#8217; is! He has suspended in my ears heavy ornaments and (fed me liberally) that my sinews and bones are covered with fat. So he made me happy. He found me among the shepherds living in the side of the mountain, and he made me the owner of the horses, camels and lands and heaps of grain and he finds no fault with me. I sleep and get up in the morning (at my own sweet will) and drink to my heart&#8217;s content. The mother of Abu Zara&#8217;, how fine is the mother of Abu Zara&#8217;! Her bundles are heavily packed (or receptacles in her house are filled to the brim) and the house quite spacious. So far as the son of Abu Zara&#8217; is concerned, his bed is as soft as a green palm-stick drawn forth from its bark, or like a sword drawn forth from its scabbard, and whom just an arm of a lamb is enough to satiate. So far as the daughter of Abu Zara&#8217; is concerned, how fine is the daughter of Abu Zara&#8217;, obedient to her father, obedient to her mother, wearing sufficient flesh and a source of jealousy for her co-wife. As for the slave-girl of Abu Zara&#8217;, how fine is she; she does not disclose our affairs to others (outside the four walls of the house). She does not remove our wheat, or provision, or take it forth, or squander it, but she preserves it faithfully (as a sacred trust). And she does not let the house fill with rubbish. One day Abu Zara&#8217; went out (of his house) when the milk was churned in the vessels, that he met a woman, having two children like leopards playing with her pomegranates (chest) under her vest. He divorced me (Umm Zara&#8217;) and married that woman (whom Abu Zara&#8217;) met on the way. I (Umm Zara&#8217;) later on married another person, a chief, who was an expert rider, and a fine archer: he bestowed upon me many gifts and gave me one pair of every kind of animal and said: Umm Zara&#8217;, make use of everything (you need) and send forth to your parents (but the fact) is that even if I combine all the gifts that he bestowed upon me, they stand no comparison to the least gift of Abu Zara&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;A&#8217;isha reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to me: I am for you as Abu Zara&#8217; was for Umm Zara&#8217;.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Miswar b. Makhramali reported that he heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) say, as he sat on the pulpit: The sons of Hisham b. Mughira have asked my permission to marry their daughter with &#8216;Ali b. Abi Talib (that refers to the daughter of Abu Jahl for whom &#8216;All had sent a proposal for marriage). But I would not allow them, I would not allow them, I would not allow them (and the only alternative possible is) that &#8216;Ali should divorce my daughter (and then marry their daughter), for my daughter is part of me. He who disturbs her in fact disturbs me and he who offends her offends me.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(Imam Zain-ul-&#8216;Abidin) &#8216;Ali b. Husain reported that when they came to Medina from Yazid b. Mu&#8217;awiya after the martyrdom of Husain b. &#8216;Ali (Allah be pleased with him) Miswar b. Makhramah met him and said to him: Is there any work for me which you ask me to do? I said to him: No. He again said to me: Would you not give me the sword of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) for I fear that the people may snatch it from you? By Allah, if you give that to me, no one would be able to take it away, so long as there is life in me. Verily &#8216;Ali b. Abi Talib sent a proposal of marriage to the daughter of Abu Jahl in spite of (the fact that his wife) Fatima (had been living in his house). Thereupon I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) say while addressing the people on the pulpit. I was adolescing in those days. He said: Fatima is a part of me and I fear that she may be put to trial in regard to religion. He then made a mention of his son-in law who had been from the tribe of &#8216;Abd Shams and praised his behaviour as a son-in-law and said: Whatever he said to me he told the truth and whatever he promised he fulfilled it for me. I am not going to declare forbidden what is lawful and make lawful what is forbidden, but, by Allah, the daaghter of Allah&#8217;s Messenger and the daughter of the enemy of Allah can never be combined at one place.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Ali b. Husain reported that Miswar b. Makhramah informed him that &#8216;Ali b. Abi Talib sent the proposal of marriage to the daughter of Abu Jahl as he had Fatima, the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), (as his wife). When Fatima heard about it, she came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and said: The people say that you never feel angry on account of your daughters and now &#8216;Ali is going to marry the daughter of Abu Jahl. Makhramah said: Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) rose up and I heard him reciting Tashahhud and say: Now to the point. I gave a daughter of mine (Zainab) to Abu&#8217;l-&#8216;As b. Rabi, and he spoke to me and spoke the truth. Verily Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad, is a part of me and I do not approve that she may be put to any trial and by Allah, the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Messenger cannot be combined with the daughter of God&#8217;s enemy (as the co-wives) of one person. Thereupon &#8216;Ali gave up (the idea of his intended) marriage. This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Zuhri with the same chain of transmitters.</p>

She said: Yes, now I can do that (so listen to it). When he talked to me secretly for the first time he informed me that Gabirel was in the habit of reciting the Qur&#8217;an along with him once or twice every year, but this year it had been twice and so he perceived his death quite near, so fear Allah and be patient (and he told me) that he would be a befitting forerunner for me and so I wept as you saw me.

He (Abu Dharr) said: My nephew, I used to observe prayer three years before my meeting with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). I said: For whom did you say prayer? He said: For Allah. I said: To which direction did you turn your face (for observing prayer)? He said: I used to turn my face as Allah has directed me to turn my face. I used to observe the night prayer at the time of the end of night and I fell down in prostration like the mantle until the sun rose over me. Unais said: I have a work in Mecca, so you better stay here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unais went until he came to Mecca and he came to me late. I said: What did you do? He said: I met a person in Mecca who is on your religion and he claims that verily it is Allah Who has sent him. I said: What do the people say about him? He said: They say that he is a poet or a Kahin or a magician. Unais who was himself one of the poets said. I have heard the words of a Kahin but his words in no way resemble his (words). And 1 also compared his words to the verses of poets but such words cannot be uttered by any poet. By Allah, he is truthful and they are liars. Then I said: you stay here, until I go, so that I should see him. He said: I came to Mecca and I selected an insignificant person from amongst them and said to him: Where is he whom you call as-Sabi? He pointed out towards me saying: He is Sabi. Thereupon the people of the valley attacked me with sods and bows until I fell down unconscious. I stood up after havin. regained my consciousness and I found as if I was a red idol. I came to Zamzarn and washed blood from me and drank water from it and listen, O son of my brother, I stayed there for thirty nights or days and there was no food for me but the water of Zamzarn. And I became so bulky that there appeared wrinkles upon my stomach, and I did not feel any hunger in my stomach. It was during this time that the people of Mecca slept in the moonlit night and none was there to eircumambulate the House but only two women who had been invoking the name of Isafa, and Na&#8217;ila (the two idols).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They came to me while in their circuit and I said: Marry one with the other, but they did not dissuade from their invoking. They came to me and I said to them: Insert wood (in the idols&#8217; private parts). (I said this to them in such plain words) as I could not express in metaphorical terms. These women went away crying and saying: Had there been one amongst our people (he would have taught a lesson to you for the obscene words used for our idols before us). These women met Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and Abu Bakr who had also been coming down the hill. He asked them: What has happened to you? They said: There is Sabi, who has hidden himself between the Ka&#8217;ba and its curtain. He said: What did he say to you? They said: He uttered such words before us as we cannot express. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came and he kissed the Black Stone and circumambulated the House along with his Companion and then observed prayer, and when he had finished his prayer, Abu Dharr said: I was the first to greet him with the salutation of peace and uttered (these words) in this way; Allah&#8217;s Messen- ger, may there be peace upon you, whereupon he said: It may be upon you too and the mercy of Allah. He then said: Who are you? I said: From the tribe of Ghifar. He leaned his hand and placed his finger on his forehead and I said to myself: Perhaps he has not liked it that I belong to the tribe of Ghifar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I attempted to catch hold of his hand but his friend who knew about him more than I dissuaded me f rom doing so. He then lifted his head and said: Since how long have you been here? I said: I have been here for the last thirty nights or days. He said: Who has been feeding you? I said: There has been no food for me but the water of Zamzam. I have grown so bulky that there appear wrinkles upon my stomach and I do not feel any hunger. He said: It is blessed (water) and it also serves as food. Thereupon Abu Bakr said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, let me serve as a host to him for tonight, and then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) proceeded forth and so did Abu Bakr and I went along with them. Abu Bakr opened the door and then he brought for us the raisins of Ta&#8217;if and that was the first food which I ate there. Then I stayed as long as I had to stay. I then came to Allah&#8217;s Messenaer (may peace be upon him) and he said: I have been shown the land abound- ing in trees and I think it cannot be but that of Yathrib (that is the old name of Medina). You are a preacher to your people on my behalf. I hope Allah would benefit them through you and He would reward you. I came to Unais and he said: What have you done? I said: I have done that I have embraced Islam and I have testified (to the prophethood of Allah&#8217;s Messenger). He said: I have no aversion for your religion and I also embrace Islam and testify (to the prophethood of Muhammad). Then both of us came to our mother and she said: I have no aversion for your religion and I also embrace Islam and testify to the prophethood of Muhammad. We then loaded our camels and came to our tribe Ghifir and half of the tribe embraced Islam and their chief was Aimi&#8217; b. Rahada Ghifirl and he was their leader and hall of the tribe said: We will embrace Islam when Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may p,. ace be upon him) would come to Medina, and when Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to Medina the remaining half also embraced Islam. Then a tribe Aslam came to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, we also embrace Islam like our brothers who have embraced Islam. And they also embraced Islam. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Allah granted pardon to the tribe of Ghifar and Allah saved (from destruction) the tribe of Aslam.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbas reported that when Abu Dharr heard of the advent of the Apostle (may peace be upon him) in Mecca he said: Brother, ride in this valley and bring information for me about the person who claims that there comes to him information from the Heavens. Listen to his words and then come to me. So he rode on until he came to Mecca and he heard his words (the sacred words of the Holy Prophet) and then came back to Abu Dharr and said: I have seen him exhorting (people) to develop good morals and his expressions can in no way be termed as poetry. He (Abu Dharr) said: I have not been satisfied with it regarding that which I had in my mind (as I sent you). So he took up provisions for the journey and a small water-skin con- taining water (and set forth) until he came to Mecca. He came to the mosque (Ka&#8217;ba) and began to find out Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and he did not re- cognise him (the Holy Prophet) and he did not even like that he should ask about him from anyone until it was night, and he slept. &#8216;All saw him and found him to be a stranger. So he went with him. He followed hive but one did not make any inquiry from the other about anything until it was morning. He then brought the water and his provisions to the mosque and spent a day there, but he did not see Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) until it was night. He then returned to his bed that there happened to pass &#8216;Ali and he said: This man has not been able to find his destination until this time. He made him stand and he went with him and no one made an in- quiry from his companion about anything. And when it was the third day he did the same. &#8216;Ali made him stand up and brought him along with him. He said: By Him, besides Whom there is no god, why don&#8217;t you tell me (the reason) which brought you here to this town? He said: (I shall do this) provided you hold me promise and a covenant that you would guide me aright. He then did that. He (&#8216;Ali) said: Verily, he Is truthful and he is a Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and when it is morning, follow me and if I would say anything from which I would sense fear about you I would stand (in a manner) as if I was throwing water and if I move on, you then follow me until I get in (some house). He did that and I followed him until he came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). He entered (the house) of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) along with him and listened to his words and embraced Islam at his very place. Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said to him: Go to your people and inform them until my command reaches you. Thereupon he said: By Him in Whose Hand is my life, I shall say to the people of Mecca this thing at the top of my voice So he set forth until he came to the mosque and then spoke at the top of his voice (saying): I bear testimony to the fact that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. The people attacked him and made him fall down when &#8216;Abbas came and he leaned over him and said: Woe be upon you, don&#8217;t you know that he is from amongst the tribe of Ghifar and your trad- ing route to Syria passes through (the settlements of this tribe), and he rescued him. He (Abu Dharr) did the same on the next day and they (the Meccans) again attacked him and Abbas leaned upon him and he rescued him.</p>

Some people said: He is a person from amongst the people of Paradise; he is a person from amongst the people of Paradise. He observed two short rak&#8217;ahs of prayer and then went out. I followed him and he got into his house and I also got in and we began to converse with each other. And when he became familiar (with me) I said to Him: When you entered (the mosque) before (your entrance in the house) a person said so and so (that you are amongst the people of Paradise), whereupon he said: It is not meet for anyone to say anything which he does not know. I shall (now) tell you why they (say) this. I saw a dream during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and narrated it to him. I seemed to be in a garden [he described its vastness, its rich fructification and its verdure]; in the midst of it, there stood an iron pillar, with its base in the earth and its summit in the sky: and upon its summit there was a handhold. It was said to me: Climb up this (pillar). I said to him (visitant in the dream): I am unable to do it. Thereupon a helper came to me, and he (supported) me (by catching hold of my) garment from behind and thus helped me with his hand and so I climbed up till I was at the summit of the pillar, and grasped the handhold. It was said to me: Ho d it tightly. It was at this that I woke up when (the handhold) was in fthe grip) of my hand. I narrated it (the dream) to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him), whereupon he said: That garden implies al-Islam and that pillar implies the pillar of Islam. And that handhold is the firmest faith (as refered to in the Qur&#8217;an). And you will remain attached to Islam until you shall die. And that man was &#8216;Abdullah b. Salim.</p>

Verily I saw as if a pillar had been raised in a green garden and there had been fixed at its (upper) end a handhold and there was a helper at its base. It was said to me: Climb up. So I climbed up and caught hold of the haildhold.

I said to him: As you stood up, I heard people say about you: He who is desirous of seeing a person from among the people of Paradise should look at him. So I became desirous of accompanying you. He (&#8216;Abdullah b. Salim) said: It is Allah Who knows best about the people of Paradise. I would, however, narrate to you as to why they said like it. (The story is) that while I was asleep (one night) there came to me a person (in the dream) who asked me to stand up. (So I stood up) and he caught hold of my hand and I walked along with him, and, lo, I found some paths on my left and I was about to set out upon them. Thereupon he said to me Do not set yourself on (them) for these are the paths of the leftists (denizens of Hell-fire). Then there were paths leading to the right side, whereupon he said: Set yourself on these paths. We came across a hill and he said to me: Climb up, and I attempted to climb up that I fell upon my buttocks. I made several attempts (but failed to succeed). He led until he came to a pillar (so high) that its upper end touched the sky and its base was in the earth. And there was a handhold at its upper end. He said to me Climb over it. I said: How can I climb upon it, as its upper end touches the sky? He cought hold of my hand and pushed me up and I found myself suspended with the handhold. He then struck the pillar and it fell down, but I remained attached to that handhold until it was morning (and the dream was thus over). I came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and narrated it to him. He said: So far as the paths which you saw on your left are concerned, these are paths of the leftists (denizens of Hell) and the paths which you saw on your right, these are the paths of the rightists (the dwellers of Paradise) and the mountain represents the destination of the martyrs which you would not be able to attain. The pillar implies the pillar of Islam. and so far as the handhold is concerned, it implies the handhold of Islam, and you would hold to it fastly until you would meet death.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;A&#8217;isha reported: Don&#8217;t you feel surprised at Abu Huraira? He came (one day) and sat beside the nook of my apartment and began to narrate (the hadith of Allah&#8217;s Apostle). I was hearing while I was engaged in extolling Allah (reciting Subhan Allah) constantly. He stood up before I finished my repetition of Subhan Allah. if I were to meet him I would have warned him in stern words that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) did not speak so quickly as you talk. Ibn Shihab transmitted on the authority of Ibn Musayyib that Abu Huraira said: People say that Abu Huraira transmits so many ahadith, whereas Allah is the Reckoner, and they say: How is it with Muhajirs and the Ansar that they do not narrate ahadith like him (like Abu Huraira)? Abu Huraira said: I tell you that my brothers from Ansar remained busy with their lands and my brothers Muhajirs were busy in transactions in the bazars, but I always kept myself attached to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) with bare subsistence. I remained present (in the company of the Holy Prophet), whereas they had been absent. I retained in my mind (what the Holy Prophet said), whereas they forgot it. One day Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He who amongst you spreads the cloth and listens to my talk and would then press it against his chest would never forget anything heard from me. So I spread my mantle and when he had concluded his talk I then pressed it against my chest and so I never forgot after that day anything that he (the Holy Prophet) said. And if these two verses would not have been revealed in the Book I would have never transmitted anything (to anybody):&#8221; Those who conceal the clear evidence and the guidance that We revealed&#8221; (ii. 159) tip to the last verse.</p>

She would be in possession of a letter, which you must get from her. So we rushed on horses and when we met that woman, we asked her to deliver that letter to us. She said: There is no letter with me. We said: Either bring out that letter or we would take off your clothes. She brought out that letter from (the plaited hair of) her head. We delivered that letter to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) in which Hatib b. Abu Balta&#8217;a had informed some people amongst the polytheists of Mecca about the affairs of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Hatib, what is this? He said: Allah&#8217;s messenger, do not be hasty in judging my intention. I was a person attached to the Quraish. Sufyan said: He was their ally but had no relationship with them. (Hatib further said): Those who are with you amongst the emigrants have blood-relationship with them (the Quraish) and thus they would protect their families. I wished that when I had no blood-relationship with them I should find some supporters from (amongst them) who would help my family. I have not done this because of any unbelief or apostasy and I have no liking for the unbelief after I have (accepted) Islam. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: You have told the truth. &#8216;Umar said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, permit me to strike the neck of this hypocrite.

I went to him and said: Uncle, who shot an arrow upon you? Abu &#8216;Amir pointed out to Abu Musa and said: Verily that one who shot an arrow upon me in fact killed me. Abu Musa said: I followed him with the determination to kill him and overtook him and when he saw me he turned upon his heels. I followed him and I said to him: Don&#8217;t you feel ashamed (that you run), aren&#8217;t you an Arab? Why don&#8217;t you stop? He stopped and I had an encounter with him and we exchanged the strokes of (swords). I struck him with the sword and killed him. Then I came back to Abu Amir and said: Verily Allah has killed the one who killed you. And he said: Now draw out this arrow. I drew out the arrow and there came out from that (wound) water. Abu &#8216;Amir said: My nephew, go to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and convey my greetings to him and tell him that Abu Amir begs you to ask forgiveness for him. And Abu Amir appointed me as the chief of the people and he died after a short time. When I came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) I visited him and he had been lying on the cot woven by strings and there was (no) bed over it and so there had been marks of the strings on the back of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and on his sides.

He again said: O Allah, grant him distinction amongst the majority of Thine created beings or from amongst the people. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, ask forgiveness for me too.

And I was accompanied by two brothers of mine, I being the youngest of them; one of them was Abu Burda and the other one was Abu Ruhm, and there were some other persons with them. Some say they were fifty-three or fifty-two persons of my tribe. We embarked upon a boat, and the boat sailed away to the Negus of Abyssinia. There we met Ja&#8217;far b. Abu Talib and his companions. Ja&#8217;far said: Allall&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has sent us here and has commanded us to stay here and you should also stay with us. So we stayed with him and we came back (to Medina) and met Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) when Khaibar had been conquered. He (the Holy Prophet) allocated a share to us and in the ordinary course he did not allocate the share to one who had been absent on the occasion of the conquest of Khaibar but conferred (a share) upon him only who had been present there with him. He, however, made an exception for the people of the boat, viz. for Ja&#8217;far and his companions. He allocated a share to them, and some persons from amongst the people said to us, viz. the people of the boat: We have preceded you in migration. Asma&#8217; bint &#8216;Umais who had migrated to Abyssinia and had come back along with them (along with immigrants) visited Hafsa, the wife of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him). (Accordingly), Umar had been sitting with her (Hafsa). As &#8216;Umar saw Asma, he said: Who is she? She (Hafsa) said: She is Asma, daughter of &#8216;Umais. He said: She is an Abyssinian and a sea-woman. Asma said: Yes, it is so. Thereupon &#8216;Umar said: We preceded you in migration and so we have more right to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as compared with you. At this she felt annoyed and said: &#8216;Umar, you are not stating the fact; by Allah, you had the privilege of being in the company of the Messenger (may peace be upon him) who fed the hungry among you and instructed the ignorant amongst you, whereas we had been far (from here) in the land of Abyssinia amongst the enemies and that was all for Allah and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and, by Allah, I would never take food nor take water unless I make a mention to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) of what you have said. We remained in that country in constant trouble and dread and I shall talk about it to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (way peace be upon him) and ask him (about it). By Allah, I shall not tell a lie and deviate (from the truth) and add anything to that. So, when Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) came, she said: Allah&#8217;s Apostle, &#8216;Umar says so and so. Upon this Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: His right is not more than yours, for him and his companions there is one migration, but for you, i. e. for the people of the boat, there are two migrations. She said: I saw Abu Musa and the people of the boat coming to me in groups and asking me about this hadith, because there was nothing more pleasing and more significant for them than this. Abu Burda reported that Asma said: I saw Abu Musa, asking me to repeat this hadith to him again and again.</p>

So he came to Uwais and said.: Beg forgiveness (from Allah) for me. He (Uwais) said: You have just come from a sacred journey (Hajj) ; you, therefore, ask forgiveness for me. He (the person who had performed Hajj) said: Ask forgiveness for me (from Allah). He (Uwais again) said: You have just come from the sacred journey, so you ask forgiveness for me. (Uwais further) said: Did you meet Umar? He said: Yes. He (Uwais) then begged forgiveness for him (from Allah). So the people came to know about (the status of religious piety) of Uwais. He went away (from that place). Usair said: His clothing consisted of a mantle, and whosoever saw him said: From where did Uwais get this mantle?</p>

<p>    </p>
<h3 align="center"><font><em>The Book on Salutations and Greetings  (Kitab As-Salam) </em></font>    </h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><br></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Just as the face is the index to the mind, in the same way  the words of greetings which are exchanged amongst people indicate the spiritual role of a  society. The gestures, and the expressions of salutations are, therefore, the indicators  of the ideals for which a particular society stands. The common practice with the  pre-Islamic Arabs and thi modern West is to greet one another with Good Morning and Good  Evening accompanied by a gesture of the hand or the nodding of head. These words have no  spiritual and moral significance, but just a wish that one should find one&#8217;s mornings and  evenings happy. The words of greeting which Islam has exhorted its followers to use at the  time of meeting are as-Salam-u-&#8216;Alaikum which have a deep spiritual and moral significance  behind them Since the predominant feature of Islamic faith and practice is peace within  and peace without, it has, therefore, been made a watchword which should be repeated on  every occasion when two Muslims meet so that the utmost importance of peace should be  constantly inculcated in the mind of every Muslim, and he should have full consciousness  of the great reality that he lives in this world as a messenger of peace for mankind.  peace amongst individuals and nations. -The second important feature of words of greeting  in Islam is that they convey the message of peace not only to the person who is greeted  but to the whole of the Muslim society as it is the plural pronoun that is used for the  blessing of peace. (The pronoun&#8217;Alaikum has a evry wide range and all the Muslims come  within its orbit.) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The two words as-Salam-u-&#8216;Alaikum may be called the  irreducible minimum which are essential for greeting one another. The Muslims have been  commanded to add to this expression some other words with a view to excelling one another  in showering blessing upon the Muslims. The words as-Salam-u-&#8216;Alaikum are generally  suffixed with these words Rahmat Allah wa Barakaatuh (mercy of Allah and His bleasings).  These three words:&#8221; peace&#8230;, mercy&#8221; and&#8221; blessings of Allah&#8221; in fact  form the sum and substance of Islam and the Muslims are asked to shower upon one another  these benedictions. so that they may be able to live in this world and the Hereafter in  perfect peace and tranquillity and blessings and mercy of Allah around him. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>According to Imam Nawawl, greeting with the words of  as-Salam-u-&#8216;Alaikum is a Sunnah, and responding to it is Wajib (obligatory), but this  essentiality is of the nature of Kifaya, meaning thereby that if a few persons out of the  whole assembly or group respond to the greeting it will absolve all of the responsibility  of response but if no response comes forth from any quarter all are held responsible for  it. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Talha reported: While We were sitting in front of the    houses and talking amongst ourselves, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) happened    to come there. He stood by us and said: What about you apd your meetings on the paths?    Avoid these meetings on the paths. We said: We were sitting here without (any intention of    doing harm to the passers-by) ; we are sitting to discuss matters and to hold conversation    amongst ourselves. Thereupon he said: If there is no help (for you but to sit on these    paths), then give the paths their rights and these are lowering of the gaze, exchanging of    greetings and good conversation.</font></p>

They    said: Our opinion is that you better go back along with the people and do not make them go    to this scourge, So &#8216;Umar made announcement to the people: In the morning I would be on    the back of my side. So they (set forth in the morning), whereupon Abu &#8216;Ubaida b. Jarrah    said: Are you going to run away from the Divine Decree? Thereupon &#8216;Umar said: Had it been    someone else to say this besides you! &#8216;Umar (in fact) did not approve of his opposing    (this decision) and he said: Yes, we are running from the Divine Decree (to the) Divine    Decree. You should think if there had been camels for you and you happened to get down in    a valley having two sides, one of them covered with verdure and the other being barren,    would you not (be doing) according to the Divine Decree if you graze them in verdure? And    in case you graze them in the barren land (even then you would be grazing them) according    to the Divine Decree.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>There happened to come &#8216;Abd al-Rahman b. &#8216;Auf and he had    been absent in connection with some of his needs. He said: I have with me a knowledge of    it, that I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: If you hear of its    presence (the presence of plague) in a land, don&#8217;t enter it, but if it spreads in the land    where you are, don&#8217;t fly from it. Thereupon &#8216;Umar b. Khattab praised Allah and then went    back?</font></p>

Abu    Salama said that Abu Huraira used to narrate these two (different ahadith) from Allah&#8217;s    Messenger (may peace be upon him), but afterwards Abu Huraira became silent on these    words:&#8221; There is no transitive disease,&#8221; but he stuck to this that the sick    person should not be taken to one who is healthy. Harith b. Abu Dhubab (and he was the    first cousin of Abu Huraira) said: Abu Huraira, I used to hear from you that you narrated    to us along with this hadith and the other one also (there is no transitive disease), but    now you observe silence about it. You used to say that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be    upon him) said: There is no transitive disease. Abu Huraira denied having any knowledge of    that, but he said that the sick camel should not be taken to the healthy one. Harith,    however, did not agree with him, which irritated Abu Huraira and he said to him some words    in the Abyssinian language. He said to Harith: Do you know what I said to you? He said:    No. Abu Huraira said: I simply denied having said it. Abu Salama sad: By my life, Abu    Huraira in fact used to report Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) having said:    There is no transitive disease. I do not know whether Abu Huraira has forgotten it or he    deemed it an abrogated statement in the light of the other one.</font></p>

Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: What did you    say in the pre-Islamic days when there was such a shot (of meteor)? They said: Allah and    His Messenger know best (the actual position), but we, however, used to say that that very    night a great man had been born and a great man had died, whereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may    peace be upon him) said: (These meteors) are shot neither at the death of anyone nor on    the birth of anyone. Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, issues Command when He decides to do    a thing. Then (the Angels) supporting the Throne sing His glory, then sing the dwellers of    heaven who are near to them until this glory of God reaches them who are in the heaven of    this world. Then those who are near the supporters of the Throne ask these supporters of    the Throne: What your Lord has said? And they accordingly inform them what He says. Then    the dwellers of heaven seek information from them until this information reaches the    heaven of the world. In this process of transmission (the jinn snatches) what he manages    to overhear and he carries it to his friends. And when the Angels see the jinn they attack    them with meteors. If they narrate only which they manage to snatch that is correct but    they alloy it with lies and make additions to it.</font></p>

I looked towards it and found a snake. I    jumped up in order to kill it, but he (Abu Sa&#8217;id Khudri) made a gesture that I should sit    down. So I sat down and as he finished (the prayer) he pointed to a room in the house and    said: Do you see this room? I said: Yes. He said: There was a young man amongst us who had    been newly wedded. We went with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) (to participate    in the Battle) of Trench when a young man in the midday used to seek permission from    Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) to return to his family.

The man carried the weapons and then came back and found his wife standing    between the two doors. He bent towards her smitten by jealousy and made a dash towards her    with a spear in order to stab her. She said: Keep your spear away and enter the house    until you see that which has made me come out. He entered and found a big snake coiled on    the bedding. He darted with the spear and pierced it and then went out having fixed it in    the house, but the snake quivered and attacked him and no one knew which of them died    first, the snake or the young man. We came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and    made a mention to him and said: Supplicate to Allah that that (man) may be brought back to    life. Thereupon he said: Ask forgiveness for your companion and then said: There are in    Medina jinns who have accepted Islam, so when you see any one of them, pronounce a warning    to it for three days, and if they appear before you after that, then kill it for that is a    devil.</font></p>

He climbed down into it and drank (water) and then came out and saw a dog lolling    its tongue on account of thirst and eating the moistened earth. The person said: This dog    has suffered from thirst as I had suffered from it. He climbed down into the well, filled    his shoe with water, then caught it in his mouth until he climbed up and made the dog    drink it. So Allah appreciated this act of his and pardoned him. Then (the Companions    around him) said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, is there for us a reward even for (serving) such    animals? He said: Yes, there is a reward for service to every living animal.</font></p>
