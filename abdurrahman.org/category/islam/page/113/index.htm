<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Salama reported: I used to see dreams (and was so much perturbed) that I began to quiver and have temperature, but did not cover myself with a mantle. I met Abu Qatada and made a mention of that to him. He said: I heard Allali&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: A good vision comes from Allah and a (bad) dream (hulm) from devil. So when one of. you sees a bad dream (hulm) which he does not like, he should spit on his left side thrice and seek refuge with Allah from its evil; then it will not harm him.</p>

And the truest vision will be of one who is himself the most truthful in speech, for the vision of a Muslim is the forty-fifth part of Prophecy, and dreams are of three types: one good dream which is a sort of good tidings from Allah; the evil dream which causes pain is from the satan; and the third one is a suggestion of one&#8217;s own mind; so if any one of you sees a dream which he does not like he should stand tip and offer prayer and he should not relate it to people, and he said: I would love to see fetters (in the dream), but I dislike wearing of necklace, for the fetters is (an indication of) one&#8217;s steadfastness in religion. The narrator said: I do not know whether this is a part of the hadith or the words of Ibn Sirin.</p>

She came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and (informed him about it). Thereupon, he (the Holy Prophet) said: Did you squeeze it? She said: Yes.

He offered the noon and afternoon prayers together and the sunset and night prayers together and on the other day he deferred the prayers; he then came out and offered the noon and afternoon prayers together. He then went in and (later on) came out and then after that offered the sunset and night prayers together and then said: God willing, you would reach by tomorrow the fountain of Tabuk and you should not come to that until it is dawn, and he who amongst you happens to go there should not touch its water until I come. We came to that and two persons (amongst) us reached that fountain ahead of us. It was a thin flow of water like the shoelace. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) asked them whether they had touched the water. They said: Yes. Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) scolded them, and he said to them what he had to say by the will of God. The people then took water of the fountain in their palms until it became somewhat significant and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) washed his hands and his face too in it, and then, took it again in that (fountain) and there gushed forth abundant water from that fountain, until all the people drank to their fill. He then said: Mu&#8217;adh, it is hoped that if you live long you would see its water irrigating well the gardens.</p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said. Make an assessment (of the price of its fruit). And Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) also made an assessment and it was ten wasqs. He asked that lady (to calculate the amount) until they would, God willing, come back to her. So we proceeded on until we came to Tabuk and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: The violent storm will overtake you during the night, so none amongst you should stand up and he who has a camel with him should hobble it firmly. A violent storm blew and a person who had stood up was carried away by the storm and thrown between the mountains of Tayy. Then the messenger of the son of al &#8216;Alma&#8217;, the ruler of Aila, came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) with a letter and a gift of a white mule. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) wrote him (the reply) and presented him a cloak. We came back until we halted in the Wadi al-Qura. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) asked that lady about her garden and the price of the fruits in that. She said: Ten wasqs. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: I am going to depart, and he who amongst you wishes may depart with me but he who wants to stay may stay. We resumed the journey until we came to the outskirts of Medina. (It was at this time) that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: This is Taba, this is Uhud, that is a mountain which loves us and we love it, and then said: The best amongst the houses of the Ansar is the house of Bani Najjar. Then the house of Bani Abd al-Ashhal, then the house of Bani Abd al-Harith b. Khazraj, then the house of Bani Sa&#8217;ida, and there is goodness in all the houses of the Ansar. Said b. Ubada came to us and Abu Usaid said to him: Did you not see that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has declared the houses of the Ansar good and he has kept us at the end. Said met Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, you have declared the house of the Ansar as good and have kept us at the end, whereupon he said: Is it not enough for you that you have been counted amongst the good.</p>

He then came back and sat on pulpit and said: I shall be present there (at the Cistern) before you. I shall be your witness and, by Allah, I perceive as if I am seeing with my own eyes my Cistern at this very state and I have been given the keys of the treasures of the earth or the keys of the earth and, by Allah, I am not afraid concerning you that you would associate anything (with Allah after me), but I am afraid that you would be vying with one another (for the possession of) the treasures of the earth.</p>

He had come in a land inhabited by haughty and cruel men along with Sara. She was very good-looking amongst the people, so he said to her: If these were to know that you are my wife they would snatch you away from me, so if they ask you tell that you are my sister and in fact you are my sister in Islam, and I do not know of any other Muslim in this land besides I and you. And when they entered that land the tyrants came to see her and said to him (the king): &#8216;there comes to your land a woman, whom you alone deserve to possess, so he (the kings sent someone (towards her) and she was brought and Ibrahim (peace be upon him) stood in preyer, and when she visited him (the tyrant king came) he could help but stretch his hand towards her and his hand was tied up. He said: Supplicate Allah so that He may release my hand and I will do no harm to you. She did that and the man repeated (the same highhandedness) and his hand was again tied up more tightly than on the first occasion and he said to her like that and she again did that (supplicated), but he repeated (the same highhandedness and his hands were tied up more tightly than on the previous occasion). He then again said: Supplicate your Lord so that He may set my hand free; by. @ llah I shall do no harm to you. She did and his hand was freed. Then he called the person who had brought her and said to him: You have brought to me the satan and you have not brought to me a human being, so turn them out from my land, and he gave Hajira as a gift to her. She returned (along with Hajira) and when Ibrahim (peace be upon him) saw her, he said: How have you returned? She said: With full safety (have I returned). Allah held the hand of that debauch and he gave me a maid-servant. Abu Hiaraira said: O sons of the rain of the sky, she is your mother.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa&#8217;id b. jubair reported: I said to Ibn Abbas that Nauf al-Bikali was of the opinion that Moses (peace be upon him), the Apostle of Bani Isra&#8217;il, was not the same who accompanied Khadir, whereupon he said: The enemy of Allah tells a lie. I heard Ubayy b. Ka&#8217;b say: Moses (peace be upon him) stood up to give sermon to the people of Isra&#8217;il. He was asked as to who amongst the people has the best knowledge, whereupon he said: I have the best knowledge. Thereupon Allah was annoyed with him that he did not attribute (the best knowledge) to Him. He revealed to him: A servant amongst My servants is at the junction of two rivers who has more knowledge than yours. Moses said: How can I meet him? It was said to him: Carry a fish in the large basket and the place where you find it missing there you will find him. Thereupon Moses proceeded forth along with a young man (Yusha&#8217;). Joshua b. Nan and Moses (peace be upon him) put the fish in the basket and there went along with him the young man (Yusha&#8217;) until they came to a certain rock and Moses and his companion went to sleep and the fish stirred in that basket and fell into the ocean and Allah stopped the current of water like a vault until the way was made for the fish. Moses and his youn. companion were astonished and they walked for the rest of the day and the night and the friend of Moses forgot to inform him of this incident. When it was morning, Moses (peace be upon him) said to the young man: Bring for us the breakfast for we are dead tired because of this journey, and they did not feel exhausted until they had passed that place where they had been commanded (to stay). He said: Don&#8217;t you know that when we reached the Sakhra (rock) I forgot the fisii and noth ng made me forget it but the satan that I. could nit remember it? How strange is it that the fish found a way in the river? Moses said: That was what we had been aiming at. Then both of them retraced their steps until they reached Sakhra; there they saw a man covered with a cloth. Moses greeted him. Khadir said to him: Where is as-Salam in our country.? He said: I am Moses, whereupon he (Khadir) said: You mean the Moses of Bani Isra&#8217;il? He said: Yes. He (Khadir) said: You have a knowledge out of the knowledge of Allah which in fact Allah imparted to you and about that I know nothing and I have knowledge out of Allah&#8217;s knowledge which He imparted to me and about that you do not know. Moses (peace be upon him) said to him: May I follow you so that you may teach me that with which you have been taught righteousness. He said: You will not be able to bear with me; how you will be able to bear that about which you do not know? Moses said: Thou wilt find me patient, nor shalt I disobey you in aught. Khadir said to him: If you were to follow me, then do not ask me about anything until I myself speak to you about it. He said: Yes. So Khadir and Moses set forth on the bank of the river that there came before them a boat. Both of theni talked to them (the owners of the boat) so that they might carry both of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They had recognised Khadir and they carried them free. Khadir thereupon took hold of a plank in the boat and broke it away. Moses said: These people have carried us without any charge and you attempt to break their boat so that the people sailing in the boat may drown. This is (something) grievous that you have done. He said: Did I not say that you would not bear with me? He said: Blame me not for what I forgot and be not hard upon what I did. Then both of them got down from the boat and began to walk along the coastline that they saw a boy who had been playing with other boys. Khadir pulled up his head and killed him. Moses said: Have you killed an innocent person who is in no way guilty of slaying another? You have done something horrible. Thereupon he said: Did I not say to you that you will not be able to bear with me? He (Moses) said: This (act) is more grievous than the first one. He (Moses) further said. If I ask you about anything after this, keep not company with me, then you would no doubt find (a plausible) excuse for this. Then they both walked on until they reached the inhabitants of a village. They asked its inhabitants for food but they refused to entertain them as their guests. They found in it a wall which had been bent on one side and was about to fall. Khadir set it right with his own hand. Moses, said to him: It is the people to whom we came but they showed us no hospitality and they did not serve us food. If you wish you can get wages for it. He (Khadir) said: This is the parting of ways between mt and you. Now I wish to reveal to you the significance of that for which you could not bear with me. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said. May Allah have mercy upon Moses! I wish if Moses could show patience and a (fuller) story of both of them could have been told. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said that the first thing which Moses said was out of forgetfulness. Then there came a sparrow until it perched on the wall of the boat and took water from the ocean. Thereupon, Khadir said: My knowledge and your knowledge in comparison with the knowledge of Allah is even less than the water taken by the sparrow in its beak in comparison to the water of the ocean, and Sa&#8217;id b. jubair used to recite (verses 79 and 80 of Sura Kahf) in this way: There was before them a king who used to seize every boat by force which was in order, the boy was an unbeliever.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Book 030, Number 5865:</p>
<p><em><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="030.5865"></a></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="030.5865"></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa, id b. jubair reported that it was said to Ibn &#8216;Abbas that Nauf al-Bikali was of the opinion that Moses who went in search of knowledge was not the Moses of Bani Isra&#8217;il. He said: Sa&#8217;id, did you hear it from him? I said: Yes. Thereupon he said that Nauf had not stated the fact. Ubayy b. Ka&#8217;b narrated to us that he had heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Moses had been delivering sermons to his people. And he made this remark: No person upon the earth has better knowledge than I or nothing better than mine. Thereupon Allah revealed to him: I know one who is better than you (in knowledge) or there is a person on the earth having more knowledge than you. Thereupon he said: My Lord, direct me to him. It was said to him: Keep a salted fish as a provision for journey. The place where that fish would be lost (there you will find that man). So he set forth and a young slave along with him until they came to a place Sakhra. but he did not find any clue. So he proceeded on and left that young man there. The fish began to stir in water and the water assumed the form of an ark over the fish. The young man said: I should meet Allah&#8217;s Apostle (peace be upon him) and inform him, but he was made to forget and when they had gone beyond that place, he (Moses) said to the young man: Bring breakfast. We have been exhausted because of the journey, and he (Moses) was not exhausted until he had crossed that (particular) place (where he had) to meet Khadir, and the youth was reminded and said: Did you not see that as we reached Sakhra I forgot the fish and it is satan alone who has made me forgetful of it&#8217;? It is strange that he has been able to find way in the ocean too. He said: This is what we sought for us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They returned retracing their steps, and he (his companion) pointed to him the location (where) the fish (had been lost). Moses began to search him there. He suddenly saw Khadir wrapped in a cloth and lying on his back. He said to him: As-Salamu-&#8216;Alaikum. He removed the cloth from his face and said: Wa &#8216;Alaikum-us-Salam! Who are you? He said: I am Moses. He said: Who Moses? He said: Moses Of Bani Isra&#8217;il. He said: What brought you here? He said: I have come so that you may teach me what you have been taught of righteousness. He said: You shall have to bear with me, and how can you have patience about a thing of which you have no comprehensive knowledge? You will not have patience when you see me doing a thing I have been ordered to do. He said: If Allah pleases, you will find me patient, nor shall I disobey you in aught. Khadir said: If you follow me, don&#8217;t ask me about anything until I explain it to you. So they went on until they embarked upon a boat. He (Khadir) made a hole in that. Thereupon he (Moses) said: You have done this so that you may drown the persons sitting in the boat. You have done something grievous. Thereupon he said: Did I not tell you that you will not be able to bear with me? Thereupon he (Moses) said: Blame me not for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for what I did. (Khadir gave him another chance.) So they went on until they reached a place where boys were playing. He went to one of them and caught hold&#8217;of one (apparently) at random and killed him. Moses (peace be upon him) felt agitated and said: You have killed an innocent person not guilty of slaying another. You have done something aboininable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: May Allah have mercy upon us and Moses. Had he shown patience he would have seen wonderful things, but fear of blame, with respect to his companion, seized him and he said: If I ask anything after this, keep not company with me. You will then have a valid excuse in my case, and had he (Moses) shown patience he would have seen many wonderful things. He (the narrator) said: Whenever he (the Holy Prophet) made mention of any Prophet, he always said: May there be mercy of Allah upon us and upon my brother so and so. They, however, proceeded on until they came to the inhabitants of a village who were very miserly. They went to the meeting places and asked for hospitality but they refused to show any hospitality to them. They both found in that village a wall which was about to fall. He (Khadir) set it right. Thereupon he (Moses) said: If you so liked. you could get wages for it. Thereupon he said: This is the partince, of ways between me and you, and, taking hold of his cloth, he said: Now I will explain to you the real significance (of all these acts) for which you could not show patience. As for the boat, it belonged to the poor people working on the river and I intended to damage it for there was ahead of them (a king) who seized boats by force. (When he came) to catch hold of it he found it a damaged boat, so he spared it (and later on) it was set right with wood. So far as the boy is concerned, he has been, by very nature, an unbeliever, whereas his parents loved him very much. Had he grown up he would have involved them in wrongdoing and unbelief, so we wished that their Lord should give them in its place one better in purity and close to mercy. And as for the wall it belonged to two orphan boys in the city and there was beneath it a (treasure) belongin to them,&#8230; up to the last verse. This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Abu Ishaq.</p>

Ibn &#8216;Abbas said that he was Khadir. There happened to pass Ubayy b. Ka&#8217;b Ansari. Ibn Abbas called him and said: Abu Tufail, come to us. There has been a difference of opinion between me and my friend about the companion of Moses whom he wanted to meet on the way. Did hear anything from Allah&#8217;s meesenger (may peace be upon him) making a mention of anything? Ubayy said: I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may Peace be upon him) as saying: As Moses was amongst the group of Bani Isra&#8217;il, there came to him a person and he said to him: Do you know anyone having better knowledge than you? Moses said: No. Thereupon Allah revealed to Moses: Of course, there is amongst Our servants Khadir (who has better knowledge) than you. Moses asked the way of meeting him. Allah made the fish a sign and it was said to him: Where you miss the fish return to that (place) and you will soon find him. So Moses moved on as Allah wished him to move on. He then said to his young companion: Bring for us the breakfast. Thereupop that young man said to Moses. when he asked him for the breakfast: Don&#8217;t you see that as we had reached the Sakhra I forgot the fish and nobody made it forget (in our mind) but the satan that I should remind you of it? Mosed said to that young man: This was what we wanted. So they retraced their steps and met Khadir and the events which followed have been described in His Book except that Yunus (the narrator) said that he followed the traces of fish in the ocean.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 35: </font></p>
<p>    </p>
<h3 align="center"><font><em>The Book Pertaining to the Remembrance  of Allah, Supplication, Repentance and Seeking Forgiveness (Kitab Al-Dhikr) </em></font>    </h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><br></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Supplication is in fact not only the spontaneous  outpourings of man&#8217;s heart before his Lord, but it is an expression of his sense of  nearness to Him, of His Might and Power, of his confidence in His mercy, grace and  blessings. If one were to know how much a man supplicates, and what he supplicates about,  and how he supplicates, one would be able to see how much spirituality is there in his  soul. When a man without any witness speaks with Allah, the soul stands unveiled before  its Creator. The higher the note he strikes in his outpouring, the higher is the quality  of the faith that is imprinted upon his soul, and serves as a background to all his  thought and activity. Thus to understand the spirit of any religion and appraise its value  to life and society, supplications serve as the key. The Prophet (may peace be upon him)  was a great believer in supplication and prayer. He made supplications to his Lord with  zeal and fervour, rarely to be found in the religious literature of the world. One who  cares to read them cannot but be overwhelmed with the depth of feelings with which the  Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) approaches his Lord, his intense love for the Great  Master, his deep faith in His unbounded Favours, his unshakeable confidence in His Divine  Mercy and unflinching faith in His Might and Power, and his sense of deep humility before  Him. These are in fact the multi-coloured threads with which is woven the delicate pattern  of the Prophet&#8217;s (may peace be upon him) supplications. In Islam the supplication which a  Muslim has been instructed to make whether singly or in congregation, whether at the  appointed hour of ritual prayer or at any sudden call or urge to His Lord, reflects the  one single attitude of submission, humility and closeness to God. Whatever is the state of  spiritual elevation of the supplication he is made to keep this fact constantly in his  mind that he is a humble servant of the Lord. That is the reason why most of the  supplications in Islam open with an invocation of the Divine Being; either the personal  name of God, i. e. Allah, is used or the descriptive title of His Attributes are called  out in order to make the worshipper conscious of his own weak and dependent self before  his Master. In Islam man seeks to move God to help and grant him what he desires, and at  the same time he seeks unconsciously to work upon himself through the realisation of what  God means to him, to strengthen, to renew and to refresh his own inner life. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While the expression of dependence and trust is in reality  a prerequisite of supplication in Islam, it covers the whole range of human life with all  its needs, longings and problems. Supplication finds expression in a deep and urgent  longing for self preservation and deliverance from the oppressive situation, forgiveness  of sins, elevation of the soul, goodness of the worldly life and that of the Hereafter.  This consciousness of one&#8217;s absolute dependence upon Him, which pervades the entire stock  of the Prophet&#8217;s (may peace be upon him) supplications, shows man&#8217;s attitude of perfect  resignation before the Mighty Will of the Master, but this resignation has nothing of the  spirit of despondence and despair in it; it rather illuminates hope out of conviction that  the Being Who is the Lord of man&#8217;s fate can also help him and save him even in the most  trying circumstances. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The supplications of Muhammad (may peace be upon him)  eminently combine in themselves the mystical and the religious traits. While the Muslim  supplicates, he, like a mystic, beholds undisturbed with concentrated gaze one Supreme  Spiritual Reality Who is the Embodiment and Repository of all values. But, unlike mystics,  he, in the hour of contemplation in supplication, does not lose himself but realises  himself to be a humble servant of God and therein lies his spiritual strength and  unwavering confidence in God. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The one more distinguishing feature of the supplications  taught by Muhammad (may peace be upon him) is that these are all permeated with the spirit  of social fellowship. They do not urge man to stand face to face with God in absolute  loneliness, isolated from all other human beings. Herein the suppliant begs his Lord with  the full consciousness of human brotherhood and with a feeling that the distress which  vexes him is not his only, it is that of his brethren. The graces of God and the salvation  for which he longs are also the longings of all believers, nay, of the entire humanity.  There is no doubt a deep touch of intimate personal and individual contact with God in  these supplications, but this contact is not of the nature of a non-Muslim mystic in which  the soul is supposed to be unified with God losing all its individual identity. Here the  soul has a communion with Allah with full consciousness of man&#8217;s own self, his social  surroundings and responsibilities. That is why most of the supplications have been  expressed in the form&#8221; We&#8221; and Us&#8221;. </font></p>

And if he    remembers Me in his heart, I also remember him in My Heart, and if he remembers Me in    assembly I remember him in assembly, better than his (remembrance), and if he draws near    Me by the span of a palm, I draw near him by the cubit, and if he draws near Me by the    cubit I draw near him by the space (covered by) two hands. And if he walks towards Me, I    rush towards him.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Huraira reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be    upon him) was travelling along the path leading to Mecca that he happened to pass by a    mountain called Jumdan. He said: Proceed on, it is Jumdan, Mufarradun have gone ahead.    They (the Companions of the Holy Prophet) said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, who are Mufarradun? He    said: They are those males and females who remember Allah much.</font></p>

Verily, Allah is Odd (He is one, and it is an odd number) and He loves    odd number. And in the narration of Ibn &#8216;Umar (the words are):&#8221; He who enumerated    them.&#8221;</font></p>

He who enumerates them would get into Paradise. And Hammam has made this addition on    the authority of Abu Huraira who reported it from Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him)    that he said:&#8221; He is Odd (one) and loves odd number.&#8221;</font></p>

I (Shuraih b. Hani, one of the narrators) came to    A&#8217;isha and said to her: Mother of the faithful, I heard Abu Huraira narrate from Allah&#8217;s    Messenger (may peace be upon him) which, if it is actually so, is a destruction to us.    Thereupon she said: Those are in fact ruined who are ruined at the words of Allah&#8217;s    Messenger (may peace be upon him). What are (the words which in your opinion would cause    your destruction)? He said that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had stated: He    who loves to meet Allah, Allah too loves to meet him, and he who dislikes to meet Allah,    Allah too abhors to meet him, and there is none amongst us who dons not hate death.    Thereupon she said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has in fact stated this, but    it does not mean what you construe, but it implies (the time) when one loses the lustre of    the eye, and there is rattling in the throat, shudder in the body and convulsion in    fingers (at the time of death). (It is about this time) that it has been said: He who    loves to meet Allah, Allah would love to meet him, and he who dislikes to meet Allah,    Allah would abhor to meet him</font></p>

They say: We come from Thine servants upon the earth who had been    glorifying Thee (reciting Subhan Allah), uttering Thine Greatness (saying Allah o-Akbar)    and uttering Thine Oneness (La ilaha ill Allah) and praising Thee (uttering al-Hamdu    Lillah) and begging of Thee. Be would say: What do they beg of Me? They would say: They    beg of Thee the Paradise of Thine. He (God) would say: Have they seen My Paradise? They    said: No, our Lord. He would say: (What it would be then) if they were to see Mine    Paradise? They (the angels) said: They seek Thine protection. He (the Lord) would say:    Against what do they seek protection of Mine? They (the angels) would say: Our Lord, from    the Hell-Fire. He (the Lord) would say: Have they seen My Fire?

He would say: I grant pardon to them, and confer upon them what    they ask for and grant them protection against which they seek protection. They (the    angels) would again say: Our Lord, there is one amongst them such and such simple servant    who happened to pass by (that assembly) and sat there along with them (who had been    participating in that assembly).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Huraira reported Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon    him) as saying: He who alleviates the suffering of a brother out of the sufferings of the    world, Allah would alleviate his suffering from the sufferings of the Day of Resurrection,    and he who finds relief for one who is hard pressed, Allah would make things easy for him    in the Hereafter, and he who conceals (the faults) of a Muslim, Allah would conceal his    faults in the world and in the Hereafter. Allah is at the back of a servant so long as the    servant is at the back of his brother, and he who treads the path in search of know-    ledge, Allah would make that path easy, leading to Paradise for him and those persons who    assemble in the house among the houses of Allah (mosques) and recite the Book of Allah and    they learn and teach the Qur&#8217;an (among themselves) there would descend upon them the    tranquillity and mercy would cover them and the angels would surround them and Allah makes    a mention of them in the presence of those near Him, and he who is slow-paced in doing    good deeds, his (high) descent does not make him go ahead.</font></p>

They said: By Allah, we are sitting here for this very purpose.    Thereupon, he said: I have not demanded you to take an oath, because of any allegation    against you and none of my rank in the eye of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) is    the narrator of so few ahadith as I am. The fact is that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be    upon him) went out to the circle of his Companions and said: What makes you sit? They    said: We are sitting here in order to remember Allah and to praise Him for He guided us to    the path of Islam and He conferred favours upgn us. Thereupon he adjured by Allah and    asked if that only was the purpose of their sitting there. They said: By Allah, we are not    sitting here but for this very purpose, whereupon he (the Messenger) said: I am not asking    you to take an oath because of any allegation against you but for the fact that Gabriel    came to me and he informed me that Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, was talking to the    angels about your magnificence.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>It is reported on the authority of Ali that Fatima had    corns in her hand because of working at the hand-mill. There had fallen to the lot of    Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) some prisoners of war. She (Fatima) came to the    Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) but she did not find him (in the house). She met    A&#8217;isha and informed her (about her hardship). When Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him)    came, she ( A&#8217;isha) informed him about the visit of Fatima. ABah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be    upon him) came to them (Fitima and her family). They had gone to their beds. &#8216;Ali further    (reported): We tried to stand up (as a mark of respect) but Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace    be upon him) said: Keep to your beds, and he sat amongst us and I felt coldness of his    feet upon my chest. He then said: May I not direct you to something better than what you    have asked for? When you go to your bed, you should recite Takbir (Allah-o-Akbar)    thirty-four times and Tasbih (Subhdn Allah) thirty-three times and Tahmid (al-Hamdu    li-Allah) thirty-three times, and that is better than the servant for you.</font></p>

He    (&#8216;Urwa), said: So I met him, and asked about it and he narrated to me exactly like one    that he had narrated (to me) for the first time.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Jarir b. Abdullah reported that some desert Arabs clad in    woollen clothes came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). He saw them in sad    plight as they had been hard pressed by need. He (the Holy Prophet) exhorted people to    give charity, but they showed some reluctance until (signs) of anger could be seen on his    face. Then a person from the Ansar came with a purse containing silver. Then came another    person and then other persons followed them in succession until signs of happiness could    be seen on his (sacred) face. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He    who introduced some good practice in Islam which was followed after him (by people) he    would be assured of reward like one who followed it, without their rewards being    diminished in any respect. And he who introduced some evil practice in Islam which had    been followed subsequently (by others), he would be required to bear the burden like that    of one who followed this (evil practice) without their&#8217;s being diminished in any respect.</font></p>

Thereupon Abu Bakr wept and he wept bitterly and said: Let our fathers and our mothers be taken as ransom for you. It was Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) who had been given the choice and Abu Bakr knew it better than us, and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) is reported to have said: Behold, of all people the most generous toward me in regard to his companionship and his property was Abu Bakr and were I to choose anyone as my bosom friend, I would have chosen Abu Bakr as my dear friend, but (for him) I cherish Islamic brotherliness and love. There shall be left open no window in the mosque except Abu Bakr&#8217;s window.</p>

Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) stood up to say prayer over him Thereupon I Umar caught hold of the clothe of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, are you going to offer prayer, whereas Allah has forbidden to offer prayer for him, whereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Allah has given me a choice saying: Ask forgiveness for them or you may not ask for them; even if you ask for them seventy times, I will make an addition to the seventy. He was a hypocrite and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said prayer over him that Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed the verse:&#8221; And never pray over any one of them that has died and never should you stand by his grave&#8221; (ix. 84).</p>

It was given to him and he conversed in the same very state (the Prophet&#8217;s thigh or shank uncovered). Then &#8216;Umar sought permission for getting in and it was given to him and he conversed in that very state. Then &#8216;Uthman sought permission for getting in; Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) sat down and he set right his clothes.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Musa Ash&#8217;ari reported that he performed ablution in his house and then came out saying: I would remain with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) the whole day long. He came to the mosque, and asked about Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him). They (his Companions) said: He has gone in this direction. He (Abu Musa Ash&#8217;ari) said: I followed his steps asking about him until I came to Bi&#8217;r Aris (it is a well in the suburb of Medina). I sat by its wooden door until Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had relieved himself and then performed ablution. I went to him and he was sitting with his shanks uncovered hp to the knees and his legs dangl- ing in that well. I offered him salutations. I then came back and sat at the door as if I had been a chamberlain at the door of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) that day. There came Abu Bakr and knocked the door and I said: Who is it? He said: This is Abu Bakr. I said: Wait, please. I went and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, here is Abu Bakr seeking permission. Thereupon he said: Admit him and give him glad tidings of Paradise. I came and I said to Abu Bakr to get in (and also told him) that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was giving him the glad tidings of Paradise. Abu Bakr got in and sat on the right side of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and dangled his feet in the well as Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had done, and he uncovered his shanks. I then returned and sat there and I had left my brother as he had been performing ablution and he was to meet me and I said: If Allah would intend goodness for such and such he would intend goodness for his brother and He would bring him. I was thinking this that a person stirred the door. I said: Who is it. He said: This is Umar b., Khattab. I said: Wait. Then I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), greeted him and said: Here is &#8216;Umar seeking your. permission to get in. Thereupon he said: Let him come in and give him glad tid- ings of Paradise. I came to Umar and said: There is permission for you and glad tidings for you from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) for Paradise. He got in and sat on the left side of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) with his feet dangling in the well. I then returned and sat and said: If Allah would intend goodness for such and such (that is for his brother), He would bring him. And I was contemplat- ing over it that a man stirred the door and I said: Who is it? He said: This is Uthman b. Affan. I said: Wait, please. I then came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and informed him. and he said: Admit him and give him glad tidings (and inform) him of the turmoil which he shall have to face. I came and said: Get in, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) gives you the glad tidings of Paradise along with the trial which you shall have to face. He got in and saw the elevated plan round the well fully occupied. He sat on the other side. Sharik said that Sa&#8217;id b. al-Musayyib reported: I drew a conclusion from it that their groves would be (in this very state, the graves of Hadrat Abu Bakr, &#8216;Umar Faruq by the tide of the Holy Prophet [may peace be upon him] and the grave of Hadrat &#8216;Uthman away from their graves).</p>

He (the narrator) said: We have been anxiously waiting for it, when he (the Holy Prophet) said: Call &#8216;Ali. He was called and his eyes were inflamed. He applied saliva to his eyes and handed over the standard to him, and Allah gave him victory.

You have found goodness (for you had the honour) to live in the company of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and offered prayer behind him, and the rest of the hadith is the same but with this variation of wording that lie said: Behold, for I am leaving amongst you two weighty things, one of which is the Book of Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, and that is the rope of Allah. He who holds it fast would be on right guidance and he who abandons it would be in error, and in this (hadith) these words are also found: We said: Who are amongst the members of the household? Aren&#8217;t the wives (of the Holy Prophet) included amongst the members of his house hold? Thereupon he said: No, by Allah, a woman lives with a man (as his wife) for a certain period; he then divorces her and she goes back to her parents and to her people; the members of his household include his ownself and his kith and kin (who are related to him by blood) and for him the acceptance of Zakat is prohibited.</p>

She passed three days in this state until she fainted because of extreme hunger and at that time her son whose name was Umara stood up and served her drink and she began to curse Sa&#8217;d that Allah, the Exalted and Glorions, revealed these verses of the Holy Qur&#8217;an:&#8221; And We have enjoined upon a person goodness to his parents but if they contend with thee to associate (others) with Me of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not&#8221; (xxix. 8) ; Treat thein with customary good in this world&#8221; (xxxi. 15).

Thereupon he said: Return it to the place from where you picked it up. I went back until I decided to throw it in a store but my soul repulsed me so I came back and asked him to give that sword to me. He said in a loud voice to return it to the place from where I had picked it up. It was on this occasion that this verse was revealed:&#8221; They asked about the spoils of war&#8221; (viii. 1). He further said: I once fell ill and sent a message to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him). He visited me and I said to him: Permit me to distribute (in charity) my property as much as I like. He did not agree. I said: (Permit me to distribute) half of it. He did not agree. I said: (Permit me to distribute) the third part, whereupon he kept quiet and it was after this (that the distribution of one&#8217;s property in charity) to the extent of one-third was held valid. He further said: I came to a group of persons of the Ansir and Muhajirin and they said: Come, so that we may serve you wine, and it was before the use of wine had been prohibited. I went to them in a garden and there had been with them the roasted head of a camel and a small water-skin containing wine. I ate and drank along with them and there came under discussion the Ansr (Helpers) and Muhajirin (immigrants). I said: The immigrants are better than the Ansar, that a person picked up a portion of the head (of the camel and struck me with it that my nose was injured. I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and informed him of the situation that Aliah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed verses pertaining to wine:&#8221; Intoxicants and the games of chance and (sacrificing to) stones set up and (divining by) arrows are only an uncleanliness, the devil&#8217;s work&#8221; (v. 90).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;A&#8217;isha, the wife of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him), said: The wives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) sent Fatima, the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him). She ouaht permission to get in as he had been lying with me in my mantle. He gave her permission and she said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, verily, your wives have sent me to you in order to ask you to observe equity in case of the daughter of Abu Quhafa. She (&#8216;A&#8217;isha) said: I kept quiet. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to her (Fatima): 0 daughter, don&#8217;t you love whom I love? She said: Yes, (I do). Thereupon he said: I love this one. Fatima then stood up as she heard this from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and went to the wives of Allatt&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and informed them of what she had said to him and what Allah&#8217;s messenger (may peace be upon him) had said to her. Thereupon they said to her: We think that you have been of no avail to us. You may again go to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and tell him that his wives seek equity in case of the daughter of Abu Quhafa. Fitima said: By Allah, I will never talk to him about this matter. &#8216;A&#8217;isha (further) reported: The wives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) then sent Zainab b. jahsh, the wife of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him), and she was one who was somewhat equal in rank with me in the eyes of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and I have never seen a woman more advanced in religious piety than Zainab, more God-conscious, more truthful, more alive to the ties of blood, more generous and having more. sense of self-sacrifice in practical life and having more charitable disposition and thus more close to God, the Exalted, than her. She, however, lost temper very soon but was soon calm. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) permitted her to enter as she (&#8216;A&#8217;isha) was along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) in her mantle, in the same very state when Fatima had entered. She said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, your wives have sent me to you seeking equity in case of the daughter of Abu Quhafa. She then came to me and showed harshness to me and I was seeing the eyes of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) whether he would permit me. Zainab went on until I came to know that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) would not disapprove if I retorted. Then I exchanged hot words until I made her quiet. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) smiled and said: She is the daughter of Abu Bakr.

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;A&#8217;isha reported that (one day) there sat together eleven women making an explicit promise amongst themselves that they would conceal nothing about their spouses. The first one said: My husband is a sort of the meat of a lean camel placed at the top of a hill, which it is difficult to climb up, nor (the meat) is good enough that one finds in oneself the urge to take it away (from the top of that mountain).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second one said: My husband (is so bad) that I am afraid I would not be able to describe his faults-both visible and invisible completely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third one said: My husband is a long-statured fellow (i. e. he lacks intelligence). If I give vent to my feelings about him, he would divorce me, and if I keep quiet I would be made to live in a state of suspense (neither completely abandoned by him nor entertained as wife).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth one said: My husband is like the night of Tihama (the night of Hijaz and Mecca), neither too cold nor hot, neither there is any fear of him nor grief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fifth one said: My husband is (like) a leopard as he enters the house, and behaves like a lion when he gets out, and he does not ask about that which he leaves in the house.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sixth one said: So far as my husband is concerned, he eats so much that nothing is left back and when he drinks he drinks that no drop is left behind. And when he lies down he wraps his body and does not touch me so that he may know my grief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The seventh one said: My husband is heavy in spirit, having no brightness in him, impotent, suffering from all kinds of conceivable diseases, heaving such rough manners that he may break my head or wound my body, or may do both.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eighth one said: My husband is as sweet as the sweet-smelling plant, and as soft as the softness of the hare.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ninth one said: My husband is the master of a lofty building, long-statured, having heaps of ashes (at his door) and his house is near the meeting place and the inn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tenth one said: My husband is Malik, and how fine Malik is, much above appreciation and praise (of mine). He has many folds of his camel, more in number than the pastures for them. When they (the camels) hear the sound of music they become sure that they are going to be slaughtered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eleventh one said: My husband is Abu Zara&#8217;. How fine Abu Zara&#8217; is! He has suspended in my ears heavy ornaments and (fed me liberally) that my sinews and bones are covered with fat. So he made me happy. He found me among the shepherds living in the side of the mountain, and he made me the owner of the horses, camels and lands and heaps of grain and he finds no fault with me. I sleep and get up in the morning (at my own sweet will) and drink to my heart&#8217;s content. The mother of Abu Zara&#8217;, how fine is the mother of Abu Zara&#8217;! Her bundles are heavily packed (or receptacles in her house are filled to the brim) and the house quite spacious. So far as the son of Abu Zara&#8217; is concerned, his bed is as soft as a green palm-stick drawn forth from its bark, or like a sword drawn forth from its scabbard, and whom just an arm of a lamb is enough to satiate. So far as the daughter of Abu Zara&#8217; is concerned, how fine is the daughter of Abu Zara&#8217;, obedient to her father, obedient to her mother, wearing sufficient flesh and a source of jealousy for her co-wife. As for the slave-girl of Abu Zara&#8217;, how fine is she; she does not disclose our affairs to others (outside the four walls of the house). She does not remove our wheat, or provision, or take it forth, or squander it, but she preserves it faithfully (as a sacred trust). And she does not let the house fill with rubbish. One day Abu Zara&#8217; went out (of his house) when the milk was churned in the vessels, that he met a woman, having two children like leopards playing with her pomegranates (chest) under her vest. He divorced me (Umm Zara&#8217;) and married that woman (whom Abu Zara&#8217;) met on the way. I (Umm Zara&#8217;) later on married another person, a chief, who was an expert rider, and a fine archer: he bestowed upon me many gifts and gave me one pair of every kind of animal and said: Umm Zara&#8217;, make use of everything (you need) and send forth to your parents (but the fact) is that even if I combine all the gifts that he bestowed upon me, they stand no comparison to the least gift of Abu Zara&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;A&#8217;isha reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to me: I am for you as Abu Zara&#8217; was for Umm Zara&#8217;.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(Imam Zain-ul-&#8216;Abidin) &#8216;Ali b. Husain reported that when they came to Medina from Yazid b. Mu&#8217;awiya after the martyrdom of Husain b. &#8216;Ali (Allah be pleased with him) Miswar b. Makhramah met him and said to him: Is there any work for me which you ask me to do? I said to him: No. He again said to me: Would you not give me the sword of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) for I fear that the people may snatch it from you? By Allah, if you give that to me, no one would be able to take it away, so long as there is life in me. Verily &#8216;Ali b. Abi Talib sent a proposal of marriage to the daughter of Abu Jahl in spite of (the fact that his wife) Fatima (had been living in his house). Thereupon I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) say while addressing the people on the pulpit. I was adolescing in those days. He said: Fatima is a part of me and I fear that she may be put to trial in regard to religion. He then made a mention of his son-in law who had been from the tribe of &#8216;Abd Shams and praised his behaviour as a son-in-law and said: Whatever he said to me he told the truth and whatever he promised he fulfilled it for me. I am not going to declare forbidden what is lawful and make lawful what is forbidden, but, by Allah, the daaghter of Allah&#8217;s Messenger and the daughter of the enemy of Allah can never be combined at one place.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Ali b. Husain reported that Miswar b. Makhramah informed him that &#8216;Ali b. Abi Talib sent the proposal of marriage to the daughter of Abu Jahl as he had Fatima, the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), (as his wife). When Fatima heard about it, she came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and said: The people say that you never feel angry on account of your daughters and now &#8216;Ali is going to marry the daughter of Abu Jahl. Makhramah said: Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) rose up and I heard him reciting Tashahhud and say: Now to the point. I gave a daughter of mine (Zainab) to Abu&#8217;l-&#8216;As b. Rabi, and he spoke to me and spoke the truth. Verily Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad, is a part of me and I do not approve that she may be put to any trial and by Allah, the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Messenger cannot be combined with the daughter of God&#8217;s enemy (as the co-wives) of one person. Thereupon &#8216;Ali gave up (the idea of his intended) marriage. This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Zuhri with the same chain of transmitters.</p>

She said: Yes, now I can do that (so listen to it). When he talked to me secretly for the first time he informed me that Gabirel was in the habit of reciting the Qur&#8217;an along with him once or twice every year, but this year it had been twice and so he perceived his death quite near, so fear Allah and be patient (and he told me) that he would be a befitting forerunner for me and so I wept as you saw me. And when he saw me in grief he talked to me secretly for the second time and said: Fatima, are you not pleased that you should be at the head of the believing women or the head of this Umma? I laughed and it was that laughter which you saw.</p>

He took it and drank water. She then embellished herself which she did not do before. He (Abu Talha) had a sexual intercourse with her and when she saw that he was satisfied after sexual intercourse with her, she said: Abu Talha, if some people borrow something from another family and then (the members of the family) ask for its return, would they resist its return?

When the people came near Medina, she felt the pangs of delivery. He (Abu Talha) remained with her and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) proceeded on. Abu Talha said: O Lord, you know that I love to go along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger when he goes out and enter along with him when he enters and I have been detained as Thou seest. Umm Sulaim said: Abu Talha, I do not feel (so much pain) as I was feeling formerly, so better proceed on. So we proceeded on and she felt the pangs of delivery as they reached (Medina) and a child was born and my mother said to me: Anas, none should suckle him until you go to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) tomorrow morning.

Mas&#8217;ud) reported that he (said to his companions to conceal their copies of the Qur&#8217;an) and further said: He who conceals anything he shall have to bring that which he had concealed on the Day of judgment, and then said: After whose mode of recitation you command me to recite? I in fact recited before AIlah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) more than seventy chapters of the Qur&#8217;an and the Companions of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) know it that I have better understanding of the Book of Allah (than they do), and if I were to know that someone had better understanding than I, I would have gone to him. Shaqiq said: I sat in the company of the Companions of Mubkmmad (may peace be upon him) but I did not hear anyone having rejected that (that is, his recitation) or finding fault with it.</p>

I and my brother Unais and our mother stayed with our maternal uncle who treated us well. The men of his tribe fell jealous and they said: When you are anay from your house, Unais commits adultery with your wife. Our -naternal uncle came and he accused us of the sin which was conveyed to him. I said: You have undone the good you did to us. We cannot stay with you after this. We came to our camels and loaded (our) luggage. Our maternal uncle began to weep covering himself with (a piece of) cloth. We proceeded on until we encamped by the side of Mecca. Unais cast lot on the camels (we had) and an equal number (above that). They both went to a Kahin and he made Unais win and Unais came with our camels and an equal number along with them. He (Abu Dharr) said: My nephew, I used to observe prayer three years before my meeting with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). I said: For whom did you say prayer? He said: For Allah. I said: To which direction did you turn your face (for observing prayer)? He said: I used to turn my face as Allah has directed me to turn my face. I used to observe the night prayer at the time of the end of night and I fell down in prostration like the mantle until the sun rose over me. Unais said: I have a work in Mecca, so you better stay here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unais went until he came to Mecca and he came to me late. I said: What did you do? He said: I met a person in Mecca who is on your religion and he claims that verily it is Allah Who has sent him. I said: What do the people say about him? He said: They say that he is a poet or a Kahin or a magician. Unais who was himself one of the poets said. I have heard the words of a Kahin but his words in no way resemble his (words). And 1 also compared his words to the verses of poets but such words cannot be uttered by any poet. By Allah, he is truthful and they are liars. Then I said: you stay here, until I go, so that I should see him. He said: I came to Mecca and I selected an insignificant person from amongst them and said to him: Where is he whom you call as-Sabi? He pointed out towards me saying: He is Sabi. Thereupon the people of the valley attacked me with sods and bows until I fell down unconscious. I stood up after havin. regained my consciousness and I found as if I was a red idol. I came to Zamzarn and washed blood from me and drank water from it and listen, O son of my brother, I stayed there for thirty nights or days and there was no food for me but the water of Zamzarn. And I became so bulky that there appeared wrinkles upon my stomach, and I did not feel any hunger in my stomach. It was during this time that the people of Mecca slept in the moonlit night and none was there to eircumambulate the House but only two women who had been invoking the name of Isafa, and Na&#8217;ila (the two idols).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They came to me while in their circuit and I said: Marry one with the other, but they did not dissuade from their invoking. They came to me and I said to them: Insert wood (in the idols&#8217; private parts). (I said this to them in such plain words) as I could not express in metaphorical terms. These women went away crying and saying: Had there been one amongst our people (he would have taught a lesson to you for the obscene words used for our idols before us). These women met Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and Abu Bakr who had also been coming down the hill. He asked them: What has happened to you? They said: There is Sabi, who has hidden himself between the Ka&#8217;ba and its curtain. He said: What did he say to you? They said: He uttered such words before us as we cannot express. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came and he kissed the Black Stone and circumambulated the House along with his Companion and then observed prayer, and when he had finished his prayer, Abu Dharr said: I was the first to greet him with the salutation of peace and uttered (these words) in this way; Allah&#8217;s Messen- ger, may there be peace upon you, whereupon he said: It may be upon you too and the mercy of Allah. He then said: Who are you? I said: From the tribe of Ghifar. He leaned his hand and placed his finger on his forehead and I said to myself: Perhaps he has not liked it that I belong to the tribe of Ghifar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I attempted to catch hold of his hand but his friend who knew about him more than I dissuaded me f rom doing so. He then lifted his head and said: Since how long have you been here? I said: I have been here for the last thirty nights or days. He said: Who has been feeding you? I said: There has been no food for me but the water of Zamzam. I have grown so bulky that there appear wrinkles upon my stomach and I do not feel any hunger. He said: It is blessed (water) and it also serves as food. Thereupon Abu Bakr said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, let me serve as a host to him for tonight, and then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) proceeded forth and so did Abu Bakr and I went along with them. Abu Bakr opened the door and then he brought for us the raisins of Ta&#8217;if and that was the first food which I ate there. Then I stayed as long as I had to stay. I then came to Allah&#8217;s Messenaer (may peace be upon him) and he said: I have been shown the land abound- ing in trees and I think it cannot be but that of Yathrib (that is the old name of Medina). You are a preacher to your people on my behalf. I hope Allah would benefit them through you and He would reward you. I came to Unais and he said: What have you done? I said: I have done that I have embraced Islam and I have testified (to the prophethood of Allah&#8217;s Messenger). He said: I have no aversion for your religion and I also embrace Islam and testify (to the prophethood of Muhammad). Then both of us came to our mother and she said: I have no aversion for your religion and I also embrace Islam and testify to the prophethood of Muhammad. We then loaded our camels and came to our tribe Ghifir and half of the tribe embraced Islam and their chief was Aimi&#8217; b. Rahada Ghifirl and he was their leader and hall of the tribe said: We will embrace Islam when Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may p,. ace be upon him) would come to Medina, and when Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to Medina the remaining half also embraced Islam. Then a tribe Aslam came to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, we also embrace Islam like our brothers who have embraced Islam. And they also embraced Islam. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Allah granted pardon to the tribe of Ghifar and Allah saved (from destruction) the tribe of Aslam.</p>

Listen to his words and then come to me. So he rode on until he came to Mecca and he heard his words (the sacred words of the Holy Prophet) and then came back to Abu Dharr and said: I have seen him exhorting (people) to develop good morals and his expressions can in no way be termed as poetry. He (Abu Dharr) said: I have not been satisfied with it regarding that which I had in my mind (as I sent you). So he took up provisions for the journey and a small water-skin con- taining water (and set forth) until he came to Mecca. He came to the mosque (Ka&#8217;ba) and began to find out Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and he did not re- cognise him (the Holy Prophet) and he did not even like that he should ask about him from anyone until it was night, and he slept. &#8216;All saw him and found him to be a stranger. So he went with him. He followed hive but one did not make any inquiry from the other about anything until it was morning. He then brought the water and his provisions to the mosque and spent a day there, but he did not see Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) until it was night. He then returned to his bed that there happened to pass &#8216;Ali and he said: This man has not been able to find his destination until this time. He made him stand and he went with him and no one made an in- quiry from his companion about anything. And when it was the third day he did the same. &#8216;Ali made him stand up and brought him along with him. He said: By Him, besides Whom there is no god, why don&#8217;t you tell me (the reason) which brought you here to this town? He said: (I shall do this) provided you hold me promise and a covenant that you would guide me aright. He then did that. He (&#8216;Ali) said: Verily, he Is truthful and he is a Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and when it is morning, follow me and if I would say anything from which I would sense fear about you I would stand (in a manner) as if I was throwing water and if I move on, you then follow me until I get in (some house). He did that and I followed him until he came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). He entered (the house) of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) along with him and listened to his words and embraced Islam at his very place. Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said to him: Go to your people and inform them until my command reaches you. Thereupon he said: By Him in Whose Hand is my life, I shall say to the people of Mecca this thing at the top of my voice So he set forth until he came to the mosque and then spoke at the top of his voice (saying): I bear testimony to the fact that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. The people attacked him and made him fall down when &#8216;Abbas came and he leaned over him and said: Woe be upon you, don&#8217;t you know that he is from amongst the tribe of Ghifar and your trad- ing route to Syria passes through (the settlements of this tribe), and he rescued him. He (Abu Dharr) did the same on the next day and they (the Meccans) again attacked him and Abbas leaned upon him and he rescued him.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Qais b. &#8216;Ubada reported: I was in the company of some persons, amongst whom some were the Companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) in Medina, that there came a person whose face depicted the fear (of Allah). Some people said: He is a person from amongst the people of Paradise; he is a person from amongst the people of Paradise. He observed two short rak&#8217;ahs of prayer and then went out. I followed him and he got into his house and I also got in and we began to converse with each other. And when he became familiar (with me) I said to Him: When you entered (the mosque) before (your entrance in the house) a person said so and so (that you are amongst the people of Paradise), whereupon he said: It is not meet for anyone to say anything which he does not know. I shall (now) tell you why they (say) this. I saw a dream during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and narrated it to him. I seemed to be in a garden [he described its vastness, its rich fructification and its verdure]; in the midst of it, there stood an iron pillar, with its base in the earth and its summit in the sky: and upon its summit there was a handhold. It was said to me: Climb up this (pillar). I said to him (visitant in the dream): I am unable to do it. Thereupon a helper came to me, and he (supported) me (by catching hold of my) garment from behind and thus helped me with his hand and so I climbed up till I was at the summit of the pillar, and grasped the handhold. It was said to me: Ho d it tightly. It was at this that I woke up when (the handhold) was in fthe grip) of my hand. I narrated it (the dream) to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him), whereupon he said: That garden implies al-Islam and that pillar implies the pillar of Islam. And that handhold is the firmest faith (as refered to in the Qur&#8217;an). And you will remain attached to Islam until you shall die. And that man was &#8216;Abdullah b. Salim.</p>

Saliim happened to pass (by that side). They (the people sitting in that company) said: He is a person from amongst the dwellers of Paradise. I stood up and said to him: They say such and such (thing about you), whereupon he said: Hallowed be Allah, it is not meet for them to say (anything) of which They have no knowledge. Verily I saw as if a pillar had been raised in a green garden and there had been fixed at its (upper) end a handhold and there was a helper at its base. It was said to me: Climb up. So I climbed up and caught hold of the haildhold. I narrated (the contents of this dream) to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), whereupon he said: &#8216;Abdullah would die in a state that he would be catching hold of the firmest handhold (he would die holding fast to the faith).</p>

He was telling good things to them (to the people sitting in that company). As he stood up (to depart) the people said: He who is desirous of looking at a person from amongst the people of Paradise should see him. I said: By Allah, I will follow him, and would try to know his residence. So I followed him and he walked on until he reached the outskirts of Medina. He then entered his house. I sought permission from him to get in, and he granted me the permission, saying: My nephew, what is the need (that has brought you here)? I said to him: As you stood up, I heard people say about you: He who is desirous of seeing a person from among the people of Paradise should look at him. So I became desirous of accompanying you. He (&#8216;Abdullah b. Salim) said: It is Allah Who knows best about the people of Paradise. I would, however, narrate to you as to why they said like it. (The story is) that while I was asleep (one night) there came to me a person (in the dream) who asked me to stand up. (So I stood up) and he caught hold of my hand and I walked along with him, and, lo, I found some paths on my left and I was about to set out upon them. Thereupon he said to me Do not set yourself on (them) for these are the paths of the leftists (denizens of Hell-fire). Then there were paths leading to the right side, whereupon he said: Set yourself on these paths. We came across a hill and he said to me: Climb up, and I attempted to climb up that I fell upon my buttocks. I made several attempts (but failed to succeed). He led until he came to a pillar (so high) that its upper end touched the sky and its base was in the earth. And there was a handhold at its upper end. He said to me Climb over it. I said: How can I climb upon it, as its upper end touches the sky? He cought hold of my hand and pushed me up and I found myself suspended with the handhold. He then struck the pillar and it fell down, but I remained attached to that handhold until it was morning (and the dream was thus over). I came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and narrated it to him. He said: So far as the paths which you saw on your left are concerned, these are paths of the leftists (denizens of Hell) and the paths which you saw on your right, these are the paths of the rightists (the dwellers of Paradise) and the mountain represents the destination of the martyrs which you would not be able to attain. The pillar implies the pillar of Islam. and so far as the handhold is concerned, it implies the handhold of Islam, and you would hold to it fastly until you would meet death.</p>

And if these two verses would not have been revealed in the Book I would have never transmitted anything (to anybody):&#8221; Those who conceal the clear evidence and the guidance that We revealed&#8221; (ii. 159) tip to the last verse.</p>

Rafi&#8217;, who was the scribe of &#8216;All, reported: I heard &#8216;Ali (Allah be pleased with him) as saying: Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) sent me and Zubair and Miqdad saying: Go to the garden of, Khakh [it is a place between Medina and Mecca at a distance of twelve miles from Medina] and there you will find a woman riding a camel. She would be in possession of a letter, which you must get from her. So we rushed on horses and when we met that woman, we asked her to deliver that letter to us. She said: There is no letter with me. We said: Either bring out that letter or we would take off your clothes. She brought out that letter from (the plaited hair of) her head. We delivered that letter to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) in which Hatib b. Abu Balta&#8217;a had informed some people amongst the polytheists of Mecca about the affairs of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Hatib, what is this? He said: Allah&#8217;s messenger, do not be hasty in judging my intention. I was a person attached to the Quraish. Sufyan said: He was their ally but had no relationship with them. (Hatib further said): Those who are with you amongst the emigrants have blood-relationship with them (the Quraish) and thus they would protect their families. I wished that when I had no blood-relationship with them I should find some supporters from (amongst them) who would help my family. I have not done this because of any unbelief or apostasy and I have no liking for the unbelief after I have (accepted) Islam. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: You have told the truth. &#8216;Umar said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, permit me to strike the neck of this hypocrite. But he (the Holy Prophet) said: He was a participant in Badr and you little know that Allah revealed about the people of Badr: Do what you like for there is forgiveness for you. And Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, said:&#8221; O you who believe, do not take My enemy and your enemy for friends&#8221; (lx. 1). And there is no mention of this verse in the hadith transmitted on the authority of Abu Bakr and Zubair and Ishaq has in his narration made a mention of the recitation of this verse by Sufyan.</p>

Abu Musa said: I followed him with the determination to kill him and overtook him and when he saw me he turned upon his heels. I followed him and I said to him: Don&#8217;t you feel ashamed (that you run), aren&#8217;t you an Arab? Why don&#8217;t you stop? He stopped and I had an encounter with him and we exchanged the strokes of (swords). I struck him with the sword and killed him. Then I came back to Abu Amir and said: Verily Allah has killed the one who killed you. And he said: Now draw out this arrow. I drew out the arrow and there came out from that (wound) water. Abu &#8216;Amir said: My nephew, go to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and convey my greetings to him and tell him that Abu Amir begs you to ask forgiveness for him. And Abu Amir appointed me as the chief of the people and he died after a short time. When I came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) I visited him and he had been lying on the cot woven by strings and there was (no) bed over it and so there had been marks of the strings on the back of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and on his sides.

He again said: O Allah, grant him distinction amongst the majority of Thine created beings or from amongst the people. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, ask forgiveness for me too.

And I was accompanied by two brothers of mine, I being the youngest of them; one of them was Abu Burda and the other one was Abu Ruhm, and there were some other persons with them. Some say they were fifty-three or fifty-two persons of my tribe. We embarked upon a boat, and the boat sailed away to the Negus of Abyssinia. There we met Ja&#8217;far b. Abu Talib and his companions. Ja&#8217;far said: Allall&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has sent us here and has commanded us to stay here and you should also stay with us. So we stayed with him and we came back (to Medina) and met Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) when Khaibar had been conquered. He (the Holy Prophet) allocated a share to us and in the ordinary course he did not allocate the share to one who had been absent on the occasion of the conquest of Khaibar but conferred (a share) upon him only who had been present there with him. He, however, made an exception for the people of the boat, viz. for Ja&#8217;far and his companions. He allocated a share to them, and some persons from amongst the people said to us, viz. the people of the boat: We have preceded you in migration. Asma&#8217; bint &#8216;Umais who had migrated to Abyssinia and had come back along with them (along with immigrants) visited Hafsa, the wife of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him). (Accordingly), Umar had been sitting with her (Hafsa). As &#8216;Umar saw Asma, he said: Who is she? She (Hafsa) said: She is Asma, daughter of &#8216;Umais. He said: She is an Abyssinian and a sea-woman. Asma said: Yes, it is so. Thereupon &#8216;Umar said: We preceded you in migration and so we have more right to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as compared with you. At this she felt annoyed and said: &#8216;Umar, you are not stating the fact; by Allah, you had the privilege of being in the company of the Messenger (may peace be upon him) who fed the hungry among you and instructed the ignorant amongst you, whereas we had been far (from here) in the land of Abyssinia amongst the enemies and that was all for Allah and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and, by Allah, I would never take food nor take water unless I make a mention to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) of what you have said. We remained in that country in constant trouble and dread and I shall talk about it to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (way peace be upon him) and ask him (about it). By Allah, I shall not tell a lie and deviate (from the truth) and add anything to that. So, when Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) came, she said: Allah&#8217;s Apostle, &#8216;Umar says so and so. Upon this Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: His right is not more than yours, for him and his companions there is one migration, but for you, i. e. for the people of the boat, there are two migrations. She said: I saw Abu Musa and the people of the boat coming to me in groups and asking me about this hadith, because there was nothing more pleasing and more significant for them than this. Abu Burda reported that Asma said: I saw Abu Musa, asking me to repeat this hadith to him again and again.</p>

And he (the narrator) said: (When) the consignment of Zakat was brought to him, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: This is the charity of our people, and there was one slave-girl in the house of &#8216;A&#8217;isha and she was from the tribe of Banu Tamim; thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Set her free, for she is from the offspring of Isma&#8217;il.

At the end of one hundred years after this none would survive on the surface of the earth (from amount my Companions). Ibn Umar said: People were (not understanding) these words of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) which had been uttered pertaining to one hundred years. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) in fact meant (by these words) that on that day none from amongst those who had been living upon the earth (from amongst his Companions) would survive (after one hundred years) and that would be the end of this generation.</p>

(He would be) from Qaran, (the branch) of Murid. He had been suffering from leprosy from which he was cured but for a spot of a dirham. His treatment with his mother would have been excellent. If he were to take an oath in the name of Allah, He would honour that. And if it is possible for you, then do ask him to beg forgiveness for you (from your Lord). So he (Uwais) begged forgiveness for him. Umar said: Where do you intend to go? He said: To Kufa. He (&#8216;Umar) said: Let me write a letter for you to its governor, whereupon he (Uwais) said: I love to live amongst the poor people. When it was the next year, a person from among the elite (of Kufa) performed Hajj and he met Umar. He asked him about Uwais. He said: I left him in a state with meagre means of sustenance. (Thereupon) Umar said: I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: There would come to you Uwais b. &#8216;Amir, of Qaran, a branch (of the tribe) of Murid, along with the reinforcement of the people of Yemen. He had been suffering from leprosy which would have been cured but for the space of a dirham. His treatment with his mother would have been very kind. If he would take an oath in the name of Allah (for something) He would honour it. Ask him to beg forgiveness for you (from Allah) in case it is possible for you. So he came to Uwais and said.: Beg forgiveness (from Allah) for me. He (Uwais) said: You have just come from a sacred journey (Hajj) ; you, therefore, ask forgiveness for me. He (the person who had performed Hajj) said: Ask forgiveness for me (from Allah). He (Uwais again) said: You have just come from the sacred journey, so you ask forgiveness for me. (Uwais further) said: Did you meet Umar? He said: Yes. He (Uwais) then begged forgiveness for him (from Allah). So the people came to know about (the status of religious piety) of Uwais. He went away (from that place). Usair said: His clothing consisted of a mantle, and whosoever saw him said: From where did Uwais get this mantle?</p>

By Allah, I used to forbid you from this; by Allah, I used to forbid you from this, by Allah I used to forbid you from this. By Allah, so far as I know, you had been very much devoted to fasting and prayer and you had been paying very much care to cementing the ties of blood.

He again sent the messenger to her with the message that she must come, otherwise he would bring her forcibly catching hold of her hair. But she again refused and said: By Allah, I will not come to you until you send one to me who would drag me by pulling my hair. Thereupon he said: Bring me my shoes. He put on his shoes and walked on quickly swollen with vanity and pride until he came to her and said: How do you find what I have done with the enemy of Allah? She said: I find that you wronged him in this world, whereas he has spoiled your next life. It has been conveyed to me that you used to call him (&#8216;Abdullah b. Zubair) as the son of one having two belts. By Allah, I am indeed (a woman) of two belts. One is that with the help of which I used to suspend high the food of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and that of Abu Bakr (making it out of the reach) of animals and, so far as the second belt is concerned, that is the belt which no woman can dispense with. Verily Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) told us that in Thaqif, there would be born a great liar and great murderer.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 26: </font></p>
<p>    </p>
<h3 align="center"><font><em>The Book on Salutations and Greetings  (Kitab As-Salam) </em></font>    </h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><br></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Just as the face is the index to the mind, in the same way  the words of greetings which are exchanged amongst people indicate the spiritual role of a  society. The gestures, and the expressions of salutations are, therefore, the indicators  of the ideals for which a particular society stands. The common practice with the  pre-Islamic Arabs and thi modern West is to greet one another with Good Morning and Good  Evening accompanied by a gesture of the hand or the nodding of head. These words have no  spiritual and moral significance, but just a wish that one should find one&#8217;s mornings and  evenings happy. The words of greeting which Islam has exhorted its followers to use at the  time of meeting are as-Salam-u-&#8216;Alaikum which have a deep spiritual and moral significance  behind them Since the predominant feature of Islamic faith and practice is peace within  and peace without, it has, therefore, been made a watchword which should be repeated on  every occasion when two Muslims meet so that the utmost importance of peace should be  constantly inculcated in the mind of every Muslim, and he should have full consciousness  of the great reality that he lives in this world as a messenger of peace for mankind.  peace amongst individuals and nations. -The second important feature of words of greeting  in Islam is that they convey the message of peace not only to the person who is greeted  but to the whole of the Muslim society as it is the plural pronoun that is used for the  blessing of peace. (The pronoun&#8217;Alaikum has a evry wide range and all the Muslims come  within its orbit.) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The two words as-Salam-u-&#8216;Alaikum may be called the  irreducible minimum which are essential for greeting one another. The Muslims have been  commanded to add to this expression some other words with a view to excelling one another  in showering blessing upon the Muslims. The words as-Salam-u-&#8216;Alaikum are generally  suffixed with these words Rahmat Allah wa Barakaatuh (mercy of Allah and His bleasings).  These three words:&#8221; peace&#8230;, mercy&#8221; and&#8221; blessings of Allah&#8221; in fact  form the sum and substance of Islam and the Muslims are asked to shower upon one another  these benedictions. so that they may be able to live in this world and the Hereafter in  perfect peace and tranquillity and blessings and mercy of Allah around him. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>According to Imam Nawawl, greeting with the words of  as-Salam-u-&#8216;Alaikum is a Sunnah, and responding to it is Wajib (obligatory), but this  essentiality is of the nature of Kifaya, meaning thereby that if a few persons out of the  whole assembly or group respond to the greeting it will absolve all of the responsibility  of response but if no response comes forth from any quarter all are held responsible for  it. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Talha reported: While We were sitting in front of the    houses and talking amongst ourselves, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) happened    to come there. He stood by us and said: What about you apd your meetings on the paths?    Avoid these meetings on the paths. We said: We were sitting here without (any intention of    doing harm to the passers-by) ; we are sitting to discuss matters and to hold conversation    amongst ourselves. Thereupon he said: If there is no help (for you but to sit on these    paths), then give the paths their rights and these are lowering of the gaze, exchanging of    greetings and good conversation.</font></p>

Besides this, I grazed the camel, made arrangements for    providing it with water and patched up the leather bucket and kneaded the flour. But I was    not proficient in baking the bread, so my female neighbours used to bake bread for me and    they were sincere women.

They informed    him that a scourge had broken out in Syria. Ibn &#8216;Abbas further reported that &#8216;Umar said:    Call to me tile earliest emigrants. So I called them. He (Hadrat &#8216;Umar) sought their    advice, and they told him that the scourge had broker, out in Syria. There was a    difference of opinion (whether they should proceed further or go back to their homes in    such a situation). Some of them said: You (&#8216;Umar) have set forth for a task, and,    therefore, we would not advise you to go back, whereas some of them said: You have along    with you the remnants (of the sacred galaxy) of men and (the blessed) Companions of    Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), so we would not advise you to go forth towards    this calamity (with such eminent persons and thus expose them deliberately to a danger).

So I called    them to him, and he consulted them, and they trod the same path as was trodden by the    Muhajirin, and they differed in their opinions as they had differed. He said: Now, you can    go. He again said: Call to me the old persons of the Quraish who had migrated before the    Victory (that is the Victory of Mecca), so I called them (and Hadrat &#8216;Umar consulted them)    and not even two persons differed (from the opinion held by the earlier delegates). They    said: Our opinion is that you better go back along with the people and do not make them go    to this scourge, So &#8216;Umar made announcement to the people: In the morning I would be on    the back of my side. So they (set forth in the morning), whereupon Abu &#8216;Ubaida b. Jarrah    said: Are you going to run away from the Divine Decree? Thereupon &#8216;Umar said: Had it been    someone else to say this besides you! &#8216;Umar (in fact) did not approve of his opposing    (this decision) and he said: Yes, we are running from the Divine Decree (to the) Divine    Decree. You should think if there had been camels for you and you happened to get down in    a valley having two sides, one of them covered with verdure and the other being barren,    would you not (be doing) according to the Divine Decree if you graze them in verdure? And    in case you graze them in the barren land (even then you would be grazing them) according    to the Divine Decree.</font></p>

Abu    Salama said that Abu Huraira used to narrate these two (different ahadith) from Allah&#8217;s    Messenger (may peace be upon him), but afterwards Abu Huraira became silent on these    words:&#8221; There is no transitive disease,&#8221; but he stuck to this that the sick    person should not be taken to one who is healthy. Harith b. Abu Dhubab (and he was the    first cousin of Abu Huraira) said: Abu Huraira, I used to hear from you that you narrated    to us along with this hadith and the other one also (there is no transitive disease), but    now you observe silence about it. You used to say that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be    upon him) said: There is no transitive disease. Abu Huraira denied having any knowledge of    that, but he said that the sick camel should not be taken to the healthy one. Harith,    however, did not agree with him, which irritated Abu Huraira and he said to him some words    in the Abyssinian language. He said to Harith: Do you know what I said to you? He said:    No. Abu Huraira said: I simply denied having said it. Abu Salama sad: By my life, Abu    Huraira in fact used to report Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) having said:    There is no transitive disease. I do not know whether Abu Huraira has forgotten it or he    deemed it an abrogated statement in the light of the other one.</font></p>

Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: What did you    say in the pre-Islamic days when there was such a shot (of meteor)? They said: Allah and    His Messenger know best (the actual position), but we, however, used to say that that very    night a great man had been born and a great man had died, whereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may    peace be upon him) said: (These meteors) are shot neither at the death of anyone nor on    the birth of anyone. Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, issues Command when He decides to do    a thing. Then (the Angels) supporting the Throne sing His glory, then sing the dwellers of    heaven who are near to them until this glory of God reaches them who are in the heaven of    this world. Then those who are near the supporters of the Throne ask these supporters of    the Throne: What your Lord has said? And they accordingly inform them what He says. Then    the dwellers of heaven seek information from them until this information reaches the    heaven of the world. In this process of transmission (the jinn snatches) what he manages    to overhear and he carries it to his friends. And when the Angels see the jinn they attack    them with meteors. If they narrate only which they manage to snatch that is correct but    they alloy it with lies and make additions to it.</font></p>

I looked towards it and found a snake. I    jumped up in order to kill it, but he (Abu Sa&#8217;id Khudri) made a gesture that I should sit    down. So I sat down and as he finished (the prayer) he pointed to a room in the house and    said: Do you see this room? I said: Yes. He said: There was a young man amongst us who had    been newly wedded. We went with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) (to participate    in the Battle) of Trench when a young man in the midday used to seek permission from    Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) to return to his family. One day he sought    permission from him and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) (after granting him the    permission) said to him: Carry your weapons with you for I fear the tribe of Quraiza (may    harm you). The man carried the weapons and then came back and found his wife standing    between the two doors. He bent towards her smitten by jealousy and made a dash towards her    with a spear in order to stab her. She said: Keep your spear away and enter the house    until you see that which has made me come out. He entered and found a big snake coiled on    the bedding. He darted with the spear and pierced it and then went out having fixed it in    the house, but the snake quivered and attacked him and no one knew which of them died    first, the snake or the young man. We came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and    made a mention to him and said: Supplicate to Allah that that (man) may be brought back to    life. Thereupon he said: Ask forgiveness for your companion and then said: There are in    Medina jinns who have accepted Islam, so when you see any one of them, pronounce a warning    to it for three days, and if they appear before you after that, then kill it for that is a    devil.</font></p>

He climbed down into it and drank (water) and then came out and saw a dog lolling    its tongue on account of thirst and eating the moistened earth. The person said: This dog    has suffered from thirst as I had suffered from it. He climbed down into the well, filled    his shoe with water, then caught it in his mouth until he climbed up and made the dog    drink it. So Allah appreciated this act of his and pardoned him. Then (the Companions    around him) said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, is there for us a reward even for (serving) such    animals? He said: Yes, there is a reward for service to every living animal.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Harith b Abi Rabi&#8217;a and &#8216;Abdullah b. Safwan both went to Umm Salama, the Mother of the Faithful, and they asked her about the army which would be sunk in the earth, and this relates to the time when Ibn Zubair (was the governor of Mecca). She reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had said that a seeker of refuge would seek refuge in the Sacred House and an army would be sent to him (in order to kill him) and when it would enter a plain ground, it would be made to sink. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, what about him who would be made to accompany this army willy nilly? Thereupon he said: He would be made to sink along with them buf he would be raised on the Day of Resurrection on the basis of his intention. Abu Ja&#8217;far said. &#8216; This plain, ground means the plain ground of Medina.</p>

A person (who had been listening to this badith from Abdullah b. Safwan) said: I bear testimony in regard to you that you are not imputing a lie to Hafsa. And I bear testimony to the fact that Hafsa is not telling a lie about Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him).</p>

Safwan reported the Mother of the Faithful as saying that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: They would soon seek protection in this House, viz. Ka&#8217;ba (the defenceless), people who would have nothing to protect themselves in the shape of weapons or the strength of the people. An army would be sent to fight (and kill) them and when they would enter a plain ground the army would be sunk in it. Yiisuf (one of the narrators) said: It was a people of Syria (hordes of Hajjaj) who had been on that day comin. towards Mecca for an attack (on &#8216;Abdulllah b. Zubair) and Abdullah b. Safwan said: By God, it does not imply this army.</p>

And when they would reach the plain ground they would be sunk. We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, all sorts of people throng the path. Thereupon he said: Yes, there would be amongst them people who would come with definite designs and those who would come under duress and there would be travellers also, but they would all be destroyed through one (stroke) of destruction. though they would be raised in different states (on the Day of Resurrection). Allah would, however, raise them according to their intention.</p>

When they will arrange themselves in ranks, the Romans would say: Do not stand between us and those (Muslims) who took prisoners from amongst us. Let us fight with them; and the Muslims would say: Nay, by Allah, we would never get aside from you and from our brethren that you may fight them. They will then fight and a third (part) of the army would run away, whom Allah will never forgive. A third (part of the army). which would be constituted of excellent martyrs in Allah&#8217;s eye, would be killed ani the third who would never be put to trial would win and they would be conquerors of Constantinople. And as they would be busy in distributing the spoils of war (amongst themselves) after hanging their swords by the olive trees, the Satan would cry: The Dajjal has taken your place among your family. They would then come out, but it would be of no avail. And when they would come to Syria, he would come out while they would be still preparing themselves for battle drawing up the ranks. Certainly, the time of prayer shall come and then Jesus (peace be upon him) son of Mary would descend and would lead them in prayer. When the enemy of Allah would see him, it would (disappear) just as the salt dissolves itself in water and if he (Jesus) were not to confront them at all, even then it would dissolve completely, but Allah would kill them by his hand and he would show them their blood on his lance (the lance of Jesus Christ).</p>

I said: You mean Rome? And he said: Yes, and there would be a terrible fight and the Muslims would prepare a detachment (for fighting unto death) which would not return but victorious. They will fight until night will intervene them; both the sides will return without being victorious and both will be wiped out. The Muslims will again prepare a detachment for fighting unto death so that they may not return but victorious. When it would be the fourth day, a new detachment out of the remnant of the Muslims would be prepared and Allah will decree that the enemy should be routed. And they would fight such a fight the like of which would not be seen, so much so that even if a bird were to pass their flanks, it would fall down dead before reaching the end of them. (There would be such a largescale massacre) that when counting would be done, (only) one out of a hundred men related to one another would be found alive. So what can be the joy at the spoils of such war and what inheritance would be divided! They would be in this very state that they would hear of a calamity more horrible than this.

Ibn Sayyad said to the Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him): Do you bear witness to the fact that I am the messenger of Allah? Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) rejected this and said: I affirm my faith in Allah and in His messengers. Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to him: What do you see? Ibn Sayyad said: It us a Dukh. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: May you be disgraced and dishonoured, you would not not be able to go beyond your rank. &#8216;Umar b. Khattab said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, permit me that I should strike his neck. Therupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: If he is the same (Dajjal) who would appear near the Last Hour, you would not be able to overpower him, and he is not that ther is no good for you to kill him. &#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Umar further narrated that after some time Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and Ubayy b. Ka&#8217;b went towards the palm trees where Ibn Sayyad was. When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) went near the tree he hid himself behind a tree with the intention of hearing something from Ibn sayyad before Ibn Sayyad could see him, but Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may pcxce be upon him) saw him on a bed with a blanket around him from which a murmuring sound was being heard and Ibn Sayyad&#8217;s mother saw Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) behind the trunk of the palm tree. She said to Ibn Sayyad: Saf (that being his name), here is Muhammad. Thereupon Ibn Sayyad jumped up murmuring and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: If she had left him alone he would have made things clear. Abdullah b. Umar told that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) stood up amongst the people and lauded Allah as He deserved, then he made a mention of the Dajjal and said: I warn you of him and there is no Prophet who has not warned his people against the Dajjal. Even Noah warned (against him) but I am going to tell you a thing which no Prophet told his people. You must know that he (the Dajjal) is one-eyed and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, is not one-eyed. Ibn Shihab said: &#8216;Umar b. Thabit al-Ansari informed me that some of the Companions of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) informed him that the day when Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) warned people against the Dajjal, he also said: There would be written between his two eyes (the word) Kafir (infidel) and everyone who would resent his deeds would be able to read or every Muslim would be about to read, and he also said: Bear this thing in mind that none amongst you would be able to see Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, until he dies.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nawwas b. Sam&#8217;an reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) made a mention of the Dajjal one day in the morning. He sometimes described him to be insignificant and sometimes described (his turmoil) as very significant rand we felt) as if he were in the cluster of the date-palm trees. When we went to him (to the Holy Prophet) in the evening and he read (the signs of fear) in our faces, he said: What is the matter with you? We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, you made a mention of the Dajjal in the morning (sometimes describing him) to be insignificant and sometimes very important, until we began to think as if he were present in some (near) part of the cluster of the datpalm trees. Thereupon he said: I harbour fear in regard to you in so many other things besides the Dajjal. If he comes forth while I am among on, I shall contend with him on your behalf, but if he comes forth while I am not amongst you, a man must contend on his own behalf and Allah would take care of every Muslim on my behalf (and safeguard him against his evil). He (Dajjal) would be a young man with twisted, contracted hair, and a blind eye. I compare him to &#8216;Abd-ul-&#8216;Uzza b. Qatan. He who amongst you would survive to see him should recite over him the opening verses of Sura Kahf (xviii.). He would appear on the way between Syria and Iraq and would spread mischief right and left. O servant of Allah! adhere (to the path of Truth). We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, how long would he stay on the earth? He said.. For forty days, one day like a year and one day like a month and one day like a week and the rest of the days would be like your days. We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, would one day&#8217;s prayer suffice for the prayers of day equal to one year? Thereupon he said: No, but you must make an estimate of time (and then observe prayer). We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, how quickly would he walk upon the earth? Thereupon he said: Like cloud driven by the wind. He would come to the people and invite them (to a wrong religion) and they would affirm their faith in him and respond to him. He would then give command to the sky and there would be rainfall upon the earth and it would grow crops. Then in the evening, their posturing animals would come to them with their humps very high and their udders full of milk and their flanks stretched. He would then come to another people and invite them. But they would reject him and he would go away from them and there would be drought for them and nothing would be lef t with them in the form of wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would then walk through the waste, land and say to it: Bring forth your treasures, and the treasures would come out and collect (themselves) before him like the swarm of bees. He would then call a person brimming with youth and strike him with the sword and cut him into two pieces and (make these pieces lie at a distance which is generally) between the archer and his target. He would then call (that young man) and he will come forward laughing with his face gleaming (with happiness) and it would at this very time that Allah would send Christ, son of Mary, and he will descend at the white minaret in the eastern side of Damscus wearing two garments lightly dyed with saffron and placing his hands on the wings of two Angels. When he would lower his head, there would fall beads of perspiration from his head, and when he would raise it up, beads like pearls would scatter from it. Every non-believer who would smell the odour of his self would die and his breath would reach as far as he would be able to see. He would then search for him (Dajjal) until he would catch hold of him at the gate of Ludd and would kill him. Then a people whom Allah had protected would come to Jesus, son of Mary, and he would wipe their faces and would inform them of their ranks in Paradise and it would be under such conditions that Allah would reveal to Jesus these words: I have brought forth from amongst My servants such people against whom none would be able to fight; you take these people safely to Tur, and then Allah would send Gog and Magog and they would swarm down from every slope. The first of them would pass the lake of Tibering and drink out of it. And when the last of them would pass, he would say: There was once water there. Jesus and his companions would then be besieged here (at Tur, and they would be so much hard pressed) that the head of the ox would be dearer to them than one hundred dinirs and Allah&#8217;s Apostle, Jesus, and his companions would supplicate Allah, Who would send to them insects (which would attack their necks) and in the morning they would perish like one single person. Allah&#8217;s Apostle, Jesus, and his companions would then come down to the earth and they would not find in the earth as much space as a single span which is not filled with their putrefaction and stench. Allah&#8217;s Apostle, Jesus, and his companions would then again beseech Allah, Who would send birds whose necks would be like those of bactrin camels and they would carry them and throw them where God would will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah would send rain which no house of clay or (the tent of) camels&#8217; hairs would keep out and it would wash away the earth until it could appear to be a mirror. Then the earth would be told to bring forth its fruit and restore its blessing and, as a result thereof, there would grow (such a big) pomegranate that a group of persons would be able to eat that, and seek shelter under its skin and milch cow would give so much milk that a whole party would be able to drink it. And the milch camel would give such (a large quantity of) milk that the whole tribe would be able to drink out of that and the milch sheep would give so much milk that the whole family would be able to drink out of that and at that time Allah would send a pleasant wind which would soothe (people) even under their armpits, and would take the life of every Muslim and only the wicked would survive who would commit adultery like asses and the Last Hour would come to them.</p>

So he will alight at some of the barren tracts near Medina, and a person who would be the best of men or one from amongst the best of men would say to him: I bear testimony to the fact that you are Dajjal about whom Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had informed us. The Dajjal would say: What is your opinion if I kill this (person), then I bring him back to life; even then will you harbour doubt in this matter? They would say: No. He would then kill (the man) and then bring him back to life. When he would bring tha@ person to life, he would say: By Allah, I had no better proof of the fact (that you are a Dajjal) than at the present time (that you are actually so). The Dajjal would then make an attempt to kill him (again) but he would not be able to do that. Abu Ishaq reported that it was said: That person would be Khadir (Allah be pleased with him).</p>

He would say: I intend to go to this one who is coming forth. They would say to him: Don&#8217;t you believe in our Lord? He would say: There is nothing hidden about our Lord. They would say: Kill him. Then some amongst them would say: Has your master (Dajjal) not forbidden you to kill anyone without (his consent)? And so they would take him to the Dajjal and when the believer would see him, he would say: O people. he is the Dajjil about whom Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has informed (us). The Dajjal would then order for breaking his head and utter (these words): Catch hold of him and break his head. He would be struck even on his back and on his stomach. Then the Dajjal would ask him: Don&#8217;t you believe in me? He would say: You are a false Masih. He would then order him to be torn (into pieces) with a saw from the parting of his hair up to his legs. After that the Dajjal would walk between the two pieces. He would then say to him: Stand, and he would stand erect. He would then say to him: Don&#8217;t you believe in me? And the person would say: It has only added to my insight concerning you (that you are really the Dajjal). He would then say: O people, he would not behave with anyone amongst people (in such a manner) after me. The Dajjal would try to catch hold of him so that he should kill him (again). The space between his neck and collar bone would be turned into copper and he would find no means to kill him. So he would catch hold of him by his hand and feet and throw him (into the air) and the people would think as if he had been thrown in the Hell-Fire whereas he would be thrown in Paradise. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He would be the most eminent amongst persons in regard to martyrdom in the eye of the Lord of the world.</p>

Thereupon he said: Hallowed be Allah, there is no god but Allah (or the words to the same effect). I have decided that I would not narrate anything to anyone now. I had only said that you would see after some time an important event that the (sacred) House (Ka&#8217;ba) would be burnt and it would happen and definitely happen. He then reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: The Dajjal would appear in my Ummah and he would stay (in the world) for forty-I cannot say whether he meant forty days, forty months or forty years. And Allah would then send Jesus son of Mary who would resemble &#8216;Urwa b Mas&#8217;ud. He (Jesus Christ) would chase him and kill him. Then people would live for seven years that there would be no ran. cour between two persons. Then Allah would send cold wind from the side of Syria that none would survive upon the earth having a speck of good in him or faith in him but he would die, so much so that even if some amongst you were to enter the innermost part of the mountain, this wind would reach that place also and that would cause his heath. I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Only the wicked people would survive and they would be as careless as birds with the charactertistics of beasts. They would never appreciate the good nor condemn evil. Then the Satan would come to them in human form and would say: Don&#8217;t you respond? And they would say: What do you order us? And he would command them to worship the idols but, in spite of this, they would have abundance of sustenance and lead comfortable lives. Then the trumpet would be blown and no one would hear that but he would bend hfs neck to one side and raise it from the other side and the first one to hear that trumpet would be the person who would be busy in setting right the tank meant for providing water to the camels. He would swoon and the other people would also swoon, then Allah would send or He would cause to send rain which would be like dew and there would grow out of it the bodies of the people. Then the second trumpet would be blown and they would stand up and begin to look (around). Then it would be said: O people, go to your Lord, and make them stand there. And they would be questioned. Then it would be said: Bring out a group (out of them) for the Hell-Fire. And then it would be asked: How much? It would be said: Nine hundred and ninty-nine out of one thousand for the Hell-Fire and that would be the day which would make the children old because of its terror and that would be the day about which it has been said:&#8221; On the day when the shank would be uncovered&#8221; (lxviii. 42).</p>

Qais and she was the first amongst the emigrant women: Narrate to me a hadith which you had heard directly from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and there is no extra link in between them. She said: Very well, if you like, I am prepared to do that, and he said to her: Well, do It and narrate that to me. She said: I married the son of Mughira and he was a chosen young man of Quraish at that time, but he fell as a martyr in the first Jihad (fighting) on the side of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). When I became a widow, &#8216;Abd al-Rahman b. Auf, one amongst the group of the Companions of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), sent me the proposal of marriage. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) also sent me such a message for his freed slave Usama b. Zaid. And it had been conveyed to me that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (way peace be upon him) had said (about Usama): He who loves me should also love Usima. When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) talked to me (about this matter), I said: My affairs are in your hand. You may marry me to anyone whom you like. He said: You better shift now to the house of Umm Sharik, and Umm Sharik was a rich lady from amongst the Anqir. She spent generously for the cause of Allah and entertained guests very hospitably. I said: Well, I will do as you like. He said: Do not do that for Umm Sharik is a woman who is very frequently vizited by guests and I do not like that your head may be uncovered or the cloth may be removed from your shank and the strangers may catch sight of them which you abhor. You better shift to the house of your cousin &#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Amr b. Umm Maktum and he is a person of the Bani Fihr branch of the Quraish, and he belonged to that tribe (to which Fatima) belonged. So I shifted to that house, and when my period of waiting was over, I heard the voice of an announcer making an announcement that the prayer would be observed in the mosque (where) congregational prayer (is observed).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I set out towards that mosque and observed prayer along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and I was in the row of the women which was near the row of men. When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had finished his prayer, he sat on the pulpit smiling and said: Every worshipper should keep sitting at his place. He then said: Do you know why I had asked you to assemble? They said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He said: By Allah. I have not made you assemble for exhortation or for a warning, but I have detained you here, for Tamim Dari, a Christian, who came and accepted Islam, told me something, which agrees with what I was-telling, yuu about the Dajjal. He narrated to me that he had sailed in a ship along with thirty men of Bani Lakhm and Bani Judham and had been tossed by waves in the ocean for a month. Then these (waves) took them (near) the land within the ocean (island) at the time of sunset. They sat in a small side-boat and entered that Island. There was a beast with long thick hair (and because of these) they could not distinguish his face from his back. They said: Woe to you, who can you be? Thereupon it said: I am al-Jassasa. They said: What is al-Jassasa? And it said: O people, go to this person in the monastery as he is very much eager to know about you. He (the narrator) said: When it named a person for us we were afraid of it lest it should be a Devil. Then we hurriedly went on till we came to that monastery and found a well-built person there with his hands tied to his neck and having iron shackles between his two legs up to the ankles. We said: Woe be upon thee, who are you? And he said: You would soon come to know about me. but tell me who are you. We said: We are people from Arabia and we embarked upon a boat but the sea-waves had been driving us for one month and they brought as near this island. We got Into the side-boats and entered this island and here a beast met us with profusely thick hair and because of the thickness of his hair his face could not be distinguished from his back. We said: Woe be to thee, who are you? It said: I am al- Jassasa. We said: What is al-Jassasa? And it said: You go to this very person in the monastery for he is eagerly waiting for you to know about you. So we came to you in hot haste fearing that that might be the Devil. He (that chained person) said: Tell me about the date-palm trees of Baisan. We &amp;aid: About what aspect of theirs do you seek information? He said: I ask you whether these trees bear fruit or not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We said: Yes Thereupon he said: I think these would not bear fruits. He said: Inform me about the lake of Tabariyya? We said: Which aspect of it do you want to know? He said: Is there water in it? They said: There is abundance of water in it. Thereupon he said: I think it would soon become dry. He again said: Inform me about the spring of Zughar. They said: Which aspect of it you want to know? He (the chained person) said: Is there water in it and does it irrigate (the land)? We said to him: Yes, there is abundance of water in it and the inhabitants (of Medina) irrigate (land) with the help of it, He said: Inform me about the unlettered Prophet; what has he done? We said: He has come out from Mecca and has settled In Yathrib (Medina). He said: Do the Arabs fight against him? We said: Yes. He said: How did he deal with him? We informed him that he had overcome those in his neighbourhood and they had submitted themselves before him. Thereupon he said to us: Had it actually happened? We said: Yes. Thereupon he said: If it is so that is better for them that they should show obedience to him. I am going to tell you about. myself and I am Dajjal and would be soon permitted to get out and so I shall get out and travel in the land, and will not spare any town where I would not stay for forty nights except Mecca and Medina as these two (places) are prohibited (areas) for me and I would not make an attempt to enter any one of these two. An angel with a sword in his hand would confront me and would bar my way and there would be angels to guard every passage leading to it; then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) striking the pulpit with the help of the end of his staff said: This implies Taiba meaning Medina. Have I not, told you an account (of the Dajjal) like this? &#8216;The people said: Yes, and this account narrated by Tamim Dari was liked by me for it corroborates the account which I gave to you in regard to him (Dajjal) at Medina and Mecca. Behold he (Dajjal) is in the Syrian sea (Mediterranian) or the Yemen sea (Arabian sea). Nay, on the contrary, he As In the east, he is in the east, he is in the east, and he pointed with his hand towards the east.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Zaid b. Arqam reported: We set out on a journey along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) in which we faced many hardships. &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy said to his friends: Do not give what you have in your possession to those who are with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) until they desert him. Zubair said: That is the reciting of that person who recited as min haulahu (from around him) and the other reciting is man haulahia (who are around him). And in this case when we would return to Medina the honourable would drive out the meaner therefrom (lxiv. 8). I came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and informed him about that and he sent someone to &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy and he asked him whether he had said that or not. He took an oath to the fact that he had not done that and told that it was Zaid who had stated a lie to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). Zaid said: I was much perturbed because of this until this verse was revealed attesting my truth:&#8221; When the hypocrites come&#8221; (lxiii. 1). Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) then called them in order to seek forgiveness for them, but they turned away their heads as if they were hooks of wood fixed in the wall (lxiii. 4), and they were in fact apparently good-looking persons.</p>

Ubayy) came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and begged him that he should give him his shirt which he would use as a coffin for his father, he gave him that. He then begged that he should conduct funeral prayer for him. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had hardly got up to observe the prayer for him that &#8216;Umar stood up and caught hold of the garment of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, are you going to conduct prayer for this man, whereas Allah has forbidden you to offer prayer for him? Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Allah has given me an option as He has said:&#8221; You may beg pardon for them or you may not beg pardon for them, and even if you beg pardon for them, seventy times&#8221; (ix. 80), and I am going to make an addition to the seventy. He was a hypocrite and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) offered prayer for him and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed this verse:&#8221; Do not offer prayer for any one of them at all and do not stand upon their graves for (offering prayer over them)&#8221; (ix. 84).</p>

They lacked understanding but wore more flesh. One of them said: Do you think that Allah hears as we speak? The other one said: He does hear when we speak loudly and He does not hear when we speak in undertones, and still the other one said: If He listens when we speak loudly, He also listens when we speak in undertones. It was on this occasion that this verse was revealed:&#8221; You did not conceal yourselves lest your ears, your eyes and your skins would stand witness against you&#8221; (xli. 22).</p>

The Companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) were divided in two groups. One group said: We would kill them, and the other one said: No, this should not be done, and it was on this occasion that this verse was revealed:&#8221; Why should you, then, be two parties in relation to hypocrites?&#8221; (iv. 88).</p>

It was on this occasion that this verse was revealed:&#8221; Think not that those who exult in what they have done, and love to be praised for what they have not done-think not them to be safe from the chastisement; and for them is a painful chastisement&#8221; (iii. 18).</p>

Ibn &#8216;Abbas said: What you have to do with this verse? It has been in fact revealed in connection with the people of the Book.&#8221; Then Ibn Abbas recited this verse:&#8221; When Allah took a covenant from those who had been given the Book: You shall explain it to people and shall not conceal this&#8221; (iii. 186), and then Ibn &#8216;Abbas recited this verse:&#8221; Think not that those who exult in what they have done and love to be praised for what they have not done&#8221; (iii. 186). Ibn &#8216;Abbas (further) said: Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) asked them about something and then they concealed that and they told him something else and they went out and they thought that they had informed him as lie had asked them and they felt happy of what they had concealed.</p>

Is it your personal opinion or something you got from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him)? &#8216;Ammar said: We have got nothing from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) which people at large did not get, but Hudhaifa told me that Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) had especially told him amongst his Companion, that there would be twelve hypocrites out of whom eight would not get into Paradise, until a camel would be able to pass through the needle hole. The ulcer would be itself sufficient (to kill) eight. So far as four are concerned, I do not remember what Shu&#8217;ba said about them.</p>

Dubaila (ulcer) would be enough to (torment them) -a kind of flame of Fire which would appear in their shoulders and it would protrude from their chest.</p>

We have been informed that they were fourteen and If you are to be counted amongst them, then they would be fifteen and I state by Allah that twelve amongst them were the enemies of Allah and of His Messenger (may peace be upon him) in this world. The rest of the three put forward this excuse: We did not hear the announcement of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and we were not aware of the intention of the people as he (the Holy Prophet) had been in the hot atmosphere. He (the Holy Prophet) then said: The water is small in quantity (at the next station). So nobody should go ahead of me, but he found people who had gone ahead of him and he cursed them on that day.</p>

They again dug the grave for him and buried him but the earth again threw him out upon the surface. They again dug the grave for him and buried him but the earth again threw him out upon the surface.

Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: This wind has perhaps been made to blow for the death of a hypocrite, and as he reached Medina a notorious hypocrite from amongst the hypocrites had died.</p>

When I placed my hand upon him, I said: By Allah, I have never seen, till this day, a person running higher temperature than he.

By Allah, it is not the poverty about which I fear in regard to you but I am afraid in your case that (the worldly) riches way be given to you as were given to those who had gone before you and you begin to vie with one another for them as they vied for them. and these may destroy you as these destroyed them.</p>

Allah decided to test them. So He sent an angel who came to one who was suffering from leprosy and said: Which thing do you like most? He said: Beautiful colour and fine skin and removal of that which makes me detestable in the eye of people. He wiped him and his illness was no more and he was conferred upon beautiful colour and beautiful skin. He (the angel) again said: Which property do you like most? He said: Camels, or he said: The cow the narrator is, however, doubtful about it, but (out of the persons) suffering from leprosy or baldness one of them definitely said: The came]. And the other one said: Cow. And he (one who demanded came]) was bestowed upon a she-camel, in an advanced stage of pregnancy, and while giving he said: May Allah bless you in this I Then he came to the bald-headed person and said: Which thing do you like most? He said: Beautiful hair and that (this baldness) may be removed from me because of which people hate me He wiped his body and his illness was removed and he was bestowed upon beautiful hair, and the angel said: Which wealth do you like most? He said: The cow. And he was given a pregnant cow and while handing it over to him he (the angel) said: May Allah bless you in this I Then he came to the blind man and he said: Which thing do you like most? He said: Allah should restore my eyesight so that I should be able to see people with the help of that. He wiped his body and Allah restored to him his eyesight, and he (the angel) also said: Which wealth do you like most? He said. The flock of sheep. And he was given a pregnant goat and that gave birth to young ones and it so happened that one valley abounded in camels and the other one in goats and the third one in sheep. He then came to one suffering from leprosy in his (old) form and shape and he said: I am a poor person and my provision has run short in my journey and there is none to take me to my destination except with the help of Allah and your favour. I beg of you in His name Who gave you fine colour and fine skin, and the camel in the shape of wealth (to confer upon me) a camel which should carry me in my journey. He said: I have many responsibilities to discharge. Thereupon he said: I perceive as if I recognise you. Were you not suffering from leprosy whom people hated and you were a destitude and Allah conferred upon you (wealth) He said: I have inherited this property from my forefathers. Thereupon he said: If you are a liar may Allah change you to that very position in which you had been. He then came to the one who was bald-headed in his (old) form and said to him the same what he had said to him (one suffering from leprosy) and he gave him the same reply as he had given him and he said: If you &#8216;are a liar, may Allah turn you to your previous position in which you had been. And then he came to the blind man in his (old) form and shape and he said: I am a destitute person and a wayfarer. My provision have ran short and today there is no way to reach the destination but with the help of Allah and then with your help and I beg of you in the (name) of One Who restored your eyesight and gave you the flock of sheep to give me a sheep by which I should be able to make my provisions for the journey. He said: I was blind and Allah restored to me my eyesight; you take whatever you like and leave whatever you like. By Allah. I shall not stand in your way today for what you take in the name of God. Thereupon, he said: You keep with you what you have (in your possession). The fact is that you three were put to test and Allah is well pleased with you and He is annoyed with your companions.</p>

Nothing would be left out of it but only water left in the utensil which its owner leaves, and you are going to shift to an abode which knows no end, and you should shift with the good before you, for we have been told that a stone would be thrown at one side of the Hell and it would go down even for seventy years but would not be able to reach its bottom. By Allah, it would be fully packed. Do you find it something strange, and it has been mentioned that there yawns a distance which one would be able to cover in forty years from one end to another of Paradise, and a day would come when it would be fully packed and you must be knowing that I was the seventh amongst seven who had been with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and we had nothing to eat but the leaves of the tree until the corners of the mouth were injured. We found a sheet which we tore in two and divided between myself and Sa&#8217;d b. Malik. I made the lower garment with halt of it and so did Sa&#8217;d make the lower garment with half of it and today there is none amongst us who has not become the governor of a city from amongst the cities (of the Islamic Commonwealth) and I seek refuge with Allah that I should consider myself great whereas I am insignificant in the eye of Allah. Prophethood does not remain for ever and its impact fades with the result that it changes eventually into kingship, and you would soon come to know and experience those rulers who would come after us and see (how far they are from religion).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Suhaib reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) thus said: There lived a king before you and he had a (court) magician. As he (the magician) grew old, he said to the king: I have grown old, send some young boy to me so that I should teach him magic. He (the king) sent to him a young man so that he should train him (in magic). And on his way (to the magician) he (the young man) found a monk sitting there. He (the young man) listened to his (the monk&#8217;s) talk and was impressed by it. It became his habit that on his way to the magician he met the monk and set there and he came to the magician (late). He (the magician) beat him because of delay. He made a complaint of that to the monk and he said to him: When you feel afraid of the magician, say: Members of my family had detained me. And when you feel afraid of your family you should say: The magician had detained me. It so happened that there came a huge beast (of prey) and it blocked the way of the people, and he (the young boy) said: I will come to know today whether the magician is superior or the monk is superior. He picked up a stone and said: O Allah, if the affair of the monk is dearer to Thee than the affair of the magician, cause death to this animal so that the people should be able to move about freely. He threw that stone towards it and killed it and the people began to move about (on the path freely). He (the young man) then came to that monk and Informed him and the monk said: Sonny, today you are superior to me. Your affair has come to a stage where I find that you would be soon put to a trial, and in case you are put to a trial don&#8217;t give my clue. That young man began to treat the blind and those suffering from leprosy and he in fact began to cure people from (all kinds) of illness. When a companion of the king who had gone blind heard about him, he came to him with numerous gifts and said: If you cure me all these things collected together here would be yours. Be said: I myself do not cure anyone. It is Allah Who cures and if you affirm faith in Allah, I shall also supplicate Allah to cure you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He affirmed his faith in Allah and Allah cured him and he came to the king and sat by his side as he used to sit before. The king said to him: Who restored your eyesight? He said: My Lord. Thereupon he said: It means that your Lord is One besides me. He said: My Lord and your Lord is Allah, so he (the king) took hold of him and tormented him till he gave a clue of that boy. The young man was thus summoned and the king said to him: O boy, it has been conveyed to me that you have become so much proficient in your magic that you cure the blind and those suffering from leprosy and you do such and such things. Thereupon he said: I do not cure anyone; it is Allah Who cures, and he (the king) took hold of him and began to torment him. So he gave a clue of the monk. The monk was thus summoned and it was said to him: You should turn back from your religion. He, however, refused to do so. He (ordered) for a saw to be brought (and when it was done) he (the king) placed it in the middle of his head and tore it into parts till a part fell down. Then the courtier of the king was brought and it was said to him: Turn back from your religion. Arid he refused to do so, and the saw was placed in the midst of his head and it was torn till a part fell down. Then that young boy was brought and it was said to him: Turn back from your religion. He refused to do so and he was handed over to a group of his courtiers. And he &#8216;said to them: Take him to such and such mountain; make him climb up that mountain and when you reach its top (ask him to renounce his faith) but if he refuses to do so, then throw him (down the mountain). So they took him and made him climb up the mountain and he said: O Allah, save me from them (in any way) Thou likest and the mountain began to quake and they all fell down and that person came walking to the king. The king said to him: What has happened to your companions? He said: Allah has saved me from them. He again handed him to some of his courtiers and said: Take him and carry him in a small boat and when you reach the middle of the ocean (ask him to renounce) his religion, but if he does not renounce his religion throw him (into the water).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they took him and he said: O Allah, save me from them and what they want to do. It was quite soon that the boat turned over and they were drowned and he came walking to the king, and the king said to him: What has happened to your companions? He said: Allah has saved me from them, and he said to the king: You cannot kill me until you do what I ask you to do. And he said: What is that? He said: You should gather people in a plain and hang me by the trunk (of a tree). Then take hold of an arrow from the quiver and say: In the name of Allah, the Lord of the worlds; then shoot an arrow and if you do that then you would be able to kill me. So he (the king) called the people in an open plain and tied him (the boy) to the trunk of a tree, then he took hold of an arrow from his quiver and then placed the arrow in the bow and then said: In the name of Allah, the Lord of the young boy; he then shot an arrow and it bit his temple. He (the boy) placed his hands upon the temple where the arrow had bit him and he died and the people said: We affirm our faith in the Lord of this young man, we affirm our faith in the Lord of this young man, we affirm our faith in the Lord of this young man. The courtiers came to the king and it was said to him: Do you see that Allah has actually done what you aimed at averting. They (the people) have affirmed their faith in the Lord. He (the king) commanded ditches to be dug at important points in the path. When these ditches were dug, and the fire was lit in them it was said (to the people): He who would not turn back from his (boy&#8217;s) religion would be thrown in the fire or it would be said to them to jump in that. (The people courted death but did not renounce religion) till a woman came with her child and she felt hesitant in jumping into the fire and the child said to her: 0 mother, endure (this ordeal) for it is the Truth.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Ubadab. Walid b. Samit reported: I and my father set out in search of knowledge to a tribe of the Ansar before their death (i. e. before the Companions of the Holy Prophet left the world) and I was the first to meet Abu Yasar, a Companion of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and there was a young man with him who carried the record of letters with him and there was a mantle prepared by the tribe of Ma&#8217;afiri upon him. And his servant too had a Ma&#8217;afiri mantle over him. My father said to him: My uncle, I see the signs of anger or that of agony on your face. He said: Yes, such and such person, the son of so and so, of the tribe of Harami owed me a debt. I went to his family, extended salutations and said: Where is he? They said: He is not here. Then came out to me his son who was at the threshold of his youth. I said to him: Where is your father? He said: No sooner did he hear your sound than he hid himself behind my mother&#8217;s bedstead. I said to him: Walk out to me, for I know where you are. He came out. I said to him: What prompted you to hide yourself from me? He said: By God, whatever I would say to you would not be a lie. By Allah, I fear that I should tell a lie to you and in case of making promise with you I should break it, as you are the Companion of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). The fact is that I was hard up in regard to money. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. I said: Do you adjure by Allah? He said: I adjure by Allah. Then he brought his promissory note and he wrote off (the debt) with his hand and said: Make payment when you find yourself solvent enough to pay me back; if you are not, then there is no liability upon you. These two eyes of mine saw, and he (Abu&#8217;I-Yasar) placed his fingers upon his eyes and these two ears of mine heard and my heart retained, and he pointed towards his heart that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He who gives time to one who is financially hard up (in the payment of debt) or writes off his debt, Allah will provide him His shadow. I said to him: My uncle, if you get the cloak of your servant and you give him your two clothes, or take his two clothes of Ma&#8217;afir and give him your cloak, then there would be one dress for you and one for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He wiped my head and said: O Allah, bless the son of my brother. O, son of my brother, these two very eyes of mine saw and these two ears of mine listened to and this heart of mine retained this, and he pointed towards the heart that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Feed them (the servants) and clothe them (the servants) what you wear, and if I give him the goods of the world, it is easy for me than this that he should take my virtues on the Day of Resurrection. We went on till we came to Jabir b. Abdullah in the mosque and he was busy in observing prayer in one cloth which he had joined at its opposite ends. I made my way through the people till I sat between him and the Qibla and I said: May Allah have mercy upon you. Do you observe prayer with one cloth on your body whereas your mantle is lying at your side? He pointed me with his hand towards my breast just like this and he separated his fingers and bent them in the shape of a bow. And (he said): I thought that a fool like you should come to me so that he should see me as I do and he should then also do like it. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to us in this very mosque and he had in his hand the twig of the palm-tree and he saw mucus towards the Qibla of the mosque and he erased it with the help of the twig. He then came to us and said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He then again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He again said: Who amongst you likes that Allah should turn His face away from him? We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, none of us likes it. And he said: If one amongst you stands for prayer, Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, is before him he should not spit in front of him, or on his right side, but should spit on his left side beneath his left foot and if he is impelled to do so all of a sudden (in spite of himself) he should then spit in his cloth and fold it in some part of it. (and he further said: ) Bring some sweet-smelling thing. A young man who belonged to our tribe stood up, went and brought scent in his palm. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) took that and applied it to the end of that twig and then touched the place where there had been mucus. Jabir said: This is why you should apply scent to your mosques.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported on the same authority: We set out along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) on an expedition of Batn Buwat. He (the Holy Prophet) was in search of al-Majdi b. &#8216;Amr al-Juhani. (We had so meagre equipment) that five. six or seven of us had one camel to ride and so we mounted it turn by turn. Once there wan. the turn of an Ansari to ride upon the camel. He made it kneel down to ride over it (and after having. mounted it), he tried to raise it up but it hesitated. So he said. May there be curse of Allah upon you! Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is there to curse his camel? He said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, it&#8217; is I. Thereupon he said: Get down from the camel and let us not have in our company the cursed one. Don&#8217;t curse your own selves, nor your children. nor your belongings. There is the possibility that your curse may synchronies with the time when Allah is about to confer upon you what you demand and thus your prayer may be readily responded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported on the same authority: We set out on an expedition along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) until it was evening, and we had been near a. water reservoir of Arabia. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who would be the person who would go ahead and set right the reservoir and drink water himself and serve us with it? Jabir said: I stood up and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, it is I who am ready to do that. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who is the person to accompany Jabir? And then Jabbar b. Sakhr stood up. So we went to that well and poured in that tank a bucket or two of water and plastered it with clay and then began to fill it (with water) until it was filled to the brim. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was the first who appeared before us, and he said: Do you (both) permit me to drink water out of it? We said: Yea, Allah&#8217;s Messenger. He led his camel to drink water and it drank. He then pulled its rein and it stretched its legs and began to urinate. He then took it aside and made it kneel down at another place and then came to the tank and performed ablution. I then got up and performed ablution like the ablution of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), and Jabbar b. Sakhr went in order to relieve himself and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) got up to observe prayer and there was a mantle over me. I tried to invert its ends but it was too short (to cover my body easily). It had its borders. I then inverted it (the mantle) and drew its opposite ends and then tied them at my neck. I then came and stood upon the left side of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). He caught hold of me and made me go round behind him, until he made me stand on his right side. Then Jabbar b. Sakhr came. He performed ablution and then came and stood on the left side of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) caught hold of our hands together, pushed us back and made us stand behind him. Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) began to look upon me with darting looks, but I did not perceive that. After that I became aware of it and he pointed with the gesture of his hand that I should wrap my loin-cloth. When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had finished the prayer, he said: Jabir! I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, at thy beck and call. He said: When the cloth around you is inadequate, then tie the opposite ends but when it is small, tie it over the lower body.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and the only means of sustenance for every person amongst us was only one date for a day and we used to chew it. And we struck the leaves with the help of our bow and ate them until the sides of our mouths were injured. It so happened one day that a person was overlooked and not given a date. We carried that person and bore witness to the fact that he had not been given that date so he was offered that and he got up and received that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jabir reported: We set out on an expedition along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) until we got down at a spacious valley and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) went to relieve himself. I followed him with a bucket full of water and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) looked about and he found no privacy but two trees at the end of the valley and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may. peace be upon him) went to one of them and took hold of one of its twigs and said: Be thou under my control by the permission of Allah, and so it came under his control like the camel who has its nosestring in the hand of its rider, and then he came to the second tree and took hold of a twig and said: Be thou under my control with the permission of Allah, and it came under his control, and when he came in the middle of the two trees he joined together the two twigs and said: join with the permission of Allah. Jabir said: I was afraid lest Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) should be aware of my nearness and go still farther. And Muhammad b. Abbad has used the word&#8221; faitab&#8217;d&#8221; and I began to talk to myself. And as I saw, I suddenly found Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) before me and the two trees were separated and each one of them was standing at its place. I saw Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) standing for a short time, nodding his head towards right and left. Isma&#8217;il pointed towards the right and left with the help of his head (in order to demonstrate how the Holy Prophet had pointed). Then he (the Holy Prophet) came to me and said: Jabir did you see my place where I was standing? I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, yes. He then said: Then you should go to those two trees and cut a twig from each of them and go to that place with them where I was standing and stand there where I was standing and place a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Jabir said: I set out and took hold of a stone and broke it and sharpened it and then I came to those trees and cut a twig from each one of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I then came dragging them until I stood at the place where Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had been standing and placed a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Then I met him and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, I have done that, but (kindly) explain to me the reason for it. Thereupon he said: I passed by two graves the occupants of which had been undergoing torment. I liked to make intercession for them so that the might be relieved of this torment y as long as these twigs remain fresh. Jabir said: We came back to the (camp of the) army and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, call people for per- forming wudu. I cried: Come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, there is not even a drop of water in the army camp, and there. was a person who used to cool the water for Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) in the old water-skin which kept hanging by the twig. He asked me to go to such and such Ansari and ask him to see if there was any water in that skin. I went to him and cast a glance in it but did not find anything but a drop in the mouth of that water-skin and if I were to draw that, the water-skin&#8217;s,. dried part would suck it up. I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, I have not found anything in it but a drop of water in the mouth of the water-skin and now if I were to draw that, it would be absorbed. He said: Go and bring that to me. I brought that to him. He took hold of it -and began to utter something which I could not understand and then pressed it with his hand and gave that to me and said: Jabir, announce for the tub to be brought. So I announced that the tub of the army (be brought). It was brought accordingly and I placed it before him (the Holy Prophet). Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) placed his hands in the tub like this: with his fingers stretched out, and then he placed his fingers at the bottom of the tub and said: Jabir, take it (that waters-skin) and pour water over me, by reciting Bismillah, and I poured water and I said: Bismillah, and found water sprouting out between the fingers of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). Then that tub gushed forth until it was filled up and the Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Jabir, make an announcement to the effect: He who needs water should take that. Jabir said: The people came and got water until they were all satiated. I said: Is there anyone left who wants to get it? And Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) then lifted up his hand from that tub and it was still full. Then the people made a complaint to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) about hunger and he said: May Allah provide you food! We came to the bank of the ocean and the ocean was tossing and it threw out a big animal and we lit fire and cooked it and took it until we had eaten to our heart&#8217;s content. Jabir said: I and such and such five persons entered Its socket and nobody could see us until we had come out, and we took hold of one of its ribs and twisted it into a sort of arch, then we called the tallest of the persons of the army and the hugest of the camels of the army and it had the big saddle over it, and it could easily pass through it without the rider having need to bend down.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bara&#8217; b. &#8216;Azib reported that Abu Bakr Siddlq came to the residence of my father (&#8216;Azib) and bought a haudaj from him and said to &#8216;Azib: Send your son to my residence (to carry this haudaj), and my father said to me: Carry it (for him). So I carried it and there went along with him (with Abu Bakr) my father in order to fetch its price and he (&#8216;Azib) said to Abu Bakr: Abu Bakr, narrate to me what you both did on the night when you set out on a journey along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). He said: We set out during the night and went on walking until it was noon, and the path was vacant and so none passed by that (until) there appeared prominently before us a large rock. It had its shade and the rays of the sun did not reach that place. So we got down at that place. I then went to the rock and levelled the ground with my hands at the place where the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) would take rest under its shade. I then set the bedding and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, go to sleep and I shall keep a watch around you. I went out and watched around him. There we saw a shepherd moving towards that rock with his flock and he intended what we intended (i. e. taking rest). I met him and said to him: Young boy, to which place do you belong? He said: I am a person from Medina. I said, is there any milk in the udders of your sheep and goats? He said: Yes. He took hold of a goat, and I said to him: Clean the udder well so that it should be free from hair, dust and impurity. I saw al-Bara&#8217; striking his hand upon the other (to give an indication) how he did that. He milked the goat for me in a wooden cup which he had with him and I had with me a bucket in which I kept water for drinking and for performing ablution. I came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and did not like to awaken him from sleep but he was accidentally startled from the sleep. I poured water upon the milk (till It was cold) and I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, take this milk. He then took It and I was delighted and he (the Holy Prophet) said: Is now not the time to march on? I said: Of course. So he marched on after the sun had passed the meridian and Suraqa b. Malik pursued us and we had been walking on soft, level ground. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, we are about to be overtaken by them. Thereupon he said: Be not grieved. Verily, Allah is with us. Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) cursed him and his horse sank into the earth. I think he also said: I know you have hurled curse upon me. So supplicate Allah for me and I take an oath that I shall turn everyone away who would come in search of you. So he (Allah&#8217;s Messenger) supplicated Allah and he was rescued and he came back and to everyone he met, he said: I have combed all this side. In short, he diverted everyone whom he met and he in fact fulfilled his promise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bara&#8217; reported: Abu Bakr purchased a saddle from me for thirteen dirhams; the rest of the hadith is the same, and in the narration of Uthman b. &#8216;Umar, the words are: He (Suraqa b. Malik) drew near Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), and he (the Holy Prophet) cursed him and his camel sank in the earth up to the belly and he jumped from that and said: Muhammad, I am fully aware of It that it is your doing. Supplicate Allah that He should rescue me from it in which I am (pitchforked) and I give you a solemn pledge that I shall keep this as a secret from all those who are coming after me. Take hold of an arrow out of it (quiver) for you will find my camels and my slaves at such and such place and you can get whatever you need (on showing this arrow). He (the Holy Prophet) said: I don&#8217;t need your camels. And we (the Holy Prophet and Abu Bakr) came to Medina during the night and the people began to contend as to where Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) should reside and he encamped in the tribe of Najjar who were related to &#8216;Abd ul-Muttalib from the side of mother. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) honoured them, then people climbed upon house-top and women also and boys scattered in the way, and they were all crying: Muhammad, Messenger of Allah, Muhammad, Messenger of Allah.</p>

She said: The wording of Allah&#8221; what is recited to you&#8221; in the Book means the first verse, i. e.&#8221; if you fear that you may not be able to observe equity in case of an orphan woman, marry what you like in case of woman&#8221; (iv. 3). &#8216;A&#8217;isha said: (And as for this verse [iv. 126], i. e. and you intend&#8221; to marry one of them from amongst the orphan girls&#8221; it pertains to one who is in charge (of orphans) having small amount of wealth and less beauty and they have been forbidden that they should marry what they like of her wealth and beauty out of the orphan girls, but with equity, because of their disliking for them.</p>

Khattab delivering sermon on the pulpit ol Allah&#8217;s messenger (may peace be upon him) and saying&#8217;: Now, coming to the point, O people, there was revealed (the command pertaining to the prohibition of wine) and it was prepared (at that time) out of five things: grape, date, honey, wheat, barley, and wine is that which clouds the intellect, and, O people, I wish Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had explained to us in greater detail three things: the inheritance of the grandfather, of one who dies without leaving any issue, and some of the problems of interest.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="center"><em>The Book of Destiny (Kitab-ul-Qadr) </em></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whether the fate of man is predestined or he himself is the architect of it, is a question which has been very often discussed by scholars of all times. This problem is significantly important as no sensible man. not even the man in the street, can afford to ignore it. Faith in Taqdir (Destiny) has a very deep impact upon our lives and we always find our lives oscillating between determinism and freewill. As a man looks around himself and looks to his own self and within himself, he finds that there are hundred and one things in shaping and reshaping of which he has no hand, e. g. in determining the climate of the land in which he is born, in canalising the courses of rivers which flow therein and in determining the nature of the soil thereof. He finds himself absolutely powerless. As he looks to himself he finds that there are so many things In him which are beyond his control, viz. the measure of intellect he has been endowed with, the shape and form of his physical structure with which he has been sent to this world, and the inclinations and so many other qualities of head and heart which are embedded in his very nature. In all these aspects of life he finds himself helpless before the Great and Mighty Power that created him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, there are so many things in which man finds himself quite empowered. As he looks to the marvellous achievements of man despite all odds, he finds it difficult to believe that he is a mere puppet in the mighty hand of Nature. This problem of predestination and freewill, in which man finds his life hanging, has been adequately solved by the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah. We give below a brief summary of their elucidations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first principle which Islam lays down in regard to Taqdir is that man is neither completely the master of his fate nor is he bound to the blind law of predestination. So far as the sovereignty of Allah&#8217;s Will is concerned, it is all-pervading and nothing falls outside its orbit. Not even a leaf, therefore, stirs without His Will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is His Will that prevails everywhere. To God belongs the sovereignty of Heavens and the Earth. He created what He pleaseth, giving to whom He pleaseth females and to whom He pleaseth males or conjoining them males and females, and He maketh whom He pleaseth barren, verify He hath knowledge and power (xlii. 48).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Men are, therefore, completely subordinate to the overruling power of God, they cannot do anything unless God wills so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; Whom God guideth he is the rightly-guided. Whom he sendeth stray, thou wilt not find a patron to set him right (xviii. 16).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His mighty grasp is, therefore, over everything. The Almighty Lord, Who has created everything and has determined its nature and course, has in His infinite wisdom and mercy conferred upon man a limited autonomy according to which a man is free to do or not to do a certain thing. It is because of this autonomy enjoyed by man that he is hold accountable for his deeds. The concept of human responsibility and that of his answerability for his deeds and misdeeds becomes meaningless if he is supposed to be deprived of this autonomy. There are, a large number of verses in the Holy Qur&#8217;an which make a pointed reference to the autonomy conferred upon man.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Man shall have nothing but that what he strives for (liii. 39).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah does not change the condition of a people until they change it themselves (viii. 53; xiii. 11).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who strive in His path, are guided in the right path, while those who persist in denial and sinful livifig have their hearts sealed against faith (ii. 7, 26; iv. 155; v;. i. 102).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah does not compel belief and leaves the people free to believe or disbelieve (vi. 35, 150; xvi-. 9).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever has done an atorn&#8217;s weight of good shall meet with its reward and whoever has done an atom&#8217;s weight of evil shall meet with its consequences (xcix. 7-8).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It should be borne in mind in this connection that the word Taqdir used in the Qur&#8217;an does not always signify something predestined. It at times implies a measure or the latent potentialities or possibilities with which Allali created man and all things of Nature. For example: He created everything for its Destiny (or its Measure) (xxv. 2). In Sura 54, verse 9 (the words are): We created everything according to a Measure or Destiny. In both these verses Destiny impiies the inward reach of things, their latent potentialities or possibilities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The idea of Destiny as we find in the hadith that God wrote down the decrees regarding the created world fifty thousand years before He created the Heavens and the Earth does not in any way mean that God created a block Universe, finished off and complete, bound to the iron formulae of Nature. Here the idea behind Taqdir is that the creation of this universe is not accidental but something preplanned and pre-conceived and it was shaped according to the Grand Design of the Greatest Designer. There is no element of chance in the creation of this Universe. Everything is well-set and well-planned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The idea that Allah has a foreknowledge of everything that He created and the events unfold themselves exactly according to it, does not imply that human beings have been completely deprived of the freedom of action. The foreknowledge of God is an acknowledged fact, but it should not be interpreter in the sense of predestination, for if we do so we shall have to conceive of eternity as a storehouse of ready-made events, from which they drop one by one like particles of sand in a glass hour. If we take the foreknowledge to be a reflecting mirror we shall have to deprive the Creator and the Controller of the Universe of His Creative activity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dr Muhammad Iqbal has shed a good deal of light over this problem. He says:&#8221; Divine knowledge must be conceived as a living creative activity to which the objects that appear to exist in their own right are organically related. By conceiving God&#8217;s knowledge as a kind of reflecting mirror, we no doubt save His fore-knowledge of future events, but it is obvious that we do so at the expense of His freedom. The future certainly pre-exists in the organic whole of God&#8217;s creative life, but it pre-exists as an open possibility, not as a fixed order of events with definite outlines.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We should bear in mind that the idea of put, present and future is something relative and is conceived by the inite wind of man. It is. however, a great now in the eye of the All-Seeing God. The whole expanse of eternity lies before Him in the shape of now. Knowledge is, therefore, an act of creative activity and not the mere reflection of it. When He decrees a thing it happens and He knows it before it happens. God in Islam is not, therefore, a prisoner of necenity. He is a free Creator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The concept of predestination in Islam, therefore, does not in any way mean helpless abandonment of oneself to otherwise unwelcome fate. It means rather co-operation with God, studying His will and bringing oneself into unison with His Planning Will. Destiny as conceived by Islam is, thus, by no stretch of imagination, fatal to the freedom of conduct and unfoldment of one&#8217;s inherent possibilities; it is a source of inspiration and encouragement and opens up vast fields of human activity. It is not a message of despondency and despair, but a source of solace, comfort and inspiration and a powerful means of evoking a sense of piety and humility and self-surrender to the Will of God. It does not inculcate in mind frustration and pessimism, making his life dark and dreary, devoid of hope and promise for the future, but it teaches him to put his heart and soul in the sublime work as assigned to him by his Master.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullah (b. Mas&#8217;ud) reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) who is the most truthful (of the human beings) and his being truthful (is a fact) said: Verily your creation is on this wise. The constituents of one of you are collected for forty days in his mother&#8217;s womb in the form of blood, after which it becomes a clot of blood in another period of forty days. Then it becomes a lump of flesh and forty days later Allah sends His angel to it with instructions concerning four things, so the angel writes down his livelihood, his death, his deeds, his fortune and misfortune. By Him, besides Whom there is no god, that one amongst you acts like the people deserving Paradise until between him and Paradise there remains but the distance of a cubit, when suddenly the writing of destiny overcomes him and he begins to act like the denizens of Hell and thus enters Hell, and another one acts in the way of the denizens of Hell, until there remains between him and Hell a distance of a cubit that the writing of destiny overcomes him and then he begins to act like the people of Paradise and enters Paradise.</p>

And both these things would be written. Then the angel says: My Lord, would he be male or female? And both these things are written. And his deeds and actions, his death, his livelihood; these are also recorded. Then his document of destiny is rolled and there is no, addition to and subtraction from it.</p>

Thereupon the person said to him: You are surprised at this, whereas I have heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saving: When forty nights pass after the semen gets into the womb, Allah sends the angel and gives him the shape. Then he creates his sense of hearing, sense of sight, his skin, his flesh, his bones, and then says: My Lord, would he be male or female? And your Lord decides as He desires and the angel then puts down that also and then says: My Lord, what about his age? And your Lord decides as He likes it and the angel puts it down. Then he says: My Lord, what about his livelihood? And then the Lord decides as He likes and the angel writes it down, and then the angel gets out with his scroll of destiny in his hand and nothing is added to it and nothing is subtracted from it.</p>

I said: Of course, it is something which is predetermined for them and preordained for them. He (further) said: Then, would it not be an injustice (to punish them)? I felt greatly disturbed because of that, and said: Everything is created by Allah and lies in His Power. He would not be questioned as to what He does, but they would be questioned; thereupon he said to me: May Allah have mercy upon you, I did not mean to ask you but for testing your intelligence. Two men of the tribe of Muzaina came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, what is your opinion that the people do in the world and strive for, is something decreed for them; something preordained for them and will their fate in the Hereafter be determined by the fact that their Prophets brought them teachings which they did not act upon. and thus they became deserving of punishment? Thereupon, he said: Of course, it happens as it is decreed by Destiny and preordained for them, and this view is confirmed by this verse of the Book of Allah, the Exalted and Glorious:&#8221; Consider the soul and Him Who made it perfect, then breathed into it its sin and its piety&#8221; (xci. 8).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Umar reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may    peace be upon him) said: Three persons set out on a journey. They were overtaken by rain    and they had to find protection in a mountain cave where at its mouth there fell a rock of    that mountain and thus blocked them altogether. One of them said to the others: Look to    your good deeds that you performed for the sake of Allah and then supplicate Allah, the    Exalted, that He might rescue you (from this trouble). One of them said: 0 Allah, I had my    parents who were old and my wife and my small children also. I tended the flock and when I    came back to them in the evening, I milked them (the sheep, goats, cows, etc.) and first    served that milk to my parents. One day I was obliged to go out to a distant place in    search of fodder and I could not come back before evening and found them (the parents)    asleep. I milked the animals as I used to milk and brought milk to them and stood by their    heads avoiding to disturb them from sleep and I did not deem it advisable to serve milk to    my children before serving them. My children wept near my feet. I remained there in that    very state and my parents too until it was morning. And (0 Allah) if Thou art aware that I    did this in order to seek Thine pleasure, grant us riddance from this trouble. (The rock    slipped a bit) that they could see the sky. The second one said: 0 Allah, I had a female    cousin whom I loved more than the men love the women. I wanted to have sexual intercourse    with her; she refused but on the condition of getting one hundred dinirs. It was with very    great difficulty that I could collect one hundred dinirs and then paid them to her and    when I was going to have a sexual intercourse with her, that she said: Servant of Allah,    fear Allah and do not break the seal (of chastity) but by lawful means. I got up. 0 Allah,    if Thou art aware that I did this in order to seek Thine pleasure, rid us from this    trouble. The situation was somewhat eased for them. The third one said: Allah, I employed    a workman for a measure of rice. After he had finished his work I gave him his dues (in    the form of) a measure of rice, but he did not accept them. I used these rice as seeds,    and that gave a bumper crop and I became rich enough to have cows and flocks (in my    possession). He came to me and said: Fear Allah, and commit no crueltv upon me in regard    to my dues. I said to him: Takeaway this flock of cows and sheep. He said: Fear Allah and    do not make a fun of me. I said: I am not making a fun of you. You take the cows and the    flocks. So he took them. 0 Allah, if Thou art aware that I did it for Thine pleasure, case    the situation for us. And Allah relieved them from the rest of the trouble.</font></p>

The rest of the hadith is the same and    the additional words are:&#8221; A person amongst them said: 0 Allah, I had my aged parents    and I served them milk before I (served that) to my wife, children and my servants.&#8221;    And in case of the second one, the words are:&#8221; She avoided me until she was hard    pressed because of famine and she came to me and I gave her one hundred and twenty    diiiirs&#8221; And in cease of the third one (the words are):&#8221; I invested his wages,    and it brought profit and, as a result thereof, the merchandise increased and there was    abundance of goods.&#8221; And he (the narrator said) that they got out of the cave and    began to walk.</font></p>

When he draws near Me by the span of his hand. I draw near him by the length of a cubit and when he draws near Me by the length of a cubit. I draw near him by the length of a fathom and when he draws near Me walking I draw close to him hurriedly.</p>

He heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Allah is more pleased with the repentance of His believing servant than a person who loses his riding beast carrying food and drink. He sleeps (being disappointed of its recovery) and then gets up and goes in search for that, until he is stricken with thirst. then comes back to the place where he had been before and goes to sleep completely exhausted placing his head upon his hands waiting for death. And when he gets up, lot there is before him his riding beast and his provisions of food and drink. Allah is more pleased with the repentance of His servant than the recovery of this riding beast along with the provisions (of food and drink).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Nu&#8217;man b. Bashir reported: Allah is more pleased with the repentance of a believing servant than of a person who set out on a journey with a provision of food and drink on the back of his camel. He went on until he came to a waterless desert and he felt like sleeping. So he got down under the shade of a tree and was overcome by sleep and his camel ran away. As he got up he tried to see (the camel) standing upon a mound. but did not find it. He then got upon the other mound, but could not see anything. He then climbed upon the third mound but did not see anything until he came back to the place where he had been previously. And as he was sitting (in utter disappointment) there came to him the camel, till that (camel) placed its nosestring in his hand. Allah is more pleased with the repentance of His servant than the person who found (his lost camel) in this very state. Simak reported that Sha&#8217;bi was of the opinion that Nu&#8217;min traced it to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him). Simak, however, did not hear that himself.</p>

He (in response to the question of the Holy Prophet) said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, he would feel highly delighted. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said. By Allah, Allah is more delighted at the repentance of His servant than that person (as he finds his lost) camel.</p>

Thereupon he said: I say that when we are in the company of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) we ponder over Hell-Fire and Paradise as if we are seeing them with our very eyes and when we are away from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) we attend to our wives, our children, our business; most of these things (pertaining to After-life) slip out of our minds. Abu Bakr said: By Allah, I also experience the same.

I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, when we are in your company, we are reminded of Hell-Fire and Paradise as if we are seeing them with our own eyes, but whenever we go away from you and attend to our wives, children and business, much of these things go out of our minds. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: By Him in Whose Hand is my life, if your state of mind remains the same as it is in my presence and you are always busy in remembrance (of Allah), the Angels will shake hands with you in your beds and in your paths but, Hanzala, time should be devoted (to the worldly affairs) and time (should be devoted to prayer and meditation).

Then I came to my house and began to laugh with my children and sport with my wife. (Hanzala) further reported: I went out and met Abu Bakr and made a mention of that to him.

He was directed to a monk. He came to him and told him that he had killed ninety-nine persons and asked him whether there was any scope for his repentance to be accepted. He said: No. He killed him also and thus completed one hundred. He then asked about the learned persons of the earth and he was directed to a scholar, and he told him that he had killed one hundred persons and asked him whether there was any scope for his repentance to be accepted. He said: Yes; what stands between you and the repentance? You better go to such and such land; there are people devoted to prayer and worship and you also worship along with them and do not come to the land of yours since it was an evil land (for you). So he went away and he had hardly covered half the distance when death came to him and there was a dispute between the angels of mercy and the angels of punishment. The angels of mercy said: This man has come as a penitant and remorseful to Allah and the angels of punishment said: He has done no good at all. Then there came another angel in the form of a human being in order to decide between them. He said: You measure the land to which he has drawn near. They measured it and found him nearer to the land where he intended to go (the land of piety), and so the angels of mercy took possession of it. Qatada said that Hasan told him that it was said to them that as death approached him, he crawled upon his chest (and managed) to slip in the land of mercy.</p>

He killed the monk also and then began to make an inquiry and moved from one village to another village where there lived pious persons, and as he had covered some distance, he was overtaken by death, but he managed to crawl upon his chest (to the side nearer to the place where the pious men lived). He died and then there was a dispute between the angels of mercy and the angels of punishment and (when it was measured) he was found to be nearer to the village where pious persons were living equal to the Space of a span and he was thus included among them.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Shihab reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) made an expedition to Tabuk and he (the Holy Prophet) had in his mind (the idea of threatening the) Christians of Arabia in Syria and those of Rome. Ibn Shihab (further) reported that &#8216;Abd al-Rahman b. &#8216;Abdullah b. Ka&#8217;b informed him that Abdullah b. Ka&#8217;b who served as the guide of Ka&#8217;b b. &#8216;Malik as he became blind that he heard Ka&#8217;b b. Malik narrate the story of his remaining behind Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) from the Battle of Tabuk. Ka&#8217;b b. Malik said: I never remained behind Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) from any expedition which he undertook except the Battle of Tabuk and that of the Battle of Badr. So far as the Battle of Badr is concerned, nobody was blamed for remaining behind as Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and the Muslims (did not set out for attack but for waylaying) the caravan of the Quraish, but it was Allah Who made them confront their enemies without their intention (to do so). I had the honour to be with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) on the night of &#8216;Aqaba when we pledged our allegiance to Islam and it was more dear to me than my participation in the Battle of Badr, although Badr was more popular amongst people as compared with that (Tabuk). And this is my story of remaining back from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) on the occasion of the Battle of Tabuk. Never did I possess means enough and (my circumstances) more favourable than at the occasion of this expedition. And, by Allah, I had never before this expedition simultaneously in my possession two rides. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) set out for this expedition in extremely hot season; the journey was long and the land (which he and his army had to cover) was waterless and he had to confront a large army, so he informed the Muslims about the actual situation (they had to face), so that they should adequately equip themselves for this expedition, and he also told them the destination where he intended to go. And the Muslims who accompanied Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) at that time were large in numbers but there was no proper record of them. Ka&#8217;b (further) said: Few were the persons who wanted to absent themselves, and were under the impression that they could easily conceal themselves (and thus remain undetected) until revelations from Allah, the Exalted and Glorious (descended in connection with them).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) set out on an expedition when the fruits were ripe and their shadows had been lengthened. I had weakness for them and it was during this season that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) made preparations and the Muslims too along with them. I also set out in the morning so that I should make preparations along with them but I came back and did nothing and said to myself: I have means enough (to make preparations) as soon as I like. And I went on doing this (postponing my preparations) until people were about to depart and it was in the morning that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) set out and the Muslims too along with him, but I made no preparations. I went early in the morning and came back, but I made no decision. I continued to do so until they (the Muslims) hastened and covered a good deal of distance. I also made up my mind to march on and to meet them. Would that I had done that but perhaps it was not destined for me. After the departure of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as I went out amongst people, I was shocked to find that I did not find anyone like me but people who were labelled as hypocrites or the people whom Allah granted exemption because of their incapacity and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) took no notice of me until he had reached Tabuk. (One day as he was sitting amongst the people in Tabuk) he said: What has happened to Ka&#8217;b b. Malik? A person from Banu&#8217; Salama said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, the (beauty) of his cloak and his appreciation of his sides have allured him and he was thus detained. Mua&#8217;dh b. Jabal said: Woe be upon that what you contend. Allah&#8217;s Messenger, by Allah, we know nothing about him but good. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), however, kept quiet. It was during that time that he (the Holy Prophet) saw a person (dressed in all white (garment) shattering the illusion of eye (mirage).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: May he be Abu Khaithama and, lo, it was Abu Khaithama al-Ansari and he was that person who contributed a sa&#8217; of dates and was scoffed at by the hypocrites. Ka&#8217;b b. Malik farther said: When this news reached me that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was on his way back from Tabuk I was greatly perturbed. I thought of fabricating false stories and asked myself how I would save myself from his anger on the following day. In this connection, I sought the help of every prudent man from amongst the members of my family and when it was said to me that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was about to arrive, all the false ideas banished (from my mind) and I came to the conclusion that nothing could save me but the telling of truth, so I decided to speak the truth and it was in the morning that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) arrived (in Medina). And it was his habit that as he came back from a journey he first went to the mosque and observed two Rak&#8217;ahs of nafl prayer (as a mark of gratitude) and then sat amongst people. And as he did that, those who had remained behind him began to put forward their excuses and take an oath before him and they were more than eighty persons. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) accepted their excuses on the very face of them and accepted their allegiance and sought forgiveness for them and left their secret (intentions) to Allah, until I presented myself to him. I greeted him and he smiled and there was a tinge of anger in that. He (the Holy Prophet) then said to me: Come forward. I went forward until I sat in front of him. He said to me: What kept you back? Could you not afford to go in for a ride? I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, by Allah, if I were to sit in the presence of anybody else from amongst the worldly people I would have definitely saved myself from his anger on one pretext (or the other) and I have also the knack to fall into argumentation, but, by Allah, I am fully aware of the fact that if I were to put forward before you a false excuse to please you Allah would definitely provoke your wrath upon me, and if I speak the truth you may be annoyed with me, but I hope that Allah would make its end well and, by Allah, there is no valid excuse for me. By Allah, I never possessed so good means, and I never had such favourable conditions for me as I had when I stayed behind you (failed to join the expedition).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereupon, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: This man told the truth, so get up until Allah gives a decision in your case. I stood up and some people of Banu&#8217; Salama followed me in hot haste, and they said to me: By Allah, we do not know about you that you committed a sin prior to this. You, however, showed inability to put forward an excuse before Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as those who stayed behind him have put forward excuses. It would have been enough for the forgiveness of your sin that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) would have sought forgiveness for you. By Allah, they continued to incite me until I thought of going back to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and contradict myself. Then I said to them: Has anyone else also met the same fate? They said: Yes, two persons have met the same fate as has fallen to you and they have made the sane statement as you have made, and the same verdict has been delivered in their case as it has been delivered in your case. I said: Who are they? They said: Murara b. ar-Rabi&#8217;a &#8216;Amiri and Hilal b. Umayya al-Waqafi. They made a mention of these two pious persons to me who had participated in the Battle of Badr and there was an example for me in them. I went away when they named these two persons. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) forbade the Nluslims to talk with three of us from amongst those (persons) who had stayed behind him. The people began to avoid us and their attitude towards us underwent a change and it seemed as if the whole atmosphere had turned (hostile) against us and it was in fact the same atmosphere ot which I was fully aware and in which I had lived (for a fairly long time). We spent fifty nights in this very state and my two friends confined themselves withen their houses and spent (most of the) time in weeping, but as I was young and strong amongst them I got (out of my house), participated in congregational prayers, moved about in the bazar; but none spoke to me. I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as he sat amongst (people) after the prayer, greeted him and asked myself whether his lips stirred in response to my greetings (or not).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I observed prayer beside him and looked at him with stealing glances and when I attended to my prayer, he looked at me and when I cast a glance at him he turned away his eyes from me. And when the harsh treatment of the Muslims towards me extended to a (considerable) length of time, I walked until I climbed upon the wall of the garden of Abu Qatada, and he was my cousin, and I had the greatest love for him. I greeted him but, by Allah, he did not respond to my greetings. I said to him: Abu Qatada, I adjure you by Allah, arn&#8217;t you well aware of the fact that I love Allah and His Messenger (may peace be upon him) the most. He kept quiet. I again repeated saying: I adjure you by Allah. arn&#8217;t you well aware of the fact that I love Allah and His Messenger (may peace be upon him) the most. He kept quiet. I again adjured him, whereupon he said: Allah and the Messenger (may peace be upon him) are best aware of it. My eyes began to shed tears and I came back climbing down from the wall and as I was walking in the bazar of Medina a Nabatean from amongst the Nabateans of Syria, who had come to sell foodgrains in Medina, asked people to direct him to Ka&#8217;b b. Malik. People gave him the indication by pointing towards me. He came to me and delivered to me a letter of the King of Ghassan and as I was a scribe I read that letter and it was written like this:&#8221; Coming to my point, it has been conveyed to us that your friend (the Holy Prophet) is subjecting you to cruelty and Allah has not created you for a place where you are to be degraded and where you cannot find your right place, so you come to us that we should accord you honour. As I read that letter I said: This is also a calamity, so I burnt it in the oven. When out of the fifty days, forty days had passed and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) received no revelation, there came the messenger of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) to me and said: Verily, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has commanded you to remain separate from your wife. I said: Should I divorce her or what (else) should I do? He said: No, but only remain separate from her and don&#8217;t have sexual contact with her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same message was sent to my companions. So I said to my wife: You better go to your parents and stay there with them until Allah gives the decision in my case. The wife of Hilal b. Umayya came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, Hilal b. Umayya is a senile person, he has no servant. Do you disapprove of my serving him? He said: No, but don&#8217;t go near him. She said: By Allah, he has no such instinct in him. By Allah, he spends his time in weeping from that day to this day. Some of the members of my family said to me: Were you to seek permission from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) in regard to your wife as he has granted permission to the wife of Hilal b. Umayya to serve him. I said: I would not seek permission from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), for I cannot say what Allah&#8217;s Apostle may say in response to seeking my permission. Moreover, I am a young man. It was in this state that I spent ten more nights and thus fifty nights had passed that (people) had observed boycott with us. It was on the morning of the fiftieth night that I observed my dawn prayer and was sitting on one of the roofs of our houses. And I was in fact sitting in that very state which Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, has described about us in these words:&#8221; Life had become hard for myself and the earth had compressed despite its vastness,&#8221; that I heard the noise of an announcer from the peak of the hill of Sal&#8217; saying at the top of his voice: Ka&#8217;b b. Malik, there is glad tidings for you. I fell down in prostration and came to realise that there was (a message of) relief for me. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had informed the people of the acceptance of our repentance by Allah as he offered the dawn prayer. So the people went on to give us glad tidings and some of them went to my friends in order to give them the glad tidings and a person galloped his horse and came from the tribe of Aslam and his horse reached me more quickly than his voice. And when he came to me whose sound I heard, he gave me the glad tidings. I took off my clothes and clothed him with them because of his bringing good news to me and, by Allah, I possessed nothing else (in the form of clothes) than these two on that occasion, and I asked one to lend me two clothes and dressed myself in them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and on my way I met groups of people who greeted me because of (the acceptance of) repentance and they said: Here is a greeting for you for your repentance being accepted by Allah. (I moved on) until I came to the mosque and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had been sitting there amongst persons. So Talha b. &#8216;Ubaidullah got up and rushed towards me and he shook hands with me and greeted me and, by Allah, no person stood up (to greet me) from amongst the emigrants except he. Ka&#8217;b said that he never forgot (this good gesture of) Talha. Ka&#8217;b further said: I greeted Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) with Assalam-o-&#8216;Alaikam and his face was glistening because of delight, and he said: Let there be glad tidings and blessings for you, the like of which (you have neither found nor you will find, as you find today) since your mother gave your birth. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger. is this acceptance of repentance from you or from Allah? He said: No, (it is not from ma), it is from Allah, and it was common with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) that as he was happy his face brightened up and it looked like a part of the moon and it was from this that we recognised it (his delight). As I sat before him, I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, am I allowed to give in charity my wealth for Allah&#8217;s sake and for the sake of His Messenger (may peace be upon him)? Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Keep some property with you as it is better for you. I said: I shall keep with me that part (of my property) which fell to my lot (on the occasion of the expedition of) Khaibar. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, verily, Allah has granted me salvation because of truth and, therefore, (I think) that repentance implies that I should not speak anything but truth as long as I live. He said: By Allah, I do not know whether anyone amongst the Muslims was put to more severe trial than I by Allah because of telling the truth. And since I made a mention of this to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) up to this day I have not told any lie and, by Allah, I have decided not to tell a lie and I hope that Allah would save me (from trials) for the rest of my life and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed these verses:&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Certainly, Allah has turned in Mercy to the Prophet and the emigrants and the helpers who followed him in the hour of hardship after the hearts of a part of them were about to deviate; then He turned to them in mercy. Surely, to them He is Compassionate, Merciful and (He turned in Mercy) to the three who were left behind until the earth despite its vastness became strait for them and their souls were also straitened to them.&#8221; And this revelation reached up to the (words):&#8221; O you who believe, develop God consciousness, and be with the truthful&#8221; (ix. 117-118). Ka&#8217;b said: By Allah, since Allah directed me to Islam there has been no blessing more significant for me than this truth of mine which I spoke to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and if I were to tell a lie I would have been ruined as were ruined those who told lies, for in regard to those who told lies Allah used harshest words used for anyone as He descended revelation (and the words of Allah are):&#8221; They will swear by Allah to you when you return to them so that you may leave them alone. So leave them alone. Surely, they are unclean and their resort is Hell, recompense for what they earned. They will swear to you that you may be pleased with them but if you are pleased with them, yet surely Allah is not pleased with the transgressing people&#8221; (ix. 95-96). K&#8217;ab said that the matter of us three persons was deferred as compared with those who took an oath in the presence of Allahs Messenger (may peace be upon him) and he accepted their allegiance and sought forgiveness for them and Allah did not give any decision in regard to us. It was Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, Who gave decisions in our case, three who remained behind. (The words of the Qur&#8217;an)&#8221; the three who were left behind&#8221; do not mean that we remained back from Jihad but these imply that He kept our matter behind them who took oath and presented excuse before Him. This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Zuhri with the same chain of transmitters.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa&#8217;id b. Musayyib, &#8216;Urwa b. Zubair, &#8216;Alqama b. Waqqas and &#8216;Ubaidullah b. Abdullah b. &#8216;Utba b. Mas&#8217;ud&#8211;all of them reported the story of the false allegation against &#8216;A&#8217;isha, the wife of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him). And they (the slanderers) said what they had to say, but Allah exonerated her of this charge and all of them reported a part of the hadith and some of them who had better memories reported more and with better retention, and I tried to retain this hadith (listening) from every one of them that they reported to me and some of them attested the other. (The sumaried substance of the false allegation is this): &#8216;A&#8217;isha said: Whenever Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) intended to set out on a journey he cast lots amongst his wives and he took one with him in whose favour the lot was cast. It so happened that he cast lots amongst us while setting out on a battle and it was cast in my favour, so I set out along with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). This relates to the period when the revelation concerning the commands of veil had been made. I was carried in a haudaj and I was brought down where we had to stay. In short, when we set out for return journey from the expedition and our caravan was near Medina, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) commanded one night to march forward. I also got up when the command for the march was given and moved on until I went out of the encampments of the army and after relieving myself I came to my place. I touched my chest and found that my necklace which had been made of the stones of zafar had been broken. I retraced my steps and tried to search my necklace and this detained me there. The group of people who saddled my ride and placed my haudaj carrying me upon the camels marched on. They were under the impression that I was in it. The women in those days were light of weight and they did not wear much flesh, as they ate less food; so they did not perceive the weight of my haudaj as they placed it upon the camel as I was a young girl at that time. So they drove the camel and Eet out and I found my necklace after the army had marched. I came to my place and there was none to call and none to respond (the call).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I waited at my place under the impression that when the people would riot find me they would come back. So I kept sitting at my place. I was overpowered by sleep and slept. Safwan b. Mu&#8217;attal Sulami Dhakwini, who had lagged behind the army because of taking rest came to my place walking in the latter part of the night and he saw the body of a person who was asleep. He came to me and recognised me as he had seen rue before it was enjoined to observe purda. I got ap by his voice as he recited Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raji&#8217;un [we are for Allah and to Him we have to return. ] and I covered my head with my headdress. By Allah, he did not speak to me a word and I did not hear a word from him except Inna lillahi. He made his camel kneel down and I amounted the camel as he pressed tLe camel&#8217;s foreleg and he moved on leaning the camel by the nose string on which I was riding until we came to the army where it had encamped for rest because of extreme heat. Woe be upon those who harboured doubts about me and the most notorious among them was &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy, the great hypocrite. We came to Medina and I fell sick for a month. The people had been deliberating over the statements of those who had brought these calumnies against me. I was absolutely unaware of anything concerning that. This, however, caused doubt in my mind that I did not see Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him.) treating me with such kindness with which he treated me as I fell ill before this. The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) would coome and greet me with Assalam-o-&#8216;Alaikum and only ask me how I was. This caused doubt in my mind, but I was unaware of the evil. I wept outside despite my failing health and there went along with me Umm Mistah and she said the daughter of Abu Rhm b. Muttalib b. &#8216;Abd Manaf and his mother was the daughter of Sakhr b. &#8216;Amir, the sister of the mother of Abu Bakr Sidiq and his son was Mistah b. Uthatha b. &#8216;Abbad b. Muttalib. I and the daughter of Abu Rahm set towards the direction of my house. Something got into the head dress of Umm Mistah and she said: Woe be upon Mistah. And I said. Woe be upon what you say. Do you curse people who had participated in Badr? She said: Innocent woman, have you not heard what he said? I said: What did he say? She conveyed to me the statement of those who had brought false allegations against me. So my illness was aggravated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I went to my house and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to me and he greeted me and then said: How is that woman? I said: Do you permit me to go to the (house) of my parents? She (further) said: I had at that time made up my mind to confirm this news from them. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) permitted me. So I came to (the house of) my parents and said to my mother: Mother, do you know what the people are talking about? She said: My daughter, you should not worry. By Allah, if there is a handsome woman who is loved by her husband and he has co-wives also they talk many a thing about her. I said: Hallowed be Allah, what are the people talking about? I wept during the whole night until it was morning and I did not have a wink of sleep and I wept even in the morning. As the revelation was delayed (in regard to this matter), so Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) called &#8216;Ali ibn Abi &#8216;Talib and Usama b. Zaid in order to seek their advice in regard to the separation of his wife. Usama b. Zaid told Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be apen him) about the innocence of his wives and what he knew about his love for them. He said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, they are your wives and we know nothing else about thembut goodness. And as for &#8216;Ali b. Abu Talib, he said: Allah has not put any unnecessary burden upon you (in regard to your wives). There are a number of women besides her and if you ask that maidservant (Barira) she will tell you the truth. So, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) called Bailra and said: Barira, did you see anything in &#8216;A&#8217;isha which can cause doubt about her? Barira said: By Him Who sent thee with the truth, I have seen nothing objectionable in her but only this much that she is a young girl and she goes to sleep while kneading the flour and the lamb eats that. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) mounted the pulpit and sought vindication against &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy b. Salul, and he further said: Who would exonerate me from imputations of that person who has troubled (me) in regard to my family? By Allah, I find nothing in my wife but goodness and the person whom the people have mentioned in this connection is, according to my knowledge, a thoroughly pious person, and he did never get into my house but along with me. Sa&#8217;d b. Mu&#8217;adh stood up and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, I defend your honour against him. If he belong to the tribe of Aus we would strike his neck and if he belongs to the tribe of our brother Khazraj and you order us we would comply with your order.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Sa&#8217;d b. &#8216;Ubada stood up. He was chief of the Khazraj tribe. He was otherwise a pioas man but he had some what tribal partisanship in him and he said to Sa&#8217;d b. Mu&#8217;adh: By the everlasting existence of Allah. you are not stating the fact, you will not be able to kill him and you will not have the power to do so. Thereupon, Usaid b. Hudair stood up, and he was the first cousin of Sa&#8217;d b. Mu&#8217;adh and said to Sa&#8217;d b. &#8216;Ubada: By the everlasting existence of Allah, you are not stating the fact. We would kill him. You are a hypocrite and so you argue in defence of the hypocrites, and thus both the tribes Aus and Khazraj were flared up, until they were about to fall upon one another and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) kept standing upon the pulpit and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) tried to subside their anger until they became silent and thus there was silence. &#8216;A&#8217;isha further reported: I spent the whole day in weeping and even the night and could not have a wink of sleep even next night. My parents thought that this constant weeping of mine would break my heart. I wept and they sat beside me. In the meanwhile a woman of the Ansar came to see me. I permitted her to see me and she also began to weep. And we were in this very state that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came and he greeted me and then sat down. He had never sat with me since a month when this rumour was afloat, and there was no revelation (to clarity) my case. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) recited Tashahhud (there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is His Apostle) and then said: Coming to the point, &#8216;A&#8217;isha, this is what has reached me about you and if you are innocent, Allah would Himself vindicate your honour, and if accidentally there has been a lapse on your part sock forgiveness of Allah; He will pardon thee for when a servant makes a confession of his fault and turns (to Him) penitently, Allah also turns to him (mercifully) accepting his repentance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) talked, my tears dried up and not even a single drop of tear was perceived by me (rolling out of my eyes). I said to my father: You give a reply to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) on my behalf. He said: By Allah, I do not know what I should say to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). I then said to my mother: Give a reply to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) on my behalf, but she said: By Allah, I do not know what I should say to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). I was a small girl at that time and I had not read much of the Qur&#8217;an (but I said): By Allah, I perceive that you have heard about this and it has settled down in your mind and you have taken it to be true, so if I say to you that I am quite innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would never believe me to be true, and if I confess to (the alleged) lapse before you, whereas Allah knows that I am completely innocent (and I have not committed this sin at all), in that case You will take me to be true and, by Allah, I, therefore, find no other alternative for me and for you except that what the father of Yousuf said:, (My course is) comely patience. And Allah it is Whose help is to be sought for in that (predicament) which ye describe&#8221; (xii 18). After this I turned my face to the other side and lay down on my bed. By Allah, I was fully aware of this fact that I was innocent but I did not expect that Allah would descend Wahy Matlu (Qur&#8217;anic Wahy) in my case as I did not think myself so much important that Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, would speak in this matter in words to be recited. I only hoped that Allah would in vision give an indication of my innocence to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) during his sleep. And, by Allah, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had not moved an inch from where he had been sitting and none from the members of my family had gone that Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, descended revelation upon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) there and then and he felt the burden which he used to feel at the time of receiving revelation. He began to perspire because of the burden of words of Allah as they descended upon him even during the winter season and there fell the drops of his sweat like silvery beads. When this state of receiving revelation was over, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) smiled and the first words which he spoke to me were that he said: &#8216;A&#8217;isha, there is glad tidings for you. Verily, Allah has vindicated your honour, and my mother who had been standing by me said: Get up (and thank him, i. e. the Holy Prophet). I said: By Allah, I shall not thank him and laud him but Allah Who has descended revelation vindicating my honour. She (&#8216;A&#8217;isha) said: Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed:&#8221; &#8216;Verily, those who spread the slander are a gang among you&#8221; (and) ten (subsequent) verses in regard to my innocence. She further said: Abu Bakr used to give to Mistah (some stipend) as a token of kinship with him and for his poverty and he (Abu Bakr) said: By Allah, now I would not spend anything for him. &#8216;A&#8217;isha said: It was upon this that Allah the Exalted and Glorious revealed this verse:&#8221; And let not those who possess dignity and ease among you swear to give to the near of the kin&#8221; up to&#8221; Yearn ye not that Allah may forgive you?&#8221; Hibban b. Musa&#8217; said that &#8216;Abdullah b. Mubarak used to say: It is a verse contained in the Book which most (eminently) brightens the hope.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr said: By Allah, I wish that Allah should pardon me. I shall never stop this stipend. So he continued to give him the stipend which he had withdrawn. &#8216;A&#8217;isha said that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (way peace be upon him) asked Zainab, daughter of Jahsh, the wife of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him), about me what she knew or what she had seen in me, and she said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, I shall not say anything without hearing (with my ears) and seeing with my eyes. By Allah, I find nothing in her but goodness. (And she stated this in spite of the fact) that she was the only lady who amongst the wives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) used to vie with me but Allah saved her in bringing false allegation against me because of her God-consciousness. Her sister Hamna bint Jahsh, however, opposed her and she was undone along with others.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;A&#8217;Isha reported: When I came under discussion what the people had to say about me, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) stood up for delivering an address and he recited tashahhud (I bear witness to the fact that iheie is no god but Allah) and praised Allah, lauded Him what He rightly deserves and then said: Coming to the point. Give me an advice about them who have brought false charge about my family. By Allah, I know no evil in the members of my family and the person in connection with whom the false charge is being levelled, I know no evil in him too. And he never entered my house but in my presence and when I was away on a journey, he remained with me even in that. The rest of the hadith is the same but with this change that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to my house and asked my maidservant and she said: By Allah, I know no fault in her but this that she sleeps, and goat comes and eats the kneaded flour. Some of the Companions (of the Holy Prophet) scolded her and said: State the fact before Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and they even made a pointed reference (to this incident). She said: gallowed be Allah. By Allah, I know about her as does the jeweller know about the pure piece of gold. And when this news reached the person in connection with whom the allegation was made he said: Hallowed be Allah. By Allah, I have never unveiled any woman. &#8216;A&#8217;isha said: He fell as a martyr in the cause of Allah, and there is this addition in this hadith that the people who had brought false allegation amongst them were Mistah and Hamna and Hassan. And so far as the hypocrite &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy is concerned, he was one who tried his best to gather the false news and then gave them the wind. And he was in fact a fabricator and there was Hamna, daughter of Jahsh with him.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas reported that a person was charged with fornication with the slavegirl of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to &#8216;Ali: Go and strike his neck. &#8216;Ali came to him and he found him in a well making his body cool. &#8216;Ali said to him: Come out, and as he took hold of his hand and brought him out, he found that his sexual organ had been cut. Hadrat &#8216;Ali refrained from striking his neck. He came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, he has not even the sexual organ with him.</p>

It would be a feast arranged in the honour of the people of Paradise. He (the narrator) further narrated that a person from among the Jews came and he said: Abu al-Qasim, may the Compassionate Lord be pleased with you! May I inform you about the feast arranged in honour of the people of Paradise on the Day of Resurrection? He said: Do it, of course. He said: The earth would become one single bread. Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) looked towards us and laughed until his molar teeth became visible.

Thereupon Abdullah got up and said in anger. O people, fear Allah and say only that which one knows amongst you and do not say which he does not know and he should simply say: Allah has the best knowledge for He has the best knowledge amongst all of you. It does not behove him to say that which he does not know. Allah has the best knowledge of it. Verily Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, said to His Prophet (may peace be upon him) to state:&#8221; I do not ask from you any remuneration and I am not the one to put you in trouble,&#8221; and when Allah&#8217;s Mesqenger (may peace be upon him) saw people turning back (from religion) he said: O Allah, afflict thern with seven famines as was done in the case of Yusuf, so they were afflicted with famine by which they were forced to eat everything until they were obliged to eat the hides and the dead bodies because of hunger, and every one of them looked towards the sky and he found a smoke. And Abu Sufyan came and he said: Muhammad, you have come to command us to obey Allah and cement the ties of blood- relation whereas your people are undone; supplicate Allah for tlicm. Thereupon Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, said:&#8221; Wait for the day when there would be clear smoke from the sky which would envelop people and that would be grievous torivent&#8221; up to the words:&#8221; you are going to return to (evil).&#8221; (if this verse implied the torment of the next life) could the chastisement of the next (life) be averted (as the Qur&#8217;an states): On the day when We seize (them) with the most violent seizing; surely We shall exact retribution&#8221; (xliv. 16)?

This reflects the understanding of a person that he should say about that which he does not know that it is Allah who knows best. The fact is that when the Quraish disobeyed Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) he supplicated Allah that they should be afflicted with famine and starvation as was done in case of Yusuf. And they were so much hard pressed that a person would ace the sky and he would see between him and the sky something like smoke and they were so much hard pressed that they began to cat the bones, and a person came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger. seek forgiveness for the tribe of Mudar for (its people) have been undone.

When there was some relief for them they returned to the same position as they had been before, and Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed this verse:&#8221; So wait for the day when the heaven brings a clear smoke enveloping people.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 19: </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="center"><span><em>The Book of Jihad and Expedition (Kitab Al-Jihad wa&#8217;l-Siyar) </em></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The word Jihad is derived from the verb jahada which means:&#8221; he exerted himself&#8221;. Thus literally, Jihad means exertion, striving; but in juridico-religious sense, it signifies the exertion of one&#8217;s power to the utmost of one&#8217;s capacity in the cause of Allah. This is why the word Jihad has been used as the antonym to the word Qu, ud (sitting) in the Holy Qur&#8217;an (iv. 95). Thus Jihad in Islam is not an act of violence directed indiscriminately against the non-Muslims; it is the name given to an all-round struggle which a Muslim should launch against evil in whatever form or shape it appears. Qital fi sabilillah (fighting in the way of Allah) is only one aspect of Jihad. Even this qital in Islam is not an act of mad brutality. It has its material and moral functions, i. e. self-preservation and the preservation of the moral order in the world. The verdict of all religious and ethical philosophies-ancient and modern-justify war on moral grounds. When one nation is assailted by the ambitions and cupidity of another, the doctrine of non-resistance is anti-social, as it involves non-assertion, not only of one&#8217;s own rights, but of those of others who need protection against the forces of tyranny and oppression. A Muslim is saddled with the responsibilities to protect himself and all those who seek his protection. He cannot afford to abandon the defenceless people, old man, women and children to privation, suffering and moral peril. Fighting in Islam, therefore, represents in Islamic Law what is known among Western jurists as&#8221; just war&#8221;. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The very first revelation in which the permission to wage war against the forces of evil sums up the aims and objects of qital in Islam: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8221; Permitted&#8217;are those who are fought against, because they have been oppressed. and verily God is more Powerful for their aid. Those who have been driven from their homes unjustly only because they said: &#8216;Our Lord is Allah, &#8216; for had it not been for &#8216;Allah&#8217;s repelling someone by means of others, cloisters and churches and mosques, wherein the name of Allah is oft-mentioned, would assuredly have been pulled down. Verily Allah helps one who helps Him. Lo! Allah is Strong. Almighty&#8221; (xxii. 39. 41). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>These verses eloquently speak of &#8216;the fact that it is neither for the acquisition of territory nor for the love of power and distinction that the Muslims have been permitted to raise arms against the enemy. They were allowed to do so because their very existence had been made difficult by the high-handedness of the Meccans. The Holy Qur&#8217;an has elucidated this point in the following verse: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8221; And what reason have you not to fight in the way of Allah and for the oppressed among men and women and children who say: Our Lord! take us forth from the town whereof the people are oppressors and grant us from Thee a friend and grant us from Thee a helper&#8221; (iv. 75). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The war in Islam is waged with a view to securing liberty and freedom for those who are groaning under the oppression of heartless tyrants. It is the bounden duty of the Muslims to alleviate their sufferings and create for them an atmosphere of peace and security. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Then in the succeeding verse a distinction is also drawn between two types of war: one which is fought for the sake of Allah and the other which is waged for evil ends: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8221; Those who believe fight in the way of Allah and those who disbelieve fight in the way of devil. So fight against the friends of Satan; verily weak indeed is the strategy of the devil&#8221; (iv. 76). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been made clear that those people who fight for self-glorification or for the exploitation of the weak are in fact friends of the devil; wheres those who raise arms to curb tyranny and aggression, to eradicate evil from the human society, fight in the way of Allah. Mere fighting is not, therefore, Jihad in Islam; it is the noble objective alone which makes it a sacred pursuit like devotion and prayer. It is narrated on the authority of Abu Musa Ash&#8217;ari that once a man went to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) and said: One man fights for the sake of spoils of war, the second one fights for fame and glory and the third to display his courage and skill; which among them is the fighter for the cause of Allah? Upon this the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) replied: He who fights with the sole objective that the word of Allah should become supreme is a Mujahid in the cause of the Lord. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>A Mujahid is thus a noble person who offers his life for the achievement of lofty ends. He is actuated by human considerations lifts arms not under the impulse of fury and revenge, but with will, fore-thought, tenacity and fellow-feeling, and his conduct bears the imprint of human intellect, human sympathy and sense of justice. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The Holy Qur&#8217;an has explained this point in Sura Anfal in these words: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8221; O you who believe, when you meet an enemy, be firm, and remember Allah much, that you may be successful. And obey Allah and His Apostle. And fall with no disputes, lest ye falter and your strength fail; but be steadfast! For Allah is with those who patiently persevere. Be not as those who came forth from their dwellings boastfully. And to be seen of men and debar (men) from the way of Allah. And Allah encompasses what they do&#8221; (viii. 45-46). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Here the Muslims have been exhorted to observe five principles of war: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Be steadfast in the face of the enemy. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Have full reliance on the help of Allah and remember Him much. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Have the unity of purpose and solidarity of corporate life always before your eyes. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Be fully aware of the lofty purpose before you in fighting. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Don&#8217;t be proud and boastful in your attitude and behaviour. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Islam has purified even war of all its cruelty and horrors and has made it a&#8221; reformative process&#8221; to deal with evil. The Holy Qur&#8217;an bserves: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8221; And fight in the way of Allah against those who fight against you and transgress not the limits. Verily Allah loves not the transgressors&#8221; (ii. 190). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) has given clear instructions about the behaviour of the Muslim army. He observed: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8221; Set out for Jihad in the name of Allah and for the sake of Allah. Do not lay hands on the old verging on death, on women, children and babes. Do not steal anything from the booty and collect together all that falls to your lot in the battlefield and do good, for Allah loves the virtuous and the pious.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>So great is the respect for humanly feelings in Islam that even the wanton destruction of enemy&#8217;s crops or property is strictly forbidden. The righteous Caliphs followed closely the teachings of Allah and those of His Apostle in letter and spirit the celebrated address which the first Caliph Abu Bakr (Allah be pleased with him) gave to his army while sending her on the expedition to the Syrian borders is permeated with the noble spirit with which the war in Islam is permitted. He said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8221; Stop, O people, that I may give you ten rules for your guidance in the battlefield. Do not commit treachery or deviate from the right path. You must not mutilate dead bodies. Neither kill a child, nor a woman. nor an aged man. Bring no harm to the trees, nor burn them with fire, especially those which are fruitful. Slay not ary of the enemy&#8217;s flock. save for your food. You are likely to pass by people who have devoted their lives to monast ic services; leave them alone&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It is said that once at the time of conquest, a singing girl was brought to al-Muhajir b. Abu Umayya who had been publicly singing satirical poems about Hadrat Abu Bakr. Muhajir got her hand amputated. When the Caliph heard this news, he was shocked and wrote a letter to Muhajir in the following words: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8221; I have learnt that you laid hands on a woman who had hurled abuses on me, and, therefore, got her hand amputated. God has not sought vengeance even in the case of polytheism, which is a great crime. He has not permitted mutilation even with regard to manifest infidelity. Try to be considerate and sympathetic in your attitude towards others in future. Never mutilate, because it is a grave offence. God purified Islam and the Muslims from rashness and excessive wrath. You are well aware of the fact that those enemies fell into the hands of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) who had been recklessly abusing him; who had turned him out of his home; and who fought against him, but he never permitted their mutilation.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Another letter written by hadrat &#8216;Umar the Second Caliph, which is addressed to sa&#8217;d b. Abu Waqqas, speaks eloquently of the noble spirit with which the Muslims have bear exhorted to take up arms: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8221; Always search your minds and hearts and stress upon your men the need of perfect integrity and sincerity in the cause of Allah. There should be no material end before them in laying down their lives. but they abould deem it a means whereby they can please their Lord and entitle them. selves to His favour: such a spirit of selflessness should be inculcated in the minds of those who unfortunately lack it. Be firm in the thick of the battle as Allah helps man according to the perseverance that he shows in the cause of His faith and he would be rewarded in accordance with the spirit of sacrifice which he displays for the sake of the Lord. Be careful that those who have been entrusted to your care receive no harm at your hands and are never deprived of any of their legitimate rights. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Such in fact is the humane and noble attitude which Islam exhorts its followers to adopt on the battlefield where passions are generally let loose. It is an attitude the like of which is not to be found in the history of any other nation. Has the world any code of military ethics more noble and compassionate than this?&#8221; The moral tone adopted by the Caliph Abu Bakr in his instructions to the Syrian army was,&#8221; says a Christian historian,&#8221; so unlike the principles of the Roman government that it must have commanded profound attention from the subject people-such a proclamation announced to Jews and Christians sentiments of justice and principles of toleration which neither Roman emperors nor orthodox bishops had ever adopted as the rule of conduct.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Western scholars have indulged in a good deal of mud-slinging on the question of the use of the sword in Islam. But if one were to reflect calmly on this point one would be convinced that the sword has not been used recklessly by the Muslims; it has been wielded purely with humane feelings in the wider interest of humanity. Utmost regard was always shown to human life, honour and property even on the battlefield. That is why in all the eighty-two encounters between the Muslims and the non-Muslims during the life of the Holy Prophet (may peace he upon him), only 1018 persons lost their lives on both sides. Out of this 259 were Muslims, whereas the remaining 759 belonged to the opposite camp. One wonders at the audacity of these writers only when one compares the religious wars of Charles the Great, in which 4300 pagan Saxons were killed in cold blood, when one recalls the&#8221; famous answer by which the Papal Legate, in the Albigensian war, quieted the scruples of a too conscientious general, &#8216;Kill all, God will know His own&#8217;&#8230;. When we recall the Spanish Inquisition, the conquest of Mexico and Peru, the massacre of St. Bartholomew, and the sack of Magdeburg by Tilly.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It is indeed strange that the criticism on the use of sword by Muslims emanates from those whose hands are soiled in the blood of countless innocent human beings, by those who exult in the techniques of homicide, who have depersonalised warfare to such an extent that millions of innocent men and women are put to death and numberless are thrown into concentration camps and flogged with steel rods and ox-hide whips, and all this is done without any qualm of conscience. As human beings. we hang our heads down in shame when we think of the horrifying atrocities which have been perpetrated by the modern civilised men. It is estimated that. in the First World War, ten million soldiers were killed and an equal number of civilians lost their lives, and twenty million died on account of widespread epidemics and famines throughout the world as an aftermath of this war. Economic costs are estimated at $ 338,000,000,000 of which $ 186,000,000,000 were direct costs. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The losses in the Second World War were staggeringly greater as compared to those in the first one. Twenty-two million persons were killed and thirty-four million were wounded. The estimated cost of the war was $ 1, 348. 000,000,000 of which $ 1, 167,000,000,000 consisted of direct military costs. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It is significant that in the Korean War, the first instance in which an international organisation for establishing peace utilised military force to suppress aggression, more than one million persons were killed which added to the civilian deaths in Korea and totalled about five millions. </span></p>

He wrote (in reply) to me that it was necessary in the early days of Islam. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) made a raid upon Banu Mustaliq while they were unaware and their cattle were having a drink at the water. He killed those who fought and imprisoned others. On that very day, he captured Juwairiya bint al-Harith. Nafi&#8217; said that this tradition was related to him by Abdullah b.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been reported from Sulaiman b. Buraid through his father that when the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) appointed anyone as leader of an army or detachment he would especially exhort him to fear Allah and to be good to the Muslims who were with him. He would say: Fight in the name of Allah and in the way of Allah. Fight against those who disbelieve in Allah. Make a holy war, do not embezzle the spoils; do not break your pledge; and do not mutilate (the dead) bodies; do not kill the children. When you meet your enemies who are polytheists, invite them to three courses of action. If they respond to any one of these, you also accept it and withold yourself from doing them any harm. Invite them to (accept) Islam; if they respond to you, accept it from them and desist from fighting against them. Then invite them to migrate from their lands to the land of Muhairs and inform them that, if they do so, they shall have all the privileges and obligations of the Muhajirs. If they refuse to migrate, tell them that they will have the status of Bedouin Muilims and will be subjected to the Commands of Allah like other Muslims, but they will not get any share from the spoils of war or Fai&#8217; except when they actually fight with the Muslims (against the disbelievers). If they refuse to accept Islam, demand from them the Jizya. If they agree to pay, accept it from them and hold off your hands. If they refuse to pay the tax, seek Allah&#8217;s help and fight them. When you lay siege to a fort and the besieged appeal to you for protection in the name of Allah and His Prophet, do not accord to them the guarantee of Allah and His Prophet, but accord to them your own guarantee and the guarantee of your companions for it is a lesser sin that the security given by you or your companions be disregarded than that the security granted in the name of Allah and His Prophet be violated When you besiege a fort and the besieged want you to let them out in accordance with Allah&#8217;s Command, do not let them come out in accordance with His Command, but do so at your (own) command, for you do not know whether or not you will be able to carry out Allah&#8217;s behest with regard to them.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Abu Qatada reported: We accompanied the Messenger of Allah (my peace be upon him) on an expedition in the year of the Battle of Hunain. When we encountered the enemy, (some of the Muslims turned back (in fear). I saw that a man from the polytheists overpowered one of the Muslims. I turned round and attacked him from behind giving a blow between his neck and shoulder. He turned towards me and grappled with me in such a way that I began to see death staring me in the face. Then death overtook him and left me alone. I joined &#8216;Umar b. al-Khattab who was saying: What has happened to the people (that they are retreating)? I said: It is the Decree of Allah. Then the people returned. (The battle ended in a victory for the Muslims) and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sat down (to distribute the spoils of war). He said: One who has killed an enemy and can bring evidence to prove it will get his belongings. So I stood up and said: Who will give evidence for me? Then I sat down. Then he (the Holy Prophet) said like this. I stood up (again) and said: Who will bear witness for me? He (the Holy Prophet) made the same observation the third time, and I stood up (once again). Now the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: What has happened to you, O Abu Qatada? Then I related the (whole) story, to him. At this, one of the people said: He has told the truth. Messenger of Allah 1 The belongings of the enemy killed by him are with me. Persuade him to forgo his right (in my favour). (Objecting to this proposal) Abu Bakr said: BY Allah, this will not happen. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) will not like to deprive one of the lions from among the lions of Allah who fight in the cause of Allah and His Messenger and give thee his share of the booty. So the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) said: He (Abu Bakr) has told the truth, and so give the belongings to him (Abu Qatada). So he gave them to me. I sold the armour (which was a part of my share of the booty) and bought with the sale proceeds a garden in the street of Banu Salama. This was the first property I acquired after embracing Islam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>In a version of the hadith narrated by Laith, the words uttered by Abu Bakr are:&#8221; No, never!

A man on a brown rhe-camel chased him (taking him for a spy). Salama (the narrator) said: I followed on foot. I ran on until I was near the thigh of the she-camel. I advanced further until I was near the haunches of the camel. I advanced still further until I caught hold of the nosestring of the camel. I made it kneel down. As soon as it placed its knee on the ground, I drew my sword and struck at the head, of the rider who fell down. I brought the camel driving it along with the man&#8217;s baggage and weapons. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) came forward to meet me and the people were with him. He asked: Who has killed the man? The people said: Ibn Akwa&#8217;.

Aus who said: Umar b. al-Khattab sent for me and I came to him when the day had advanced. I found him in his house sitting on his bare bed-stead, reclining on a leather pillow. He said (to me): Malik, some people of your tribe have hastened to me (with a request for help). I have ordered a little money for them. Take it and distribute it among them. I said: I wish you had ordered somebody else to do this job. He said: Malik, take it (and do what you have been told). At this moment (his man-servant) Yarfa&#8217; came in and said: Commander of the Faithful, what do you say about Uthman, Abd al-Rabman b. &#8216;Auf, Zubair and Sa&#8217;d (who have come to seek an audience with you)? He said: Yes, and permitted them. so they entered. Then he (Yarfa&#8217;) came again and said: What do you say about &#8216;Ali and Abbas (who are present at the door)? He said: Yes, and permitted them to enter. Abbas said: Commander of the Faithful, decide (the dispute) between me and this sinful, treacherous, dishonest liar. The people (who were present) also said: Yes. Commander of the Faithful, do decide (the dispute) and have mercy on them. Malik b. Aus said: I could well imagine that they had sent them in advance for this purpose (by &#8216;Ali and Abbas). &#8216;Umar said: Wait and be patient. I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heavens and the earth are sustained, don&#8217;t you know that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said:&#8221; We (prophets) do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity&#8221;? They said: Yes. Then he turned to Abbas and &#8216;Ali and said: I adjure you both by Allah by Whose order the heavens and earth are sustained, don&#8217;t you know that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said:&#8221; We do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity&#8221;? They (too) said: Yes. (Then) Umar said: Allah, the Glorious and Exalted, had done to His Messenger (may peace be upon him) a special favour that He has not done to anyone else except him. He quoted the Qur&#8217;anic verse:&#8221; What Allah has bestowed upon His Apostle from (the properties) of the people of township is for Allah and His Messenger&#8221;. The narrator said: I do not know whether he also recited the previous verse or not. Umar continued: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) distrbuted among you the properties abandoned by Banu Nadir. By Allah, he never preferred himself over you and never appropriated anything to your exclusion. (After a fair distribution in this way) this property was left over.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) would meet from its income his annual expenditure, and what remained would be deposited in the Bait-ul-Mal. (Continuing further) he said: I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heavens and the earth are sustained. Do you know this? They said: Yes. Then he adjured Abbas and &#8216;All as he had adjured the other persons and asked: Do you both know this? They said: Yes. He said: When the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) passed away, Abu Bakr said:&#8221; I am the successor of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him).&#8221; Both of you came to demand your shares from the property (left behind by the Messenger of Allah). (Referring to Hadrat &#8216;Abbas), he said: You demanded your share from the property of your nephew, and he (referring to &#8216;Ali) demanded a share on behalf of his wife from the property of her father. Abu Bakr (Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had said:&#8221; We do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity.&#8221; So both of you thought him to be a liar, sinful, treacherous and dishonest. And Allah knows that he was true, virtuous, well-guided and a follower of truth. When Abu Bakr passed away and (I have become) the successor of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and Abu Bakr (Allah be pleased with him), you thought me to be a liar, sinful, treacherous and dishonest. And Allah knows that I am true, virtuous, well-guided and a follower of truth. I became the guardian of this property. Then you as well as he came to me. Both of you have come and your purpose is identical. You said: Entrust the property to us. I said: If you wish that I should entrust it to you, it will be on the condition that both of you will undertake to abide by a pledge made with Allah that you will use it in the same way as the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) used it. So both of you got it. He said: Wasn&#8217;t it like this? They said: Yes. He said: Then you have (again) come to me with the request that I should adjudge between you. No, by Allah. I will not give any other judgment except this until the arrival of the Doomsday. If you are unable to hold the property on this condition, return it to me.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It is narrated on the authority of Urwa b. Zubair who narrated from A&#8217;isha that she informed him that Fatima, daughter of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), sent someone to Abu Bakr to demand from him her share of the legacy left by the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) from what Allah had bestowed upon him at Medina and Fadak and what was left from one-filth of the income (annually received) from Khaibar. Abu Bakr said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said:&#8221; We (prophets) do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity.&#8221; The household of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) will live on the income from these properties, but, by Allah, I will not change the charity of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) from the condition in which it was in his own time. I will do the same with it as the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upun him) himself used to do. So Abu Bakr refused to hand over anything from it to Fatima who got angry with Abu Bakr for this reason. She forsook him and did not talk to him until the end of her life. She lived for six months after the death of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). When she died, her husband. &#8216;Ali b. Abu Talib, buried her at night. He did not inform Abu Bakr about her death and offered the funeral prayer over her himself. During the lifetime of Fatima, &#8216;All received (special) regard from the people. After she had died, he felt estrangement in the faces of the people towards him. So he sought to make peace with Abu Bakr and offer his allegiance to him. He had not yet owed allegiance to him as Caliph during these months. He sent a person to Abu Bakr requesting him to visit him unaccompanied by anyone (disapproving the presence of Umar). &#8216;Umar said to Abu Bakr: BY Allah, you will not visit them alone. Abu Bakr said: What will they do to me? By Allah, I will visit them. And he did pay them a visit alone. &#8216;All recited Tashahhud (as it is done in the beginning of a religious sermon) ; then said: We recognise your moral excellence and what Allah has bestowed upon you. We do not envy the favour (i. e. the Catiphate) which Allah nas conferred upon you; but you have done it (assumed the position of Caliph) alone (without consulting us), and we thought we had a right (to be consulted) on account of our kinship with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). He continued to talk to Abu Bakr (in this vein) until the latter&#8217;s eyes welled up with tears. Then Abd Bakr spoke and said: By Allah, in Whose Hand is my life, the kinship of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) is dearer to me than the kinship of my own people. As regards the dispute that has arisen between you and me about these properties, I have not deviated from the right course and I have not given up doing about them what the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) used to do. So &#8216;Ali said to Abu Bakr: This aftetnoon is (fixed) for (swearing) allegiance (to you). So when Abu Bakr had finished his Zuhr prayer, he ascended the pulpit and recited Tashahhud, and described the status of &#8216;Ali, his delay in swearing allegiance and the excuse which lie had offered to him (for this delay). (After this) he asked for God&#8217;s forgiveness. Then &#8216;Ali b. Abu Talib recited the Tashahhud. extolled the merits of Abu Bakr and (said that) his action was nott prompted by any jealousy of Abu Bakr on his part or his refusal to accept the high position which Allah had conferred upon him, (adding: ) But we were of the opinion that we should have a share in the government, but the matter had been decided without taking us into confidence, and this displeased us. (Hence the delay in offering allegiance. The Muslims were pleased with this (explanation) and they said: You have done the right thing. The Muslims were (again) favourably inclined to &#8216;Ali since he adopted the proper course of action.</span></p>

Abu Bakr said to her: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be npon him) said:&#8221; We do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is Sadaqa (charity).&#8221; The narrator said: She (Fatima) lived six months after the death of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and she used to demand from Abu Bakr her share from the legacy of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) from Khaibar, Fadak and his charitable endowments at Medina. Abu Bakr refused to give her this, and said: I am not going to give up doing anything which the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) used to do. I am afraid that it I go against his instructions in any matter I shall deviate from the right course. So far as the charitable endowments at Medina were concerned, &#8216;Umar handed them over to &#8216;All and Abbas, but &#8216;Ali got the better of him (and kept the property under his exclusive possession). And as far as Khaibar and Fadak were concerned &#8216;Umar kept them with him, and said: These are the endowments of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) (to the Umma). Their income was spent on the discharge of the responsibilities that devolved upon him on the emergencies he had to meet. And their management was to be in the hands of one who managed the affairs (of the Islamic State). The narrator said: They have been managed as such up to this day.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been narrated on the authority of &#8216;Umar b. al-Khattab who said: When it was the day on which the Battle of Badr was fought, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) cast a glance at the infidels, and they were one thousand while his own Companions were three hundred and nineteen. The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) turned (his face) towards the Qibla Then he stretched his hands and began his supplication to his Lord:&#8221; O Allah, accomplish for me what Thou hast promised to me. O Allah, bring about what Thou hast promised to me. O Allah, if this small band of Muslims is destroyed. Thou will not be worshipped on this earth.&#8221; He continued his supplication to his Lord, stretching his hands, facing the Qibla, until his mantle slipped down from his shoulders. So Abu Bakr came to him, picked up his mantle and put it on his shoulders. Then he embraced him from behind and said:. Prophet of Allah, this prayer of yours to your Lord will suffice you, and He will fulfil for you what He has promised you. So Allah, the Glorious and Exalted, revealed (the Qur&#8217;anic verse):&#8221; When ye appealed to your Lord for help, He responded to your call (saying): I will help you with one thousand angels coming in succession.&#8221; So Allah helped him with angels.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Abu Zumail said that the badith was narrated to him by Ibn &#8216;Abbas who said: While on that day a Muslim was chasing a disbeliever who was going ahead of him, he heard over him&#8217; the swishing of the whip and the voice of the rider saying: Go ahead, Haizi&#8217;m! He glanced at the polytheist who had (now) fallen down on his back. When he looked at him (carefully he found that) there was a scar on his nose and his face was torn as if it had been lashed with a whip, and had turned green with its poison. An Ansari came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and related this (event) to him. He said: You have told the truth. This was the help from the third heaven. The Muslims that day (i. e. the day of the Battle of Badr) killed seventy persons and captured seventy. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said to Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar (Allah be pleased with them): What is your opinion about these captives? Abu Bakr said: They are our kith and kin. I think you should release them after getting from them a ransom. This will be a source of strength to us against the infidels. It is quite possible that Allah may guide them to Islam. Then the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: What is your opinion. Ibn Khattab? He said: Messenger of Allah. I do not hold the same opinion as Abu Bakr. I am of the opinion that you should hand them over to us so that we may cut off their heads. Hand over &#8216;Aqil to &#8216;Ali that he may cut off his head, and hand over such and such relative to me that I may but off his head. They are leaders of the disbelievers and veterans among them. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) approved the opinion of Abu Bakr and did not approve what I said The next day when I came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), I found that both he and Abu Bakr were sitting shedding tears. I said: Messenger of Allah, why are you and your Companion shedding tears? Tell me the reason. For I will weep ate, if not, I will at least pretend to weep in sympathy with you. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: I weep for what has happened to your companions for taking ransom (from the prisoners). I was shown the torture to which they were subjected. It was brought to me as close as this tree. (He pointed to a tree close to him.) Then God revealed the verse:&#8221; It is not befitting for a prophet that he should take prisoners until the force of the disbelievers has been crushed&#8230;&#8221; to the end of the verse:&#8221; so eat ye the spoils of war, (it is) lawful and pure. So Allah made booty lawful for them.&#8221;</span></p>

If you kill me, you will kill a person who has spilt blood. If you do me a favour, you will do a favour to a grateful person. If you want wealth, ask and you will get what you will demand. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be pon him) lefthim (in this condition) for two days, (and came to him again) and said: What do you think, O Thumama? He replied: What I have already told you.

The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Set Thumama free. He went to a palm-grove near the mosque and took a bath. Then he entered the mosque and said: I bear testimony (to the truth) that there is no god but Allah and I testify that Muhammad is His bondman and His messenger. O Muhammad, by Allah, there was no face on the earth more hateful to me than your face, but (now) your face has become to me the dearest of all faces. By Allah, there was no religion more hateful to me than your religion, but (now) your religion has become the dearest of all religions to me. By Allah, there was no city more hateful to me than your city, but (now) your city has become the dearest of all cities to me. Your horsemen captured me when I intended going for Umra. Now what is your opinion (in the matter)? The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) announced good tidings to him and told him to go on &#8216;Umra. When he reached Mecca, somebody said to him: Have you changed your religion? He said: No! I have rather embraced Islam with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him).

Mu&#8217;adh about them. Accordingly, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sent for Sa&#8217;d who came to him riding a donkey. When he approached the mosque, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said to the Ansar: Stand up to receive your chieftain. Then he said (to Sa&#8217;d): These people have surrendered accepting your decision. He (Sa&#8217;d) said: You will kill their fighters and capture their women and children. (Hearing this), the Propbot (may peace he tpon him) said: You have adjudged by the command of God.

A man from the Quraish called Ibn al-Ariqah shot at him an arrow which pierced the artery in the middle of his forearm. The Messenger of Allah (may peacce be upon him) pitched a tent for him in the mosque and would inquire after him being in close proximity. When he returned from the Ditch and laid down his arms and took a bath, the angel Gabriel appeared to him and he was removing dust from his hair (as if he had just returned from the battle). The latter said: You have laid down arms. By God, we haven&#8217;t (yet) laid them down. So march against them. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) asked: Where? He poirftad to Banu Quraiza. So the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) fought against them. They surrendered at the command of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), but he referred the decision about them to Sa&#8217;d who said: I decide about them that those of them who can fight be killed, their women and children taken prisoners and their properties distributed (among the Muslims).</span></p>

If anything yet remains to be decided from the war against the Quraish, spare my life so that I may fight against them in Thy cause. O Lord, I think Thou hast ended the war between us and them. If Thou hast done so, open my wound (so that it may discharge) and cause my death thereby. So the wound begin to bleed from the front part of his neck. The people were not scared except when the blood flowed towards them, and in the mosque along with Sa&#8217;d&#8217;s tent was the tent of Banu Ghifar.

The Ansar divided and gave them on the condition that they would give half the fruit from the orchards every year, and the Muhajirs would recompense them by working with them and putting in labour. The mother of Anas b. Malik was called Umm Sulaim and she was also the mother of &#8216;Abdullah b. Talha who was a brother of Anas from his mother&#8217;s side.

Zaid. When the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had finished the war with the people of Khaibar and returned to Medina, the Muhajirs returned to the Ansar all the gifts which they had given them out of the fruits. (Anas b. Malik said: ) The Messenger of. Allah (may peace be upon him) returned to my mother her date-palms and gave to Umm Aiman instead of them date-palms from his orchard. Ibn Shihab says that Umm Aiman was the mother of Usama b. Zaid who was the slave-girl of &#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Abd-ul-Muttalib and hailed from Abyssinia. When Amina gave birth to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) after the death of his father, Umm Aiman used to nurse him until he grew up. He (later on) freed her and married her to Zaid b.

<p><em><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="019.4380"></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been narrated on the authority of Ibn Abbas who learnt the tradition personally from Abu Safyan. The latter said: I went out (on a mercantile venture) during the period (of truce) between me and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). While I was in Syria, the letter of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was handed over to Hiraql (Ceasar), the Emperor of Rome (who was on a visit to Jerusalem at that time). The letter was brought by Dihya Kalbi who delivered it to the governor of Busra The governor passed it on to Hiraql, (On receiving the letter), he said: Is there anyone from the people of this man who thinks that he is a prophet. People said: Yes. So, I was called along with a few others from the Quraish. We were admitted to Hiraql and he seated usbefore him. He asked: Which of you has closer kinship with the man who thinks that he is a prophet? Abu Sufyan said: I. So they seated me in front of him and stated my companions behind me. Then, he called his interpreter and said to him: Tell them that I am going to ask this fellow (i. e. Abu Sufyan) about the man who thinks that he is a prophet. It he tells me a lie, then refute him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Abu Sufyan told (the narrator): By God, if there was not the fear that falsehood would be imputed to me I would have lied. (Then) Hiraqi said to his interpreter: Inquire from him about his ancestry, I said: He is of good ancestry among us. He asked: Has there been a king among his ancestors? I said: No. He asked: Did you accuse him of falsehood before he proclaimed his prophethood? I said: No. He asked: Who are his follower people of high status or low status? I said: (They are) of low status. He asked: Are they increasing in number or decreasing? I said. No. they are rather increasing. He asked: Does anyone give up his religion, being dissatisfied with it, after having embraced it? I said: No. He asked: Have you been at war with him? I said: Yes. He asked: How did you fare in that war? I said: The war between us and him has been wavering like a bucket, up at one turn and down at the other (i. e. the victory has been shared between us and him by turns). Sometimes he suffered loss at our hands and sometimes we suffered loss at his (hand). He asked: Has he (ever) violated his covenant? I said: No. but we have recently concluded a peace treaty with him for a petiod and we do not know what he is going to do about it. (Abu Sufyin said on oath that he could not interpolate in this dialogue anything from himself more than these words ) He asked: Did anyone make the proclamation (Of prophethood) before him? I said: No. He (now) said to his interpreter: Tell him, I asked him about his ancestry and he had replied that he had the best ancestry. This is the case with Prophets; they are the descendants of the noblest among their people (Addressing Abu Sufyan), he continued: I asked you if there had been a king among his ancestors. You said that there had been none. If there had been a king among his ancestors, I would have said that he was a man demanding his ancestral kingdom. I asked you about his followers whether they were people of high or low status, and you said that they were of rather low status. Such are the followers of the Prophets. I asked you whether you used to accuse him of falsehood before he proclaimed his prophethood, and you said that you did not.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>So I have understood that when he did not allow himself to tell a lie about the poeple, he would never go to the length of forging a falsehood about Allah. I asked you whether anyone renounced his religion being dissatisfied with it after he had embraced it, and you replied in the negative. Faith is like this when it enters the depth of the heart (it perpetuates them). I asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing. You said they were increasing. Faith is like this until it reaches its consummation. I asked you whether you had been at war with him, and you replied that you had been and that the victory between you and him had been shared by turns, sometimes he suffering loss at your hand and sometimes you suffering lost at his. This is how the Prophets are tried before the final victory its theirs. I asked you whether he (ever) violated his covenant, and you said that he did not. This is how the Prophets behave. They never violate (their covenants). I asked you whether anyone before him had proclaimed the same thing, and you replied in the negative. I said: If anyone had made the same proclamation before, I would have thought that he was a man following what had been proclaimed before. (Then) he asked: What does he enjoin upon you? I said: He exhorts us to offer Salat, to pay Zakat, to show due regard to kinship and to practise chastity. He said: It what you have told about him is true, he is certainly a Prophet. I knew that he was to appear but I did not think that he would be from among you. If I knew that I would be able to reach him. I would love to meet him; and it I had been with him. I would have washed his feet (out of reverence). His dominion would certainly extend to this place which is under my feet. Then he called for the letter of the Messenger of Allah (may pface be upon him) and read it. The letter ran as follows:&#8221; In the name of Allah, Most Gracious and Most Merciful. From Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, to Hiraql, the Emperor of the Romans. Peace be upon him who follows the guidance. After this, I extend to you the invitation to accept Islam. Embrace Islam and you will be safe. Accept Islam, God will give you double the reward. And if you turn away, upon you will be the sin of your subjects.&#8221; O People of the Book, come to the word that is common between us that we should worship none other than Allah, should not ascribe any partner to Him and some of us should not take their fellows as Lords other than Allah. If they turn away, you should say that we testify to our being Muslims [iii. 64].&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>When he hid finished the reading of the letter, noise and confused clamour was raise around him, and he ordered us to leave. Accordingly, we left. (Addressing my companions) while we were coming out (of the place). I said: Ibn Abu Kabsha (referring sarcastically to the Holy Prophet) has come to wield a great power. Lo! (even) the king of the Romans is afraid of him. I continued to believe that the authority of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) would triumph until God imbued me with (the spirit of) Islam.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been narrated on the authority of &#8216;Abbas who said: I was in the company of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) on the Day of Hunain. I and Abd Sufyan b. Harith b. &#8216;Abd al-Muttalib stuck to the Messenaer of Allah (may peace be upon him) and we did not separate from him. And the Messenger of Allah (may place be upon him) was riding on his white mule which had been presented to him by Farwa b. Nufitha al-Judhami. When the Muslims had an encounter with the disbelievers, the Muslims fled, falling back, but the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) began to spur his mule towards the disbelievers. I was holding the bridle of the mule of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) checking it from going very fast, and Abu Sufyan was holding the stirrup of the (mule of the) Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), who said: Abbas, call out to the people of al-Samura. Abbas (who was a man with a loud voice) called out at the top of the voice: Where are the people of Samura? (Abbas said: ) And by God, when they heard my voice, they came back (to us) as cows come back to their calves, and said: We are present, we are present! &#8216;Abbas said: They began to fight the infidels. Then there was a call to The Ansar. Those (who called out to them) shouted: O ye party of the Ansar! O party of the Ansar! Banu al-Harith b. al-Khazraj were the last to be called. Those (who called out to them) shouted: O Banu Al-Harith b. al-Khazraj! O BanU Harith b. al-Khazraj! And the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) who was riding on his mule looked at their fight with his neck stretched forward and he said: This is the time when the fight is raging hot. Then the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) took (some) pebbles and threw them in the face of the infidels. Then he said: By the Lord of Muhammad, the infidels are defeated. &#8216;Abbas said: I went round and saw that the battle was in the same condition in which I had seen it. By Allah, it remained in the same condition until he threw the pebbles. I continued to watch until I found that their force had been spent out and they began to retreat.</span></p>

This party (of archers) belonged to Banu Hawazin and Banu Nadir. They shot at the advancing young men and their arrows were not likely to miss their targets.

They and the Companions of the Prophet (may peace be upon him) met in combat, but the Companions of the Prophet turned back and I too turned back defeated. I had two mantles, one of which I was wrapping round the waist (covering the lower part of my body) and the other I was putting around my shoulders.

Wher. the Companions gathered round him from all sides. the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) got down from his mule. picked up a handful of dust from the ground, threw it into their (enemy) faces and said: May these faces be deformed 1 There was no one among the enemy whose eyes were not filled with the dust from this handful. So they turned back fleeing. and Allah the Exalted and Glorious defeated them, and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) distributed their booty among the Muslims.</span></p>

Then spoke &#8216;Umar (expressing his views), but he (the Holy Prophet) did not pay heed to him (too). Then Sa&#8217;d b. &#8216;Ubada stood up and said: Messenger of Allah, you want us (to speak).

(Soon) the water-carriers of the Quraish arrived. Among them was a black slave belonging to Banu al-Hajjaj. The Companions of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) caught him and interrogated him about Abu Sufyan and his companions. He said: I know nothing about Abu Sufyan, but Abu Jahl, Utba, Shaiba and Umayya b. Khalaf are there. When he said this, they beat him. Then he said: All right, I will tell you about Abu Sufyan. They would stop beating him and then ask him (again) about Abu Sufyan. He would again say&#8217;, I know nothing about Abu Sufyan, but Abu Jahl. &#8216;Utba, Shaiba and Umayya b. Khalaf are there. When he said this, they beat him likewise. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was standing in prayer. When he saw this he finished his prayer and said: By Allah in Whose control is my life, you beat him when he is telling you the truth, and you let him go when he tells you a lie.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been narrated by &#8216;Abdullah b. Rabah from Abu Huraira, who said: Many deputations came to Mu&#8217;awiya. This was in the month of Ramadan. We would prepare food for one another. Abu Huraira was one of those who frequently invited us to his house. I said: Should I not prepare food and invite them to my place? So I ordered meals to be prepared Then I met Abu Huraira in the evening and said: (You will have) your meals with me tonight. He said: You have forestalled me. I said: Yes, and invited them. (When they had finished with the meals) Abu Huraira said: Should I not tell yon a tradition from your traditions, O ye assembly of the Ansar? He then gave an account of the Conquest of Mecca and said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) advanced until he reached Mecca. He deputed Zubair on his right flank and Khalid on the left, and he despatched Abu Ubaida with the force that had no armour. They advanced to the interior of the valley. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was in the midst of a large contingent of fighters. He saw me and said: Abu Huraira. I said: I am here at your call, Messenger of Allah I He said: Let no one come to me except the Ansar, so call to me the Ansar (only). Abu Huraira continued: So they gathered round him. The Quraish also gathered their ruffians and their (lowly) followers, and said: We send these forward. If they get anything, we shall be with them (to share it), and if misfortune befalls them, we shall pay (as compensation) whatever we are asked for. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said (to the Ansar): You see the ruffians and the (lowly) followers of the Quraish. And he indicated by (striking) one of his hands over the other that they should be killed and said: Meet me at as-Safa. Then we went on (and) if any one of us wanted that a certain person should be killed, he was killed, and none could offer any resistance. Abu Huraira continued: Then came Abu Sufyan and said: Messenger of Allah, the blood of the Quraish has become very cheap. There will be no Quraish from this day on.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Then he (the Holy Prophet) said: Who enters the house of Abu Sufyan, he will be safe. Some of the Ansar whispered among themselves: (After all), love for his city and tenderness towards his relations have overpowered him. Abu Huraira said: (At this moment) revelation came to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) and when he was going to receive the Revelation, we understood it, and when he was (actually) receiving it, none of us would dare raise his eyes to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) until the revelation came to an end. When the revelation came to an end, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: O ye Assembly of the Ansar! They said: Here we are at your disposal, Messenger of Allah. He said: You were saying that love for his city and tenderness towards his people have overpowered this man. They said: So it was. He said: No, never. I am a bondman of God and His Messenger. I migrated towards God and towards you. I will live with you and will die with you. So, they (the Ansar) turned towards him in tears and they were saying: By Allah, we said what we said because of our tenacious attachment to Allah and His Messenger. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Surely, Allah and His Messenger testify to your assertions and accept your apology. The narrator continued: People turned to the house of Abu Sufyan and people locked their doors. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) proceeded until he approached the (Black) Stone. He kissed it and circumambulated the Ka&#8217;ba. He reached near an idol by the side of the Ka&#8217;ba which was worshipped by the people. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had a bow in his hand, and he was holding it from a corner. When he came near the idol, he began to pierce its eyes with the bow and (while doing so) was saying: Truth has been established and falsehood has perished. When he had finished the circumambulation, he came to Safa&#8217;, ascended it to a height from where he could see the Ka&#8217;ba, raised his hands (in prayer) and began to praise Allah and prayed what he wanted to pray.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The tradition has been narrated by a different chain of transmitters with the following additions: (i) Then be (the Messenger of Allah) said with his hands one upon the other: Kill them (who stand in your way)&#8230;.

Each of us would prepare food for his companions turn by turn for a day. (Accordingly) when it was my turn I said: Abu Huraira, it is my turn today. So they came to my place. The food was not yet ready, so I said to Abu Huraira: I wish you could narrate to us a tradition from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) until the food was ready. (Complying with my request) Abu Huraira said: We were with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) on the day of the Conquest of Mecca. He appointed Khalid b. Walid as commander of the right flank, Zubair as commander of the left flank, and Abu &#8216;Ubaida as commander of the foot-soldiers (who were to advance) to the interior of the valley. He (then) said: Abu Huraira, call the Ansar to me. So I called out to them and they came hurriedly. He said: O ye Assembly of the Ansaar, do you see the ruffians of the Quraish? They said: Yes. He said: See, when you meet them tomorrow, wipe them out. He hinted at this with his hand, placing his right hand on his left and said: You will meet us at as-Safa&#8217;. (Abu Huraira continued): Whoever was seen by them that day was put to death. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) ascended the mount of as-Safa&#8217;. The Ansar also came there and surrounded the mount. Then came Abu Sufyan and said: Messenger ot Allah, the Quraish have perished. No member of the Quraish tribe will survive this day. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Who enters the house of Abu Safyin will be safe, who lays down arms will be safe, who locks his door will be safe. (some of) the Ansar said: (After all) the man has been swayed by tenderness towards his family and love for his city. At this, Divine inspiration descended upon the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). He said: You were saying that the man has been swayed by tenderness towards his family and love for his city. Do you know what my name is? I am Muhammad, the bondman of God and His Messenger. (He repeated this thrice.) I left my native place for the take of Allah and joined you. So I will live with you and die with you. Now the Ansar said: By God, we said (that) only out of our greed for Allah and His Messenger. He said: Allah and His Apostle testify to you and accept your apology.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been narrated on the authority of al-Bara&#8217; b. &#8216;Azib who said: &#8216;Ali b. Abu Talib penned the treaty between the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) and the polytheists on the Day of Hudaibiya. He wrote: This is what Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, has settled. They (the polytheists) said: Do not write words&#8221; the Messenger of Allah&#8221;. If we knew that you were the Messenger of Allah, we would not fight against you. The Prophet (may peace be upon him) said to &#8216;Ali: Strike out these words. He (Ali) said: I am not going to strike them out. So the Prophet (may peace be upon him) struck them out with his own hand. The narrator said that the conditions upon which the two sides had agreed included that the Muslims would enter Mecca (next year) and would stay there for three days, and that they would not enter bearing arms except in their sheaths or bolsters.</span></p>

He said to &#8216;Ali: Write down the terms settled between us. (So &#8216;Ali wrote): In the name of Allah, most Gracious and most Merciful. This is what Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, has settled (with the Meccans), The polytheists said to him: If we knew that thou art the Messenger of of Allah, we would follow you. But write: Muhammad b. &#8216;Abdullah. So he told &#8216;Ali to strike out these words. &#8216;Ali said: No, by Allah, I will not strike them out. The Messenger of Allah (may Peace be upon him) said: Show me their place (on the parchment). So he (&#8216;Ali) showed him their place and he (the Holy Prophet) struck them out; and &#8216;Ali wrote: Ibn &#8216;Abdullah. (According to the terms of the treaty, next year) the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) stayed there for three days When it was the third day, they said to &#8216;Ali: This is the last day according to the terms of your companion. So tell him to leave. &#8216;Ali informed the Prophet (may peace be upon him) accordingly. He said: Yes, and left (the city). Ibn Janab in his version of the tradition used:&#8221; we would swear allegiance to you&#8221; instead of&#8221; we would follow you&#8221;.</span></p>

The Prophet (may peace be upon him) said to &#8216;Ali: Write&#8221; In the name of Allah, most Gracious and most Merciful.&#8221; Suhail said: As for&#8221; Bismillah,&#8221; we do not know what is meant by&#8221; Bismillah-ir-Rahman-ir-Rahim&#8221; (In the name of Allah most Gracious and most Merciful). But write what we understand, i. e. Bi ismika allahumma (in thy name. O Allah). Then, the Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: Write:&#8221; From Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah.&#8221; They said: If we knew that thou welt the Messenger of Allah, we would follow you. Therefore, write your name and the name of your father. So the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: Write&#8221; From Muhammad b. &#8216;Abdullah.&#8221; They laid the condition on the Prophet (may peace be upon him) that anyone who joined them from the Muslims, the Meccans would not return him, and anyone who joined you (the Muslims) from them, you would send him back to them. The Companions said: Messenger of Allah, should we write this? He said: Yes. One who goes away from us to join them-may Allah keep him away! and one who comes to join us from them (and is sent back) Allah will provide him relief and a way of escape.</span></p>

If we had thought it fit to fight, we could fight. This was in the truce between the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and the polytheists. Umar b. Khattab came, approached the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and said: Messenger of Allah, aren&#8217;t we fighting for truth and they for falsehood? He replied: By all means. He asked: Are not those killed from our side in Paradise and those killed. from their side in the Fire? He replied: Yes. He said: Then why should we put a blot upon our religion and return, while Allah has not decided the issue between them and ourselves? He said: Son of Khattab, I am the Messenger of Allah. Allah will never ruin me. (The narrator said): Umar went away, but he could not contain himself with rage. So he approached Abu Bakr and said: &#8216;Abu Bakr, aren&#8217;t we fighting for truth and they for falsehood? He replied: Yes. He asked: Aren&#8217;t those killed from our side in Paradise and those killed from their side in the Fire? He replied: Why not? He (then) said: Why should we then disgrace our religion and return while God has not yet decided the issue between them and ourselves? Abu Bakr said: Son of Khattab, verily, he is the Messenger of Allah, and Allah will never ruin him. (The narrator continued): At this (a Sura of) the Qur&#8217;an (giving glad tidings of the victory) was revealed to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). He sent for Umar and made him read it. He asked: Is (this truce) a victory? He (the Messenger of Allah) replied: Yes. At this Umar was pleased, and returned.</span></p>

We kept quiet and none of us responded to him. He again said: Hark, a man who (goes reconnoitring and) brings me the news of the enemy shall be ranked with me on the Day of Judgtuent by Allah (the Glorious and Exalted) Then he said: Get up Hudhaifa, bring me the news of the enemy. When he called me by name I had no alternative but to get up. He said: Go and bring me information about the enemy, and do nothing that may provoke them against me. When I left him, I felt warm as if I were walking in a heated bath untill I reached them. I saw Abu Sufyan warming his back against fire I put an arrow in the middle of the bow. intending to shoot at him, when I recalled the words of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)&#8221; Do not provoke them against me.&#8221; Had I shot at him, I would have hit him. But I returned and (felt warm as if) I were walking in a heated bath (hammam). Presenting myself before him, I gave him information about the enemy. When I had done so, I began to feel cold, so the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) wrapped me in a blanket that he had in excess to his own requirement and with which he used to cover himself while saying his prayers. So I continued to sleep until it was morning. When it was morning he said: Get up, O heavy sleeper.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been narrated on the authority of Ibn Mas&#8217;ud who said: While the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was saying his prayer near the Ka&#8217;ba and Abu Jahl with his companions was sitting (near by), Abu Jahl said, referring to the she-camel that had been slaughtered the previous day: Who will rise to fetch the foetus of the she-camel of so and so, and place it between the shoulders of Muhammad when he goes down in prostration (a posture in prayer). The one most accursed among the people got up, brought the foetus and, when the Prophet (may peace be upon him) went down in prostration, placed it between his shoulders. Then they laughed at him and some of them leaned upon the others with laughter. And I stood looking. If I had the power, I would have thrown it away from the back of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). The Prophet (may peace be upon him) had bent down his head in prostration and did not raise it, until a man went (to his house) and informed (his daughter) Fatima, who was a young girl (at that time) (about this ugly incident). She came and removed (the filthy thing) from him. Then she turned towards them rebuking them (the mischief-mongers). When the Prophet (may peace be upon him) had finished his prayer, he invoked God&#8217;s imprecations upon them in a loud voice. When he prayed, he prayed thrice, and when he asked for God&#8217;s blessings, he asked thrice. Then he said thrice: O Allah, it is for Thee to deal with the Quraish. When they heard his voice, laughter vanished from them and they feared his malediction. Then he said: O God, it is for Thee to deal with Abu Jahl b. Hisham, &#8216;Utba b. Rabi&#8217;a, Shaiba b. Rabi&#8217;a. Walid b. Uqba, Umayya b. Khalaf, Uqba b. Abu Mu&#8217;ait (and he mentioned the name of the seventh person. which I did not remember). By One Who sent Muhammad with truth, I saw (all) those he had named lying slain on the Day of Badr. Their dead bodies were dragged to be thrown into a pit near the battlefield.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Abu Ishiq had said that the name of Walid b. &#8216;Uqba has been wrongly mentioned in this tradition.</span></p>

He said: I have experienced from thy people and the hardest treatment I met from them was what I received from them on the day of &#8216;Aqaba. I betook myself to Ibn Abd Yalil b. Abd Kulal with the purpose of inviting him to Islam, but he did not respond to me as I desired. So I departed with signs of (deep) distress on my face. I did not recover until I reached Qarn al-Tha&#8217;alib. Where I raised my head, lo! near me was a cloud which had cast its shadow on me. I looked and lo! there was in it the angel Jibril who called out to me and said.: God. the Honoured and Glorious, has heard what thy people have said to thee, and how they have reacted to thy call. And He has sent to thee the angel in charge of the mountains so that thou mayest order him what thou wishest (him to do) with, regard to them. The angel in charge of the mountains (then) called out to me, greeted me and said: Muhammad, God has listened to what thy people have said to thee. I am the angel in charge of the mountains. and thy Lord has sent me to thee so that thou mayest order me what thou wishest. If thou wishest that I should bring together the two mountains that stand opposite to each other at the extremities of Mecca to crush them in between, (I would do that). But the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) said to him: I rather hope that God will produce from their descendants such persons as will worship Allah, the One, and will not ascribe partners to Him.</span></p>

(He proceeded) until he passed by a mixed company of people in which were Muslims, polytheists, idol worshippers and the Jews and among them were &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy and &#8216;Abdullah b. Rawaha. When the dust raised by the hoofs of the animal spread over the company, &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy covered his nose with his mantle and said: Do not scatter the dust over us (Not minding this remark), the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) greeted them, stopped, got down from his animal, invited them to Allah, and recited to them the Qur&#8217;an. &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy said: O man, if what you say is the truth, the best thing for you would be not to bother us with it in our assemblies. Get back to your place. Whoso comes to you from us, tell him (all) this. Abdullah b. Rawaha said: Come to us in our gatherings, for we love (to hear) it. The narrator says: (At this), the Muslims, the polytheists and the Jews began to rebuke one another until they were determined to come to blows. The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) continued to pacify them. (When they were pacified), he rode his animal and came to Sa&#8217;d b. &#8216;Ubida. He said: Sa&#8217;d, haven&#8217;t you heard what Abu Hubab (meaning &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy) has said? He has said so and so. Sa&#8217;d said: Messenger of Allah, forgive and pardon. God has granted you a sublime position, (but so far as he is concerned) the people of this settlement had-decided to make him their king by making him wear a crown and a turban (in token thereof), but God has circumvented this by the truth He has granted you. This has made him jealous and his jealousy (must have) prompted the behaviour that you have witnessed. So, the Holy Prophet (may peace upon him) forgave him.</span></p>

We journeyed during the night. One of the people said to (my brother) &#8216;Amir b. al-Akwa&#8217;: Won&#8217;t you recite to us some of your verses? Amir was a poet. So he began to chant his verses to urge the camels, reciting:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>O God, if Thou hadst not guided us</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>We would have neither been guided rightly nor practised charity,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Nor offered prayers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>We wish to lay down our lives for Thee; so forgive Thou our lapses,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>And keep us steadfast when we encounter (our enemies).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Bestow upon us peace and tranquillity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Behold, when with a cry they called upon us to help.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Who is this driver (of the camels)? They said: It is &#8216;Amir. He said: God will show mercy to him. A man said: Martyrdom is reserved for him. Messenger of Allah, would that you had allowed us to benefit ourselves from his life. (The narrator says): We reached Khaibar and besieged them, and (we continued the siege) until extreme hunger afflicted us. Then the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Behold, God has conquered it for you. When it was evening of the day on which the city was conquered. the Muslims lit many fires. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: What are these fires? And what are they cooking? They said: They are cooking meat. He asked. Which meat? They said: That of domestic asses. He said: Let them throw it away and break the pots (in which it is being cooked). A man said: Or should they throw it away and wash the pots? He said: They may do that. When the people drew themselves up in battle array &#8216;Amir caught hold of his sword that was rather short He drove a Jew before him to strike him with it. (As he struck him), his sword recoiled and struck his own knee, and &#8216;Amir died of the wound. When the people returned (after the conquest of Kliaibar) and he (Salama) had caught hold of my hand, and said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) saw that I was silent (and dejected) ; he said: What&#8217;s the matter with thee? I said to him: My father and my mother be thy ransom, people presume that &#8216;Amir&#8217;s sacrifice has been in vain. He asked: Who has said that? I said: So and so and Usaid b. Hudair al-Ansari. He said: Who has said that has lied. For him (for &#8216;Amir) there is a double reward. (He indicated this by putting two of his fingers together.) He was a devotee of God and a warrior fighting for His cause. There will be hardly any Arab who can fight as bravely as he did. Qutaiba has differed in a few words.</span></p>

Akwa&#8217; who said: On the day of the Battle of Khaibar my brother fought a fierce fight by the side of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). His sword rebounded and killed him. The Companions of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon hill) talked about his death and doubted (whether it was martyrdom). (They said): (He is) a man killed by his own weapon, and expressed doubt about his affair. Salama said: When the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) returned from Khaibar, I said: Messenger of Allah, permit me that I may recite to you some rajaz verses. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) permitted him. &#8216;Umar b. Khattab said: I know what you will recite. I recited:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>By God, if God had guided us not,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>We would hive neither been guided aright nor practised charity,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Nor offered prayers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: What you have said is true, &#8216;I (continued):</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>And the polytheists have rebelled against us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>When I finished my rajaz, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Who composed these verses? I said: They were composed by my brother. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: May God show mercy to him! I said: By God, some people are reluctant to invoke God&#8217;s mercy on him (because) they say he is a man who died by his own sword. (Hearing this) the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: He died as God&#8217;s devotee and warrior. Ibn Shihab has said: I asked one of the sons of Salama (b. Akwa&#8217;) about (the death of &#8216;Amir). He related to me a similar tradition except that he said: When I said some people were reluctant invoke God&#8217;s blessings on him, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be, upon him said: They lied.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been narrated on the authority of Ibn Salama. He heard the tradition from his father who said: We arrived at Hudaibiya with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and we were fourteen hundred in number. There were fifty goats for them which could not be watered (by the small quantity of water in the local well). So, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sat on the brink of the well. Either he prayed or spat into the well The water welled up. We drank and watered (the beasts as well). Then the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) called us to take the vow of allegiance, as he was sitting at the base of a tree. I was the first man to take the vow. Then other people took the vow. When half the number of people had done so, he said to me: You take the vow, Salama. I said: I was one of those who took the vow in the first instance. He said: (You may do) again. Then the Messenger. of Allah (may peace be upon him) saw that I was without weapons. He gave me a big or a small shield. Then he continued to administer vows to the people until it was the last batch of them. He said (to me): Won&#8217;t you swear allegiance, Salama? I said: Messenger of Allah, I took the oath with the first batch of the people and then again when you were in the middle of the people. He said: (Doesn&#8217;t matter), you may (do so) again. So I took the oath of allegiance thrice. Then he said to me: Salama, where is the shield which I gave to thee? I said: Messenger of Allah, my uncle &#8216;Amir met me and he was without any weapons. So I gave the shield to him. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) laughed and said: You are like a person of the days gone by who said: O God. I seek a friend who is dearer to me than myself. (When all Companions had sworn allegiance to the Holy Prophet), the polytheists sent messages of peace, until people could move from our camp to that of the Meccans and vice versa. Finally, the peace treaty was concluded.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>I was a dependant of Talha b. Ubaidullah. I watered his horse, rubbed its back. I served Talha (doing odd jobs for him) and partook from his food. I had left my family and my property as an emigrant in the cause of Allah and His Messenger (may peace be uron him). When we and the people of Mecca had concluded a peace treaty and the people of one side began to mix with those of the other, I came to a tree, swept away its thorns and lay down (for rest) at its base; (while I lay there), four of the polytheists from the Meccans came to me and began to talk ill of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). I got enraged with them and moved to another tree. They hung their weapons (to the branches of the tree) and lay down (for rest). (While they lay there), somebody from the lower part of the valley cried out: Run up, O Muhajirs! Ibn Zunaim has been murdered. I drew my sword and attacked these four while they were asleep. I seized their arms and collected them up in my hand, and said: By the Being Who has conferred honour upon Muhammad, none of you shall raise his head, else I will smite his face. (Then) I came driving them along to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him). (At the same time). my uncle Amir came (to him) with a man from&#8221; Abalat called Mikraz. Amir was dragging him on a horse with a thick covering on its back along with seventy polytheists. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) cast a glance at them and said: Let them go (so that) they may prove guilty of breach of trust more than once (before we take action against them). So the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) forgave them. On this occasion. God revealed the Qur&#8217;anic verse:&#8221; It is He Who restrained their hands from you and your hands from them in the valley of Mecca after He had granted you a victory over them&#8221; (xlviii. 24). Then we moved returning to Medina, and halted at a place where there was a mountain between us and Banu Lihyan who were polytheists. The Messenaer of Allah (may peace be upon him) asked God&#8217;s forgiveness for one who ascended the mountain at night to act as a scout for the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and his Compinions. I ascended (that mountain) twice or thrice that night. (At last) we reached Medina. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sent his camels with his slave, Rabah, and I was with him. I (also) went to the pasture with the horse of Talha along with the camels.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>When the day dawned, Abd al-Rahman al-Fazari made a raid and drove away all the camels of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), and killed the man who looked after them. I said: Rabah, ride this horse, take it to Talha b. &#8216;Ubaidullah and Inform the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) that the polytheists have made away with his camels. Then I stood upon a hillock and turning my face to Medina, shouted thrice: Come to our help I Then I set out in pursuit of the raiders, shooting at them with arrows and chanting a (self-eulogatory) verse in the Iambic metre:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>I am the son of al-Akwa&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>And today is the day of defeat for the mean.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>I would overtake a man from them, shoot at him an arrow which, piercing through the saddle, would reach his shoulder. and I would say: Take it, chanting at the same time the verse</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>And I am the son of al-Akwa&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>And tody is the day of defeat for the mean.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>By God, I continued shooting at them and hamstringing their animals. Whenever a horseman turned upon me, I would come to a tree and (hid myself) sitting at its base. Then I would shoot at him and hamstring his horse. (At last) they entered a narrow mountain gorge. I ascended that mountain and held them at bay throwing stones at them. I continued to chase them in this way until I got all the camels of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) released and no camel was left with them. They left me; then I followed them shooting at them (continually) until they dropped more than thirty mantles and thirty lances. lightening their burden. On everything they dropped, I put a mark with the help of (a piece of) stone so that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and his Companions might recognise them (that it was booty left by the enemy). (They went on) until They came to a narrow valley when so and so, son of Badr al-Fazari joined them. They (now) sat down to take their breakfast and I sat on the top of a tapering rock. Al-Fazari said: Who is that fellow I am seeing? They said: This fellow has harassed us. By God, he has not left us since dusk and has been (continually) shooting at us until he has snatched everything from our hands. He said: Four of you should make a dash at him (and kill him). (Accordingly), four of them ascended the mountain coming towards me. When it became possible for me to talk to them, I said: Do you recognise me? They said: No. Who are thou? I said: I am Salama, son of al-Akwa&#8217;. By the Being Who has honoured the countenance of Muhammad (may peace be upon him) I can kill any of you I like but none of you will be able to kill me. One of them said: I think (he is right). So they returned. I did not move from my place until I saw the horsemen of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), who came riding through the trees. Lo! the foremost among them was Akhram al-Asadi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Behind him was Abu Qatada al-Ansari and behind him was al-Miqdad b. al-Aswad al-Kindi. I caught hold of the rein of Akhram&#8217;s horse (Seeing this). they (the raiders) fled. I said (to Akhram): Akhram, guard yourself against them until Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and his Companions join you. He said: ) Salama, if you believe In Allah and the Day of Judgment and (if) you kaow that Paradise is a reality and Hell is a reality, you should not stand between me and martyrdom. so I let him go. Akhram and Abd al-Rahman (Fazari) met in combat. Akhram hamstrung Abd al-Rahman&#8217;s horse and the latter struck him with his lance and killed him. Abd al-Rabman turned about riding Akhram&#8217;s horse. Abu Qatada, a horse-man of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), met &#8216;Abd al-Rahman (in combat), smote him with his lance and killed him. By the Being Who honoured the countenance of Muhammad (may peace oe upon him), I followed them running on my feet (so fast) that I couldn&#8217;t see behind me the Companions of Muhammad (may peace be upon him), nor any dust raised by their horses. (I followed them) until before sunset they reached a valley which had a spring of water, which was called Dhu Qarad, so that they could have a drink, for they were thirsty. They saw me running towards them. I turned them out of the valley before they could drink a drop of its water. They left the valley and ran down a slope. I ran (behind them), overtook a man from them, shot him with an arrow through the shoulder blade and said: Take this. I am the son of al-Akwa&#8217;; and today is the day of annihilation for the people who are mean. The fellow (who was wounded) said: May his mother weep over him! Are you the Akwa&#8217; who has been chasing us since morning? I said: Yes, O enemy of thyself, the same Akwa&#8217;. They left two horses dead tired on the hillock and I came dragging them along to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). I met &#8216;Amir who had with him a container having milk diluted with water and a container having water. I performed ablution with the water and drank the milk. Then I came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) while he was at (the spring of) water from which I had driven them away. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had captured those camels and everything else I had captured and all the lances and mantles I had snatched from the polytheists and Bilal had slaughtered a she-camel from the camels I had seized from the people, and was roasting its liver and hump for the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). I said: Messenger of Allah, let me select from our people one hundred men and I will follow the marauders and I will finish them all so that nobody is left to convey the news (of their destruction to their people). (At these words of mine), the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) laughed so much that his molar teeth could be seen in the light of the fire, and he said: Salama, do you think you can do this? I said: Yes, by the Being Who has honoured you. He said: Now they have reached the land of Ghatafan where they are being feted. (At this time) a man from the Ghatafan came along and said: So and so slaughtered a camel for them. When they were exposing its skin, they saw dust (being raised far off). They said: They (Akwa&#8217; and his companions) have come. So. they went away fleeing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>When it was morning, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Our best horseman today is Abu Qatada and our best footman today is Salama. Then he gave me two shares of the booty-the share meant for the horseman and the share meant for the footman, and combined both of them for me. Intending to return to Medina, he made me mount behind him on his she-camel named al-Adba&#8217;. While we were travelling, a man from the Ansar who could not be beaten in a race said: Is there anyone who could compete (with me) in race to Medina? Is there any competitor? He continued repeating this. When I heard his talk, I said: Don&#8217;t you show consideration to a dignified person and don&#8217;t you have awe for a noble man? He said: No, unless he be the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). I said: Messenger of Allah, may my father and mother be thy ransom, let me get down so that I may beat this man (in the race). He said: It you wish, (you may). I said (to the man): I am coming to thee, I then turned my feet. sprang up and tan and gasped (for a while) when one or two elevated places were left and again followed his heel and again gasped (for a while) when one or two elevated places were left and again dashed until I joined him and gave a blow between his shoulders. I said: You have been overtaken, by God. He said: I think so. Thus, I reached Medina ahead of him. By God, we had stayed there only three nights when we set out to Khaibar with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). (On the way) my uncle, Amir, began to recite the following rajaz verses for the people:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>By God, if Thou hadst not guided us aright,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>We would have neither practised charity nor offered prayers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>(O God! ) We cannot do without Thy favours;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Keep us steadfast when we encounter the enemy,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>And descend tranquillity upon us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Who is this? &#8216;Amir said: it is &#8216;Amir. He said: May thy God forgive thee! The narrator said: Whenever the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) asked forgiveness for a particular person, he was sure to embrace martyrdom. Umar b. Khattab who was riding on his camel called out: Prophet of Allah, I wish you had allowed us to benefit from Amir. Salama continued: When we reached Khaibar, its king named Marhab advanced brandishing his sword and chanting:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Khaibar knows that I am Marhab (who behaves like)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>A fully armed, and well-tried warrior.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>When the war comes spreading its flames.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>My uncle, Amir, came out to combat with him, saying:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Khaibar certainly knows that I am &#8216;Amir,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>A fully armed veteran who plunges into battles.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>They exchanged blows. Marbab&#8217;s sword struck the shield of &#8216;Amir who bent forward to attack his opponent from below, but his sword recoiled upon him and cut the main artery: in his forearm which caused his death. Salama said: I came out and beard some people among the Companions of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) as saying: Amir&#8217;s deed has gone waste; he has killed himself. So I came to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) weeping and I said: Messenger of Allah. Amir&#8217;s deed has gone waste. The Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who passed this remark? I said: Some of your Companions. He said: He who has passed that remark has told a lie, for &#8216;Amir there is a double reward. Then he sent me to &#8216;Ali who had tore eyes, and said: I will give the banner to a man who loves Allah and His Messenger or whom Allah and His Messenger love. So I went to &#8216;Ali, brought him beading him along and he had sore eyes, and I took him to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), who applied his saliva to his eyes and he got well. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) gave him the banner (and &#8216;Ali went to meet Marhab in a single combat). The latter advanced chanting:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Khaibar knows certainly that I am Marhab,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>A fully armed and well-tried valorous warrior (hero)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>When war comes spreading its flames.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8216;Ali chanted in reply:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>I am the one whose mother named him Haidar, (And am) like a lion of the forest with a terror-striking countenance. I give my opponents the measure of sandara in exchange for sa&#8217; (i. e. return thir attack with one that is much more fierce).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The narrator said: &#8216;Ali struck at the head of Mirhab and killed him, so the victory (capture of Khaibar) was due to him. This long tradition has also been handed down Through a different chain of transmitters.</span></p>

Ibn Abbas wrote to him: You have written asking me whether the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) took women with him to participate in Jihad. He did take them to the battle and sometimes he fought along with them. They would treat the wounded and were given a reward from the booty, but he did not assign any regular share for them.

We were six in number and had (with us) only one camel which we rode turn by turn Our feet were injured. My feet were so badly injured that my nails dropped off. We covered our feet with rags. so this expedition was called Dhat-ur-Riqa&#8217; (i. e. the expedition of rags) because we bandaged our feet with rags (on that day). Abu Burda said: Abu Musa narrated this tradition, and then disliked repeating it as he did not want to give any publicity to what he did in a noble cause Abu Usama said: Narrators other than Abu Buraida have added to the version of the words:&#8221; God will reward it.&#8221;</span></p>

He (the Holy Prophet) said: By Allah, I cannot provide you with a mount, and there is nothing with me which I should give you as a ride. He (the narrator) said: We stayed there as long as Allah willed. Then there were brought to him (to the Holy Prophet) camels. He (the Holy Prophet) then ordered to give us three white humped camels, We started and said (or some of us said to the others): Allah will not bless us. We came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) begging him to provide us with riding camels. He swore that he could not provide us with a mount, but later on he provided us with that. They (some of the Prophet&#8217;s Companions) came and informed him about this (rankling of theirs), whereupon he said: It was not I who provided you with a mount, but Allah has provided you with that. So far as I am concerned, by Allah, if He so wills, I would not swear, but if, later on, I would see better than it, I (would break the vow) and expiate it and do that which is better.</p>

He (the Holy Prophet) said: By Allah, I cannot provide you with anything to ride. And it so happened that he was at that time much perturbed. I little knew of it, so I came back with a heavy heart on account of the refusal of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), and the fear that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) might have some feelings against me. I returned to my friends and informed them about what Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had said. I had hardly stayed for a little that I heard Bilal calling: &#8216;Abdullah b. Qais. I responded to his call. He said: Hasten to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), he is calling you, When I came to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) he said: Take this pair, this pair, and this pair (i. e. six camels which he had bought from Sa&#8217;d), and take them to y, our friends and say: Verily Allah (or he said: Verily Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has provided you with these animals. So ride upon them. Abu Musa said: I went along with them to my friends and said: Verily Allah&#8217;s messenger (may peace be upon him) has provided you with these animals for riding; but by Allah, I shall not leave you until some of you go along with me to him who had heard the talk of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) then I asked him for you, and his refusal for the first time, and then his granting them to me subsequently; so you should not think that I narrated to you something which he did not say. They said to me: By Allah, in our opinion you are certainly truthful, and we would do as you like. So Abu Musa went along withsome of the menfrom them until they came to those who had heard the words of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may, peace be upon him) and his refusal to (provide) them with (animals) ; and subsequently his granting (the animals) to them; and they narrated to them exactly as Abu Masa had narrated to them.</p>

His complexion was red having the resemblance of a slave. He said to him: Come and (join me in food). He showed reluctance. He (Abu Masa) said: Come on, for I saw Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) eating it (fowl&#8217;s meat), whereupon that person said: I saw it eating something (of filth and rubbish) and I found it repugnant and took an oath that I would never eat that. He (Abu Muds) said: Come, so that I would narrate to you about that (the incident pertaining to vow). (And he narrated thus): I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) along with a group of people belonging to the tribe of Ash&#8217;ari, asking him to provide us with riding camels. He (the Holy Prophet) said: By Allah, I cannot provide you with riding animals. And there is nothing with me with which I can provide you a mount. We stayed (for some time) there as Allah willed, and there was brought to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) booty of camels. He called us and commanded that we should be given five white humped camels. As we were about to go back, some of us said to the other: As we made Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) forget oath, there would be no blessing for us (in his gift). We went back to him and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, we came to you to provide us with riding animals and you took an oath that you would never equip us with mounts and then you have provided us with the riding beasts Allali&#8217;s Messenger, have you forgotten? Thereupon he said: I swear by Allah that if Allah so wills, I shall not swear an oath, and then consider something else to be better than it without making atonement for my oath and doing the thing that is better. So you go; Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, has given you riding animals.</p>

Dawud (once) said: I will go round in the night to my ninety wives, and every one of them will give birth to a child (who will grow up) as a horseman and fight in the cause of Allah His companions said to him: Say&#8221; Insha&#8217; Allah.&#8221; but he did not say Inshii&#8217; Allah. He went round all of them but none of them became pregnant but one, and she gave birth to a premature child.

I said: Even if them (the trained dogs) kill that (the game)? He (the Holy    Prophet) said: Even if these kill, but (on the condition) that no other dog, which you did    not set off (along with your dogs), participates (in catching the game). I said to him: I    throw Mi&#8217;rad, a heavy featherless blunt arrow, for hunting and killing (the game).    Thereupon he said: When you throw Mi&#8217;rad, and it pierces, then eat, but if it falls flatly    (and beats the game to death), then do not eat that.</font></p>

Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: When you set of your trained dogs    having recited the name of Allah, then eat what these (hounds) have caught for you, oven    if it (the game) is killed, provided (the hunting dog) has not eaten (any part of the    game). If it has eaten (the game), then you don&#8217;t eat it as I fear that it might have    caught for its own self. And do not eat in case other dogs have joined your trained dogs.</font></p>

He    said: If it strikes (the game) with its point, then eat, but if it strikes flatly and it    dies, that is Waqidh (beaten into death), do not eat that. I asked the Messenger of Allah    (may peace be upon him) about (hunting with the help of) dogs, whereupon he said. When you    send your dog (for hunting) reciting the name of Allah, then eat (the game), but if some    part of it is eaten (by the dogs, then do not eat that, for it (your dog) has caught that    (the-game) for itself. I (again) said: If I find along with my dog another dog, and do not    know which of (the dogs) has caught (the game). then (what should I do)? Thereupon he    (&#8216;Allah&#8217;s Messenger) said: Then don&#8217;t eat that, for you recited the name of Allah on your    dog and not on the other one.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Jabir reported: Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace he upon him)    sent us (on an expedition) and appointed Abu &#8216;Ubaida our chief that we might intercept a    caravan of the Quraish and provided us with a bag of dates. And he found for us nothing    besides it. Abu Ubaida gave each of us one date (everyday). I (Abu Zubair, one of the    narrators) said: What did you do with that? He said: We sucked that just as a baby sucks    and then drank water over that, and it sufficed us for the day until night. We beat off    leaves with the help of our staffs, then drenched them with water and ate them. We then    went to the coast of the sea, and there rose before us on the coast of the sea something    like a big mound. We came near that and we found that it was a beast, called al-&#8216;Anbar    (spermaceti whale). Abu &#8216;Ubaida said. It is dead. He then said: No (but it does not    matter), we have been sent by the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) in the path    of Allah and you are hard pressed (on account of the scarcity of food), so you eat that.    We three hundred in number stayed there for a month, until we grew bulky. He (Jabir) said:    I saw how we extracted pitcher after pitcher full of fat from the cavity of its eye, and    sliced from it compact piece of meat equal to a bull or like a bull. Abu &#8216;Ubaida called    forth thirteen men from us and he made them sit in the cavity of its eye, and he took hold    of one of the ribs of its chest and made it stand and then saddled the biggest of the    camels we had with us and it passed under it (the arched rib), and we provided ourselves    with pieces of boiled meat (especially for use in our journey). When we came back to    Medina, we went to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and made a mention of that to    him, whereupon he said: That was a provision which Allah had brought forth for you. Is    there any piece of meat (left) with you, so tnat you give to us that? He (Jabir) said: We    sent to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) tome of that (a piece of meat) and he    ate it.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Jabir b. &#8216;Abdullah reported: Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace    he upon him) sent us (on an expedition). We were three hundred riders and our chief    (leader) was &#8216;Ubaida b. al-Jarrah. We were on the look out for a caravan of the Quraish.    So we stayed on the coast for half a month, and were so much afflicted by extreme hunger    that we (were obliged) to eat leaves. That is why it was called the Detachment of the    Leaves. The ocean cast out for us an animal which was called al-&#8216;Anbar (whale). We ate of    that for half of the month and rubbed its fat on our (bodies) until our bodies became    stout. Abu &#8216;Ubaida caught hold of one of its ribs and fixed that up. He then cast a glance    at the tallest man of the army and the highest of the camels. and then made him ride over    that, and that-tnan passed beneath it (the rib), and many a man could sit in its    eye-socket, and we extracted many pitchers of fat from the cavity of its eye. We had small    bags containing dates with us (before finding the whale). &#8216;Ubaida gave every person    amongst us a handful of dates (and when the provision ran short), he then gave each one of    us one date. And when that (stock) was exhausted, we felt its loss.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 12: </font></p>
<p>    </p>
<h3 align="center"><font><em>The Book of Gifts (Kitab Al-Hibat) </em></font>    </h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><br></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A Hiba is defined as the transfer of the possession of  property, movable and immovable, from one person to the other willingly and without any  reward. The one who makes this transfer is known as donor (Wahib), and the thing  transferred is known as Mauhubah, and the one who is donated is known as Mauhub lahu  (donee). The other words used in the language of the Shar&#8217;i&#8217;ah are Nihla or &#8216;Atiyya. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The act of Hiba is not complete unless the donor surrenders  the possession of the thing donated. Moreover, the declaration of donation should be in  clear terms without any ambiguity (around them). This act of donation is based on the  following hadith of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him):&#8221; Give presents to one  another for this would increase your mutual love.&#8221; This not only implies the legality  of gifts, but the exhortation to give these to one another. There is perfect agreement  amongst all the jurists that Hiba is valid in Islam. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The act of donation can be made verbally or in writing by  any person capable of making a contract. A gift by a person involved in debt is invalid,  and gift in death illness cannot take effect beyond one-third of the assets of the  deceased after defraying all necessary expenses. The donation can be made to a living  person and not to one who is dead. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Shari&#8217;ah imposes certain restrictions on the property  which is to be donated. In the first place, the property must be in existence at the time  when the gift is given; hence the gift of oil in the sesame or of butter in the milk would  not be valid. The property once given as a gift cannot be revoked except in some  extraordinary circumstances. The father is entitled to get back the donation given by him  from his children if be finds it contrary to the laws and spirit of the Shari&#8217;ah. The  right to revoke a gift is called Raj&#8217;. This act of revocation can be done with the decree  of a competent court. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Umar b. Khattab (Allah be pleased with him) reported: I    donated a pedigree horse in the path of Allah. Its possesser made it languish. I thought    that he would sell it at a cheap price. I asked Allah&#8217;s Menengsr (may peace be upon him)    about it, whereupon he said: Don&#8217;t buy it and do not get back your charity, for one who    gets back the charity is like a dog who swallows its vomit. This hadith has been narrated    on the authority of Malik b. Anas with the same chain of transmitters but with this    addition:&#8221; Don&#8217;t buy that even if he gives you for one dirham.&#8221;</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Zaid b. Aslam reported on the authority of his father that    &#8216;Umar (Allah be pleased with him) donated a horse in the path of Allah. He found that it    had languished in the hand of its possessor, and he was a man of meagre resources He    (Hadrat &#8216;Umar) intended to buy it. He came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him)    and made a mention of that to him, whereupon he said: Don&#8217;t buy that even if you get it    for a dirham for he who gets back the charity is like a dog which swallows its vomit.</font></p>

He asked the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)    about it. whereupon he (the Holy prophet) said: Don&#8217;t buy that and do not get back what    you gave in charity.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Iyas b. Salama reported on the authority of his father: We    set out on an expedition with, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). We facts    hardship (in getting provisions) until we decided to slaughter some of our riding animals.    Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him), commanded us to pool our provisions of food. So    we spread a sheet of leather and the provisions of the people were collected on it. I    stretched myself to measure how much that was (the length and, breadth of the sheet on    which the provisions were laid). I measured it and (found) that it was (in length and    breadth) of (so much size) on which a goat could sit. We were fourteen hudnred persons. We    (all) ate until we were fully satisfied and then filled our bags with provisions. Then    Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: Is there any water for performing ablution.    Then there came a man with a small bucket containing some water. He threw it in a basin.    We all fourteen hundred persons performed ablution using the water in plenty. Then there    came after that eight persons and they said: Is there any water to perform ablution?    Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: The ablution has already been    performed.</font></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 9:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="center"><em>The Book of Divorce (Kitab Al-Talaq) </em></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabic word for divorce is talaq which means&#8221; freeing or undoing the knot&#8221; (Imam Raghib). In the terminology of the jurists. Talaq signifies the dissolution of marriage, or the annulment of its legality by the pronouncement of certain words.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Divorce is of three kinds: the Ahsan, or most laudable, the Hasan, or laudable, and the Bid&#8217;a or irregular.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Talaq Ahsan or the most laudable divorce is where the husband repudiates his wife by making one pronouncement within the term of Tahr (purity. when the woman is not passing through the period of menses) during which he has not had sexual intercourse with her, and she is left to observe her &#8216;Idda.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Talaq Hasan or laudable divorce is where a husband repudiates an enjoyed wife by three sentences of divorce, in three Tuhrs</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Talaq Bid&#8217;a or irregular divorce is where a husband repudiates his wife by three divorces at once. According to the majority of the jurists, the Talaq holds good, but it is against the spirit of the Shari&#8217;ah, and, therefore, the man who follows this course in divorce is an offender in the eye of Islamic Law.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The right of woman in demanding the dissolution of marriage is known as Khula&#8217; (meaning, literally, the putting off or taking off a thing). It is a kind of facility provided to the wife in securing Talaq from her husband by returning a part or full amount of the bridal gift.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have described before that, according to Islam, marriage is a civil contract; yet the rights and responsibilities consequent upon it are of such importance to the welfare of humanity that a high degree of sanctity is attached to it. But, in spite of the sacredness of the character of the marriage tie, Islam recognises the eternity of divorce in cases when marital relations are poisoned to a degree which makes a peaceful home life impossible. But Islam does not believe in unlimited opportunities for divorce on frivolous and flimsy grounds, because any undue increase in tht facilities for divorce would destroy the stability of family life. Therefore, while allowing divorce even on genuine grounds, Islam has taken great care to introduce checks designed to limit the use of available facilities. The French legists Planiol and Ripert have explicitly emphasised Islam&#8217;s point of view in regard to divorce in these words:&#8221; Divorce is a mischief. However, it is a measure that cannot be avoided for the welfare of the community, because it is the only remedy for another harm which may be wore dangerous The prohibition of divorce, whatever harm it may imply, is like the prohibition of surgery, because the surgeon is compelled to amputate some of the limbs of the patient&#8217;s body. However, there is no danger whatsoever, in legislating for divorce (in accordance with the practice established by Islam) since it is not divorce that spoils married life and dissolves its sacred tie, but the misunderstanding that arises between the married couple and hinders the strengthening of this (union by marriage) and demolished it. Divorce alone puts an end to the hatred that may occur between the husband and his wife before it is aggravated and becomes an intolerable mischief to society&#8221; (quoted by Hasan Ibrihim Hasan, Islam, Religious, Political. Social and Economic Study, p. 274).</p>

<p><em><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.3473"></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported that he divorced his wife while she was menstruating during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). &#8216;Umar b. Khattib (Allah be pleased with him) asked Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) about it, whereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Command him (&#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Umar) to take her back (and keep her) and pronounce divorce when she is purified and she again enters the period of menstruation and she is again purified (after passing the period of menses), and then if he so desires he may keep her and if he desires divorce her (finally) before touching her (without having an intercourse with her), for that is the period of waiting (&#8216;ldda) which God, the Exalted and Glorious, has commanded for the divorce of women.</p>

<p><em><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.3474"></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullah (b. &#8216;Umar) reported that he divorced a wife of his with the pronouncement of one divorce during the period of menstruation. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) commanded him to take her back and keep her until she was purified, and then she entered the period of menses in his (house) for the second time. And he should wait until she was purified of her menses. And then if he would decide to divorce her, he should do so when she was purified before having a sexual intercourse with her; for that was the &#8216;Idda which Allah had commanded for the divorce of women. Ibn Rumh in his narration made this addition: When &#8216;Abdullah was asked about it, he said to one of them: If you have divorced your wife with one pronouncement or two (then you can take her back), for Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) commanded me to do it; but if you have divorced her with three pronouncements, then she is forbidden for you until she married another husband, and you disobeyed Allah in regard to the divorce of your wife what He had commanded you. (Muslim said: The word&#8221; one divorce&#8221; used by Laith is good.)</p>

Then (let her) enter the period of second menses, and when she is purified, then divorce her (finally) before having a sexual intercourse with her, or retain her (finally). That is the &#8216;Idda (the prescribed period) which Allah commanded (to be kept in view) while divorcing the women. &#8216;Ubaidullah reported: I said to Nafi&#8217;: What became of that divorce (pronounced within &#8216;Idda)? He said: It was as one which she counted.</p>

When Ibn &#8216;Umar (Allah be pleased with them) was asked about the person who divorces his wife in the state of menses, he said: If you pronounced one divorce or two, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had commanded him to take her back, and then allow her respite until she enters the period of the second menses, and then allow her respite until she is purified, and then divorce her (finally) before touching her (having a sexual intercourse with her) ; and if you have pronounced (three divorces at one and the same time) you have in fact disobeyed your Lord with regard to what He commanded you about divorcing your wife. But she is however (finally separated from you).</p>

He found people sitting at his door and none amongst them had been granted permission, but it was granted to Abu Bakr and he went in. Then came &#8216;Umar and he sought permission and it was granted to him, and he found Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) sitting sad and silent with his wives around him. He (Hadrat &#8216;Umar) said: I would say something which would make the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) laugh, so he said: Messenger of Allah, I wish you had seen (the treatment meted out to) the daughter ofKhadija when you asked me some money, and I got up and slapped her on her neck. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (mav peace be upon him) laughed and said: They are around me as you see, asking for extra money. Abu Bakr (Allah be pleased with him) then got up went to &#8216;A&#8217;isha (Allah be pleased with her) and slapped her on the neck, and &#8216;Umar stood up before Hafsa and slapped her saying: You ask Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) which he does not possess. They said: By Allah, we do not ask Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) for anything he does not possess. Then he withdrew from them for a month or for twenty-nine days. Then this verse was revealed to him:&#8221; Prophet: Say to thy wives&#8230; for a mighty reward&#8221; (xxxiii. 28). He then went first to &#8216;A&#8217;isha (Allah be pleased with her) and said: I want to propound something to you, &#8216;A&#8217;isha, but wish no hasty reply before you consult your parents. She said: Messenger of Allah, what is that? He (the Holy Prophet) recited to her the verse, whereupon she said: Is it about you that I should consult my parents, Messenger of Allah? Nay, I choose Allah, His Messenger, and the Last Abode; but I ask you not to tell any of your wives what I have said He replied: Not one of them will ask me without my informing her. God did not send me to be harsh, or cause harm, but He has sent me to teach and make things easy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.3507"></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umar b. al-Khattab (Allah be pleased with him) reported: When Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) kept himself away from his wives, I entered the mosque, and found people striking the ground with pebblesand saying: Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has divorced his wives, and that was before they were commanded to observe seclusion &#8216;Umar said to himself: I must find this (actual position) today. So I went to &#8216;A&#8217;isha (Allah be pleased with her) and said (to her): Daughter of Abu Bakr, have you gone to the extent of giving trouble to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him)? Thereupon she said: Son of Khattab, you have nothing to do with me, and I have nothing to do with you. You should look to your own receptacle. He (&#8216;Umar) said: I visited Hafsa daughter of &#8216;Umar, and said to her: Hafsa, the (news) has reached me that you cause Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) trouble. You know that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) does not love you, and had I not been (your father) he would have divorced you. (On hearing this) she wept bitterly. I said to her: Where is Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him)? Shesaid: He is in the attic room. I went in and found Rabah, the servant of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), sitting on the thresholds of the window dangling his feet on the hollow wood of the date-palm with the help of which Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) climbed (to the apartment) and came down. I cried: 0 Rabah, seek permission for me from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (way peace be upon him). Rabah cast a glance at the apartment and then looked toward me but said nothing. I again said: Rabah, seek permission for me from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). Rabah looked towards the apartment and then cast a glance at me, but said nothig. I then raised my voice and said: 0 Rabah, seek permission for me from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). I think that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) is under the impression that I have come for the sake of Hafsa. By Allah, if Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) would command me to strike her neck, I would certainly strike her neck. I raised my voice and he pointed me to climb up (and get into his apartment). I visited Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), and he was lying on a mat. I sat down and he drew up his lower garment over him and he had nothing (else) over him, and that the mat had left its marks on his sides. I looked with my eyes in the store room of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). I found only a handful of barley equal to one sa&#8217; and an equal quantity of the leaves of Mimosa Flava placed in the nook of the cell, and a semi-tanned leather bag hanging (in one side), and I was moved to tears (on seeing this extremely austere living of the Holy Piophet), and he said: Ibn Khattab, what wakes you weep?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: Apostle of Allah, why should I not shed tears? This mat has left its marks on your sides and I do not see in your store room (except these few things) that I have seen; Ceasar and Closroes are leading their lives in plenty whereas you are Allah&#8217;s Messenger. His chosen one, and that is your store! He said: Ibn Khattab, aren&#8217;t you satisfied that for us (there should be the prosperity) of the Hereafter, and for them (there should be the prosperity of) this world? I said: Yes. And as I had entered I had seen the signs of anger on his face, and I therefore, said: Messenger of Allah, what trouble do you feel from your wives, and if youhave divorced them, verily Allah is with you, His angels, Gabriel, Mika&#8217;il, I and Abu Bakr and the believers are with you. And seldom I talked and (which I uttered on that day) I hoped that Allah would testify to my words that I uttered. And so the verse of option (Ayat al-Takhyir) was revealed. Maybe his Lord, if he divorce you, will give him in your place wives better than you&#8230;&#8221; (Ixv. 5). And if you back up one another against him, then surely Allah is his Patron, and Gabriel and the righteous believers, and the angels after that are the aidera (lvi. 4). And it was &#8216;A&#8217;isha, daughter of Abu Bakr, and Hafsa who had prevailed upon all the wives of Allah&#8217;s Prophet (way peace be upon him) for (pressing them for mote money). I said: Messenger of Allah, have you divorced them? He said: No. I said: Messenger of Allah, I entered the mosque and found the Muslims playing with pebbles (absorbed in thought) and saying: Allah&#8217;s Messenger has divorced his wives. Should I get down and inform there that you have not divorced them? He said: Yes, if you so like. And I went on talking to him until I (found) the signs of anger disappeared on his face and (his seriousness was changed to a happy mood and as a result thereof) his face had the natural tranquillity upon it and he laughed and his teeth were the most charming (among the teeth) of all people. Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) climbed down and I also climbed down and catching hold of the wood of the palm-tree and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came down (with such ease) as if he was walking on the ground, not touching anything with his hand (to get support). I said: Messenger of Allah, you remained in your apartment for twenty-nine days. He said: (At times) the month consists of twenty-nine days. I stood at the door of the mosque and I called out at the top of my voice: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) has not divorced his wives (and it was on this occasion that this) verse was revealed:&#8221; And if any matter pertaining to peace or alarm comes within their ken, they broadcast it; whereas, if they would refer it to the Apostle and those who have been entrusted with authority amongst them, those of them who are engaged in obtaining intelligence would indeed know (what to do with) it&#8221; (iv 83). And it was I who understood this matter, and Allah revealed the verse pertaining to option (given to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him in regard to the retaining or divorcing of his wives).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullah b. Abbas (Allah be pleased with tlicm) reported: I intended to ask &#8216;Umar b. al-Khattab (Allah be pleased with him) about a verse, but I waited for one year to ask him out of his fear, until he went out for Pilgrimage and I also accompanied him. As he came back and we were on the way he stepped aside towards an Arak tree to ease himself. I waited for him until he was free. I then walked along with him and said: Commander of the Faithful, who are the two among the wives of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) who backed up one another (in their demand for extra money)? He said: They were Hafsa and &#8216;A&#8217;isha (Allah be pleased with them). I said to him: It is for one year that I intended to ask you about this matter but I could not date so on account of the awe for you. He said: Don&#8217;t do that. If you think that I have any knowledge, do ask me about that. And if I were to know that, I would inform you. He (the narrator) stated that &#8216;Umar had said: By Allah, during the days of ignorance we had no regard for women until Allah the Exalt- ed revealed about them what He has revealed, and appointed (turn) for them what he appointed. He said: It so happened that I was thinking about some matter that my wife said: I wish you had done that and that. I said to her: It does not concern you and you should not feel disturbed in a matter which I intend to do. She said to me: How strange is it that you, O son of Khattab, do not like anyone to retort upon you, whereas your daughter retorts upon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upou him) until he spends the day in vexation. &#8216;Umar said: I took hold of my cloak, then came out of my house until I visited Hafsa and said to her: O daughter, (I heard) that you retort upon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) until he spends the day in vexation, whereupon Hafsa said: By Allah, we do retort upon him. I said: You should bear in mind, my daughter, that I warn you against the punishment of Allah and the wrath of His Messenger (may peace be upon him). You may not be misled by one whose beauty has fascinated her, and the love of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) for her. I (&#8216;Umar) then visited Umm Salama because of my relationship with her and I talked to her. Umm Salama said to me: Umar b. al-Khattab, how strange is it that you meddle with every matter so much so that you are anxious to interfere between Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and his wives, and this perturbed me so much that I refrained from saying what I had to say, so I came out of her apartment, and I had a friend from the Anar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I had been absent (from the company of the Holy Prophet) he used to bring me the news and when he had been absent I used to bring him the news, and at that time we dreaded a king of Ghassan. It was mentioned to us that he intended to attack us, and our minds were haunted by him. My friend, the Ansari, came to me, and he knocked at the door and said: Open it, open it. I said: Has the Ghassani come? He said: (The matter is) more serious than that. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) has separated himself from his wives. I said: Let the nose of Hafsa and &#8216;A&#8217;isha be besmeared with dust. I then took hold of my cloth and went out until I came and found Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) in his attic to which he climbed by means of a ladder made of date-palm, and the servant of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) who was black had been sitting at the end of the ladder. I said: This is Umar. So permission was granted to me. I narrated this news to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and as I narrated the news concerning Umm Salama, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) smiled. He was lying on the mat and there was nothing between him and that (mat), and under his head there was a pillow made of leather and it was stuffed with plam fibres and at his feet were lying a heap of sant tree (acacia niloctica, meant for dyeing) and near his head there was hanging a hide. And I saw the marks of the maton the side of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), and so I wept. He said: What makes you weep? I said: Messenger of Allah, the Khusrau and the Ceasars (spendd their lives in) the midst of (luxuries), whereas you being Allah&#8217;s Messenger (are leading your life in this poverty). Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Don&#8217;t you like that they should have riches of their world, and you have the Hereafter.</p>

And as he reached Marr al Zahran he went away to answer the call of nature, and he said (to me): Bring me a jug of water, and I took that to him. After having answered the call of nature, as he came back, I began to pour water (over his hands and feet), and I remembered (this event of separation of Allah&#8217;s Apostle [may peace be upon him] from his wives).

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) reported. I had always been anxious to ask &#8216;Umar (Allah be pleased with him) about the two ladies amongst the wives of Allah&#8217;s Prophet (may peace be upon Lim) about whom Allah, the Exalted, said:&#8221; If you both turn in repentance to Allah, then indeed your hearts are inclined (to this)&#8221; (Ixvi. 4), until &#8216;Umar (Allah be pleased with him) set out for Hajj and I also went along with him. And as we were going along a path, &#8216;Umar (Allah be pleased with hiyn) went aside and I also went aside with him with a jug (of water). He answered the call of nature, and then came to me and I poured water over his hands and he performed ablution I said: Commander of the Faithful, who are the two ladies amongst the wives of Allah&#8217;s Prophet (may peace be upon him) about whom Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, said: &#8216;If you both turn to Allah in repentance, then indeed your heart are inclined to it&#8221;? &#8216;Umar (Allah he pleased with him) said: How strange is it for you, Ibn &#8216;Abbas! (Zuhri said: By Allah, he disliked what he asked about, but did not keep it a secret.) He (&#8216;Umar) said: They are Hafsa and &#8216;A&#8217;isha; and he then began to narrate the hadith and said: We were such people among the Quraish who dominated women, and as we reached Medina we found there people who were dominated by their women, and our women began to learn (the habits) of their women. He further said: And my house was situated in the suburb of Aledina in the tribe of Banu Umayya b. Zaid. One day I became angry with my wife and she retorted upon me. I did not like that she should retort upon me. She said: You disapprove of my retorting upon you By Allah, the wives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) retort upon him, and one of them detaches herself from him for the day until the night. So I (&#8216;Umar) went out and visited Hafsa and said: Do you retort upon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him)? She said: Yes. I said; Does any one of you detach herself from him from the day to the night? She said: Yes. He said: She who did like it amongst you in fact failed and incurred loss. Does everyone amongst you not fear the wrath of Allah upon her due to the wrath of His Messenger (may peace be upon him), and (as a result thereof) she may perish? So do not retort upon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and do not ask him for anything, but ask me that which you desire, (and the frank behaviour) of your companion may not mislead you, if she is more graceful and is dearer to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) than you (meaning &#8216;A&#8217;isha) (Allah be pleased with her).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Hadrat &#8216;Umar further) said: I had a compalaion from the Ansar and, we used to remain in the company of the Messenger (may peace be upon him) turn by turn. He remained there for a day while I remained there on the other day, and he brought me the news about the revelation and other (matter), and I brought him (the news) like this. And we discussed that the Ghassanids were shoeing the horses in order to attack us. Id y companion once attended (the Apostle). and then came to me at night and knocked at my door and called me, and I came out to him, and he said: A matter of great importance has happened. I said: What is that? Have the Ghassanids come? He said: No, but even more serious and more significant than that: the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) has divorced his wives. I said: Hafsa has failed and has incurred loss. and I feared that it would happen. When it was dawn I observed the dawn prayer and dressed myself, and then came there (in the house of the Holy Prophet) and visited Hafsa, and she was weeping. I said: Has Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) divorced you (all)? She said: I do not know. He has, however, separated himself in his attic. I came to a black servant and said to him: Seek permission for &#8216;Umar. He went in and then came to me and said: I made mention of you to him, but he kept quiet. I then went to the pulpit and sat there, and there was a group of people sitting by it and some of then were weeping. I sat there for some time, until I was overpowered (by that very idea) which was in my mind. I then came back to the boy and said to him: Seek permission for Umar. He went in and came to me and said: I made mention of you to him but he kept quiet. I was about to turn back when the boy called me and said: Go in; permission has been granted to you. I went in and greeted Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and he was reclining against the couch of mat and it had left its marks upon his side. I said: Messenger of Allah, have you divorced your wives? He raised his head towards me and said: No. I said: Allah is the Greatest. Messenger of Allah, I wish if you had seen how we the people of Quraish had domination over women but when we came to Medina we found people whom their women dominated. So our women began to learn from their women. One dily I became angry with my wife and she began to retort upon me. I did not approve that she should retort upon me. She said: You do not like that I should retort upon you, but, by Allah. the wives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) retort upon him and any one of them separates herself from him for a day until night. I said: He who did that amongst them in fact failed and incurred loss. Does any of them feel sate from the wrath of Allahupon her due to the wrath of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), and she has certainly perished. Allah&#8217;s Messtnger (may peace be upon him) smiled, I said: Messenger of Allah, I visited Hafsa and said: (The behaviour) of your companion (&#8216;A&#8217;isha) may not mislead you, If she is more graceful than you and is dearer to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) than you.</p>

He then said: &#8216;A&#8217;isha, I am going to talk to you about a matter, and you should not be hasty in it (and do not give your final decision) until you have consulted your parents. He then recited this verse to me:&#8221; O Prophet, say to your wives&#8221; till he reached&#8221; mighty reward&#8221; (xxxiii. 28). &#8216;A&#8217;isha (Allah be pleased with her) said: By Allah, he knew that my parents would not allow me to separate from him. I said: Is there any need to consult my parents in this matter? I in fact choose Allah and His Messenger (may peace be upon him) and the abode in the Hereafter.

And much time had not elapsed that she gave birth to a child after his death and when she was free from the effects of childbirth she embellished herself for those who had to give proposals of marriage. Abd al-Sunabil b. Ba&#8217;kak (from Banu &#8216;Abd al-Dar) came to her and said: What is this that I see you embellished; perhaps you are inclined to marry, By Allah, you cannot marry unless four months and ten days (of &#8216;Idda are passed). When he said that. I dressed myself, and as it was evening I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and asked him about it, and he gave me a religious verdict that I was allowed to marry when I had given birth to a child and asked me to marry if I so liked. Ibn Shihab said: I do not find any harm fur her in marrying when she has given birth to a child even when she is bleeding (after the birth of the child) except that her husband should not go near her until she is purified.</p>

Then an animal like a donkey, or a goat, or a bird was brought to her and she rubbed her hand over it, and it so happened that one on which she rubbed her hand died.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa&#8217;id b Jubair reported: I was asked about the invokers of curses during the reign of Mus&#8217;ab (b. Zubair) whether they could separate (themselves by this process). He said: I did not understand what to say. So I went to the house of Ibn &#8216;Umar (Allah be pleased with them) in Mecca. I said to his servant: Seek permission for Me. He said that he (Ibn &#8216;Umar) had been taking rest. He (Ibn &#8216;Umar) heard my voice. and said: Are you Ibn Jubair? I said: Yes. He&#8217;said: Come in. By Allah, it must be some (great) need which has brought you here at this Hour. So I got in and found him lying on a blanket reclining against a pillow stuffed with fibres of date-palm. I said: O Abu&#8217;Abd al-Rahman, should there be separation between the invokers of curses? He said: Hallowed be Allah, yes, The first one who asked about it was so and so. he said: Messenger of Allah, tell me If one of us finds his wife committing adultery: what should he do? If he talks, that is something great, and if he keeps quiet that is also (something great) (which he cannot afford to do). Allah&#8217;s Prophet (may peace be upon him) kept quiet (or some time). After some time he (that very person) came to him (Allah&#8217;s Messenger) and said: I have been involved in that very cage about which I had asked you Allah the Exalted and Majestic then revealed (these) verses of Surah Nur:&#8221; Those who accuse their wives&#8221; (verse 6), and he (the Holy Prophet) recited them to him and admonished him, and exhorted him and informed him that the torment of the world is less painful than the torment of the Hereafter. He said: No, by Him Who sent you with Truth, I did not tell a lie against her. He (the Holy Prophet) then called her (the wife of that person who had accused her) and admonished her, and exhorted her, and informed her that the torment of this world is less painful than the torment of the Hereafter. She said: No, by Him Who sent thee with Truth, he is a liar. (it was) the man who started the swearing of oath and he swore in the name of Allah four times that he was among the truthful. and at the fifth turn he said: Let there be curse of Allah upon him if he were among the liars. Then the woman was called and she swore four times in the name of Allah that he (her husband) was among the liars, and at the fifth time (she said): Let there be curse upon her if he were among the truthful. He (the Holy Prophet) then effected separation between the two. A hadith like this is narrated by Ibn Numair with a slight variation of words.</p>

By Allah, I will definitely ask about him from Allah&#8217;s Mescenger (may peace be upon him). On the following day he came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and asked him thus: If a man were to find with his wife a man and if he were to talk about it, you would lash him; and if he killed, you would kill him, and if he were to keep quiet. he would consume anger, whereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Allah, solve (this problem), and he began to supplicate (before Him), and then the verses pertaining to li&#8217;an were revealed:&#8221; Those who accuse their wives and have no witnesses except themselves&#8221; (xxiv. 6). The person was then put to test according to these verses in the presence of the people. There came he and his wife in the presence of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), and they invoked curses (in order to testify their claim). The man swore four times in the name of Allah that he was one of the truthful and then invoked curse for the fifth time saying: Let there be curse of Allah upon him if he were among the liars. Then she began to invoke curse. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to her: just wait (and curse after considering over it), but she refused and invoked curse and when she turned away, he (Allah&#8217;s Apostle) said: It seems that this woman shall give birth to a curly-haired black child, And so she did gave birth to a curly-haired black child.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him) reported Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: A Muslim who emancipates a Muslim (slave). Allah will save from Fire every limb of his for every limb (of the slave). Sa&#8217;id b. Marjana said: When I heard this hadith from Abu Huraira (Allah be pleased with him), I went away and made a mention of it to &#8216;Ali b. Husain and he at once emancipated the slave for which Ibn ja&#8217;far was prepared to pay ten thousand dirhams or one thousand dinars.</p>
