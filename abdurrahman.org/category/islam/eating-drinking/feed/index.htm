<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>This questioner says: O virtuous Shaykh, l have heard that the Prophet, may the praise of Allah and peace be upon him, commanded that water should be drunk in one go. Is this correct?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzan:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is not correct. Rather the Prophet, may the praise of I Allah and peace be upon him, prohibited drinking water in one go. This is because it is in imitation to camels. The Prophet, may the praise of Allah and peace be upon him, instructed us to drink with three breaths. To drink with three breaths. Yes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="entry-title" style="text-align:center;"><strong>We should not eat while standing</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q: “Is it allowed to eat while standing?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh al-Albaani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I say, there is no text about the prohibition of eating while standing like there occurs the text prohibiting drinking while standing. But there is a narration from Anas bin Maalik رضي الله عنه that when he narrated to those around him in a gathering that the Prophet ﷺ prohibited drinking while standing, someone said to him: ‘What about eating (while standing)?’ He replied: ‘It is worse.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say here, we should follow this Companion because we don’t have anything with which we can contradict him. But what is the distinction between eating while standing and eating while walking? <strong>Eating while walking is allowed</strong>, because there is text clearly stating that they used to eat while walking during the time of the Prophet ﷺ. As for eating while standing, there is no text regarding it from the Prophet ﷺ, neither negative nor positive. All we have is this authentic narration from Anas bin Maalik and this is what we act upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, maybe some of you noticed in these times that it has become a fashion for the disbelievers to eat while standing although chairs are present; but they don’t sit on them out of pride. So then, the previous ruling is further strengthened. <strong>I say, we are with the narration of Anas, because Anas knew what we don’t know, and because the disbelievers nowadays and the Muslims who imitate them eat while standing, so we differ from them</strong>.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: <em>silsilat ul-hudaa wa nnoor – </em>the series of guidance and light &#8211; tape no. 692</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question #6: “Is it <em>sunnah</em> to eat with three fingers generally with respect to all food or specifically with <em>thareed</em>[1] only?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh al-Albaani </em>(<em>rahimahullaah</em>) answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There isn’t, in the <em>Sunnah</em> mentioned from the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa aalihi wa sallam</em>), that which will help us to answer this question. All there is, is that the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa aalihi wa sallam</em>) used to eat with three fingers; but that which is necessary for us to say about this <em>hadeeth</em> with regard to its<em> fiqh</em> (understanding) is that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Firstly, <strong>this <em>hadeeth</em> does not mean to determine that it is not permissible for the Muslim to eat by other means like the well-known spoons today</strong>. Rather, it only means that if the Muslim eats a food that can be eaten with three fingers, then he (should) not show that he is greedy with the food such that he eats with the whole handful while he is able to eat like the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa aalihi wa sallam</em>) used to eat, with three fingers. Secondly, it is known that gravy of meat, for example, cannot be eaten with three fingers; so there it is necessary (to use) other means to eat it. And this is from the worldly affairs and not from the affairs of the religion, which the Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa aalihi wa sallam</em>) was assigned that he conveys all the rulings of the religion to the people. He (<em>‘alayhi ssalaat wa ssalaam</em>) has said (regarding) worldly affairs: ‘You are more knowledgeable about your worldly affairs than me.’”[2]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">Taken from  ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">By the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 175  – From Abu Huraira who said: the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘One of you should not dare drink standing up.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Abu Huraira said: from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>: that he saw a man drinking standing up, so the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Vomit it out.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man asked: ‘Why?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Would it please you that a cat drank along with you?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man answered: ‘No.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘For indeed, someone more evil than a cat drank along with you! Shaytan!!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ahmad, Darmi and Tahawi , and Al-Albaani said this chain is Saheeh.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 176/2175 – From Abu Huraira who said that Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If the person who drank whilst standing knew what was in his stomach, he would vomit it out.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ahmad and Albaani said it was Saheeh]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 177 – From Anas from the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>: that ‘he prohibited’ – and in another wording: ‘rebuked us’ – from drinking while standing.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Muslim, Abu Dawood, Tirmidhi, Darmi, Ibn Majah &amp; Tahawi]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani commented:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The evident prohibition in these Ahadeeth acknowledge the prohibition of drinking whilst standing if you do not have an excuse. There are many Ahadeeth which mention that the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>drank standing up, so the scholars have differed in bringing harmony between the two different types of Ahadeeth.  The majority of the scholars hold the opinion that the prohibition is not a total prohibition, and that the command of vomiting after having drank is only a recommended action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hazm opposed them in this, and went with the ruling of the prohibition to drink standing up, and perhaps this opinion is closer to being correct.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the opinion that it is not a total prohibition then the wording ‘rebuked’ does not support that opinion, nor does the command ‘to vomit’, and what I mean by this is, that vomiting is a severe hardship upon humans, and I am not aware of such a hardship in the Sharia’ as a consequence for being lax about a recommended action! Likewise the saying of the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>: ‘Indeed Shaytan drank with you.’  Then this is a strict deterrent from drinking whilst standing up, and it cannot be inferred from this, that it is possible to say that, not sitting whilst drinking is merely leaving a recommended action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Ahadeeth which mention drinking whilst standing up, then we can assume that this is when there is an excuse for it, like if there is no space to sit, or that it is a hanging water skin and you need to reach it and this point has been indicated in some Ahadeeth, and Allaah knows Best.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;" align="center"><span style="color:#808080;">Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’.<br />
By the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani. </span><span style="color:#808080;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 71 – From AbdurRahman bin Jubayr who said: a man who used to serve the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> for eight years narrated to him: that he used to hear the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> say when food was brought close to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong><em>Bismillaah</em><br />
‘In the name of Allaah’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">when he would finish he would say:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#808000;"><b>Allãhumma &#8216;at`amta, wa &#8216;asqayta,  wa &#8216;aqnayta, wa hadayta, wa &#8216;ahyayta, falakal hamdu `alã mã &#8216;a`tayta</b> *</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘O Allaah! You fed, You gave drink, You satisfied, You guided, You gave life, so for You is praise for what You have given.’ </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Shaykh Albaani said:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And in this hadeeth it mentions that saying ‘<em>Bismillaah</em>’ (in the name of Allaah) is done when you begin to eat, and that you do not add anything extra to that ‘<em>Bismillaah</em>’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All the authentic <em>Ahadeeth</em> which have been mentioned regarding this topic, such as this hadeeth do not mention any extra wording, and I am not aware of it being mentioned in any hadeeth. Any extra wording is a <em>Bida’</em> according to the <em>Fuqaha </em>(Scholars of <em>Fiqh</em>) with the meaning of a real <em>Bida’</em>, as for the blind followers then their answer is well-known: ‘What’s wrong with extra wording?!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In fact we say: everything is wrong with it. Since it is a form of trying to amend the One who legislated the <em>Deen</em>, The Wise, Who never left anything whatsoever which will bring us closer to Allaah except that He ordered us with it and legislated it upon us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, if it was legislated to add extra wording to ‘<em>Bismillaah</em>’ and there was nothing wrong with that, then the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em> would have added an extra wording, even once. And is this extra wording added to saying ‘<em>Bismillaah</em>’ not like the extra wording added on to sending <em>Salaat</em> (Praise) upon the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>when someone sneezes and adds the <em>Salaat </em>(Praise) after saying ‘<em>Alhamdulillah</em>’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullaah ibn Umar <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> rejected this <em>Bida’</em> as is mentioned in the ‘<em>Mustadrak</em>’ of al-Hakim, and reaffirmed by Suyootee in ‘<em>al-Haaweeya lilfatawaa</em>’ that it is a disliked <em>Bida’</em>, so can the blind followers (<em>al-Muqalidoon</em>) give a reply to the reason which made Suyootee reaffirm that it is a <em>Bida’</em>! !</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the negligent people among them hastily accuse Suyootee – as is their habit to do so – that he is a Wahaabi! Even though Suyootee’s death took place before the death of Muhammad bin AbdulWahhab by about three hundred years! !</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This reminds me of a strange story which took place in some of the schools in Damascus.  One of the famous teachers from amongst the Christians was talking about the movement of Muhammad bin AbdulWahhab in the Arabian Peninsula, and how they fought against <em>Shirk</em>, <em>Bida’</em> and superstitions, and it seems as if he praised that movement, so some of his students said: it is evident that the teacher is a Wahhabi!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the other people, perhaps said that Suyootee was incorrect, however, where is the proof for this? ! On the contrary the proof is with Suyootee which is the saying of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>: ‘<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Whoever innovates something in this matter of ours that which is not of it, then it will be rejected</strong></span>.’ (Collected by Bukhari and Muslim).’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from ‘Riyadh as-Saliheen’ By Imaam an-Nawwawi<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Then when the (<em>Jumu’a</em> <em>Salah</em>) prayer has finished, you may disperse through the land, and seek the Bounty of Allaah (by working, etc.) &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Juma’ :10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">544 – On the authority of Abu Abdullaah az-Zubayr bin ‘Awwaam <em>–Radhiallaahu anhu-</em> who said: The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>said: ‘For one of you to take his ropes, go to a mountain, carry a bundle of wood on his back and then sell it – Allaah making that sufficient for him – is better for him than asking from people, whether they give or withhold.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhari</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">545 – On the authority of Abu Huraira <em>–Radhiallaahu anhu-</em>  who said: The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said: ‘For one of you to gather wood in a bundle on his back is better for him than asking/begging from anyone, they either give it to him or withhold it from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhari and Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">546 – On the authority of Abu Huraira <em>–Radhiallaahu anhu-</em> from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>  who said: ‘Dawood <em>–alayhi sallam- </em>never used to eat except from the earnings of his own hands.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhari</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">547 – On the authority of Abu Huraira that The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said: ‘Zakareeyaa <em>–alayhi sallam- </em>used to be a carpenter.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">548 – On the authority of al-Maqdaam bin Ma’ad Yakrib <em>–Rahiallaahu anhu-</em> from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> who said: ‘No one ever ate food better than that which he earned with his own hands.  Indeed the Prophet of Allaah, Dawood <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> used to eat from what his hands had earned.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhari</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#993300;">By the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 344- From Umar bin Abu Salmah who said: I was a young boy in the house of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> and my hands used to take food from all over the dish, the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam </em>&#8211; said to me:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O boy! If you eat, then say ‘Bismillaah’ and eat with your right hand and eat what is close to you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Albaani said: ‘In this hadeeth, there is evidence that the Sunnah regarding mentioning the name of Allaah when beginning food is to only say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">بسم الله</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">‘<strong>Bismillaah’ (In The Name of Allaah)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, there is the hadeeth of ‘Aeysha <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anha</em><em>&#8211;</em> where the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If one of you eats food, then he should say ‘<strong>Bismillaah</strong>’.  If you forget to say it when beginning then you should say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">‫بسم الله في أوله وفي آخره</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Bismillaah fee awwalihi wa fee aakhirihi</strong>’.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Tirmidhi, who authenticated it.  It also has a supporting narration in the hadeeth of Ibn Mas’ood.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hadeeth of Aeysha <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> was authenticated by Ibn al-Qayyim in ‘Az-Za’ad’ and was strengthened by al-Hafidh in ‘al-Fath’ where he said ‘It is the most clear hadeeth that has been mentioned regarding the manner of saying Bismillaah’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said, ‘As for the statement of an-Nawawi in ‘Al-Athkaar’ regarding the manners of eating in which he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The description for saying Bismillaah is the most important thing out of those things which are necessary to know,  it is best to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Bismillaahir-Rahmaanir-Raheem’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(In The Name of Allaah, The Most Merciful, The Bestower of Mercy).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if he says ‘Bismillaah’, then this would be sufficient and he would have fulfilled the Sunnah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hajr continues: I do not see any specific evidence to support his claim of being better.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (al-Albaani) say, there is nothing better than the Sunnah of the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> <strong>‘And the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad</strong> <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.’  Therefore, if nothing has been affirmed regarding saying ‘Bismillaah’ when commencing food except the saying of ‘Bismillaah’ alone, then it is not permissible to add extra wording to that saying of ‘Bismillaah’, nor to imply that there is an extra wording that is better than saying ‘Bismillaah’ alone!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because using this extra wording opposes that which is indicated in the hadeeth,<strong>‘And the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad</strong> <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from Silsilah Ahadeeth as-Saheehah  by Shaykh al-Albaani (No. 344)]</p>

Chapter 364<br />
Prohibition of using Utensils made of Gold and Silver</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1795.</b> Umm Salamah (May Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Whosoever drinks in utensils of silver, in fact, kindles in his belly the fire of Hell</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narration of Muslim is: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Verily, the person who eats or drinks in utensils made of gold and silver</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1796.</b>  Hudhaifah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) prohibited us from wearing silk or Dibaj and from drinking out of gold and silver vessels and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">These are meant for them (non-Muslims) in this world and for you in the Hereafter</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration Hudhaifah (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do not wear silk and Dibaj, nor eat or drink from utensils made of gold and silver</span>.&#8221;<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1797.</b> Anas bin Sirin (May Allah be pleased with him) said:<span style="color:#008000;"> I was with Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) in the company of some Magians when Faludhaj (a sweet made of flour and honey) was brought in a silver utensil, and Anas did not take it. The man was told to change the utensil. So he changed the utensil and when he brought it to Anas, he took it</span>.<br />
[Al-Baihaqi].</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1702.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">He who has eaten from this plant (i.e., garlic) should not approach us and should not offer Salat (prayer) along with us</span>.&#8221;<br />

A bedouin said to him: &#8220;What sort of sitting is that?&#8221; Thereupon Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Verily, Allah has made me a courteous slave not a fierce tyrant.&#8221;</span> Then he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Eat from the sides of the bowl and leave the central part of it so that your food will be blessed.&#8221;</span><br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>

Chapter 111<br />
Etiquette of Drinking Water</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>757.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to breathe three times in the course of a drink (he used to drink in three gulps).</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>758.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Do not drink in one gulp like a camel, but in two or three (gulps). Mention the Name of Allah (i.e., say Bismillah) when you start drinking and praise Him (i.e., say Al-hamdu lillah) after you have finished (drinking).&#8221;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>759.</b> Abu Qatadah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) forbade breathing into the vessel while drinking.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>760.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Milk mixed with water was brought to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). On his right side was sitting a bedouin and on his left was sitting Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him). He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) drank from it and handed the rest to the bedouin saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;One who is on the right has preference, then again the one who is on the right.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>761.</b> Sahl bin Sa`d (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A drink was brought to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and he drank (some) from it. On his right was a boy and on his left were some elderly people. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to the boy,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Would you permit me to give rest of this drink to these on my left?&#8217;</span>&#8216; The boy said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, I would certainly not give preference to anyone in anything that might come to me from you.&#8221; So he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) handed over the rest of the drink to him.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 align="Center"><a href="#">Imam Al-Nawawi&#8217;s Riyad-us-Saliheen</a><br />
Chapter 114<br />
Permission to Drink while in a standing Posture</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>767.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> I served Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) Zamzam water to drink and he drank it while he was standing.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>768.</b> An-Nazzal bin Sabrah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> `Ali bin Abu Talib (May Allah be pleased with him) arrived at Bab Ar-Rahbah (in Kufah) and drank water in a standing posture.</span> Then he said:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;I saw Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) doing what you have seen me doing.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>769.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> During the lifetime of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) we would eat while walking and would drink while standing.</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>770.</b> `Amr bin Shu`aib on the authority of his father and grandfather reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> that they saw Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) drink standing, and sitting</span>.<br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The last three Ahadith point out the permissibility of eating and drinking while walking or standing or sitting, but drinking in the sitting position remains the best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>771.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) forbade us from drinking while standing. Qatadah reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;We asked him: `What about eating?&#8221;&#8217;</span> He said:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;That is even worse, (or may be he said) more detestable.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Another narration is: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) reprimanded us for drinking while standing.<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>772.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;None of you should drink standing; and if any one forgets, he must vomit.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 align="Center"><a href="#">Imam Al-Nawawi&#8217;s Riyad-us-Saliheen</a><br />
Chapter 109<br />
Excellence of Eating with three Fingers and Licking them</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>748.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;When  one of you finishes eating, he should not wipe his fingers until he has licked them himself or has given them to someone else to lick for him.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>749.</b> Ka`b bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> I saw Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) eating with three fingers (i.e., the thumb, the index finger and the middle finger) and licking them after having finished the food.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>750.</b> Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) commanded the licking of fingers and the gleaning of the dish, saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;You do not know in which portion the blessing lies.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>751.</b> Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;When a morsel of any of you falls, he should pick it up and remove any of the dirt on it and then eat it, and should not leave it for Satan nor should wipe his hand with towel until he has licked his fingers, for he does not know in what portion of the food the blessing lies.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>752.</b> Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Satan appears at every thing done by you; he appears even at one&#8217;s dinner. When a morsel of any of you falls, he should pick it up and remove any dirt on it, and then eat it. He should not leave it for Satan, nor should he wipe his hand with the towel until he has licked his fingers, for he does not know in what portion of the food the blessing lies.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>753.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Whenever Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) ate food, he would lick his three fingers and say,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;If anyone of you drops a morsel of food, he should remove any dirt that may have stuck on it and then eat it, and should not leave it for Satan.&#8221;</span> He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) also commanded us that we should glean the pot, saying, &#8220;You do not know in which part of your food the blessings lies.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>754.</b> Sa`id bin Al-Harith reported: I asked Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) whether it was obligatory to make Wudu&#8217; for Salat (prayer) after eating cooked food. He said:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;No, because in the lifetime of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), such food was rarely available. We had no handkerchiefs, so when we ate such food we would wipe our fingers against our palms, forearms or (the sole of our) feet, and would offer Salat without fresh Wudu&#8217; (for prayer).&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>

Eating from what is in front of One</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>740.  `</b>Umar bin Abu Salamah (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: I was a boy under the care of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), and as my hand used to wander around in the dish, he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to me once,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Mention Allah&#8217;s Name (i.e., say Bismillah), eat with your right hand, and eat from what is in front of you.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>741.</b> Salamah bin Al-Akwa` (May Allah be pleased with him) reported on the authority of his father: A man ate with his left hand in the presence of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), whereupon he said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Eat with your right hand.&#8221;</span> The man said: &#8220;I cannot do that.&#8221; Thereupon he (the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;May you not be able to do that.&#8221;</span> It was vanity that prevented him from doing it and he could not raise it (the right hand) up to his mouth afterwards.<br />
[Muslim].</p>

Chapter 116<br />
Permissibility of drinking water from clean Vessels of all types except Gold and<br />
Silver ones</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>774.</b> Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Once the time for As-Salat (the prayer) approached. Those whose houses were near, went to their houses to perform Wudu&#8217; while some of the people remained with Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). A stone (containing some water) bowl was brought for him. It was too small for him to spread his hand over it. He performed his Wudu&#8217; and it (the water) sufficed for all the others also. Anas was asked:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;How many of you were present there?&#8221;</span> He said:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Eighty or more.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration in Muslim is: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) called for a vessel containing water. A wide shallow vessel with a little water in it was brought for him. He put his fingers in it. Anas says<span style="color:#008000;">: &#8220;I kept looking at the water pouring from between his fingers. I estimated that the number of people who made their Wudu&#8217; with it was from seventy to eighty.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>775.</b> `Abdullah bin Zaid (May Allah be pleased with him) reported:<span style="color:#008000;"> The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) visited us and we brought water for him in a brass vessel for his ablution and he performed ablution.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>776.</b> Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) visited the house of a man of the Ansar with one of his Companions and said to him,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;If you have some water in the water-skin left over from last night, give it to us for drinking; otherwise, we shall drink from some stream directly.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>777.</b> Hudhaifah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) prohibited us from wearing brocade or silk and drinking out of gold or silver vessels and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;These are meant for them (disbelievers) in this world and for you in the Hereafter.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>778.</b> Umm Salamah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He who drinks from the vessel of silver kindles the Fire (of Hell) in his belly.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>

Chapter 100<br />
Mentioning Bismillah before and saying Al-Hamdulillah after Eating</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>728.</b> `Umar bin Abu Salamah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), said to me,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Mention Allah&#8217;s Name (i.e., say Bismillah before starting eating), eat with your right hand, and eat from what is near you.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>729.</b>  `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;When any of you wants to eat, he should mention the Name of Allah in the begining, (i.e., say Bismillah). If he forgets to do it in the beginning, he should say Bismillah awwalahu wa akhirahu (I begin with the Name of Allah at the beginning and at the end).&#8221;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi and Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>730.</b> Jabir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;If a person mentions the Name of Allah upon entering his house or eating, Satan says, addressing his followers: `You will find no where to spend the night and no dinner.&#8217; But if he enters without mentioning the Name of Allah, Satan says (to his followers); `You have found (a place) to spend the night in, and if he does not mention the Name of Allah at the time of eating, Satan says: `You have found (a place) to spend the night in as well as food.&#8221;&#8217;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>731.</b> Hudhaifah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: When we attended a meal with the  Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), we would not stretch forth our hands towards the food until he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) would start eating first. Once, we were with him when a little girl rushed in as if someone was impelling her. She was about to lay her hand on the food when the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) caught her hand. Then a bedouin came in rushing as if someone were pushing him. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) caught his hand also and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Satan considers that food lawful for himself on which the Name of Allah is not mentioned. He (Satan) brought this girl to make the food lawful through her but I caught her hand. Then he brought the bedouin to make it lawful through him but I caught his hand too. By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, now Satan&#8217;s hand is in my grasp along with their hands.&#8221;</span> Then he mentioned the Name of Allah and began to eat.<br />
[Abu Dawud and An-Nasa&#8217;i].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>732.</b> Umaiyyah bin Makhshi (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was sitting while a man was eating food. That man did not mention the Name of Allah (before commencing to eat) till only a morsel of food was left. When he raised it to his mouth, he said: &#8220;Bismillah awwalahu wa akhirahu (With the Name of Allah, in the beginning and in the end).&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) smiled at this and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Satan had been eating with him but when he mentioned the Name of Allah, Satan vomited all that was in his stomach.&#8221;</span><br />
[Abu Dawud and An-Nasa&#8217;i].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>733.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was eating with his six Companions when a desert Arab came and ate up the food in two mouthfuls. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Had he mentioned the Name of Allah, it would have sufficed for all of you.&#8221;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>734.</b> Abu Umamah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Whenever the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) finished a meal, he would say:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Al-hamdu lillahi kathiran taiyiban mubarakan fihi, ghaira makfiyyin wa la muwadda`in, wa la mustaghnan `anhu, Rabbuna. (All praise is due to Allah, praise which is abundant, pure, and full of blessings, which is indispensable and to which one cannot be indifferent).&#8221;  </span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>735.</b> Mu`adh bin Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He who has taken food and says at the end: `Al-hamdu lillahi-lladhi at`amani hadha, wa razaqanihi min ghairi haulin minni wa la quwwatin (All praise is due to Allah Who has given me food to eat and provided it without any endeavour on my part or any power),&#8217; all his past sins will be forgiven.&#8221;</span><br />
At-Tirmidhi].</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Ali b. Abu Talib reported; There fell to my lot along with    Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) an old she-camel from the spoils of Badr.    Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) granted me another camel. I made them kneel down    one day at the door of an Ansari, and I wanted to carry on them Idhkhir (a kind of grass)    in order to sell that. There was with me a goldsmith of the tribe of Qainuqa&#8217;. I saught to    give a wedding feast (on the occasion of marriage with) Fatima with the help of that (the    price accrued from the sale of this grass). And Hamza b. &#8216;Abd al-Muttalib was busy in    drinking in that house in the company of a singing girl who was singing to him. She said:    Hamza, get up for slaughtering the fat she-camels. Hamza attacked them with the sword and    cut off their humps and ripped their haunches, and then took out their livers. I said to    Ibn Shihab: Did he take out anything from the hump? He said: He cut off the humps    altogether. Ibn Shihab reported &#8216;Ali having said: I saw this (horrible) sight and it    shocked me, and I came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and there was Zaid b,    Haritha with him and communicated to him this news. He came in the company of Zaid and I    also went along with him and he went to Hamza and he expressed anger with him. Hamza    raised his eyes and said: Are you (not) but the servants of my father? Allah&#8217;s Messenger    (may peace be upon him) turned back on his heels (on hearing this) until he went away from    them.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Husain b. &#8216;Ali reported &#8216;Ali having said: There fell to my    lot a she-camel out of the spoils of war on the Day of Badr, and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may    peace be upon him) gave me (another) she-camel on that day out of the Khums (one-fifth    reserved for Allah and His Messenger). When I made up my mind to consummate my marriage    with Fatima, the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), I prevailed upon a    goldsmith of the tribe of Qainuqa&#8217; to go along with me so that we might bring Idhkhir    wishing to sell that to the goldsmiths and thus I should be able to arrange my wedding    feast. While I was arranging the equipments. i. e. litters, sacks and ropes, my two    she-camels were sitting down at the side of the apartment of a person of the Ansar. I    collected (the different articles of equipment) and found to my surprise that their humps    had been chopped off and their haunches had been cut off and their livers had been taken    out. I could not help weeping when I saw that plight of theirs. I said: Who has done that?    They said: Hamza b. &#8216;Abd al-Muttalib has done this. and he is in this house dead drunk in    the company of some of the Ansair with asinging girl singing before him and his    companions. She said in her song: O Hamza. get up and attack these falty she-camels.    Thereupon Hamza stood up with a sword (in his hand) and cut off their humps and ripped    their haunches and tore out their livers. &#8216;Ali said: I went away until I came to Allah&#8217;s    Messenger (may peace be upon him) and there was with him Zaid b. Haritha. Allah&#8217;s    Messenger (may peace be upon him) recognised from my face what I had experienced,    whereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: What has happened to you? I    said: Messenger of Allah, by Allah, I have never seen (such an unfortunate day) as this    day. Hamza has committed aggression to my she-camels, and has cut off their humps. and    ripped their haunches, and he is in a house in the company of some drunkards. (Hearing    this) Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) sent for his mantle and, putting it on    him, he proceeded, and I and Zaid b. Haritha followed him, until he came to the door (of    the house) in which there was Hamza. He (the Holy Prophet) sought permission which they    granted him. and they were all drunk. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) began to    reprimand Hamza for what he had done. Hamza&#8217;s eyes were red. He cast a glance at Allah&#8217;s    Messenger (may peace be upon him) and then looked towards his knees. and then lifted his    eyes and cast a glance at his waist and then lifted his eyes and saw his face. And then    Hamza said: Are you anything but the slaves of my father? Alah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be    upon him) came to know that he was intoxicated, and he thus turned upon his heels, and    came out, and we also came out along with him.</font></p>

Their liquor had been    prepared from dry dates or fresh dates when the announcer made the announcement. He (Abu    Talha) said to me: Go out and find out (what the announcement is). I got out (and found)    an announcer making this announcement: Behold, liquor has been declared unlawful. He said:    The liquor (was spilt and) flawed in the lanes of Medina. Abu Talha said to me: Go out and    Spill it, and I spilt it. They said or some of them said: Such and such were killed, such    and such were killed for (the wine) had been in their stomachs. He (the narrator) said. I    do not know whether it is the narration transmitted by Anas, (or by someone else).

They said: (He has done    that to relieve) his hunger. I went to Abu Talha, the husband of Umm Sulaim, the daughter    of Milhan, and said to him: Father, I saw Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) having    bandaged his belly. I asked some of his Companions (the reason of it) and they said that    it was due to hunger. Abu Talha came to mv mother and said: Is there anything? She said:    Yes, I have some pieces of bread with me and some dates.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Jabir b. &#8216;Abdullah reported: While I was sitting in my    house there happened to pass by me Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). He made a    gesture to me and I stood up for him. He took hold of my hand until we came to one of the    apartments of his wives. He entered and then asked me to get in. So I entered and there    was hanging a curtain beside her. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Is there any food (with    you)? They (the members of the household) said: Yes And then there were brought three    loaves of bread for him (the Holy Prophet) and placed in the basket of palm leaves.    Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) picked up one loaf and placed that before him,    and then picked up another one and placed it before me. He then picked up the third one    and broke it into two parts, and kept the one-half before him and the other half before    me, and then said: Is there any condiment? They (the members of the household) said: There    is nothing (in the form of condiment) but some vinegar only. He said: Bring that, for    vinegar is a good condiment.</font></p>

She said: No, but only a subsistence for our    children. He said: Distract their attention with something, and when the guest enters    extinguish the lamp and give him the impression that we are eating. So they sat down. and    the guest had his meal. When it was morning he went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon    him) who said: Allah was well pleased with what you both did for your guest this night.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Miqdad reported: I and two of my companions were so much    afflicted by hunger that we had lost our power of seeing and hearing. We presented    ourselves (as guests) to the Companions of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him), but    none amongst them would entertain us. So we came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon    him), and he took us to his residence and there were three goats. Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may    peace be upon him) said: Milk these for us. So we milked them and every person amongst us    drank his share and we set aside the share of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him). (It    was his habit) to come during the night and greet (the people present there) in a manner    that would not wake up one in sleep but make one who was awake hear it. He would then go    to the mosque and say prayer, then go to the milk and drink it. Miqdad added: One night    the Satan came to me when I had taken my share, and he said: Muhammad has gone to the    Ansar, who would offer him hospitality and he would get what is with them, and he has no    need for this draught (of milk). So I took (that milk) and drank it, and when it had    penetrated deeply in my stomach and I was certain that there was no way out (but to digest    it), the Satan aroused (my sense of) remorse and said: Woe be to thee! what have you done?    You have taken the drink reserved for Muhammad! When he would come and he would not find    it, he would curse you, and you would be ruined, and thus there would go (waste) this    world and the Hereafter (for) you. There was a sheet over me; as I placed (pulled) it upon    my feet, my head was uncovered and as I placed it upon my head, my feet were uncovered,    and I could not sleep, but my two companions had gone to sleep for they had not done what    I had done. There came Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him), and he greeted as he used    to greet (by saying as-Salamu &#8216;Alaikum). He then came to the mosque and observed prayer    and then came to his drink (milk) and uncovered it, but did not find anything in it. He    raised his head towards the sky, and I said (to myself) that he (the Holy Prophet) was    going to invoke curse upon me and I would be thus ruined; but he (the Holy Prophet) said:    Allah, feed him who fed me and give drink to him who provided me drink. I held tight the    sheet upon myself (and when he had supplicated), I took hold of the knife and went to the    goats (possessed by the Holy Prophet) so that I may slauhter one for Allah&#8217;s Messenger    (may peace be upon him) which was the fattest amongst them, and in fact all of them were    milch goats; then I took hold of the vessel which belonged to the family of Allah&#8217;s    Messenger (may peace be upon him) in which they used to milk and drink therefrom, and    milked them in that until it swelled up with foam. I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace    be upon him) and he said: Have you taken your share of the milk during the night? I said:    Drink it. and he drank it; he then handed over (the vessel) to me and I said: Allah&#8217;s    Messenger, drink it, and he drank it and handed over (the vessel) to me again, I then    perceived that Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) had been satiated and I had got his    blessings. I burst into laughter (so much) so that I fell upon the ground, whereupon    Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Miqdad, it must be one of your mischiefs.    I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, this affair of mind is like this and this. and I have done so.    Thereupon. Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: This is nothing but a mercy from    Allah. Why is it that you did not give me an opportunity so that we should have awakened    our two friends and they would have got their share (of the milk)? I said: By Him Who has    sent you with Truth. I do not mind whatever you give (to them), and whatever the (other)    people happen to get, when I had got it along with you from among the people.</font></p>

He (the Holy Prophet) bought a sheep from him, and it was slaughtered and its meat was    prepared, and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) commanded that its liver should be    roasted.

And he (the Holy Prophet) filled two bowls (one with soup and the other with mutton) and    we all ate out of them to our hearts&#8217; content, but (still) some part was (left) in (those)    two bowls, and I placed it on the camel- (or words to the same effect).</font></p>

Once the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said (to his    Companions): He who amongst you has food for two persons should take three (guests with    him). and he who has with him food for four persons should take five or six (guests with    him for entertaining them). It was (in accordance with these instructions of the Holy    Prophet) that Abu Bakr brought three persons, and the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon    him) brought ten persons (as guests to their respective houses). Abu Bakr had brought    three persons (he himself, and myself), my father and my mother (along with therm). He    (the narrator) said: I do not know whether he also said: My wife and one servant who was    common between our house and that of Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr had had his evening meal with    Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him). He stayed here until night prayer had been    offered. He then came back (to the house of Allah&#8217;s Apostle) and stayed there until    Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) felt drowsy and (Abu Bakr) then came (back to    his own house) when (a considerable) part of the night had been over, as Allah had    desired. His wife said to him: What held you back from your guests? He said: Oh! have you    not served them the evening meal (by this time)? She said: It was in fact served to them.    but they refused to eat until you came. He (&#8216;Abd al-Rahman) said: I slunk away and bid    myself. He (Abu Bakr) said: O, you stupid fellow, and he reprimanded me, and said to the    guests: Eat, though it may not be pleasant now. He said: By Allah. I will never eat it He    (&#8216;Abd al-Rahman) said: By Allah. we did not take a morsel when from beneath that (there    appeared) more until they had eaten to their fill, and lo! it was more than what it was    before. Abu Bakr saw that and found that it was so or more than that. He said to his wife:    Sister of Band Firis, what is th-is? She said: By the coolness of my eyes. it is in excess    by three times over the previous one. Then Abu Bakr ate saying: That was from the Satan    (viz. his vow for not eating the food). He then took a morsel out of that and then took it    (the rest) to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), and it was kept there until    morning, and during (those days) there was a covenant between us and some other people,    and the period of covenant was over, and we had appointed twelve officials with every    person amongst them. It is Allah only Who knows as to how many people were there with each    of them. He sent (this food to them) and all of them ate out of it.</font></p>

When it was evening we served the food to them, but they refused    saying: So long as the owner of the house does not come and join us, we would not take the    meal. I said to them: He (&#8216;Abd Bakr) is a stern person, and if you would not do that (if    you do not take the food). I fear, I may be harmed by him, but they refused. As he (my    father) came, the first thing he asked was: Have you served the guests? They (the peopleof    the household) said: We have not served them sofar. He said: Did I not command &#8216;Abd    al-Rahman (to do this)? He (&#8216;Abd al-Rahman) said: I slunk away and kept myself away by    that time.

I provided them with food but they refused to eat until you    came. He said to them: Why is it that you did not accept our food?

He again    said: What I did first (that is the taking of vow for not eating the food) was prompted by    the Satan. Bring the food. The food was brought, and he ate by reciting the name of Allah    and they also ate, and when it was morning he came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon    him) and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, their oath (that of the guests) came to be true, but    mine was not true, and after that he informed him of the whole incident.

I said: Even if them (the trained dogs) kill that (the game)? He (the Holy    Prophet) said: Even if these kill, but (on the condition) that no other dog, which you did    not set off (along with your dogs), participates (in catching the game). I said to him: I    throw Mi&#8217;rad, a heavy featherless blunt arrow, for hunting and killing (the game).    Thereupon he said: When you throw Mi&#8217;rad, and it pierces, then eat, but if it falls flatly    (and beats the game to death), then do not eat that.</font></p>

I asked the Messenger of Allah    (may peace be upon him) about (hunting with the help of) dogs, whereupon he said. When you    send your dog (for hunting) reciting the name of Allah, then eat (the game), but if some    part of it is eaten (by the dogs, then do not eat that, for it (your dog) has caught that    (the-game) for itself.

And he found for us nothing    besides it. Abu Ubaida gave each of us one date (everyday). I (Abu Zubair, one of the    narrators) said: What did you do with that? He said: We sucked that just as a baby sucks    and then drank water over that, and it sufficed us for the day until night. We beat off    leaves with the help of our staffs, then drenched them with water and ate them. We then    went to the coast of the sea, and there rose before us on the coast of the sea something    like a big mound. We came near that and we found that it was a beast, called al-&#8216;Anbar    (spermaceti whale). Abu &#8216;Ubaida said. It is dead. He then said: No (but it does not    matter), we have been sent by the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) in the path    of Allah and you are hard pressed (on account of the scarcity of food), so you eat that.    We three hundred in number stayed there for a month, until we grew bulky. He (Jabir) said:    I saw how we extracted pitcher after pitcher full of fat from the cavity of its eye, and    sliced from it compact piece of meat equal to a bull or like a bull. Abu &#8216;Ubaida called    forth thirteen men from us and he made them sit in the cavity of its eye, and he took hold    of one of the ribs of its chest and made it stand and then saddled the biggest of the    camels we had with us and it passed under it (the arched rib), and we provided ourselves    with pieces of boiled meat (especially for use in our journey). When we came back to    Medina, we went to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and made a mention of that to    him, whereupon he said: That was a provision which Allah had brought forth for you. Is    there any piece of meat (left) with you, so tnat you give to us that? He (Jabir) said: We    sent to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) tome of that (a piece of meat) and he    ate it.</font></p>

We were three hundred riders and our chief    (leader) was &#8216;Ubaida b. al-Jarrah. We were on the look out for a caravan of the Quraish.    So we stayed on the coast for half a month, and were so much afflicted by extreme hunger    that we (were obliged) to eat leaves. That is why it was called the Detachment of the    Leaves. The ocean cast out for us an animal which was called al-&#8216;Anbar (whale). We ate of    that for half of the month and rubbed its fat on our (bodies) until our bodies became    stout. Abu &#8216;Ubaida caught hold of one of its ribs and fixed that up. He then cast a glance    at the tallest man of the army and the highest of the camels. and then made him ride over    that, and that-tnan passed beneath it (the rib), and many a man could sit in its    eye-socket, and we extracted many pitchers of fat from the cavity of its eye. We had small    bags containing dates with us (before finding the whale). &#8216;Ubaida gave every person    amongst us a handful of dates (and when the provision ran short), he then gave each one of    us one date. And when that (stock) was exhausted, we felt its loss.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Talha had the largest number of datepalms from amongst  the Ansars of Medina. The dearest of his property to him was Bairuha garden which was  facing the (Prophet&#8217;s) Mosque. Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to enter it and drink of its good  fresh water. When the Holy Verse:&#8211; &#8216;By no means shall you attain righteousness unless you  spend (in charity) of that which you love.&#8217; (3.92) was revealed, Abu Talha got up and  said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah says: By no means shall you attain righteousness  unless you spend of that which you love,&#8217; and the dearest of my property to me is the  Bairuha garden and I want to give it in charity in Allah&#8217;s Cause, seeking to be rewarded  by Allah for that. So you can spend it, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, where-ever Allah instructs you.  &#8216; Allah s Apostle said, &#8220;Good! That is a perishable (or profitable) wealth&#8221;  (&#8216;Abdullah is in doubt as to which word was used.) He said, &#8220;I have heard what you  have said but in my opinion you&#8217;d better give it to your kith and kin.&#8221; On that Abu  Talha said, &#8220;I will do so, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; Abu Talha distributed that garden  among his kith and kin and cousins. </font></p>

All those who want to perform ablution. The blessing is from  Allah.&#8221; I saw the water gushing out from his fingers. So the people performed the  ablution and drank, and I tried to drink more of that water (beyond my thirst and  capacity), for I knew that it was a blessing. The sub-narrator said: I asked Jabir,  &#8220;How many persons were you then?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;We were one-thousand four  hundred men.&#8221; Salim said: Jabir said, 1500. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once while I was in a state of fatigue (because of severe  hunger), I met &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab, so I asked him to recite a verse from Allah&#8217;s Book to  me. He entered his house and interpreted it to me. (Then I went out and) after walking for  a short distance, I fell on my face because of fatigue and severe hunger. Suddenly I saw  Allah&#8217;s Apostle standing by my head. He said, &#8220;O Abu Huraira!&#8221; I replied,  &#8220;Labbaik, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and Sadaik!&#8221; Then he held me by the hand, and made  me get up. Then he came to know what I was suffering from. He took me to his house, and  ordered a big bowl of milk for me. I drank thereof and he said, &#8220;Drink more, O Abu  Hirr!&#8221; So I drank again, whereupon he again said, &#8220;Drink more.&#8221; So I drank  more till my belly became full and looked like a bowl. Afterwards I met &#8216;Umar and  mentioned to him what had happened to me, and said to him, &#8220;Somebody, who had more  right than you, O &#8216;Umar, took over the case. By Allah, I asked you to recite a Verse to me  while I knew it better than you.&#8221; On that Umar said to me, &#8220;By Allah, if I  admitted and entertained you, it would have been dearer to me than having nice red camels.  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I was a boy under the care of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and my hand  used to go around the dish while I was eating. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to me, &#8216;O boy!  Mention the Name of Allah and eat with your right hand, and eat of the dish what is nearer  to you.&#8221; Since then I have applied those instructions when eating. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once I ate a meal with Allah&#8217;s Apostle and I was eating  from all sides of the dish. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to me, &#8220;Eat of the dish what is  nearer to you.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A meal was brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle while his step-son,  &#8216;Umar bin Abi Salama was with him. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to him, &#8220;Mention the Name of  Allah and eat of the dish what is nearer to you.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A tailor invited Allah&#8217;s Apostle to a meal which he had  prepared.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 65, Number 293: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Talha said to Um Sulaim, &#8220;I have heard the voice  of Allah&#8217;s Apostle which was feeble, and I think that he is hungry. Have you got something  (to eat)?&#8221; She took out some loaves of barley bread, then took her face-covering  sheet and wrapped the bread in part of it, and pushed it under my garment and turned the  rest of it around my body and sent me to Allah&#8217;s Apostle . I went with that, and found  Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the mosque with some people. I stood up near them, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle  asked me, &#8220;Have you been sent by Abu Talha?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He asked,  &#8220;With some food (for us)?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to  all those who were with him, &#8220;Get up!&#8221; He set out (and all the people  accompanied him) and I proceeded ahead of them till I came to Abu Talha. Abu Talha then  said, &#8220;O Um Sulaim! Allah&#8217;s Apostle has arrived along with the people, and we do not  have food enough to feed them all.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know  better.&#8221; So Abu Talha went out till he met Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Then Abu Talha and  Allah&#8217;s Apostle came and entered the house. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Um Sulaim ! Bring  whatever you have.&#8221; She brought that very bread. The Prophet ordered that it be  crushed into small pieces, and Um Sulaim pressed a skin of butter on it. Then Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said whatever Allah wished him to say (to bless the food) and then added,  &#8220;Admit ten (men).&#8221; So they were admitted, ate their fill and went out. The  Prophet then said, &#8220;Admit ten (more).&#8221; They were admitted, ate their full, and  went out. He then again said, &#8220;Admit ten more!&#8221; They were admitted, ate their  fill, and went out. He admitted ten more, and so all those people ate their fill, and they  were eighty men. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were one hundred and thirty men sitting with the  Prophet. The Prophet said, &#8220;Have anyone of you any food with him?&#8221; It happened  that one man had one Sa of wheat flour (or so) which was turned into dough then. After a  while a tall lanky pagan came, driving some sheep. The Prophet asked, &#8216;Will you sell us (a  sheep), or give (it to) us as a gift?&#8221; The pagan said, &#8220;No, but I will sell it  &#8221; So the Prophet bought from him a sheep which was slaughtered, and then the Prophet  ordered that the liver, the kidneys, lungs and heart, etc., of that sheep be roasted. By  Allah, none of those one hundred and thirty men but had his share of those things. The  Prophet gave to those who were present, and also kept a share for those who were absent He  then served that cooked sheep in two big trays and we all ate together our fill; yet there  remained a part of it in those two trays which I carried on the camel. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We went out with Allah&#8217;s Apostle to Khaibar, and when we  were at As-Sahba&#8217;, (Yahya, a sub-narrator said, &#8220;As-Sahba&#8217; is a place at a distance  of one day&#8217;s journey to Khaibar).&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked the people to bring their  food, but there was nothing with the people except Sawiq. So we all chewed and ate of it.  Then the Prophet asked for some water and he rinsed his mouth, and we too, rinsed our  mouths. Then he led us in the Maghrib prayer without performing ablution (again). </font></p>

The Prophet invited the people to  those mastigures and they were eaten on his dining sheet, but the Prophet did not eat of  it, as if he disliked it.

He found with her a roasted mastigure which her sister  Hufaida bint Al-Harith had brought from Najd. Maimuna presented the mastigure before  Allah&#8217;s Apostle who rarely started eating any (unfamiliar) food before it was described  and named for him. (But that time) Allah&#8217;s Apostle stretched his hand towards the (meat of  the) mastigure whereupon a lady from among those who were present, said, &#8220;You should  inform Allah&#8217;s Apostle of what you have presented to him. O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! It is the  meat of a mastigure.&#8221; (On learning that) Allah&#8217;s Apostle withdrew his hand from the  meat of the mastigure.

Is this unlawful  to eat?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8220;No, but it is not found in the land of my  people, so I do not like it.&#8221; Khalid said, &#8220;Then I pulled the mastigure (meat)  towards me and ate it while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was looking at me. </font></p>

One day I brought a poor man to eat with him, the man ate too  much, whereupon Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Nafi&#8217;! Don&#8217;t let this man enter my house, for I  heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;A believer eats in one intestine (is satisfied with a  little food), and a kafir (unbeliever) eats in seven intestines (eats much food).&#8221; </font></p>

Khalid asked, &#8220;Is it unlawful to eat?&#8221;  the Prophet said, &#8220;No, but it is not found in the land of my people and that is why I  do not like eating it.&#8221; So Khalid started eating (it) while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was  looking at him.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Urban bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>who attended the Badr battle and was from the Ansar, that  he came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have lost my eyesight and I  lead my people in the prayer (as an Imam). When it rains, the valley which is between me  and my people, flows with water, and then I cannot go to their mosque to lead them in the  prayer. O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I wish that you could come and pray in my house so that I may  take it as a praying place. The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah willing, I will do that.&#8221;  The next morning, soon after the sun had risen, Allah&#8217;s Apostle came with Abu Bakr. The  Prophet asked for the permission to enter and I admitted him. The Prophet had not sat till  he had entered the house and said to me, &#8220;Where do you like me to pray in your  house?&#8221; I pointed at a place in my house whereupon he stood and said, &#8220;Allahu  Akbar.&#8221; We lined behind him and he prayed two Rakat and finished it with Taslim. We  then requested him to stay for a special meal of Khazira which we had prepared. A large  number of men from the adjoining area gathered in the house. One of them said, &#8220;Where  is Malik bin Ad-Dukhshun?&#8221; Another man said, &#8220;He is a hypocrite and does not  love Allah and His Apostle.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Do not say so. Do you not think  that he has said: &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah,&#8221; seeking  Allah&#8217;s pleasure? The man said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better, but we have  always seen him mixing with hypocrites and giving them advice.&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Allah has forbidden the (Hell) Fire for those who testify that none has the right to  be worshipped but Allah, seeking Allah&#8217;s pleasure. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet did not do that (i.e., forbade the storage of  the meat of sacrifices for three days) except (he did so) so that the rich would feed the  poor. But later we used to keep even trotters to cook, fifteen days later. The family of  Muhammad did not eat wheat bread with meat or soup to their satisfaction for three  successive days. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I was a guest of Abu Huraira for seven days. Abu Huraira,  his wife and his slave used to get up and remain awake for one-third of the night by  turns. Each would offer the night prayer and then awaken the other. I heard Abu Huraira  saying, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle distributed dates among his companions and my share was  seven dates, one of which was a Hashafa (a date which dried on the tree before it was  fully ripe). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>There was a Jew in Medina who used to lend me money up to  the season of plucking dates. (Jabir had a piece of land which was on the way to Ruma).  That year the land was not promising, so the payment of the debt was delayed one year. The  Jew came to me at the time of plucking, but gathered nothing from my land. I asked him to  give me one year respite, but he refused. This news reached the Prophet whereupon he said  to his companions, &#8220;Let us go and ask the Jew for respite for Jabir.&#8221; All of  them came to me in my garden, and the Prophet started speaking to the Jew, but he Jew  said, &#8220;O Abu Qasim! I will not grant him respite.&#8221; When the Prophet saw the  Jew&#8217;s attitude, he stood up and walked all around the garden and came again and talked to  the Jew, but the Jew refused his request. I got up and brought some ripe fresh dates and  put it in front of the Prophet. He ate and then said to me, &#8220;Where is your hut, O  Jabir?&#8221; I informed him, and he said, &#8220;Spread out a bed for me in it.&#8221; I  spread out a bed, and he entered and slept. When he woke up, I brought some dates to him  again and he ate of it and then got up and talked to the Jew again, but the Jew again  refused his request. Then the Prophet got up for the second time amidst the palm trees  loaded with fresh dates, and said, &#8220;O Jabir! Pluck dates to repay your debt.&#8221;  The Jew remained with me while I was plucking the dates, till I paid him all his right,  yet there remained extra quantity of dates. So I went out and proceeded till I reached the  Prophet and informed him of the good news, whereupon he said, &#8220;I testify that I am  Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; </font></p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle remained sitting and  some people remained sitting with him after the other guests had left. Then Allah&#8217;s  Apostle got up and went away, and I too, followed him till he reached the door of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s  room. Then he thought that the people must have left the place by then, so he returned and  I also returned with him. Behold, the people were still sitting at their places. So he  went back again for the second time, and I went along with him too. When we reached the  door of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s room, he returned and I also returned with him to see that the people had  left. Thereupon the Prophet hung a curtain between me and him and the Verse regarding the  order for (veiling of women) Hijab was revealed. </font></p>

<p align="center">Translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p>1 &#8211; (2134) From Abu Hurairah <i>&#8211; Radi Allaahu anhu–</i> who said the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> said:</p>
<p align="center">المسلم يأكل في معى واحد والكافر في سبعة أمعاء</p>
<p align="center"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>‘A Muslim eats for one stomach, and a non-Muslim eats for seven stomachs.’</strong></span></p>
<p>[Collected by Malik, Bukhari, Muslim, Ibn Majah and others. Albaani declared it Saheeh No.2134]</p>
<p>And in the narration of Bukhari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There used to be a man who would eat a lot, then he accepted Islaam, and he would only eat a small amount, so this was mentioned to the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i>, so he said:</p>
<p align="center">إن المؤمن يأكل في معى واحد وإن الكافر يأكل في سبعة أمعاء</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>‘Indeed the believer eats for one stomach, and indeed the non-Muslim eats for seven stomachs.’</strong></span></p>
<p>And in the narration of Muslim he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘That the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> hosted a non Muslim guest, so the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> ordered for a goat to be milked and the guest drank its milk, then another one was milked and he drank its milk, then another one was milked and he drank its milk, until he had drunk the milk of seven goats!  Then in the morning he had accepted Islaam. The Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> ordered for a goat and the man drank its milk, then another but he could not finish it, so the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> said:</p>
<p align="center">إن المؤمن ليشرب في معى واحد والكافر يشرب في سبعة أمعاء</p>
<p align="center"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>‘A believer drinks for one stomach, and the kaffir drinks for seven stomachs.’</strong></span></p>
<p>[It was also collected by Malik and Tirmidhi, with similar wording]</p>

<p>2 &#8211;  (2135) From Al-Miqdad bin Ma’d Yakrib <i>&#8211;</i><i>Radhi Allaahu anhu</i><i>&#8211;</i> who said:</p>
<p>‘I heard the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> saying:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">‘A human does not fill a more evil container than a stomach.  It is sufficient for the son of Adam to eat small portions by which his back can remain straight.  If it is not possible, then he should reserve his stomach, a third for his food, third for his drink and a third for his breathing.’</span></strong></p>
<p>[Collected by Tirmidhi and he declared it to be Hasan,  and by Ibn Majah and Ibn Hibban &amp; Albaani declared it to be Saheeh. No.  2135]</p>
<p>3 &#8211; (2136)  From Abu Juhayfah <i>&#8211;</i><i>Radhi Allaahu anhu</i><i>&#8211;</i> who said:</p>
<p>‘I had eaten a broth made of bread and meat, then I came to the Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> and I began burping.  The Prophet <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> said:</p>
<p align="center">يا هذا كف عنا من جشائك فإن أكثر الناس شبعا في الدنيا أكثرهم جوعا يوم القيامة</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>‘O person!  Stop your burping, indeed majority of those people who are satiated and full from food in the Dunyaa, will be the hungry on the Day of Judgement.’</strong></span></p>
<p>[Collected by al-Hakim and he said: Saheeh al Isnad &amp; Albaani declared it to be Saheeh. No. 3136]</p>
<p>[Taken from: ‘Saheeh Targheeb wa Tarheeb’ by Shaykh Albaani – Vol.2 p.501- 502]</p>
<p>4  &#8211; From al-Miqdaam bin Ma&#8217;ad Yakrib al-Kindee who said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </i>say:</p>
<p align="center">ما ملأ آدمي وعاء شرا من بطن بحسب ابن آدم أكلات يقمن صلبه فإن كان</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>‘A human does not fill a vessel more evil than his stomach.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Al-Wahshiyyi ibn Harb radiallaahu &#8216;anhu related that some of the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<p>O Messenger of Allaah! We eat, but do not become satisfied.</p>
<p>So he said to them: &#8220;Perhaps you eat separately?&#8221;</p>
<p>So they replied: Yes.</p>
<p>So he said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Eat your food collectively, mention the Name of Allaah upon it, then there will be blessings for you in it</span>.&#8221;[1]</p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Ibn al-&#8216;Uthaymeen</strong> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">This indicates that it is essential to eat collectively from a single plate. So if there are five or ten people, they should eat collectively from a single dish, depending upon the situation. Indeed, doing so is a cause for barakah (blessings) to descend, whilst eating separately is a cause for barakah to depart</span>.&#8221;[2]</p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The following is taken from <span style="color:#993300;">Imam Al-Nawawi&#8217;s Riyad-us-Saliheen </span>&#8211; <span style="color:#993300;">Chapter 107</span> :</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">745. `Abdullah bin Busr (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) had a large bowl called Al-Gharra&#8217;, which would be carried by four men. One day, when the Companions finished their Duha (forenoon optional) prayer, Al-Gharra&#8217; was brought full of sopped bread, meat and broth, and they sat down around it. When their number increased, Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) sat down on his knees and rested on the soles of his feet. A bedouin said to him: &#8220;What sort of sitting is that?&#8221; Thereupon Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;Verily, Allah has made me a courteous slave not a fierce tyrant.&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;Eat from the sides of the bowl and leave the central part of it so that your food will be blessed.&#8221; [Abu Dawud].</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Explanation Of The Hadeeth: “No human ever filled a vessel worse than the stomach&#8230;”<br />
Author: Al-Haafidh Ibn Rajab al-Hanbalee<br />
Source: Jaami&#8217; Al-&#8216;Uloom wal-Hikam, hadeeth no. 47</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Excerpts from the Book</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Al-Miqdaam ibn Maadiy-Karib who said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;No human ever filled a vessel worse than the stomach. Sufficient for any son of Aadam are some morsels to keep his back straight. But if it must be, then one third for his food, one third for his drink and one third for his breath.&#8221; [Ahmad, At-Tirmidhee, An-Nasaa&#8217;ee, Ibn Maajah &#8211; hadeeth saheeh.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Ibn Masaweh, a Muslim doctor, said after reading this hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If the people only used these words, they would avoid all diseases and maladies and the clinics and pharmacies would be idle.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Another doctor, Al-Harith ibn Kalada said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;That which has killed mankind is the introduction of food on top of food before it has been digested.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. As for spiritual benefits: humbleness of heart, strength of understanding, lessening of lower desires, lessening of personal opinions and anger, while overeating induces the opposites of all of those. Al-Hasan Al-Basree said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O, son of Adam, eat with one third of your stomach and drink with one third and leave one third of your stomach to breathe so that you may think.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Ibn Umar: A man said to Ibn Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t I bring you some jawarish?&#8221; Ibn Umar said: &#8220;What is that?&#8221; He said: &#8220;Something which aids in digesting your food after you eat.&#8221; Ibn Umar said: &#8220;I have not eaten to being full for four months. That is not because I am not able to do so, but I was with a group of people who were hungry more than they were full.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Not reaching your goals: Muhammad ibn Wasi said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever eats little will understand and make others understand and will be clear and humble. Overeating weighs a person down and keeps him from much of what he wants [to accomplish].&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. Al-Hasan Al-Basree:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The test of Aadam, alayhis-salaam, was food and it is your test until Qiyama.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And, it used to be said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever takes control of his stomach gets control of all good deeds.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Wisdom does not reside in a full stomach.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One day, Al-Hasan offered some food to his companion who said: &#8220;I have eaten until I am no longer able to eat.&#8221; To which Al-Hasan said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;SubhaanAllaah! Does a Muslim eat until he is no longer able to eat?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. Allaah grants this world to those whom He loves and those He does not love but only grants hunger to those whom he loves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I have not filled myself in sixteen years because filling oneself makes the body heavy, removes clear understanding, induces sleep and makes one weak for worship.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. In Bukhaaree and Muslim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The believer eats with one stomach while the kafir eats with seven stomachs.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: The believer eats with the manners of Islam and in moderation, while the kafir eats based on desires and gluttony and so he eats with seven stomachs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. Also:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Food for one is enough for two and food for two is enough for three and food for three is enough for four.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. Also: From Aa&#8217;ishah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The family of Muhammad (sal-Allaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam) never filled themselves with wheat bread three days in a row from the time he came to Madeenah until he passed away.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. A Muslim should not merely follow his appetites. Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Then, they were followed by generations who neglected the prayer and followed their appetites. They will encounter a pit of fire except for those who repent&#8230;&#8221; [Maryam 59-60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. The best generations did not:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The best generation is my generation, followed by the one after them then the one after them. Then will come a people who bear witness but are not asked to bear witness, who swear oaths but do not fulfill them and fatness will appear among them.&#8221; [Bukhaaree and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. From Abee Barza that the Prophet (sal-Allaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;My greatest fear for you is the appetites of transgression with regard to your stomachs and your privates and the inclinations which lead astray.&#8221; [Ahmad and others and its narrators are people of saheeh]</p>
