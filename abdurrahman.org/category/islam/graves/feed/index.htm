<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">31-Ruling on making Du&#8217;a&#8217; the dead</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: What is the ruling on those who make Du&#8217;a&#8217; (supplication) to the dead?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ans by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who make Du`a&#8217; (supplication) to the dead are Mushriks (those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). If they make Du&#8217;a&#8217; to the dead, idols, trees, stones, angels or jinn, they will be regarded as Kafirs (disbelievers) as making Du&#8217;a&#8217; to all these leads to one thing; namely, Kufr (disbelief that takes the Muslim out of Islam),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One thing that can be excluded from this ruling which is seeking help from his fellow Muslim brother or non-Muslim like buying a commodity from a non-Muslim, asking him to build a shop or mend a car while the person while he is alive. This case is considered to be exceptional and is not a kind of Shirk. It is similar to what Allah (Exalted be He) mentions in the story of Musa (Moses): <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(The man of his own) party asked him for help against his foe)</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one asks his fellow Muslim brother or the non-Muslim, who is present, to do something for him like building a house, mending the car, or plowing the land in return for something, or they agree upon doing something that is legally permitted, there will be nothing wrong as all these things are normal and can be done by human beings who are alive and present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But what is Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect) is making Du&#8217;a&#8217; to those who are not present and cannot hear him, the dead or a living person whom he thinks to be supernatural and has a mysterious power. This understanding leads him to think that if he makes Du&#8217;a&#8217; to this person for forgiveness and admittance to paradise, he will be able to do this because of something secret about this person. This is Munkar even if the person who is invoked besides Allah (Exalted be He) is living.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Sufis who worship their Shaykhs and their senior and prestigious persons who are dead. They ask them for help and make Du&#8217;a&#8217; to them to cure the sick. All these things are considered to be major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) <strong>even if the person whom they make Du`a&#8217; to is alive because they ask him something beyond his abilities</strong>. This behavior differs from asking a person to lend you something, build a house for you, cultivate some land, mend a car, bring your belongings from the car, and so on. All these things are normal and contain there is nothing wrong in them.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Proof for <em>al-Istighaathah</em> (seeking rescue and deliverance):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِذْ تَسْتَغِيثُونَ رَبَّكُمْ فَاسْتَجَابَ لَكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>Remember when you sought the aid and deliverance of your Lord, and He responded to you </b></span>[8:9]<b> </b><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>24</sup></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">24</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Istighaathah </em>is a type of the types of worship, and it is seeking <span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>al-Ghauth</em></strong></span> (deliverance or rescue), and it does not occur except at times of adversity or great difficulty, when a person comes to be in a situation of adversity, then he seeks deliverance and rescue from Allaah and he seeks salvation from this adversity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And <em>al-Istighaathah </em>(seeking rescue and deliverance) is of two types:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first type is:</strong> <em>al-Istighaathah</em> (seeking rescue) from a created being, with regard to something that no-one is able to do except Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and this is <em>shirk</em>. So whoever seeks rescue and deliverance from other than Allaah, whether it be from a <em>jinn</em> or a human or those people who are absent or from the dead, then this is <em>shirk</em> along with Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. <span style="color:#ff0000;">So seeking rescue and deliverance through the dead and those who are absent from the devils and the <em>jinn</em>, this is <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>shirk</em></strong></span> along with Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second type is: </strong>seeking aid and rescue from a created being who is present and who is alive with regard to something he is able to do – this is permissible. He the Most High said in the story of Moosaa:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> فَاسْتَغَاثَهُ الَّذِي مِن شِيعَتِهِ عَلَى الَّذِي مِنْ عَدُوِّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So the man who was upon his religion</strong> (i.e. the religion of Moosaa)<strong> he called to him for assistance and rescue against the one who was an enemy </strong></span>[28:15]</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 45: Points 70 &amp; 71</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[70] And to have <em>eemaan</em> that the deceased will be made to sit up in his grave and his soul will be restored to him in order that <em>Munkar</em> and <em>Nakeer</em> should question him about <em>eemaan</em> and its required duties then his soul will be gently removed from him without any pain. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[71] And the deceased recognises the one who visits him when he visits him and the believer will experience bliss in the grave and the wicked will be punished as Allaah wishes. </strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“</span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And to have eemaan that the deceased will be made to sit up in his grave,”</span> </strong>it is obligatory to have <em>eemaan</em> that the deceased will be made to sit up in his grave and his soul will be restored to his body and two angels will come to him; one of them is <em>Munkar</em> and the other is <em>An-Nakeer</em>. So, they will both question him and this is <strong><em>al-fitnatu fil-qabr</em> (the trial in the grave)</strong> and it is the most severe thing that will come upon the deceased. If he is saved from this trial then he will be saved from that which comes after it and if he is not saved from this trial then he will be destroyed. There will be no salvation for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The two of them will ask him about three matters:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong><em>Man Rabbuk</em></strong><strong>? (Who is your Lord?) </strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the believer will say “<em>Rabbiyy Allaah”</em> (My Lord is Allaah). Whereas, the <em>munaafiq</em> (hypocrite) will say, “<em>Hah! Hah!!</em> <em>Laa adree</em> (Hah! Hah!! I do not know).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then they will say to him:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong><em>Maa Deenuk?</em></strong><strong> (What is your religion?) </strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the believer will say, “My religion is <em>al-Islaam</em>.” Whereas, the hypocrite and the doubter will say, <em>“Hah! Hah!! Laa adree</em> (Hah! Hah!! I do not know).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then they will say to him:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong><em>Man Nabiyyuk?</em></strong><strong> (Who is your Prophet?) </strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the believer will reply, “My Prophet is Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. Whereas, the hypocrite will say, <em>“Hah! Hah!! Laa adree</em> (Hah! Hah!! I do not know).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the believer will have his grave extended wide for him and he will have bedding provided for him from Paradise and a door will be opened for him leading to Paradise and its pleasant wind and its pleasant fragrance will come upon him and he will experience bliss in his grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whereas, the <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever) and the hypocrite, his grave will be restricted upon him and he will be given bedding from the fire and the door to the fire will be opened for him and its heat and its poisonous wind will come upon him.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is the meaning of his saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And his soul will be restored to him so that Munkar and Nakeer can ask him about <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) and about its legislated duties.”</span></strong><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying,<span style="color:#993300;"><strong> “and the deceased recognises the one who visits him when he visit him,” </strong></span>and therefore it is legislated to visit the graves because the deceased takes comfort in the presence of the one who visits him and this is from the affairs of the <em>barzakh</em> (intermediate period). We do not know about the affairs of the Hereafter and the affairs of the intermediate period except what is established by proof because it is from the <em>ilm ul-ghaib</em> (knowledge of the hidden and unseen), which is not known except by Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is not to be derived from this that anything can be requested from the deceased such that it is said, “<em>Since he knows the one who comes to him then why shouldn’t we request what we need from him?</em>” We say, this was not legislated by Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, nothing may be requested from the deceased. The Companions (<em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>aabah</em>) had not used to request anything from the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> even though he was alive in his grave <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in a life of <em>barzakh</em> (intermediate period), not the life of this world.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“and the believer will experience bliss in the grave and the wicked will be punished however Allaah wishes.”</span> </strong>From the fundamentals of <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) is to have <em>eemaan</em> in the punishment of the grave and in its bliss, contrary to the Mu`tazilah; those who denied it. They say, “<em>The deceased in his grave is just the same as when we placed him in it, he receives no torment and no bliss</em>,” relying in this upon their intellects and what they see and on their own thinking and they do not believe in the <em>ghaib</em> (hidden and the unseen). An analogy is not to be made between this world and the Hereafter or between the Hereafter and this world. So, it is upon you to have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in the <em>ghaib</em> (hidden and the unseen).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the punishment of the grave and the bliss of the grave is established. Indeed it is <em>mutawaatir</em> in the a<u>h</u>aadeeth (meaning something that occurs; every level of transmission of narrations, just so many that every level of transmission, there’s so many people who report it that it’s impossible they could have got together and lied upon it) that the deceased will either be punished in his grave or otherwise, he will experience bliss.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, whoever denies the punishment of the grave and he knows of the texts and he knows of the proofs then he is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever). As for the one who denies it on account of <em>ta`weel</em> (wrong interpretation) or <em>taqleed</em> (blindly following) somebody else in that saying or <em>al-jahl</em> (ignorant) of it then this person, the truth is to be made clear to him and if he then persists after it has been clearly explained, then he is just to be a disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> You find all of this mentioned in the <u>h</u>adeeth of Baraa` ibn `Aazib <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>, reported by al-Bukhaariyy (1,369) and reported by Muslim (2,871) in abridged form. And in longer form by Imaam A<u>h</u>mad in his <em>Musnad</em> and by Aboo Daawood in his <em>Sunan</em> (4,753).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the angels being named as <em>Munkar</em> and <em>Nakeer</em> then that occurs in a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu,</em> reported by Tirmithee as <u>h</u>adeeth 1,071, said authentic by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“When one of you is placed in his grave then two angels; black-blue come to him. One of them is called al-Munkar and the other is called An-Nakeer”.</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Translator’s side point: <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said in his explanation on this point that they will ask about <em>eemaan</em> and about its <em>sharaai</em>`<em>ee</em> (legislated duties),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Perhaps what he intended by this is the general questioning because I do not know anything from the Sunnahs, which indicates that there will be questions about the details of <em>Islaam</em> and <em>Eemaan</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And likewise on the point that came, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“Then his soul will be gently taken out of him again without any pain.” ‘<em>Bilaa alam’</em> (without any pain)</span>, </strong>meaning without the pain which occurred for him at his first death.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Translator’s side point: <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said with regard to this point, <strong>“and the deceased in the grave recognises the one who visits him,”</strong> this is based upon the authenticity of the <u>h</u>adeeth which occurs about that. But there is disagreement about its authenticity as far as I know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s side point: The verifier <strong>Khaalid ar-Raddaadiyy</strong> said, “There are a number of a<u>h</u>aadeeth which mention that the deceased recognises the one who visits him when he visit him and takes comfort from his visit. However, nothing from them is authentic.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s side point: <strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong> <em><u>h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said in his explanation, “This is something, which I do not know any proof for, the point that the deceased in the grave recognises the one who visit him. Rather, what is indicated by the proof is just that he hears the footsteps of those who depart after they have buried him.”</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 44: Point 69</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that the souls of the martyrs are within the bellies of green birds, which roam freely in Paradise and they return to shelter to lamps beneath the Throne. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And the souls of the wicked and the disbelievers are in the well of <em>Barahoot</em> and are in <em>Sijjeen</em>. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F380574881&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-souls-of-the-martyrs-are-within-the-bellies-of-green-birds-in-paradise" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And know that the souls of the martyrs are within the bellies of green birds, which roam freely in Paradise,” </strong></span>for the <em>roo<u>h</u></em> (soul) by means of which a person lives and moves and grasps things by his senses, it is a secret matter from the secrets of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High. No-one knows it except Allaah, meaning no-one knows its true reality except Allaah, the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَيَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الرُّوحِ ۖ قُلِ الرُّوحُ مِنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّي وَمَا أُوتِيتُم مِّنَ الْعِلْمِ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they ask you about <em>ar-roo<u>h</u></em> (the soul). Say, the soul is from the private affairs of my Lord and you have not been given of knowledge except a little.</strong></span>(Sooratul-Israa· (17), <em>aayah </em>85)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1<sup>st</sup> explanation of <em>aayah</em>:</strong> Upon the basis that what is meant by the <em>roo<u>h</u></em> here is that by which a person lives; a person and an animal and the rest of the things possessing souls.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> explanation of <em>aayah</em>: </strong>It is otherwise said that what is meant by <em>ar-roo<u>h</u></em>; a type of the angels and Allaah knows best.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>roo<u>h</u></em> in the Arabic language is a term, which is used to refer to that by means of which the possessors of souls will live because <strong><em>al-<u>h</u>ayaat</em> (life)</strong> is of two categories:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong><em><u>H</u></em></strong><strong><em>ayaatu-<u>H</u>arakah:</em></strong> (Moving Life) &#8211; a life which involves movement; animate life and this occurs with those things possessing souls.</li>
<li><strong><em><u>H</u></em></strong><strong><em>ayaatu-Numoo: </em></strong>(Developing Life)<strong><em> &#8211; </em></strong>life that merely involves something growing and growing, this is what occurs in trees and plants.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from them (types of life) is the life of the embryo in the womb of its mother before the soul is breathed into it. But when the soul is breathed into it then it becomes animate life, the life of movement. As for before that then it is just the <em>roo<u>h</u></em> (spirit), which is the life of growth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the rhetorical theologians and the philosophers are in confusion about the true reality of the soul and they are unable to comprehend it and they stumble and make many mistakes and were unable to comprehend it.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> We find the like of that in:</p>
<p><strong>يَوْمَ يَقُومُ الرُّوحُ وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ صَفًّا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The day when the <em>roo<u>h</u></em> and the angels will stand in rows.<br />
</strong></span>(Sooratun-Nabaa· (78), <em>aayah </em>38)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Allaahu A`lam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Translator’s side point: With regard to different types of life, you can refer to <em>Zaad ul-Ma`aad</em> of Imaam ibn ul-Qayyim volume 5 page 755.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Translator’s side point: <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah </em>said on this point<em>:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“You should know that the souls of the martyrs are in the bellies of green birds that roam around freely in Paradise and they return to lamps beneath the Throne,” </strong></span>this occurs within a <u>h</u>adeeth reported by Muslim (1,887) and it is the <em>`aqeedah</em> (creed and belief) of the <em>Ahl ul-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his saying though that, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“the souls of the wicked and the disbelievers are within the well of <em>Barahoot</em> and they are in <em>Sijjeen.</em>”</strong></span> Then I say, as for the well of <em>Barahoot</em> then it is a well to the East of `<em>Adan</em>; Aden of this place in Southern Yemen, between it and between <em>Ha<u>dh</u>ramawt.</em><em style="font-size:1rem;"> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the saying that, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“the souls of the wicked and the disbelievers are gathered within it,”</strong></span> there is no authentic proof for this. However, it occurs in a narration whose chain of narration contains a <em>majhool</em> (a person who’s unknown); being reported from `Abdullaah ibn `Amr <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em> as was mentioned by the one in the footnotes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ahmad said, “I say what is correct is that which Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, informed of:</p>
<p><strong>كَلَّا إِنَّ كِتَابَ الْفُجَّارِ لَفِي سِجِّينٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The book of the wicked, they (the wicked), their souls will be in <em>Sijjeen</em>.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Mu<u>t</u>affifeen (83), <em>aayah </em>7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the word <em>As-Sijjeen</em> is an intensive form from <em>As-Sijn</em> (restriction) and it is a tight or restricted place and it (<em>Sijjeen</em>) is in the lowest depth of the earth as was said by the People of Knowledge. We ask Allah for safety and security from it, Aameen. And we seek Allaah’s refuge from His anger and from His painful punishment and Allaah grants success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aali<u>h</u> as-Su<u>h</u>aymee</strong> <em><u>h</u>afi<u>z</u>ahullaah</em> said in his explanation,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And likewise, the souls of the believers in general, there occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth that the soul of the believer will be a bird, which will come and go in Paradise. The souls of the martyrs, it occurs that they will be in the belly of green birds, which come and go in Paradise and the souls of the believers in general, it is established also in the <u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> that they will be birds that come and go in Paradise and this is from the proofs from the bliss of the grave for the soul enjoys bliss just as the body enjoys bliss.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the matter of the souls of the disbelievers that they will be in the well of <em>Barahoot</em>, this is not authentic and it is a well in <em>Ha<u>dh</u>ramawt</em>. And it occurs in some reports, which are brought by the scholars of <em>Tafseer</em> and perhaps they are reports from the <em>Banu Israa`eel</em> (People of the Book), which we do not affirm and we do not deny but however, nothing is established on this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The saying of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The soul of the believer will be a bird, which will eat from the trees of Paradise until Allaah resurrects it returning it to its body on the day when He resurrects it.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <u>h</u>adeeth was declared <u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> (authentic) by Shaykh al-Albaaniyy in <em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> al-Jaami` as-<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> no. 995 being reported by Imaam Maalik in his <em>Muwa<u>tt</u>a</em>, Imaam A<u>h</u>mad, An-Nasaa`ee, Ibn Maajah and others from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Ka`b ibn Maalik <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu.</em></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 40 : Point 61</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> that when Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> spoke to those thrown into the abandoned well on the day of Badr, meaning the People of <em>Shirk</em> that they heard his words. </strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/allaahs-messenger-spoke-to-those-thrown-into-the-abandoned-well-on-the-day-of-badr" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>has <em>mu`jizaat</em> (miracles) and a <em>mu`jizah</em> (miracle) is a matter, which is extraordinary and a person is not able to bring them about himself. Rather, they are things created by Allaah, the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p><strong>وَقَالُوا لَوْلَا أُنزِلَ عَلَيْهِ آيَاتٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِ ۖ قُلْ إِنَّمَا الْآيَاتُ عِندَ اللَّهِ </strong> &#8211; 29:50</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(People of </span><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Shirk</em></span><span style="color:#008000;">) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">said, “If only miraculous times were to be sent down to him </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Prophet </span><span style="color:#008000;"><em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em></span><span style="color:#008000;">) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">from his Lord.” Say, “The miraculous times are only with Allaah.”</span> </strong>(Sooratul-`Ankaboot (29), <em>aayah</em> 50)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They were demanding that he should himself bring miraculous times to prove his Messengership as they said. But the miraculous times are with Allaah. The Messenger did not bring any sign except from Allaah, the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p><strong> قُلْ إِنَّمَا الْآيَاتُ عِندَ اللَّهِ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “The signs are only with Allaah.”</span> </strong>(Sooratul-`Ankaboot (29), <em>aayah</em> 50)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He is the one Who manifests miracles, the Perfect and Most High. And He causes them to happen at the hands of His Messengers to attest to their truthfulness. And an example of that is &#8211; the dead person, if you speak to him, he will not hear you and he will not know what you are saying. However, the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>spoke to those who had been killed at Badr from Quraysh, those who used to harm him and harm the Muslims in Makkah and who haughtily rejected true faith and disobeyed and who tyrannized the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and expelled him and who expelled his companions and harmed them. So, Allaah caused them to be overpowered at Badr and they were killed. And their leaders and their eminent people were killed; Shaybah Ibn Rabee`ah and `Utbah ibn Rabee`ah (his brother) and Aboo Jahl Ibn Hishaam and a large number of the eminent ones of the Quraysh were killed at Badr. Then the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> ordered that they should be thrown into an old well from the wells of Badr and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> stood over them and addressed them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“O so and so, son of so and so! O Aboo Jahl Ibn Hishaam! O `Utbah! O Shaybah! O Umayyah!” He addressed them one by one, saying “Have you found what your Lord promised you to be true for I have indeed found what my Lord promised me to be true?” So then Umar said to him “O Messenger of Allaah, how can you speak to them when they have started to decay and they cannot hear.” So he <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam responded, “You people cannot hear any better what I am saying than they can. However, they cannot talk.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was a miracle from the miracles of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, which Allaah caused to happen at his hand.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (3,976) and reported by Muslim (2,873, 2,874 and 2,875).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Narration mentions this happened three days after the battle. In one narration it mentioned when the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> conquered a people then he would remain at that place for three days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This report that he did likewise at Badr, he stayed there for three days and just before he was going to travel and go back to Madeenah, on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day then he stood over the old well and said this saying, he spoke to them, he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Did you find what your Lord promised you to be true? Indeed, I found what my Lord promised me to be true&#8230;”</span> </strong>To the end of the <u>h</u>adeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I say &#8211; the disagreement that there is amongst the People of Knowledge about whether the people in the <em>Barzakh</em> (period in between this life and the hereafter, those in the grave and the like), can they hear those people who address them or is that just specific to the people of that well at Badr?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of them extend this matter and claim that all the people in that life (the <em>Barzakh)</em> can hear the speech that is said to them and some of the People of Knowledge restrict it to the place where the text is mentioned and that is what is apparent from the established texts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the people of <em>Sufism</em> then they extend this matter in a reprehensible manner to the extent that they claim that a dead person even knows what happens amongst his family whether good or bad. And Ibn ul-Qayyim <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> reported in his book <em>Ar-Rooh</em>, some reports from them, which are suspect and Allaah is the one who grants success.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aalih as-Suhaymee</strong> had said on this same point, he mentioned that there are some people who say the dead in general can hear. However, upon verification from the sayings of the people of the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah</em>, what is correct is that we restrict ourselves in the matter of the dead hearing because it is a matter of the <em>ghaib</em> (hidden and unseen) and in matters of the hidden and the unseen, we do not increase upon them upon what occurs from the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And what’s established is two cases where the dead hear:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>Firstly</strong>, the leaders of the Quraysh who were killed at Badr that they heard the words of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>when he addressed them,</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>Secondly</strong>, the deceased, who has died and been buried; they hear the footsteps of his family going away after they are buried.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Beyond that we do not extend the matter any further. Rather, the rest of it falls under the general <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<p> وَمَا أَنتَ بِمُسْمِعٍ مَّن فِي الْقُبُورِ &#8211; 35:22</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And you cannot cause those who are in the graves to hear.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah Faa<u>t</u>ir (35), <em>aayah </em>22)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 17 : Point 16</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And to have eemaan in the punishment of the grave and in Munkar and Nakeer.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F364796696&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/eemaan-in-the-punishment-of-the-grave-and-in-munkar-and-nakeer-dawud-burbank" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise from the `aqeedah (creed and belief) of the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah</em> (the people of the Sunnah and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>) is to have eemaan in the punishment of the grave (<em>`athaabul-qabr</em>) and in the bliss of the grave (<em>na`eemul-qabr</em>). So the deceased will either be punished in his grave or he will experience bliss until he is raised up on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the grave is a station between this world and the Hereafter; and therefore it is called <em>al-Barzakh</em>, ‘the barrier’ or ‘the interval’. Because barzakh means a barrier between two things. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">He </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Allaah)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> has released the two seas </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(salt water and the fresh water)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> which meet side by side. Between them there is a <em>barzakh </em></span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(barrier)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> which neither of them transgress.</span></strong> (Sooratur-Rahmaan (55), aayahs 19-20)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The salt water does not transgress upon the fresh water and the fresh water does not transgress upon the salty, because Allaah has placed a separation between them. So this does not mix with this. So therefore <em>al-barzakh</em> means a separation between two things. Because the abodes where the people will live are three:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• <em><strong>daarud-dunyaa</strong></em>, the abode/of this world<br />
<em>• <strong>daarul-barzakh</strong></em>, the abode of the interval period<br />
<em>• <strong>daarul-qaraar</strong></em>, the abode of remaining (the Hereafter)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the abodes which the servants will pass through: <em>daarud-dunyaa</em>, the abode of this world, which is a place of action; and <em>daarul-barzakh</em>, the interval period, which is a place for waiting; and <em>daarul-qaraar</em>, the place of remaining forever, which will be the place of recompense. Because Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Until you enter and visit the graves</span></strong> (Sooratut-Takaathur (102), aayah 2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this shows that the graves are not a place of permanent residence. [05] Rather a person who is in them is just like a visitor. He visits and then he travels on. So he made the time spent in the graves a visit, because he remains in them and then he travels on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, during the time when he is within the grave, when he is first placed in the grave and the soil is levelled over him and the people depart from him, “<strong><em>he will certainly hear the striking of their shoes</em></strong>.” [06] Then two angels will come to him in the grave and they will make him sit up, and his soul will be restored to his body. And he will be given life, a life of this interval period; and it is not like the life which is in this world. So they will ask him, “Who is your Lord?” and “What is your Religion?” and “Who is your Prophet?” So if he gives a correct answer to these questions, then he is saved and he will be blissful, and he will suffer no wretchedness after it. And his grave will be extended for as far as the eye can see for him and a door will be opened for him to Paradise. So its beautiful breeze and its fragrance will come to him and command will be given for him to be given bedding from Paradise. [07] So he will continue to be experiencing delight in his grave. And this is a matter of the ghayb (the hidden and the unseen). We do not know about it. So if we were to open up a grave, we would not find anything from that since it occurs in one world, and we are in a different world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the hypocrite and the doubter then he will say if it is said to him “Who is your Lord?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He will say “I do not know.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Who is you Prophet?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He will say, “I do not know.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“What is your Religion?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He will say “I do not know.” Even if, in this world, he was a learned person and he memorised texts and explanations and he memorised the language and he was a most eloquent speaker and a fine talker. But if he did not have eemaan (true faith), then he will stammer in the grave and he will be unable to answer. When he is asked about these matters he will stutter and say, “<em><strong>Hah, Hah, I do not know, I heard the people saying something, so therefore I said it.” So a door will be opened to the Fire for him and his grave will be made tight upon him until his ribs intertwine (cross over). And its fierce wind and heat come upon him and bedding from the Fire will be laid out for him.</strong></em> [08]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the punishment of the grave or its bliss is established in the Book and in the Sunnah. He <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Seek refuge with Allaah from four things: from the punishment of Hell Fire and from the punishment of the grave and from the trials of life and death and from the trial of al-Maseehud-Dajjaal </strong>(the false Messiah)<strong>.</strong></span> [09]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> used to seek refuge from the punishment of the grave.[10] And there are indications in the Qur&#8217;aan of the punishment of the grave. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We will make them taste of the lesser punishment before the greater punishment</strong></span> (Sooratus-Sajdah (32), aayah 21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They (the people of <em>tafseer</em>) said: This is the punishment of the grave. Or it is said: It is the punishment of this world. And in His saying, He the Most High, with regard to the Pharaoh and his people:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They (the people of Fir`own) are exposed to the Fire morning and evening. And on the day when the Hour is established, it will be said, “Enter the people of Fir`own into the severest torment.</span> </strong>(Soorah Ghaafir (40), aayah 46)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are exposed to it morning and evening &#8211; this is in the grave. After they died they began being exposed to the Fire morning and evening. And when the Hour (the Resurrection) is established it will be said, “Enter the people of Fir`own into the severest torment.” And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever turns away from remembrance of Me, then he will have a tight and restricted life. And We will raise him up on the Day of Resurrection blind.</span> </strong>(Soorah Taa Haa (20), aayah 124)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They (the people of explanation of the Qur&#8217;aan) said: A tight and restricted life refers to in the grave. And Allaah’s refuge is sought. [11] [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the evidences proving the punishment of the grave are <em>mutawaatirah</em> (established by huge numbers of people at every level of transmission).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever disbelieves in the punishment of the grave from the Mu`tazilah and those who adopt their way, then he is contradicting mutawaatir evidences, and he will have his belief damaged; and Allaah’s refuge is sought. And he will be missing out on one of the fundamentals from the fundamentals of `aqeedah (creed and belief); and it is belief in the punishment of the grave. So if he is doing so wilfully/knowingly, knowing of the texts, that he just does so out of pride and haughtiness and he denies, then he is a kaafir ( a disbeliever). But as for if he is doing it using a wrong interpretation or doing it blind following someone or is ignorant, then this person is not declared to be a disbeliever. Rather he is declared to astray, but not to be a disbeliever. [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“and Munkar and Nakeer.”</strong> Munkar and Nakeer are two names of angels who will come to him in a terrifying form. One of them is called al-Munkar and the other one is called an-Nakeer, as occurs in the ahaadeeth. [14]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[05] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh al-Albaanee used to criticize people when they said about someone who died, “<em>He has gone on to his final resting place</em>.” And he used to say that this is a wrong statement and a wrong belief. After the grave there is either the Paradise or the Hell Fire, and that is the final place, not the grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[06] This hadeeth occurs in al-Bukhaaree (no.1273) and reported by Muslim (no.2870) as a hadeeth of Anas radiyAllaahu `anh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[07] All this occurs in the hadeeth of al-Baraa· ibn `Aazib radiyAllaahu `anhumaa reported by at-Tayaalisee and Imaam Ahmad and Aboo Daawood and al-Haakim and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> This hadeeth was declared saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaanee in his checking of Aboo Daawood and al-Haakim and others in the long hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[08] Part of the same hadeeth of al-Baraa· ibn `Aazib radiyAllaahu `anhumaa</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[09] This hadeeth occurs in the Saheeh of al-Bukhaaree (no. 1311) and in Saheeh Muslim (no. 588) from a hadeeth of Aboo Hurayrah radiyAllaahu `anh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] This hadeeth occurs in the Saheeh of al-Bukhaaree (no. 1002) and in Saheeh Muslim (no.584) as a hadeeth of `Aa·ishah radiyAllaahu `anhaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] Ibn Katheer said in his Tafseer that it is established that “<strong>a tight and restricted life</strong>” is explained to mean the punishment of the grave. This is established from Aboo Sa`eed al-Khudree and Aboo Hurayrah radiyAllaahu `anhumaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Ibn Hibbaan in his Saheeh (no. 3109) brings a hadeeth from Aboo Hurayrah radiyAllaahu `anhu from the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> that he himself explained this aayah, that, “<strong>there will be a tight and restricted life for him</strong>,” the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said, “(it means) the punishment of the grave.” Shaykh al-Albaanee said with regard to this report ‘hasan’ (good).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Saalih as-Suhaymee hafizahullaah said in his explanation,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“The punishment of the grave is something which the people of the Sunnah are agreed upon, with consensus (ijmaa`). It is proven in the texts which are authentic, from the Book and the Sunnah. And the Mu`tazilah disagree about it. So they deny the punishment of the grave because they have a belief which is that Paradise and the Fire are not yet created.” </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Later on he said, <em>“And it is something which no one from the people of the Sunnah denied.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14] It is reported by at-Tirmithee in his Sunan, and Ibn Abee `Aasim in as-Sunnah and Ibn Hibaan and others, from a hadeeth of Aboo Hurayrah radiyAllaahu `anhu that, <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“When the deceased person is buried in his grave two angels come to him who are black and blue. One is called al-Munkar and the other is called an-Nakeer.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> This hadeeth was declared hasan (good) by Shaykh al-Albaanee.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And it is Allah Who sends the winds, so that they raise up the clouds, and We drive them to a dead land, and revive therewith the earth after its death. As such (will be) the Resurrection!</strong> <span style="color:#999999;">( Surah Faatir 35:09)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Evidence of Life after Death</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Often Allah refers to the Resurrection by using the analogy of the earth coming back to life after it has died, as in the beginning of Surat Al-Hajj, where He urges His servants to draw the lesson of the former from the latter. For the earth is dead and lifeless, with nothing growing in it, then He sends to it clouds which bring water, which He sends down upon it,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#339966;"><span style="color:#ff9900;"><span style="color:#339966;">(it is stirred (to life), and it swells and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth))</span> </span></span></strong>(22:5). So too, when Allah wishes to resurrect the bodies, He will send rain from beneath the Throne which will cover the whole earth, and the bodies will grow in their graves like seeds grow in the earth. It says in the Sahih:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>Every part of the son of Adam will disintegrate apart from the coccyx, from which he was created and from him he will be made anew</strong>.) Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#339966;"><strong>As such (will be) the Resurrection!</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">According to the Hadith of Abu Raz0n: I said, O Messenger of Allah, how will Allah bring the dead back to life? What is the sign of that in His creation? He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Abu Razin, do you not pass through the valley of your people (and see it) arid and barren, then you pass through it (and see it) stirred (to life) and green) I said, `Yes.&#8217; He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Thus will Allah bring the dead back to life.)&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[3]</strong> <strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">There are some who say that if a hadeeth contradicts an ayah in the Qur’aan, it should be rejected no matter what level of authenticity it has. Then they use as an example the hadeeth: <strong>“Indeed the deceased person will be punished (in the grave) due to the crying of his family for him.”</strong>[10] They use the statement of ‘Aa’ishah in which she used Allaah’s saying to refute this hadeeth:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">وَلَا تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَى</span></strong><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another.”</strong> [Surah Faatir: 18]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">How do we respond to those who say this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[3] Answer</strong>: Rejecting this hadeeth falls under the issues related to rejecting the Sunnah by way of the Qur’aan. So this shows the deviation of this way of thinking.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the response to this hadeeth – and I am referring here particularly to those who adhere to the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah, then it is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>:<strong> From a hadeeth standpoint:</strong> There is no way to reject this hadeeth from a hadeeth standpoint due to two reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. It has been reported through an authentic chain of narration from Ibn ‘Umar radhi Allaahu anhu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Ibn ‘Umar radhi Allaahu anhu is not alone in reporting it, rather he was followed in that by ‘Umar bin Al- Khattaab radhi Allaahu anhu. Furthermore, he and his son are not alone in reporting it either, for they were also followed in that by Al-Mugheerah bin Shu’bah radhi Allaahu anhu. This is what comes to my mind at this time since the reports of all three of these Companions can be found in the two Saheeh Collections.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if a person were to conduct an exclusive research on this hadeeth, he would find other paths of narration for it. These three ahaadeeth all have authentic chains of narration so they cannot be rejected just based on the claim that they “contradict” the noble Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: <strong>From a tafseer standpoint:</strong> This is since the scholars have explained this hadeeth in two ways:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. This hadeeth only applies to a deceased person who knew during the course of his life that his family would commit oppositions to the Religion after his death and did not advise them. Nor he did direct them to not cry over him since this crying would serve as a means for his being punished in the grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The usage of the word <strong>“the”</strong> when referring to the <strong>“deceased person”</strong> is not allencompassing and inclusive. Meaning: The hadeeth does not mean that every deceased person will be punished due to the crying of his family members. Rather, the word “the” is for a specific designation, meaning it refers to only those who do not advise others to not commit what opposes the Religion after his death. So this is the type of person who will be punished by the crying of his family over him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who takes charge of advising his family and directing them with religious guidelines such as to not wail over him and to not commit the offenses that are done ,particularly in this era, then such a person will not be punished. But if he does not direct and advise (his family), he will be punished.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the detailed breakdown that we are required to understand from the first explanation, in accordance to the interpretation of many well known and famous scholars such as An-Nawawee and others. So when we come to comprehend this detailed breakdown, it becomes clear that there is in fact no contradiction between this hadeeth and Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">وَلاَ تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَى</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another.”</strong></span> [Surah Al-An’aam: 164]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A contradiction only becomes apparent if the word <strong>“the”</strong> in the word <strong>“the deceased person”</strong> is understood to be all-inclusive, meaning that it encompasses everyone who dies. This is where the hadeeth becomes obscure and contradicts the noble ayah in the Qur’aan. But if we comprehend the meaning of the hadeeth according to what was mentioned before, there would be no more contradictions or obscurities since we would understand that the one who is being punished (in the grave) is only like that because he failed to advise and direct his family members (before his death). This is the first manner in which this hadeeth has been interpreted in order to repel this so-called “contradiction.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. A second interpretation has been mentioned by Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah, may Allaah have mercy on him, in some of his writings. And it is that the punishment here does not refer to the punishment in the grave or the punishment in the Hereafter but rather, that it only refers to pain and sorrow. Meaning: When a deceased person hears the crying of his family for him, he will feel bad and sorrowful for their grief over him. This is what Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah said. If it is correct, it would eradicate the root of the misconception.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, I say: Such an explanation goes against two facts, which is why we can only rely on the first explanation of this hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First Fact:</strong> The report from Al-Mugheerah bin Shu’abah radhi Allaahu anhu that I indicated previously has an addition to it that clarifies that the punishment here does not refer to just pain and sorrow, but rather that it refers to actual punishment, i.e. punishment in the Hellfire, unless Allaah forgives him. This is clearly stated in Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">إِنَّ اللّهَ لاَ يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاء</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Verily, Allaah does not forgive that partners be associated with Him (in worship), but He forgives what is less than that to whom He wills.”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the narration of Al-Mugheerah radhi Allaahu anhu it states: <strong>“Indeed, the deceased person will be punished due to the crying of his family over him on the Day of Judgement.”</strong> So this clearly states that the deceased will be punished due to his family crying over him on the Day of Judgement and not in his grave, which is what Ibn Taimiyyah explained as meaning pain and sorrow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second Fact:</strong> When a person dies, he does not feel anything that goes on around him whether good or bad, as indicated by evidences in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, except in certain cases, which have been mentioned in some ahaadeeth either as a rule for every deceased person or for some only whom Allaah enables to hear some things that will cause them pain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So firstly there is the hadeeth reported by Al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh from Anas bin Maalik radhi Allaahu anhu in which he narrated that the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily, when a servant (of Allaah) is placed in his grave, and his companions depart from him – at the point where he can still hear their footsteps – two angels come to him.” </strong>[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This authentic hadeeth affirms a special type of hearing that a deceased person will have at the time he is buried and the people are walking away from him. Meaning: At the time that the two angels come to sit by him, his soul returns to his body and in this state of being, he is able to hear the footsteps (of his loved ones walking away).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the hadeeth does not mean on the outset that this deceased person and all deceased people will have their souls returned to them and that they will remain with the ability to hear the footsteps of the people passing by the graves up until the day that they will be resurrected. No.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a specific circumstance and a special type of hearing on the part of the deceased since his soul has returned to him. So if we were to go by the interpretation of Ibn Taimiyyah at this point, we would be forced to expand the senses of the deceased person to include everything that goes on around him whether at the time he is being transferred to his grave before his burial or after he is placed in his grave – meaning that he can hear his living family members crying over him. This requires a textual proof, which is missing. This is first.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>, some texts from the Qur’aan and the authentic Sunnah indicate that the deceased cannot hear. This is a huge topic and requires an in-depth discussion. However I will mention one hadeeth by which I will close the answer to this question. And it is the statement of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم in which he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily, Allaah has angels that roam throughout earth who convey to me the greetings (of Salaam) on behalf of my ummah.” </strong>[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is meant by <strong>“roam”</strong> is that they frequent gatherings. So every time a Muslim sends Salaat (praises) on the Prophet, there is an assigned angel that conveys this greeting from that Muslim to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم. So if the deceased could hear, the one with the most right from those deceased to hear would be our Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم due to Allaah’s favoring him and particularizing him with special qualities and attributes over all of the prophets, messengers, and rest of mankind. So if anyone had the ability to hear, it would surely be the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم. And furthermore, if the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم were able to hear anything after his death, he would hear the Salaat (praises) of his ummah) on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So here we come to understand the error, or the deviation, of those who ask assistance – not from the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم – but rather from those less than him, whether messengers, prophets or righteous people. This is since if they were to ask assistance from the Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم, he would not hear them as is clearly stated in the Qur’aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ اللّهِ عِبَادٌ أَمْثَالُكُمْ<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And those whom you call besides Allaah are servants (of Allaah) just like you.”</strong></span> [Surah Al-A’raaf: 194]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">إِن تَدْعُوهُمْ لَا يَسْمَعُوا دُعَاءآُمْ<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“If you supplicate to them, they cannot hear your supplication.”</strong></span> [Surah Faatir: 14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, after they die, the deceased cannot hear unless there is some text that applies to a particular situation – as I mentioned before – such as the deceased hearing the footsteps. This concludes the answer to this question.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Part 7 : The Condemnation of the People of Knowledge for this Dome</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that the people of knowledge &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on them &#8211; condemn what has been prohibited by the Sharia&#8217;. Some of them have clearly mentioned their condemnation and some of them -perhaps- have remained silent, since what is known is that there is no advantage to this speech.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps they took into account the permissibility of remaining silent because of the saying of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; to &#8216;Aeysha -radiAllaah anhu:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;If it were not that your people had recently left kufr (disbelief) I would have rebuilt the house (Ka&#8217;ba) on the foundations upon which Ibraheem built it.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Agreed upon by Bukharee and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is understood is that those who openly mentioned their condemnation fulfilled what Allaah had made obligatory upon them, which is advising for the sake of Islaam and the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following are some of those who condemned the building of this dome.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him &#8211; said in his book &#8216;Iqtidaa Siraat ul-Mustaqeem&#8217; :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;…….And this is why, when his apartment was built in the time of the Tabieen (the followers of the Companions) &#8211; I would sacrifice my mother and father for him &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- that<span style="color:#993300;"> they left the top of it as a skylight towards the sky</span>. And it was like that until recent times, with wax placed upon it and rocks on its edges which held it together.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The roof was projecting upwards towards the sky and it was like that at the time the masjid and the mimbar (pulpit) were burnt down in the year six hundred and fifty odd. The fire was so severe in the land of the Hijjaz that it lit up the necks of the camels in Basra. After that came the fitnah (trial) of the Tartars in Baghdad and other Fitn (trials) also came.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Then the Masjid was re-built as it had originally been, as was the roof, and a wooden wall was introduced around the apartment. Then, after a number of years, the dome was erected on the roof whilst there were those who condemned it.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Sanaani &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him &#8211; said in &#8216;Tatheer al-I&#8217;tiqaad&#8217; :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;If you say: This is the grave of the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, a great dome has been built upon it and a lot of money has been spent on it. Then, I say that this is major ignorance of the reality of the situation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Without doubt this dome was not built by the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, nor by his Companions, nor by their successors (Tabieen), nor the followers of the successors, nor the scholars of the Ummah &#8211; the Imaams of his people.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Rather, this dome was imposed on his grave &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; and was built by one of the latter kings of Misr (Eygpt), Qaloon as-Salihee, more well known as king al-Mansoor in the year 678.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He mentioned it in: &#8216;Tahqeeq an-Nasraah bi Talkheehs mu&#8217;aalim Dar al-Hijrah&#8217; and these matters are issued by the governments and not based upon evidences from the text.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">Shaykh Hussain bin Mahdi an-Nuaymi mentions, in his book &#8216;Ma&#8217;arij alAlbaab&#8217;, the statements of some of those who were tried as a result of taking the dome of the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; as sanction for the permissibility of building all domes. A Mufti states, &#8216;From what is well known is that the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; had a dome, just like the &#8216;Aawliya of Madeenah and the &#8216;Aawliya of the rest of the different cities. Building domes is the fashion in every era; it is believed that having a dome is the cause of receiving blessings.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nuaymi &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him &#8211; commented by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;I say: if this is the case, then what about the fact that the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, warned against this, he cautioned and cleared his blessed and pure self &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam from what you did. You did exactly what he specifically prohibited. Was it not sufficient for you that you opposed his command? This (alone) is evidence against yourselves. You were forward in the presence of the Messenger (ie his statement). Did he &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – allude to any of what you hold permissible? Was he pleased with that or did he not prohibit this? As for your belief of blessings descending, then this is from yourselves and not from Allaah, and Allaah has refuted you.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Ikhwaan &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on them &#8211; entered Madeenah at the time of AbdulAzeez &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him -, it was of great importance to them to remove the dome. If only they had done so, but they &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on them &#8211; feared that the fitnah from the <strong>Qubooreeyeen</strong> (the sect of grave-worshippers) would be greater than removing the dome i.e. that removing an evil might lead to something more evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look how many false arguments the Qubooreeyeen have when they are called to remove these domes, some of which are similar to al-Laat, Uzza and Habil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance. &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Chapter 11 &#8211; The prohibition of praying to graves, upon them and in the graveyard</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 &#8211; On the authority of Abdullaah bin Umasr on the authority of the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; where he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Pray some of your prayers in your houses, and do not take them as graves</strong></span>.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhaaree (v.2 p.75) &amp; Muslim (v.6 p.68)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- On the authority of Abu Huraira -radiAllaah anhu &#8211; that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;Do not make your houses into graveyards, verily Shaytaan runs away from the house in which Soorah alBaqarah is recited.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Muslim (v.6 p.568)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is deduced from these two hadeeth, is that the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; ordered that some of the optional prayers should be prayed in homes, and prayer is not kept away from homes, as it is kept away from the graveyards.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 &#8211; On the authority of Abu Murthid al-Ghanawee who said that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> &#8216;Do not sit on graves and do not pray towards them.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Muslim (v.7 p.38) Abu Dawood (v.3 p. 210), Tirmidhee (v.2 p. 154) Nisaee (v.2 p.53)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- On the authority of Abu Sa&#8217;eed al-Khudree -radiAllaah anhu &#8211; who said: that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;The whole earth is a place in which to pray except for graveyards and bathing places.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Abu Dawood (v.1 p.184), Tirmidhee (v.2 p.263) Ibn Majah (v.1 p.246) Ahmad (v.3 p.83) by way of Muhammad bin Ishaaq on the authority of &#8216;Amr bin Yahya bin &#8216;Imarrah on the authority of his father on the authority of Abu Sa&#8217;eed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also by way of Hamad bin Salmah on the authority of &#8216;Amr bin Yahya on the authority of his father. Also as narrated from ath-Thawaree in a Mursalan form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also (p.96) by way of AbdulWahid bin Ziyad on the authority of the &#8216;Amr bin Yahya in a Mosoolun form. It was narrated by Ibn Hibban in his Saheeh, likewise in &#8216;Muwaarid athaaman&#8217; (p.104) &amp; Hakim (v.1 p.251) and he said it fulfilled the conditions of Bukhaaree &amp; Muslim and ad-Dhahabi agreed with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam ibn Taymeeyah said in &#8216;Iqtida as-Siraat al-Mustaqeem&#8217;: &#8216;Narrated by Ahmad and Abu Dawood, Tirmidhee, Ibn Majah and Bazzar and other than them, with good chains of narrations and whoever speaks against this hadeeth has not gathered all its chains.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5- On the authority of Abu Huraira -radiAllaah anhu &#8211; who said: that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;Do not make your houses into graves, do not make my grave as a place of Eid (i.e. regularly visited), and send your prayers upon me, since your prayers reach me from wherever you are.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Abu Dawood and Ahmad (v.8 p.155) from the &#8216;Tarteeb of al-Musnad&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him &#8211; said in &#8216;Iqtida as-Siraat ul Mustaqeem&#8217; (p.321): &#8216;This chain is Hasan.&#8217; then he mentioned what was said regarding one of the narrators, Abdullaah bin Nafa&#8217; asSaaigh, and he mentioned its supporting narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6- On the authority of Abdullaah bin &#8216;Amr -radiAllaah anhu &#8211; that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;Prohibited praying in a graveyard.&#8217;</strong></span> Narrated by Ibn Hibban as is mentioned in &#8216;muwaarid athaaman&#8217; (p. 105).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7- On the authority of Anas -radiAllaah anhu &#8211; that the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>-&#8216;prohibited praying to graves.&#8217;</strong></span> and in another wording: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;He prohibited praying between graves.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by lbn Hibban as in &#8216;Muwaarid&#8217; (p.105), and al Haythamee said in &#8216;Mua&#8217;jam al-zawaid&#8217; (v.2 p.27): narrated by Bazaar, and its narrators are the narrators of the saheeh</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8- On the authority of &#8216;Amroo bin Dinaar who was asked about praying between graves &#8211; who said, &#8216;It was mentioned to me that the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;Banu Israeel took the graves of their Prophets as places of prayer due to that Allaah Ta&#8217;ala cursed them.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Abdur Razzaq (v.1 p.407) and it is a mursal hadeeth (not attributed to the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9- On the authority of Abu Sa&#8217;eed the freed slave al-Mahree who said that the Messenger of Allaah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;Do not take my house as a place of Eid, nor your houses as graves and send your prayers upon me wherever you are, verily your prayers reach me.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hadeeth mursal narrated by Sa&#8217;eed bin Mansoor, as is mentioned in &#8216;Iqtida Siraat ul-Mustaqeem&#8217; (p.322)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Therefore, what is exempted from the prohibition of praying in a graveyard is the funeral prayer, due to the ahadeeth which were mentioned about it:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- On the authority of Ibn Abbas -radiAllaah anhu &#8211; that &#8211;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; passed by a grave where someone was buried just that night and he said; &#8216;when was this person buried?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said; &#8216;last night.&#8217;<br />
He said: &#8216;Why did you not inform me?&#8217;<br />
They said: &#8216;He was buried in the dark of the night, and we disliked to wake you up.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8212; stood for the funeral prayer and we stood in a row behind him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abbas said: &#8216;and I was among them, and we prayed over him.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhaaree (v.3 p.433), Muslim (v.6 p.24 &amp; p.25), and Ahmad (v.7 p.226) with the tarteeb of Sa&#8217;aatee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- On the authority of Abu Huraira -radiAllaah anhu &#8211; that &#8211;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A black man or woman used to live in the masjid, and he died. The Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -did not know about his death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So that day the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -mentioned him and said: &#8216;What happened to that person?&#8217;<br />
They said: &#8216;He died O Messenger of Allaah.&#8217;<br />
He said: Why did you not inform me?<br />
They said: Surely he was such and such, such is his story, and they belittled his matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; said: Show me where his grave is.&#8217; He came to his grave and prayed over him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhaaree (v.3 p.448) and Muslim (v.6 p.25, 26), Ahmad (v.7 p.223, 224) from the tarteeb of Musnad</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- On the authority of Anas bin Malik -radiAllaah anhu &#8211;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A black man used to clean the masjid and he died, he was buried during the night, and when the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; came, he was informed about him. He said: &#8216;Go to his grave.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they went to his grave and he said: &#8216;Certainly these graves are full of darkness for the inhabitants, and indeed Allaah Azza wa Jaal illuminates them by my prayer over them.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he came to the grave and prayed over it, a man from the Ansaar said: &#8216;O Messenger of Allaah! Indeed my brother died and he was not prayed over.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He asked: &#8216;Where is his grave?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he told him, and the Messenger of Allaah went with the Ansaar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Ahmad (v.7 p.225), Sa&#8217;atee mentions in his Takhreej: narrated by al-Bayhaaqi, ibn Mundah and Abu Dawood at-Tayalisee and al-Haythamee mentioned with his wording and said: a part of it is in asSaheeh, it is narrated by Ahmad and its narrators are the narrators of As-Saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- Also on the authority of Anas that &#8211;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; prayed for the woman at her grave, who had been already buried.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Ahmad (v.7) from tarteeb of al-Musnad, as-Sa&#8217;atee mentions: narrated by al-Bazzar and alBayhaqi and narrated by Muslim also by way of Shobah with a chain of the hadeeth from that chapter; concise, with the wording that the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -prayed at a grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is apparent is that the grave is of the woman who used to live in the masjid. This is what is generally understood although another meaning is possible. Allaah Subhana wa Ta&#8217;ala knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 &#8211; On the authority of Yazeed bin Thaabit -radiAllaah anhu &#8211; who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We went out with the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; and when we reached al-Baqee (the graveyard). He came across a new grave. He questioned us about it, so it was said it was such and such woman, and he knew her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8216;Why didn&#8217;t you inform me about her.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: &#8216;O Messenger of Allaah you were sleeping and fasting, we disliked to wake you up.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8216;Don’t do that. There is none amongst you who dies and I am here amongst you, except that you should inform me about that person. Verily my prayer over him is mercy for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yazeed said; then he came to the grave and we made rows behind him, he prayed the funeral prayer over it with four Takbirs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Ahmad (v.7 p.225) from the Tarteeb of al-Musnad. Sa&#8217;atee mentions: it was narrated by anNisa&#8217;ee, al-Bayhaqee and its Sanad is good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam a-Bayhaqee &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him &#8211; said: (v.4 p.48): We were informed by Abu Abdullaah al-Hafidh and Abu Sa&#8217;eed bin Abee &#8216;Amr who both said: Abul-Abbas Muhammad bin Yaqoob narrated to us that ar-Rabia&#8217;bin Sulaiman narrated to us that Bashr bin Bakr narrated to us that al-Awaz&#8217;aee narrated to me that Ibn Shihab informed me on the authority of Abee Umamah bin Sahl ibn Haneef al-Ansaari that some of the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; informed him that &#8211;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">the Messenger of Allaah used to visit the poor, sick Muslims and those who were weak. He would follow their funerals, and no one used to pray over them except the Messenger. There was a poor woman from the people of al-Awaali (a place in Madinah) whose sickness lasted a long time. The Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -used to ask her neighbours about her, from those who used to visit her. He would order them that they should not bury her if anything happened to her, so that he could pray over her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The woman died that night. So, they carried her and brought her with the funeral bier &#8211; or he mentioned the place of the funeral prayer &#8211; in the masjid of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -so that the Messenger of Allaah could pray over her as he had ordered them. However, they found that he had gone to sleep after the Isha prayer, and they disliked waking him from his sleep. They prayed over her, took her and buried her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the morning the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -asked about her from her neighbours who came to visit him. They informed him about her and that they disliked to wake the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; for her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8212; said to them: &#8216;Why didn&#8217;t you do it? Let&#8217;s go.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, they went with the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; until they reached her grave. They arranged themselves in rows behind the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; as they would arrange themselves in rows for the funeral prayer. The Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; prayed over her, and said four takbeers just like he would say the takbeer for the funeral prayer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth is authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now, our noble Shaykh AbdulGhaffar al-Hindi &#8211; may Allaah preserve him &#8211; mentioned during the debate, that he required me to discuss the saying of Allaah Azza Wa Jal: &lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Then those who won their point said: &#8220;We verily shall build a place of worship over them.&#8221;</span></strong> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since it is from the greatest doubts of the Qubooreeyeen (grave worshippers). I responded to his request &#8211; may Allaah preserve him &#8211; after the debate had ended, and I wrote the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Qubooreeyeen have a doubt, and it is regarding the saying of Allaah Ta&#8217;ala &lt;&lt; then those who won their point said: &#8220;We verily shall build a place of worship over them.&#8221; &gt;&gt;</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They say: building masajid on graves was permitted in the Sharia&#8217; for those before us, and it is also permissible for us now, as long as there is no abrogation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reply to this doubt is from the following angles:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: this action was the action of the people of the companions of the cave. The companions of the cave said, describing this nation: &lt;&lt;These, our people, have taken for worship gods other than Him (Allaah) &gt;&gt; Therefore whoever claims that the people of the companions of the cave accepted Islaam after the people of the cave isolated themselves, then he has certainly relied upon the stories of Banu Israeel.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the evidences showing that their people remained upon their disbelief is the saying of Allaah Ta&#8217;ala: &lt;&lt; And thus We made their case known to the people, that they might know that the Promise of Allaah is true, and that there can be no doubt about the Hour &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He who does not know that the promise of Allaah is true and that there is no doubting the final Hour, then he is not a Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Secondly if we accept, for the sake of argument, that they were Muslims, then where do we find in their Sharia&#8217; that building masajid on graves was permissible for them?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it not possible that they arrived at an understanding and were mistaken? Thirdly if we accept for the sake of argument that it has been permitted in the Sharia&#8217; for those before us, then now it has been abrogated with our Sharia&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Ahadeeth are Mutaawatir (recurring chains) from the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -which prohibit the taking of the graves as places of worship. The curse of the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -is upon the one who does this, as is mentioned in Bukharee and Muslim from the hadeeth of &#8216;Aeysha -radiAllaah anha.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>هـل نـسـتـغـفـر النبي؟</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;">Translated &amp; Compiled By Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What has been said about the Ayaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ إِذْ ظَلَمُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ جَاءُوكَ فَاسْتَغْفَرُوا اللَّهَ وَاسْتَغْفَرَ لَهُمُ الرَّسُولُ لَوَجَدُوا اللَّهَ تَوَّابًا رَحِيمًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> If they (hypocrites), when they had been unjust to themselves, had come to you (Muhammad) and begged Allaah’s Forgiveness, and the Messenger had begged forgiveness for them: indeed, they would have found Allaah All-Forgiving (One Who accepts repentance), Most Merciful</strong></span>.&gt;&gt;   [Nisa: 64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>1 – Shaykh ul-Islaam Ahmad bin AbdulHaleem Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) -Rahimullaah- said:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘From the people there are those who interpret the saying of Allaah Ta’ala :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ إِذْ ظَلَمُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ جَاءُوكَ فَاسْتَغْفَرُوا اللَّهَ وَاسْتَغْفَرَ لَهُمُ الرَّسُولُ لَوَجَدُوا اللَّهَ تَوَّابًا رَحِيمًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If they (hypocrites), when they had been unjust to themselves, had come to you (Muhammad) and begged Allaah’s Forgiveness, and the Messenger had begged forgiveness for them: indeed, they would have found Allaah All-Forgiving (One Who accepts repentance), Most Merciful.</strong></span>&gt;&gt; [Nisa: 64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They say : ‘If we seek forgiveness from the Messenger after his death then we are of the status of those who sought forgiveness from amongst the Companions.’  However, with this statement they oppose the Ijmaa (consensus) of the Companions and those who succeeded them with goodness and the rest of the Muslims, since not a single one of them sought from the Prophet –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– after his death that he intercede for them. Nor did they ask him anything and not a single one of the Imams mentioned this in their books.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Majmoo al-Fatawa 1/190]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>2 – Shaykh Allaama Saddeeq Hasan Khan (d. 1307 A.H.) said about this Ayaah :</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This ‘visiting/coming to the Prophet’ is specific to his  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam–  life time, and this does not mean that ‘this visiting /coming to’ is to  the enlightened place where he is buried after his death  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.  What indicates to this is what is mentioned in this Ayaah, as is affirmed in the book: ‘Saarim al-Munky’. This is why none from the Salaf of the Ummahand their Imams, not from  the Companions, Successors, nor from those who followed them in goodness ever took this extreme possibility [of seeking forgiveness from the Prophet –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– after his death.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Fath al-Bayan fee Maqasid al-Qur’aan 2/315]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">3 – Shaykh Abdul Muhsin bin Hamd al-Abbad al-Badr said:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for the saying of Allaah Ta’ala :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ إِذْ ظَلَمُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ جَاءُوكَ فَاسْتَغْفَرُوا اللَّهَ وَاسْتَغْفَرَ لَهُمُ الرَّسُولُ لَوَجَدُوا اللَّهَ تَوَّابًا رَحِيمًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If they (hypocrites), when they had been unjust to themselves, had come to you (Muhammad) and begged Allaah’s Forgiveness, and the Messenger had begged forgiveness for them: indeed, they would have found Allaah All-Forgiving (One Who accepts repentance), Most Merciful</strong></span>.&gt;&gt;   [Nisa: 64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then this Ayaah is in regard to the Munafiqeen, this becomes clear from what preceded this Ayaah and what came after it. ‘Coming to’ the Prophet  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– is specific to, in his lifetime. What is established in ‘Saheeh al-Bukhari’ from the Hadeeth of ‘Aeysha –Radhi Allaahu anha–that when she said: ‘O my head is hurting!’ The Messenger of Allaah –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– said to her:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>ذَاكِ لَوْ كَانَ وَأَنَا حَىٌّ، فَأَسْتَغْفِرُ لَكِ، وَأَدْعُو لَكِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘If you die and I am alive then I will seek forgiveness for you and I will pray for you. . . ‘</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the Prophet –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– was to seek forgiveness for anyone after his death then there would not have been a difference between him dying before her or her dying before him. Some of the people of Bida’ claim that which is much more than that, which is that the Prophet  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– brought his hand out of the grave and shook hands with one of the followers of the people of Bida’. What clearly invalidates this, is that the likes of this never occurred for the Companions –Radhi Allaahu anhum– and they are the best of this Ummah.  The Prophet  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>أَنَا سَيِّدُ وَلَدِ آدَمَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ وَأَوَّلُ مَنْ يَنْشَقُّ عَنْهُ الْقَبْرُ وَأَوَّلُ شَافِعٍ وَأَوَّلُ مُشَفَّعٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">‘I am the leader of the son of Adam on the Day of Judgement and I am the first for whom the grave will be opened and I am the first to intercede and the first to be interceded.’</span></strong> [Muslim] And this opening of the grave will be when the resurrection takes place. Allaah Ta’ala said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>ثُمَّ إِنَّكُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ تُبْعَثُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Then (again), surely, you will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection.</span></strong> &gt;&gt;[al-Muminun : 16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Butlaan Qisatay by AbdurRahmaan al-Umaysaan p.179-180]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaykh Abdul Muhsin bin Hamd al-Abbad al-Badr also said:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for the saying of Allaah -Tabarak wa Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ إِذْ ظَلَمُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ جَاءُوكَ فَاسْتَغْفَرُوا اللَّهَ وَاسْتَغْفَرَ لَهُمُ الرَّسُولُ لَوَجَدُوا اللَّهَ تَوَّابًا رَحِيمًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#000000;">If they (hypocrites), when they had been unjust to themselves, had come to you (Muhammad) and begged Allaah’s Forgiveness, and the Messenger had begged forgiveness for them: indeed, they would have found Allaah All-Forgiving (One Who accepts repentance), Most Merciful.</span></strong>&gt;&gt;   [Nisa: 64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the intent is not approaching his grave  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– after his death, but rather the intent is come to him during his lifetime  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– just as the Companions–Radhi Allaahu anhum– understood it.  I clarified this is in a booklet called ‘The Importance of Tawheed al-Eebaadah’ (p.69) where I said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The inmates of graves are visited and Dua is sought for them and they are not supplicated to. Allaah is requested for them and nothing is requested from them, not Dua’ nor cure nor to achieve benefit nor to repel harm. Since this is indeed requested from Allaah, Allaah -Subhanahu wa Ta’ala- is the One Who is supplicated to and to have hope in. Dua is made for anyone other than Allaah and is not supplicated to, the proof for this is that the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– used to request from him to make Dua during his lifetime and he would make Dua for them. After his death  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam–  during his life of the Barzakeeyah they would not go to his grave  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam–  and requested Dua from him. This is why  when the drought occurred at the time of Umar –Radhi Allaahu anha– he requested Dua for rain from al-Abbas–Radhi Allaahu anha– and Umar requested him to make Dua’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Bukhari collected in his book from Anas that Umar bin al-Khattab used to request Dua for rain from al-Abbas bin AbdulMuttalib, if there was a drought and he would say: ‘O Allaah indeed we used to come closer to You (make Tawassul) with Your Prophet –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– and You [Allaah] would give us rain, and indeed we come closer to You with his uncle, so give us rain,’ then the rain would come down.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if the request for Dua from the Prophet  –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– after his death was permissible Umar –Radhi Allaahu anha– would not have turned away from it and requested Al-Abbas to make Dua’ for rain.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Giving the Kaffir the glad-tidings of the Hellfire and Passing by the Places where the Mushrikeen Where Destroyed</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>18- &#8216;When ever you pass by the grave of a kaffir then give him the glad tidings of the Hellfire.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Origin Of the hadeeth</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;A Bedouin came to the Prophet and said: ‘My father used to keep good relations with his relatives and he used to do such and such good deeds so where is he?” He -sall&#8217;Allaahu alayhi wa sallam- said &#8216;in the fire&#8217;: It was as if the Bedouin was upset due to this, so he said, “O Messenger of Allaah, then where is your father?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8216;Whenever you pass by the grave of a kaffir then give him the glad tidings of the Hellfire.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Bedouin accepted Islaam and he said; the Messenger of Allaah -sall&#8217;Allaahu alayhi wa sallam- gave me the responsibility of a task; I did not pass by a grave of a kaffir except that I gave him the glad tidings of the Hellfire.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>From the understanding of the hadeeth</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a great benefit in this hadeeth which many of the general books of fiqh have neglected which is none other than the legislation of giving the kaffir the glad tidings of the Hellfire if you pass by his grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is in this legislation is not hidden, since it contains that which awakens the believer and reminds him of the danger of the sin of the kaffir, who has committed a great sin which would make all of the sins of the world facing him seem like nothing if they were all gathered together. The sin is disbelief in Allaah Azza wa Jal and committing shirk with him, which Allaah Ta&#8217;ala explained His severe hatred of such that He excludes shirk from His forgiveness. He says</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong>Verily, Allaah forgives not that partners should be set up with him in worship, but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He pleases</strong> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; said; &#8216;That the biggest of the major sins is that you associate a partner to Allaah while He is the One who created you.&#8217; [Agreed upon.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Without doubt ignorance about this benefit is what leads some Muslims to fall into that which is contrary to what Allaah, the Most Wise, intends by this benefit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>With certainty we know that many of the Muslims come to the lands of the kuffar to take care of some of their general or specific interests. However, they do not suffice themselves with just this, rather they intend to visit some of the graves of those who are called great men from amongst the kuffar. They place flowers and wreaths and they stand in front of those graves with humility and sadness which indicates being pleased with those in the graves and not having a detest for them. </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They do this even though the best example i.e. that of the Prophets &#8211; alayhim assalam &#8211; dictates the opposite of what they do, as is mentioned in this authentic hadeeth. Listen to the statement of Allaah Azza wa Jal:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong>Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibraheem and those with him, when they said to their people: Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allaah, we have rejected you, and there has started between us and you, hostility and hatred for ever &gt;&gt;</strong> the Ayaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is their stance against those who were alive, so what about those are dead!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhaaree (2/120) and Muslim (8/221) narrate on the authority of Ibn Umar that the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam said to them when he passed by Hijr (a place where the people had been destroyed):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8216;Do not enter upon these people who were punished, except that you cry, and if you do not cry then do not enter upon them, so what afflicted them does not afflict you.&#8217; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah 19</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[He veiled his face with is garment while he was on his mount]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad narrated this and the extra wording is from his book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sadeeq Hasan Khan mentioned a heading for this hadeeth in his book &#8216;Nazl alAbraar&#8217; p.293, which is; &#8216;Chapter : crying and fear while passing by the graves of the oppressors and the place where they were destroyed, and showing the need of going back to Allaah Ta&#8217;ala and warning against being neglectful about this.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah Ta&#8217;ala to give us the understanding of our Deen and inspire us to perform actions according to it. Indeed He is the One who hears and answers.</p>

<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ إِذ ظَّلَمُوا أَنفُسَهُمْ جَاءُوكَ فَاسْتَغْفَرُوا اللَّهَ وَاسْتَغْفَرَ لَهُمُ الرَّسُولُ لَوَجَدُوا اللَّهَ تَوَّابًا رَّحِيمًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>If, when they had wronged themselves, they had come to you &#8211; O Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) – and had sought Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness, and the Messenger had asked for Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness for them, then they would have found that Allaah would have accepted their repentance and had mercy upon them. </strong></span><span style="text-align:center;">[Sooratun-Nisaa (4): 64]</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Ibnul-Qayyim (<em>rahimahullaah</em>)</strong> said:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Since Allaah – the One free of all imperfections – knew that those to whom the Messenger was sent would certainly wrong themselves and follow their desires, He guided them to that which would repel the evil of that wrong and remove its causes. This lay in two things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>, there was something that they themselves were to do, which was to seek forgiveness of their Lord – the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>, there was something for someone else to do, and this was that the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) should ask forgiveness for them when they came to him, submitted obediently to him and acknowledged their wrong-doing. So, if they were to do these two things, they would find that Allaah would accept their repentance and forgive them. He would accept their repentance, thus wiping away the effect of their sins and protecting them from their evils. In addition to this, He would grant them His Mercy, His favourable and fine treatment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, what share of this Aayah is there for a person who wrongs himself after the death of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ? Does the use of the Aayah support those people who claim that the person should go to his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) grave; ask for forgiveness there, and for his intercession?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reply is that, as for the share of the person who wrongs himself after the death of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) with regard to this Aayah, he should ask for Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness, with sincere repentance and this applies in every time and place. It is not a condition for the correctness of his repentance that he should go to his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) grave, and ask for forgiveness there. (By consensus- Ijmaa&#8221;).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">As for going to his grave and seeking forgiveness there and seeking his intercession, using this Aayah as an evidence, then the Aayah does not indicate this in any sense at all. It only refers to going to him (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ; not going to his grave; nor does it state that he will seek forgiveness for them if they seek intercession from him after his death.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is thus shown to be a false and futile argument which is further clarified by the fact that the Companions, those who of all people knew best about the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) , did not understand the Aayah in this way. So it is known that this is an innovation. That which is most frequently used as evidence by those who permit it, is the narration of al-`Utabee from an unknown Bedouin, even though we do not know any chain of narration for it. If this disconnected report, or it&#8217;s like, were a hadeeth or a report from a Companion, then it would not be permissible to use it as a proof, and its ruling would not be binding upon us because of its lack of authenticity. How then can it be permissible to use as proof for this a story that is not authentic, concerning a Bedouin who is unknown!? [1]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaikh ‘Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Naasir as-Sa`dee</strong> (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Meaning: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If, when they had wronged themselves, they had come to you &#8211; O Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">i.e. acknowledging their sins, and fully confessing them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>…and had sought Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness, and the Messenger had asked for Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness for them, then they would have found that Allaah would have accepted their repentance and had mercy upon them</strong></span>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">i.e. He would have turned to them, forgiven their wrongdoing, and been Merciful to them; by accepting their repentance, guiding them to it and granting it to them, and rewarding them for it. This coming to the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was something specific to his lifetime.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>This is what the context indicates, because seeking forgiveness from the Messenger cannot occur except in his lifetime. As for after his death, then nothing can be sought from him; rather that would be shirk.&#8221;</strong></span> [2]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">* as-Saheehah (no.2926) of Shaikh al-Albaanee-rahimahullaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;From Jaabir ibn `Abdillaah who said: “Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&lt;&lt;Narrate from the Banoo Israa·eel. and there is no harm, because amazing things happened amongst them.&gt;&gt;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he began narrating, and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&lt;&lt; A group from the Banoo Israa.eel went out until they came to one of their grave- yards, and they said: &#8220;If only we were to pray two rak`ahs, and make supplication to Allaah- the Mighty and Majestic -that He should bring out for us a man from those who have died, so that we could ask him about death.&#8221; He said: So they did so. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So, whilst they were in that condition, a man put his head out from a grave from those graves. He was a brownish person, with the mark of prostration between his eyes. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He said “O people what do you want with me? <span style="color:#993300;">I died a hundred years ago, and the heat of death has not subsided from me until just now</span>. So supplicate to Allaah- the Mighty and Majesticfor me so that He should return me to being just as I was”.&gt;&gt;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Reported by Ahmad in &#8220;az-Zuhd&#8221;(16-17), Ibn Abee Shaybah in &#8220;alMusannaf&#8221;(9/62)-without the story, and likewise by al-Bazzaar in his &#8220;Musnad&#8221;(1/108/192: &#8220;Kashful-Astaar&#8221;): from ar-Rabee` ibn Sa`d al-Ju`fee :he heard it from `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Saabit: from Jaabir ibn `Abdillaah who said: Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: &#8230;, and he mentioned it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: The narrators in this chain are reliable, however there is a disagreement about whether Ibn Saabit heard from Jaabir. So Ibn Ma`een was asked: &#8220;Did `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Saabit hear from Jaabir?&#8221; So he said: &#8220;No.&#8221; However Ibn Abee Haatim confirmed his having heard from him, so he said in &#8220;al-Jarh watTa`deel&#8221; (2/2/240): “He narrated from `Umar, but this is mursal; and from Jaabir, and it is connected.” And this is contrary to what he quoted in &#8220;alMaraaseel&#8221; (p.84), and this is more correct, because of what follows.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the hadeeth was reported by `Abd Ibn Humayd in &#8220;al-Muntakhab minalMusnad&#8221; (q.152/1), with its full wording, and likewise by Wakee` in &#8220;azZuhd&#8221;(1/280/56), and by Ibn Abee Daawood in &#8220;al-Ba`th&#8221;(30/5), and in it Ibn Saabit clearly states that he had it narrated to him directly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <strong>the hadeeth is &#8220;Saheeh&#8221;</strong>, and the chain is fully connected, and all praise is for Allaah&#8230;”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Sharh-ul-Usool-ith-Thalaathah by Shaikh Saalih al-Fawzaan<br />
Translated by Dawud Burbank rahimahullaah<br />
</strong>Below in the Transcription of the Audio Explanation of Dawud Burbank</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And that the places of prayer are to be for Allaah alone, so do not invoke or worship anyone along with Allaah. [72:18]</strong><sup>9</sup><strong> </strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is not pleased that anyone should be associated with Him, no matter who it is, and this is stated clearly in the Book and in the Sunnah, however, to one who uses the intellect and who thinks carefully, and who discards blind following and the use of false and futile excuses, and who is alert to his own benefit. And the proof that Allaah is not pleased that anyone else besides Him should be associated with Him no matter who it is, is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And that the places of prayer are to be for Allaah alone, so do not invoke or worship anyone along with Allaah. [72:18]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Masaajid, </em>(the mosques), are the houses of Allaah and they are the places which are prepared for the <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">S</span>alaah </em>(prayer) and they are the most beloved of places to Allaah, and they are houses which Allaah has commanded should be raised and in which His Name should be mentioned. Then these mosques must be made a place for the worship of Allaah alone, nothing for other than Allaah must occur within them, so graves are not to be built in them, nor tombs because the Prophet <span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu‘alaihiwasallam cursed those who did that, and he informed that this is the practice of the Jews and the Christians and he forbade us from that at the end of his life, whilst he was in the throes of death <em>‘alaihi<span style="text-decoration:underline;">ss</span>alaatuwassalaam</em> with his saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Indeed those who came before you used to take the graves as places of prayer…” </strong> (he said this whilst he was dying), <strong>“…Indeed do not take the graves as places of prayer, for I certainly forbid you from that.”</strong><strong>[1]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>allallaahu‘alaihiwasallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Allaah’s curse is upon the Jews and the Christians, they took the graves of their Prophets as places of prayer.”</strong><strong>[2]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the mosques, it is obligatory that they be purified from traces of <em>shirk</em> and idolatory and that they not be built upon the graves, nor should the dead be buried in them after they have been built, rather they should be places for the worship of Allaah alone, the prayer should be established in them, and the Name of Allaah should be mentioned in them, and the Qur’aan should be recited in them, and beneficial lessons should be established in them, and people should remain in them for worship. This is the role of the mosques.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for having in them idols which are worshipped besides Allaah, then these are not mosques, these are shrines of <em>shirk</em>, even if their people call them mosques, because Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And that the mosques, the places of prayer, are for Allaah [72:18]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: not for anyone else besides Him. And because the mosques, they are the place where the people gather and meet, so it is obligatory that they should be pure and free of <em>shirk</em> and <em>bid‘ah </em>(innovations) and false superstitions, because the people acquire knowledge in them and worship, so if anything from shirk and false superstitions are found in the mosques, then they will be influenced by that and they will propagate it upon earth, so it is obligatory that mosques should be purified from <em>shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the greatest of them is <em>al-Masjid-ul-<span style="text-decoration:underline;">H</span>araam </em>(the Sacred Mosque, in Makkaah), just as Allaah, the Majestic and Most High commanded that it should be purified, He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And remember when We showed the site for the House to Ibraaheem and commanded him, that you should not associate anything with Me, and purify My house, for those people who are performing <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">T</span>awaaf</em> and for those who are standing in prayer and performing the bowing and prostration. [22:26]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Purify it from what? Purify it from <em>shirk</em>, and from innovations and false superstitions, just as it is also to be purified from impurities and filthy things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Do not call upon or invoke [72:18]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The, “<em>laa”</em>, is the, ‘no of prohibition’. And the, “<em>tad‘oo</em>”, is a present tense verb which is in the jussive form because of the prohibiting, <em>“laa”</em>, and the sign that it is the jussive form is the removal of the, <em>‘noon’</em>. So the factor which makes it jussive is the, ‘no of prohibition’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So do not invoke, O people, anyone along with Allaah, do not supplicate for help from anyone along with Allaah, such as saying, “O Allaah, O Mu<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>ammad”, “O Allaah, O Abd-ul-Qaadir”, or saying, “O Abd-ul-Qaadir, O Mu<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>ammad”, or the like of that, because Allaah is not pleased with that and will not accept it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying He the Most High, “<em>a<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>adan</em>”, (anyone): is in indefinite form in the context of a prohibition, so therefore it is general to everyone, no-one is excepted, neither any angel drawn close nor any prophet sent, nor any idol, nor any object of worship, nor any grave, nor any Shaikh, nor any beloved servant of Allaah, nor any living person, nor any dead person, no matter who it is.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is general covering everyone who is called upon besides Allaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So do not call upon, do not invoke anyone along with Allaah. [72:18]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this <em>aayah</em> shows that worship will not benefit except with <em>taw<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>eed, </em>and that if <em>shirk</em> is mixed with it, then it becomes null and void and it will be an affliction for the person. Then He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And the places of prayer are for Allaah [72:18]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory that they be built purely and sincerely, that the intention of the one building them should not be to show off or to be heard of or to be remembered as they say, or to be just Islaamic antiquities, all of this is futile.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mosques should be built for worship and with the intention of worship, and the intention in them should be purely and sincerely for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and also they should be built from good and pure earnings, they should not be built from forbidden earnings because they are for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Allah does not accept except what is good and pure”</strong><strong>[3]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the mosques are to be built from lawful spending and the intention of their builders is that it is to be done purely and sincerely seeking the Face of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, he should not intend by building it to obtain praise from the people, or to be remembered, or for show, or to be heard of, because building the mosques is worship and worship, it is obligatory that it should be done purely and sincerely for Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>[9:22 minutes]</strong><br /><strong>Dr. Saleh as Saleh (rahimahullah)</strong></p>



<p>&#8212;</p>



<p><strong>Transcript of the audio: (may Allaah reward the sister who transcribed)</strong></p>



<p>Is the Prophet (Sallallaahu Alaihi Wa sallam) alive in his Grave?</p>



<p>The answer to this question is:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Our Prophet Mohammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) is alive in his grave living the life of barzakh (in Arabic) which is the barrier life, between this life of this world and the next one in the hereafter enjoying all the grace of Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) bestowed upon him as a reward. This type of barzakh life is a medium one between this one and hereafter. His sole is not returned to him such that he lives the life of this world and not connected to him anyway which would make him a life like the life in the hereafter. But rather a medium life of barzakh. And from this way for it is known that he died (صلى الله عليه وسلم) as others died before him from the Prophets and others except for Jesus (عليه السلام), where he Jesus will be sent before the end of time then after that he will die the death we know. Qaala Allaahu ta a&#8217;ala [Allaah سبحانه و تعالىsaid] in Soorathul Anbiya 21:34</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>وَمَا جَعَلۡنَا لِبَشَرٍ۬ مِّن قَبۡلِكَ ٱلۡخُلۡدَ‌ۖ أَفَإِيْن مِّتَّ فَهُمُ ٱلۡخَـٰلِدُونَ</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>And We granted not to any human being immortality before you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), then if you die, would they live forever?</strong></p>



<p>and Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) also said the Sooratur-Rahman verse 26 &amp; 27</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>كُلُّ مَنۡ عَلَيۡہَا فَانٍ۬</strong><br /><strong> وَيَبۡقَىٰ وَجۡهُ رَبِّكَ ذُو ٱلۡجَلَـٰلِ وَٱلۡإِكۡرَامِ</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Whatsoever is on it (the earth) will perish. And the Face of your Lord full of Majesty and Honour will remain forever.</strong></p>



<p>And He Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) the one free of all imperfections, the most high said, in soorathul Zumar (39:30)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">إِنَّكَ مَيِّتٌ۬ وَإِنَّہُم مَّيِّتُونَ</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Verily, you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will die and verily, they (too) will die</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">and the like of the verses indicating that Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) told them to die. And because the companions washed him (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and performed the funeral prayer upon him. And they buried. Had he been living the life of this world, they wouldn&#8217;t have done to him what they did like what is done with any deceased. And also because Fatima his daughter, may Allah be pleased with her, sought the inheritance of her father because she believed that he died. But no one of the companions agreed with her inheritance claim and Abu Bakr responded to her that the Prophets are not to be inherited. Rather they have there is no inheritance from them. They are not inherited. And because also companions, may Allaah be pleased with them ,gather to choose a Khaleefa some one to succeed the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and that is done by choosing of AbuBakar ( رضي الله عنه) and has the Prophet(صلى الله عليه وسلم) been alive the life we know all, they wouldn&#8217;t have done that. so, in this therefore there is consensus that he died.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And that the fitan and the problems and the afflictions which increased during the time of Uthmaan, may Allaah be pleased with him, and even before and after him the companions did not go to his grave consulting with him or asking him as to the way out from these problems, afflictions and tribulations. And have he been alive the life of this world, he wouldn&#8217;t have left it while they were in need to be saved from these afflictions.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">so all these evidences stand to prove that this special life of the barzakh is for our prophet the other prophets except Jesus and the others who die and it does not resemble the life of this world nor that of the hereafter and therefore from this we know the wrong committed by many people who go and travel to the grave of the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) seeking him and calling him thinking that he is alive and he responds to their requests as if he was in this life where they use to go him to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) asking him to invoke Allaah for them at the time of the companions.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">May Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) guide us to the true path of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) which he was upon and his companions were upon, the path of the righteous predecessors. May Allaah save us from all afflictions and innovations.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions, and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Ruling on Visiting Graves and Its Benefits</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Visiting the graves is legalized for men, and the preponderating opinion is that it is forbidden for women. In visiting graves, there are two benefits.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) A lesson for the visitor – It will help remind the believer of the Hereafter.<br />
2) Seeking Allaah’s (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى: subhaanallaahu wa ta’aalaa) forgiveness for the deceased</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Scenarios of Visiting Graves</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Visiting graves falls into the following categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) Visiting the graves in order to call upon their occupants – This is major shirk and takes the person out of Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Example: The visitor says, “O so and so, I ask you to relieve me.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) Visiting the graves in order to invoke Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) by the gravesite – This is in principle an innovation; in addition, it can turn into a fitnah (affliction) for the visitor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For instance, if Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) answers his request, he may think it was due to the blessing of the grave’s occupant; however, we know the occupant possesses nothing of this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3) Visiting the grave to invoke Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) by the occupant – This involves putting the grave’s occupant as an intermediary between him and Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى); this is unlawful and could become major shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Example: “O Allaah, I ask you by the right of this occupant and the right of Muhammad (: sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) upon you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4) Visiting the grave in order to agitate grief – Shaykh al-Islam ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah) said anything that agitates the affliction is from lamentation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Example: Whenever a person remembers his beloved ones (e.g. father, mother, relatives, etc.) that have died, he visits their graves and this may fall under lamentation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5) Visiting the graves to invoke Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) for its inhabitants – <strong>This is permissible</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6) Visiting the graves for remembrance of the Hereafter and contemplation – <strong>This is permissible.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, only the last two scenarios fulfill the legal justifications for visiting the graves, and both are recommended.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Visiting the Prophet’s (صلى الله عليه وسلمصلى الله عليه وسلم) Grave</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Establishing a journey specifically for visiting the Prophet’s (صلى الله عليه وسلم) grave is forbidden; however, establishing a journey to visit his masjid is permissible. If a person is visiting his masjid and passes by his grave at which point he makes salaam, there is no harm in that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is imperative to remember that there is a difference in legality between visiting the grave of the Prophet and the legal visits to the rest of the graves. Other graves are apparent while his grave is screened by three walls. It is because Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) answered the Prophet’s (صلى الله عليه وسلم) invocation when he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O Allaah, do not make my grave an idol that is worshipped.”</strong> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) answered his call as it is being sealed and screened by these walls. The people of knowledge, including Shaykh al-Islam ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah) noted, this barrier is the reason why it is permissible for women to &#8220;visit&#8221; the grave of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم), since it is shielded while others are apparent. Similarly, in normal visits to graves, the person stands by the head of the deceased; however, this is not the situation at the Prophet’s (صلى الله عليه وسلم) gravesite.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Etiquettes at the Prophet’s (صلى الله عليه وسلم) Grave</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a person stands by the grave of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم), one may say :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Salaam be upon you O Messenger of Allaah. I bear witness that you have delivered the message, fulfilled the trust, and advised the Ummah.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible for anyone to raise his hands by the grave, and worse than that is to do so with his face towards it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the person finishes his salaam to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم), he should give salaam to the Prophet’s (صلى الله عليه وسلم) companions, Abu Bakr (radiyallaahu ‘anhu) and ‘Umar (radiyallaahu ‘anhu).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Women also may do the greeting since (i) this is a &#8220;following&#8221; of the preceding &#8220;visit&#8221; and not an &#8220;independent one,&#8221; and (ii) they would be like the situation of passing by a cemetery where, according, to some opinions, they are allowed to great the grave occupants. And Allaah Knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[59] <strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Is it permissible to excavate the graves of the Muslims and the graves of the disbelievers?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: There is a difference, naturally, between excavating the graves of the Muslims and excavating the graves of the disbelievers. Thus, excavating the graves of the Muslims is not permissible except until after the corpse has deteriorated and become decay. This is since excavating the grave would expose the buried cadaver and its bones to wreckage, and the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, said: &#8220;Breaking the bones of a deceased believer is like breaking his bones if he were alive.&#8221; So the believer has sanctity after his death, just as he used to have sanctity during his lifetime. However, this sanctity is of course within the legislated bounds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for excavating the graves of the disbelievers, then they do not possess this (same) sanctity. Therefore, it is permissible to excavate them based on what is established in Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim that when the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216; alayhi wa sallam, migrated from Makkah to Madeenah, the first thing he instituted was the construction of the Prophet&#8217;s masjid, which is still in existence today. But (at that time), there used be a garden there that belonged to a group of orphans from the Ansaar, in which were graves of polytheists. So he, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, said to these orphans: &#8220;Give me a price for your land.&#8221; He meant by this, &#8220;Sell me your land for it&#8217;s price.&#8221; They responded: &#8220;It is for Allaah and His Messenger. We do not want any price for it.&#8221; And there was found old ruins and graves of polytheists on that land. So the Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, put someone in charge of the graves of the polytheists and so they were leveled (and the bodies were taken out). And he put someone in charge of the old ruins and they were flattened. Then the Prophet&#8217;s masjid was established on the ground of that garden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, the excavation of the graves is from two perspectives. As for it being done to the Muslim graves, then it is not permissible. And as for it being done to the disbelievers&#8217; graves then it is permissible. I have indicated in the response, that it is not permissible to excavate the Muslims&#8217; graves until the bodies first deteriorate and become dust, but when is this? Indeed, it differs according to the different types of land. There are arid desert lands, in which corpses can remain for as many years as Allaah wills. And there are moist lands, which expedite the decaying of the bodies buried in them. Thus, it is not possible to put a regulation that would determine the specific time it takes for the bodies to decay. So just as it is said: &#8220;The inhabitants of Makkah are the most knowledgeable about its mountain trails&#8221;, then those individuals who bury people in that land know best the approximate time it takes for the dead buried in the graves to decay.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q : A brother from Dar&#8217;a, Syria asks: What is the correct opinion about the stories narrated from one of the famous leaders of Sufism, Al-Sayyid <strong>Ahmad Al-Rifa&#8217;y</strong> that he visited the Mosque of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in Al-Madinah and supplicated at the Prophet&#8217;s grave. The Messenger (peace be upon him) then stretched his hand out to him and he kissed it?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">This is a widespread belief among the followers of his Tariqah (Sufi order). It is a belief they hold firmly, even though he lived in the 6th century A.H. How true is this story?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph">A : This is false and baseless, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) died as decreed by Allah (Glorified be He) who says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Zumar, 39: 30" target="_blank" name="Verilyyou(OMuhammad%D8%B5%D9%84%D9%89%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Verily you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will die, and verily they (too) will die.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> [Surah Al-Zumar, 39: 30]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph">According to a Sahih Hadith, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph"><span id="ContentParagraph"><span style="color:#008000;">Allah has angels roaming around the land; if they find anyone greeting me, they carry back these greetings to me.</span></span><span style="color:#008000;">There is no one who sends greetings upon me but Allah will restore my soul to me so that I may return his greeting.</span></span><span id="ContentParagraph">[1]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (peace be upon him) said: <a name="Themostexcellentofyourdays"></a><span id="ContentParagraph"><span style="color:#008000;">The most excellent of your days is Friday; so invoke more blessings on me on that day, for your blessings will be submitted to me.</span> The people asked: O Messenger of Allah, how can it be that our blessings will be submitted to you while your body is decayed? He replied: <span style="color:#008000;">Allah, the Exalted, has prohibited the earth to consume the bodies of the prophets. </span></span><span id="ContentParagraph">[2]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Hadiths which say similar things but it is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>not narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said that he would shake hands with anybody</strong></span>. This indicates that this story is false. Even if we were to assume that it is true, then it could be that this was a <strong>shaytaan</strong> (devil) who shook hands with him in order to deceive him and lead him and others astray.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What all Muslims have to do is to fear Allah and adhere to His Shari`ah, which is indicated in His Noble Book and in the Sunnah of His trustworthy Messenger, and beware of anything that goes against that. May Allah reform the Muslims and grant them understanding of His religion and cause them to adhere to His Shari`ah, for He is the Most Generous, Most Kind.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">source: fataawaa jeddah, tape no. 13/4<br />
<em>asaheeha translations</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: “How do we reconcile between the Prophet’s (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) prohibition of praying in the graveyard and his praying over the grave of the woman who used to sweep the mosque?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaikh al-Albaani</strong> (<em>rahimahullaah</em>):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There is no contradiction between the two<em> hadeeth</em>s, and all praise is due to Allaah. The first <em>hadeeth</em> with the prohibition of praying in the graveyard is as his  (<em>‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) saying in Saheeh Muslim: ‘Don’t sit on graves and don’t pray towards them.’[1] So the prohibition of praying in the graveyard, i.e. praying towards the graves, is because <strong>prayer must be sincerely for the Face of Allaah (<em>tabaarak wa ta’aala</em>) without any glorification for other than Allaah corrupting it or being mixed with it,  as that is one type of <em>shirk</em></strong>.[2] So if a Muslim begins to pray to Allaah while facing the grave, there is an obvious suspicion that this person at least intends – as many of the ignorant people do in this era – to seek blessing from this dead person by means of his prayer and by means of his seeking nearness to Allaah (<em>‘azza wa jal</em>) with his prayer. Thus, he has fallen into some <em>shirk</em>,  and he may go too far into it such that his situation reaches the point where it would expel him from the circle of Islaam, and refuge is sought in Allaah. This meaning is what should be considered with regard to the Messenger’s (<em>‘alayhi ssalaam</em>) prohibition of praying in the graveyard or praying towards the grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for praying over the dead person while he is in his grave, then this is something else. It has no connection with (the previous situation of) praying to Allaah – Who is alone with no partner – while facing the grave of the dead person, the intention of which is not so that Allaah forgives him, has mercy on him, as is the implied purpose when supplicating over the dead person.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, <strong>praying over the dead person while he is in his grave is one thing, and praying to Allaah (<em>‘azza wa jal</em>) while facing the grave is another thing</strong>.<strong> This (the latter) is what is prohibited and that (the former) is what is allowed</strong>, so there is no contradiction between this and that.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">Taken from Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah of Shaykh Al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 3112 – On the authority of ‘Aeysha that Prophet<em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Perform a portion of your prayer in your homes and do not make your homes as graves unlike the Jews and the Christians who placed graves in their homes.Indeed the house in which the Qur’aan is recited will be made apparent to the people of the Heaven just as the stars are made apparent to the people of the earth.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dhahabi said at the end of this hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This hadeeth has a clean <em>Isnaad</em> and its text is<em>Hasan</em>. It is a prohibition of burying people in houses and there is a supporting narration with another chain.The Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em>prohibited building over graves and if the people were to be buried in their homes, then graves and houses would become one thing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Prayer in a graveyard is prohibited, whether it is a prohibition due to dislike or a prohibition meaning Haraam. The Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em>said: ‘The best prayer of a man is in his house except for that which is obligatory.’So it is appropriate that homes are not taken as graves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> being buried in the house of ‘Aa’ishah then this is specific to the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.Just as his garment being spread out under him in the niche of his grave was specifically for him and just as it was specific to him that they each Companion prayed over him, individually, without an <em>Imam</em>, since he was their <em>Imam</em> in life and in death, in the <em>Dunya</em>and in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as it was also specific to him that his burial was delayed for two days, contrary to his <em>Ummah</em> for whom it is not allowed to delay the burial, since the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> is protected from change after death unlike us.They delayed his burial so that everyone could pray over him at his house and, therefore, the delay was due to that matter and also their being hesitant regarding his death for half the day until Abu Bakr came forward with his opinion.This was the reason for the delay.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ vol.7 Hadeeth no.3112p.306-307]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">By the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Need to Know the Actions of the Salaf whilst Studying the Book and the Sunnah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad Nasir- Deen Al-Albaani (d.1420A.H) <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>said in the lecture entitled: ‘Usool Dawaat as-Salafeeyah’:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It is necessary upon every individual who wants to be upon the Salafi <em>Manhaj</em> that just as he studies the Book and the Sunnah, he must study what the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em> from amongst the Companions and those who followed them and then those who followed them were upon. This is because they were the ones who conveyed this <em>Dawa’ </em>correctly until it reached us.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Albaani <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>continued:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Here is an example in front of you, how they distinguished between the Hadeeth which are <em>Aahaad</em> (singular chains) and the Hadeeth which are <em>Mutawaatir</em> (multiple chains). They say the ‘<em>Aqeedah</em> (the Muslim creed) can only be taken from Hadeeth <em>Tawatir </em>(narrations with multiple chains), and because of this they sometimes fall into some very strange contradictions. The reason for this is their distancing themselves from the Salafi <em>Manhaj</em>, since some of the <em>Sharia’</em> texts comprise of ‘<em>Aqeedah</em> and <em>Hukm</em> (Creed and <em>Fiqh</em> ruling) in the same issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of this is the saying of the Messenger of Allaah  and this Hadeeth is in Bukhari and Muslim from the Hadeeth of Abu Hurairah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em>who said the Messenger of Allaah  said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If one of you sits in the [last] <em>Tashahud</em>; then he should seek refuge with Allaah from four things; [he says: ‘O Allaah verily I seek refuge with You] from the punishment of the Hell-Fire, and from the punishment of the grave, and from the <em>Fitna</em> of life and death, and from the evil of the <em>Fitna</em> (trials) of the <em>Maseeh ad-Dajjal</em>.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Hadeeth contains an order to seek refuge from these four things. So this issue contains a <em>Hukm</em> (<em>Fiqh</em> ruling) from the <em>Sharia’</em>, they agree with us that Hadeeth ‘<em>Aahaad</em> (singular chains) do actually affirm <em>Sharia’</em> rulings, so subsequently it does not necessitate except that they should accept this Hadeeth which contains the order to seek refuge from four things, ‘I seek refuge in you from the punishment of the grave and from the <em>Fitna</em> of life and death, and from the evil of the <em>Fitna</em> (trials) of the<em>Maseeh ad-Dajjal</em>.’ So do they really believe in the punishment of the grave?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here they fall into what is said as, ‘chaos and confusion’. Punishment of the grave is from the ‘<em>Aqeedah</em>, however according to their beliefs the punishment in the grave cannot be affirmed with Hadeeth which are <em>Aahaad</em> (singular chains). This is why they do not believe in the punishment of the grave except for that which is mentioned in the verse of the Qur’aan regarding Pharoah specifically:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; The Fire, they are exposed to it morning and evening. &gt;&gt;[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Fire is the punishment for Pharaoh, the family of the Pharaoh and likewise for the disbelievers generally, then those Muslims who rightfully deserve a little of the punishment of the grave then this is something that they do not believe in. This stems from nothing other than a false creed, which is when they say: ‘If the authentic Hadeeth is not <em>Mutawaatir</em> then the ‘<em>Aqeedah</em> cannot be established upon that,’ this is why they reject many, many Ahadeeth, due to their claim that these Ahadeeth do not reach the level of <em>Tawaatur</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example as you know <em>InshaAllah</em>&#8211; the Hadeeth of Bukhari from Ibn Abbas <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said: that the Prophet  passed by two graves and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for the two inmates of these graves then they are being punished and they are not being punished for something major, as for one of them then he used to spread gossip and as for the other he would not protect himself from urine, – [and in another narration: would not veil himself from others while urinating or protect himself from urine splashing on himself.]’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Prophet  ordered for a branch from a date tree to be brought to him and he broke it into two and placed a piece at the head of each grave, the companions asked him about this and he replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Perhaps Allaah –Azza wa Jal- may lighten their punishment as long as these branches do not dry up.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Hadeeth is in Saheeh Bukhari, in it you find that the Prophet  clearly mentioned that these two people were Muslims, even so they were being punished and the Messenger of Allaah supplicated for them for Allaah to lighten their punishment for the time that the two branches remained moist.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, there is another Hadeeth in which the  Prophet  said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Protect yourself from urine as indeed most of the punishment in the grave is due to urine.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Ahadeeth like this, and from these Ahadeeth is also the statement of the Prophet  when he passed by two graves of the <em>Mushrikoon</em> who had died in the time of <em>Jahileeyah</em>, the Prophet  said: ‘If these had not been buried I would have let you hear the punishment of the grave.’ [Bukhari &amp; Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though there is a mention of these Ahadeeth regarding the punishment of the grave concerning some of the <em>Mushrikeen</em>, and some of the Muslims, the deviants and philosophers negate these Ahadeeth and do not believe in them or what they mean. They do this implementing their philosophy that these Ahadeeth are Ahadeeth <em>Aahaad</em>(singular chain). So what is their stance to the Hadeeth of Abu Hurairah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If one of you sits in his final <em>Tashahud</em> then he should seek refuge in Allaah from four things…’ and one of those things is the punishment of the grave. Even if they seek refuge in Allaah from the punishment of the grave to carry out a legislated ruling which is obligatory upon them, because they do not differ with us in that it is obligatory to accept the Ahadeeth ‘<em>Aahaad</em> in rulings and this action has a ruling from the <em>Sharia’</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah  ordered us to supplicate with this <em>Dua’</em> in the last <em>Tashahud</em>. They take this ruling as they say, and what they say is true since the truth is with us. So how do they take this ruling and yet they do not believe in the punishment of the grave, they do not believe and affirm this punishment?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, they are confused, misguided and deviated due to this philosophy which causes them to exit from that which the Companions of the Prophet  were upon, which was not distinguishing between Ahadeeth being ‘<em>Aahaad</em> and <em>Mutawaatir</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Salaf did not make this distinction between <em>Aahaad</em> and <em>Mutawaatir</em>, nor did any of the four Imams who followed the Salaf as Salih in their beliefs, except those who deviated from some of the misguided sects at the time of the followers of the successors such as the Mutazila and Khawarij etc. So these people have opposed the path of the believers and so the threat of the Lord of the worlds is justified upon them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">وَمَن يُشَاقِقِ ٱلرَّسُولَ مِنۢ بَعۡدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ ٱلۡهُدَىٰ وَيَتَّبِعۡ غَيۡرَ سَبِيلِ ٱلۡمُؤۡمِنِينَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"> نُوَلِّهِۦ مَا تَوَلَّىٰ وَنُصۡلِهِۦ جَهَنَّمَۖ وَسَآءَتۡ مَصِيرًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>&lt;&lt;</strong> And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him <strong>and follows other than the way of the believers</strong> – We will give him what he has taken and drive him into Hell, and evil it is as a destination. <strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a very clear example, which emphasizes for you that adhering to the Book and the Sunnah alone does not benefit them, as they reject the Sunnah in relation to what they entitle ‘Hadeeth <em>Ahad’</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore protection and perfection is adhering to that which the Salaf were upon. This is why we find one of our Imams from those who have an excellence in directing us to adhering to this <em>Manhaj</em>, the <em>Manhaj</em> as-Salaf as-Salih- in understanding the Book and the Sunnah, that Imam was Ibn al Qayyim who gathered this meaning of the <em>Manhaj</em> of Salaf-as –Salih in a line of poetry where he said</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Knowledge is what Allah said what His Messenger said what the Companions said’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He did not say ‘knowledge is what Allah said and what His Messenger said’ rather he added to that ‘what the Companions said’ and do you know why he said this? Because the verses in the Qur’aan and the authentic Ahadeeth all indicate that the saved sect is that which adheres to what the Salaf and Companions of the Prophet were upon.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The difference between the <em>‘Aqeedah </em>of the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em> and the<em>‘Aqeedah</em> of the grave worshipping Soofis</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Compiled by Abbas Raheem<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The grave worshipping Soofis promote matters of <em>Shirk</em> and innovation by way of the media, and from those matters is <em>Isteegatha</em>(seeking closeness to Allaah) from the dead of the Prophets, and the righteous people.  This is a refutation against their falsehood and their trickery of the worshippers by mentioning what is ambiguous from the texts of Islaam, and using weak hadeeth and narrations, and their own understanding of the authentic hadeeth other than the understanding of the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em>.  This refutation also contains the position of the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em> regarding this issue, according to the<em>‘Aqeedah</em> of the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em>, and all capability is from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Isteegatha</em> linguistically means requesting aid and victory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Sharia’</em> definition: There is no difference with the linguistic meaning, since it means requesting help and relief from distress.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em>Isteegatha</em> is a type of <em>Dua’</em>(supplication), and <em>Dua’</em> is worship, as has been mentioned in the hadeeth of an-Numaan bin Basheer who said that the Messenger  of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said : ‘<em>Dua’</em> is worship.’  Narrated by Ahmad and Tirmidhee and he said the hadeeth was <em>hasan saheeh</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the principles of the <em>Sharia’</em> is that all worship, whether apparent or internal, is prohibited until there is an evidence from the<em>Sharia’</em> that makes the action permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once this is understood, then know – may Allaah have mercy upon you, and may He direct you to His obedience &#8211;   that making<em>Isteegatha</em> from the people is divided into two sections according to the <em>Salaf</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first</strong> :  The <em>Isteegatha</em> which is permissible : and that is seeking assistance in the time of need from a living person, with that which he has the ability to help with, without having to lower oneself to that person, or with humiliation in any form, or having submission in the same way that you ask from Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From amongst the evidences that show the permissibility of this type of <em>Isteegatha</em> is:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>a)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> regarding the story of Musa <em>– alayhi as-sallam &#8211;</em> : &lt;&lt;The man from his (own) party asked him for help against his foe&gt;&gt;</li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>b)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;Help one another in goodness and piety, and do not help one another in sin and transgression.&gt;&gt;</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second</strong>: The <em>Isteegatha</em> which is prohibited, is of two types:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>a)</strong> Seeking assistance from living people with that which only Allaah<em>Ta’ala</em> has the ability to help with, and there is agreement amongst the scholars, that this is prohibited.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from amongst the evidences for this issue, is the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;And invoke not besides Allaah, any that will neither profit you, nor hurt you…..&gt;&gt;</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>b)</strong> Making <em>Isteegatha</em> with the dead, from the Prophets or the righteous people.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the proofs of this prohibition is the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;And if My slaves ask you about Me, then I am close, and I answer the <em>Dua’</em> of the caller if he supplicates to Me.  So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So ponder – may Allaah look after you – about when the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> was faced with questions, and the answer would come from Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>, and Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> would make the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>  an intermediary to convey the answer, so Allaah would say to him : &lt;&lt;<strong>Say</strong>….&gt;&gt; meaning O Muhammad tell them.  The following are examples of that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;They ask you about the new moons.  <strong>Say</strong>: these are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage. &gt;&gt; 2:186</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> : &lt;&lt;They ask you concerning fighting in the Sacred Months (i.e. 1st, 7th, 11th and 12th months of the Islaamic calendar). Say, “Fighting therein is a great (transgression) but a greater (transgression) with Allaah is to prevent mankind from following the Way of Allaah, to disbelieve in Him,&gt;&gt; 2:217</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;They ask you (O Muhammad ) concerning alcoholic drink and gambling. Say: ‘In them is a great sin, and (some) benefit for men, but the sin of them is greater than their benefit.’ &gt;&gt; 2:219</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;They ask you what they should spend.  <strong>Say</strong> : whatever you spend of good&gt;&gt; 2 : 215</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>5)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;They ask you for a legal verdict. Say: ‘Allaah directs (thus) about <em>Al­Kalâlah</em> (those who leave neither descendants nor ascendants as heirs) &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>6)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;They ask you what is lawful for them as food. <strong> Say</strong> : lawful unto you are all kinds of <em>halaal</em> food. &gt;&gt; 5:4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>7)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;They ask you about the Hour (Day of Resurrection): ‘When will be its appointed time?’ Say: ‘The knowledge thereof is with my Lord (Alone). &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>8)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;They ask you about the spoils of war. <strong>Say</strong>: the spoils of war are for Allaah and the Messenger&gt;&gt; 8: 1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> was an intermediary to convey the message directed to him from Allaah <em>Ta’ala </em>by His saying : &lt;&lt;Say…&gt;&gt;, except in the issue of <em>Dua’</em>.  Indeed Allaah<em>Ta’ala</em> did not make the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> an intermediary for <em>Dua’</em>, but Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> Himself undertakes the answering of the<em>Dua’</em> directly without saying: &lt;&lt;Say…&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> was asked: ‘O Messenger of Allaah, is our Lord close so we can have intimate discourse with Him, or is He far, so that we have to call in a loud voice?’  Then Allaah revealed: &lt;&lt;And if My slaves ask you about Me, then I am close, and I answer the <em>Dua’</em> of the caller if he supplicates to Me.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Abdullaah bin Ahmad bin Hanbal in his book ‘Kitab as-Sunnah’1/ 277 and Ibn Hibban in his book ‘ath-Thiqaat’8/436, and at-Tabari mentioned it as a reason for the revelation of the <em>Ayaah</em> in his <em>Tafseer</em> book 2/158, and Ibn Katheer in his <em>Tafseer</em> book 1/219, and Qurtubi in his <em>Tafseer</em> book 2/308, and he mentioned it as a reason for it being revealed, on the authority of Hasan al-Basari – may Allaah have mercy upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is a divine indication that Allaah does not love that, nor is a slave in need of intermediaries or intercessors when he supplicates to his Lord <em>Azza wa Jaal</em>, rather he supplicates to Allaah directly and the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> &lt;&lt;So let them obey Me &gt;&gt; means : that they supplicate to Me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;Say O Muhammad: I do not possess anything for myself that will benefit me nor harm me.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">so indeed this <em>Ayaah</em> clearly explains that he (the Messenger of Allaah) does not control for himself that which will benefit him nor that which will harm him, so how can he possess that for anyone else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what confirms this point is the saying of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> : ‘O Fatima daughter of Muhammad, O Safiya, daughter of AbdulMuttalib, O tribe of AbdulMuttalib, I do not possess anything for you from Allaah, but ask me whatever you want from my wealth.’ Narrated by Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3)</strong> The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;Say (O Muhammad): ‘Call unto those besides Him whom you pretend [to be gods like angels, Iesa (Jesus), ‘Uzair (Ezra), etc.]. They have neither the power to remove adversity from you nor even to shift it from you to another person.’ &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the <em>Salaf</em> said that this <em>Ayaah </em>was revealed about groups of people who used to supplicate to <em>al-Azeez</em>, the Messiah and the angels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a person says that those people used to worship them (angels, prophets etc.)  and not worship Allaah, but as for us then we don’t worship them, rather,  we take them as intermediaries and intercessors with Allaah !!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the answer to them is: This statement of yours, is like the statement of the <em>Mushrikeen</em> at the time of the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;We do not worship them except that they bring us closer to Allaah&gt;&gt; and in spite of what they said, their claim was not accepted, nor did it benefit them, and the Messenger of Allaah fought against them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4)</strong> A fundamental principle is that the dead are not like the living, Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> says: &lt;&lt;The living and the dead are not the same&gt;&gt; fundamentally the dead do not hear the living.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> said: &lt;&lt;And you do not make those in the graves to hear.&gt;&gt; except where the evidence shows exceptions to this principle, and here are some examples:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>a)</strong> When the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> spoke to the dead of the<em>Mushrikeen</em> after the battle of <em>Badr</em>, while they were in the well before they were buried.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And about this Ibn Qudamah al-Maqdasee – may Allaah have mercy upon him – said: ‘and this was a miracle of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and a matter that was specific to him, so you cannot use for anyone other than him.’ Taken from ‘Kitaab al-Mughnee’10/63.</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>b)</strong> The dead hear the footsteps of his companions.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>c)</strong> The soul of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> is returned to him so that the angels can convey to him the <em>Sallam</em> of anyone who sends <em>Sallam</em> upon him.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>d)</strong> When the dead person hears the <em>Sallam</em> of the one who sends<em>Sallam</em> to him at his grave. This is according to those who authenticate this hadeeth.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no evidence to show that the dead person hears the living person who asks of him and makes a request from him, and if there is no evidence for this then the principle is that the issue remains as it is, that the dead cannot hear the living.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the fundamental principle is that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> is human, and the origin regarding the issue of death, is that he is like the rest of mankind. Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> says: &lt;&lt;Indeed you will die, and indeed they will die&gt;&gt; except for what the evidence exempts, that the earth does not eat up his body and that his soul is returned to him in the grave to receive the <em>Sallam</em> of the one who sends <em>Sallam</em> to him, and that the actions of his <em>Ummah</em>are presented to him, and this is according to those who authenticate the hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since the dead not being able to hear the living has been established about the leader of the sons of Adam <em>– alayhi as-Sallam –</em> then this more readily applies to other than the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>. If this is established that the Prophets do not hear the question of the one asking the question, then ponder over the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;And who is more astray than one who calls (invokes) besides Allaah, such as will not answer him till the Day of Resurrection, and who are (even) unaware of their calls (invocations) to them?&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>5</strong> – The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>: &lt;&lt;So when you have finished, then stand up for Allaah’s worship.  And to your Lord turn all your invocations&gt;&gt; and He did not say ‘Turn your invocations to the Prophets and the righteous people.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam at-Tabaree, may Allaah have mercy upon him, said, ‘The saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala:</em> &lt;&lt;And to your Lord turn all your invocations&gt;&gt;  Allaah mentions is : O Muhammad direct your fervent desires to your Lord, and not to any one from the creation since the <em>Mushrikeen</em> from your people have made their fervent desires to gods and their  associates. The people of <em>Tafseer</em> have also said similar to what we have just mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from the book <em>Tafseer</em> at-Tabaree 30 / 237.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>6</strong> – Indeed what the Companions <em>&#8211; radi Allaahu anhum &#8211;</em> knew and understood is that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> was not made as someone from who aid was sought after his death nor was he taken as an intermediary, and this is confirmed by what has been narrated by al-Bukhari 1 / 342 and others have also narrated this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Anas <em>&#8211; radi Allaahu anhu &#8211;</em>  and then on the authority of Umar bin al-Khattab  <em>&#8211; radi Allaahu anhu &#8211;</em>  if there was a drought, he would request rain by asking al-Abbas bin AbdulMuttalib, and he would say : ‘O Allaah indeed we used to come closer to You (make<em>Tawassul</em>) with Your Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and You would give us rain, and indeed we come closer to You with his uncle, so give us rain,’ then the rain would come down.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if you dear brother, dear reader, being unbiased, ponder that Umar and the senior Companions did not regard the permissibility of (<em>Tawassul</em>) coming closer to Allaah nor seeking assistance with the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> after his death, compared to when he was alive, in fact in their request for rain they used to make <em>Tawassul</em> with the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, but after he passed away they did not make <em>Tawassul</em> with him. Indeed Umar <em>&#8211; radi Allaahu anhu   &#8211;</em> said in his authentic, well-known and established supplication, agreed upon by the people of knowledge, which was said in the presence of the<em>Muhajiroon</em> and the <em>Ansaar</em> in the famous year of the Great Drought. When the drought became severe and the people requested rain, he said : ‘O Allaah we used to, if we suffered from a drought, we used to make <em>Tawassul</em> with Your Prophet, and You used to give us rain, and now we make <em>Tawassul</em> to You with his uncle, so give us rain , and they were given rain.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This well known supplication was accepted by all the Companions, not one of them denied it.  This is one of the clearest examples of (<em>Ijma’Sakootee</em>) silent agreement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, if <em>Tawassul</em> with the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> after his death was like the <em>Tawassul</em> during his lifetime, they would have said, why are we making <em>Tawassul</em> with al-Abbas while we don’t make it with the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, who is the best and greatest of creation with Allaah? Since not one of them said this, then this shows us that they knew <em>Tawassul</em> was only during the lifetime of the Prophet , and after his passing away, <em>Tawassul</em> is with the <em>Dua’ </em>of the righteous living people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> did not order any one of his Companions. if they had a need or were afflicted with a problem, that they turn to him and they seek assistance from him after his death. In fact the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said to Ibn Abbas <em>&#8211; radi Allaahu anhu – </em>: ‘If you ask of anyone, then ask Allaah, and if you seek help, then seek help from Allaah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by at-Tirmidhee and he said the hadeeth is <em>hasan saheeh</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is other evidence which shows that <em>Isteegatha</em> with the dead from the Prophets and the righteous people is not allowed according to Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

Chapter 160<br />
Admonition beside the Grave</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>945.</b> `Ali (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: We were accompanying a funeral procession in Baqi<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">`</span> Al-Gharqad (graveyard in Al-Madinah) when the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) proceeded towards us and sat down. We sat around him. He had a small stick in his hand. He was bending down his head and scraping the ground with the stick. He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;There is none among you but has a place assigned for him either in the Jannah or in the Hell.&#8221;</span> The Companions said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, should we not depend upon what has been written for us (and give up doing good deeds)?&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Carry on doing good deeds. Every one will find it easy to do such deeds (as will lead him to his destined place) for which he has been created.&#8221;</span><br />

Weeping while Passing by the Graves of the Infidals</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>955.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: When the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and his Companions reached Al-Hijr, the dwellings of the Thamud people, he admonished his Companions (saying),<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Do not pass by these people who are being tormented, without weeping, lest the punishment should befall you as it had befallen them.&#8221;</span><br />

Chapter 66<br />
Desirability of visiting the Graves for men, and that they should say</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>581.</b> Buraidah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;(In the past) I forbade you from visiting graves, but visit them now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Whoever wants to visit a graveyard, let him do so, because it reminds us of the Hereafter.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>582.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her): reported Whenever it was her turn to spend with Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), he used to go to the Baqi<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">` (</span>graveyard in Al-Madinah) at the last part of night and say,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;May you be safe, O abode of the believing people. What you have been promised has come to you. You are tarried till tomorrow and certainly we shall follow you if Allah wills. O Allah, forgive the inmates of the Baqi`-al-Gharqad.&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>583.</b> Buraidah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to teach them (i.e., the Companions) whenever they came out to visit the graveyard to say:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;As-salamu `alaikum ahlad-diyyari minal-Mu&#8217;minina wal-Muslimina, wa inna in sha&#8217; Allahu bikum lahiqun. As&#8217;alul-laha lana wa-lakumul- `afiyyah  (May you be safe, O inmates of the abodes of the believers and the Muslims, and if Allah pleases, we shall follow you, we pray to Allah for well-being for ourselves and for you).&#8221;</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>584.</b> Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) passed by the graves at Al-Madinah. He turned his face towards them and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;May you be granted safety, O inmates of the graves. May Allah forgive us and you. You have preceded us, and we are to follow.&#8221;</span><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Warning against building Masjids over graves</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span id="ctl00_RedirectContronl1_lblTitle">Fatwas of Ibn Baz :</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">I was asked: Is it permissible to build a Masjid over the site of the People of the Cave? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allah, all praise be to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have read the article published in the third edition of the Islamic Sciences League magazine in the &#8220;Muslim News in a Month&#8221; section.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><span style="color:#808000;">The Islamic Sciences League, in<span id="ContentParagraph"> The Hashemite Kingdom of <strong>Jordan</strong>, </span>intends to build a Masjid over the site of the cave recently discovered in<span id="ContentParagraph"> the village of Al-Rahib, </span>which is said to be the cave where <span id="ContentParagraph">the People of the Cave </span>mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an slept</span>.</span> End Quote.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As it is my duty to advise for the sake of Allah and His servants, I thought it would be beneficial to say a word in the same magazine of the Islamic Sciences League published in<span id="ContentParagraph"> the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. </span>I must <strong>admonish</strong> the league to give up the intention of building a Masjid over the site of this cave, mainly and solely for the reason that <strong><span style="color:#000000;">building Masjids over the graves and remains of the Prophets and righteous people is utterly forbidden by the Shari`ah (Islamic law) and that those who do so are cursed</span></strong>. This is because such an act <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>may lead to Shirk</strong></span> (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and <strong><span style="color:#000000;">excessive veneration and over praising of the prophets and pious people</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reality bears witness to the validity of the texts of the Shari`ah and proves that it is revealed from Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He), and provides decisive proof of the truthfulness of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and the message sent down to him which he conveyed to the Ummah (nation). <span style="color:#ff6600;">Whoever is aware of the conditions that exist in the Islamic world and the acts of Shirk, excessive reverence of prophets and the pious that prevail due to establishing Masjids over shrines and glorifying them by means of lavish structures and the presence of custodians to collect money from people unlawfully, will certainly know that they are avenues leading to Shirk</span>. One of the outstanding virtues of Shari`ah is to forbid building of Masjids over graves and to warn sternly against it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Two Shaykhs,<span id="ContentParagraph"> Al-Bukhari </span>and<span id="ContentParagraph"> Muslim </span>(may Allah be merciful to them), narrated some Hadiths to this effect on the authority of<span id="ContentParagraph"> `Aishah </span>(may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a name="MayAllahcursetheJewsandthe"></a><span style="color:#339966;"><span id="ContentParagraph">May Allah curse the Jews and the Christians; they have taken the graves of their prophets as places of worship</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph">`Aishah </span>(may Allah be pleased with her) said: <span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;</span><span style="color:#339966;">He warned against what they did and had it not been for this, his grave would have been raised above the ground but he feared that it would be taken as a Masjid</span><span style="color:#000000;">.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim that <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a name="UmSalamahandUmHabibah(may"></a><span id="ContentParagraph"> </span><span id="ContentParagraph" style="color:#339966;">Um Salamah and Um Habibah (may Allah be pleased with them) mentioned a church they had seen in Abyssinia (Ethiopia) in which there were pictures. When they told the Prophet (peace be upon him) of this, he said, &#8216;When a pious person among these people died they built a place of worship over his grave and painted these pictures therein. They will be the worst of creation in the Sight of Allah</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is related in Sahih<span id="ContentParagraph"> Muslim </span>on the authority of<span id="ContentParagraph"> Jundub ibn `Abdullah </span>(may Allah be pleased with him) that he heard the Prophet (peace be upon him) five days before his death, stating: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a name="IstandfreeofblamebeforeAllah"></a><span style="color:#339966;"><span id="ContentParagraph"></span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Hadiths in this regard. Imams of Muslim scholars from the four Madh-habs (Schools of Jurisprudence) and others have stated the prohibition of building Masjids over graves. They issued the sternest warning against doing so, urging Muslims to observe the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and advising this Ummah lest it should fall into the same excessiveness and veneration of the prophets and pious people the way its predecessors from the extremist<span id="ContentParagraph"> Jews </span>and<span id="ContentParagraph"> Christians </span>and their like who deviated from the straight path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, it is incumbent upon the Islamic Sciences League in<span id="ContentParagraph"> Jordan </span>and Muslims to adhere to the Sunnah and the way of the righteous Imams, and to be cautious not to commit what Allah and His Messenger warned against. It is the only way that leads to people&#8217;s uprightness and happiness in this world and in the Hereafter. <span style="color:#ff6600;">It should be noted that some people formed their opinions based on the misinterpretation of Allah&#8217;s Statement in the story<span id="ContentParagraph"> of the People of the Cave: </span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Kahf, 18: 21" target="_blank" name="AndthusWemadetheircaseknown"></a>(then) those who won their point said (most probably the disbelievers): “We verily shall build a place of worship over them.”<img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer to this is that Allah (Praised and Exalted be He) informed us about the rulers and prominent people who announced this statement. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He told their story not by of expressing content and agreement with what they said, but rather as a kind of dispraise and expressing abhorrence of their action</strong></span>. This is even indicated by the Messenger (peace be upon him) to whom this Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse) was revealed and was the most knowledgeable of its interpretation, for he forbade his Ummah from building Masjids over the graves and cursed and dispraised those who do so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this had been permissible, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) would not have strongly affirmed its prohibition to the extent of cursing those who did it, or describing them as the worst creatures in the Sight of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He). This should be sufficient in pointing out the gravity implied in the matter and providing a convincing answer to those who seek the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Even if we supposed that building Masjids over graves was permissible for those who preceded us, still we are not permitted to follow their example because the Shari`ah (Islamic law) abrogates all previous laws, and our Prophet (peace be upon him) is the Last of the Messengers and the Shari`ah revealed to him is comprehensive</strong>. He (peace be upon him) forbade building Masjids over graves, and as such, we are not permitted to disobey him. We must follow his example and adhere to his Sunnah and abandon what contradicts it regarding the previous Shari`ahs (Divine laws) and favorable customs followed by some people, because Allah&#8217;s Shari`ah is perfect and comprehensive and no guidance is better than that of the Prophet (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah is the One Whom we invoke to grant all Muslims and us success and to keep us firm on the truth and help us adhere to the Sunnah of His Messenger, Muhammad (peace be upon him) in words and deeds, whether manifested or hidden, and in all our daily affairs until we meet Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He). Allah is the All-Hearer, Ever-Near and Responsive. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions and those who follow his guidance until the Day of Resurrection.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Answered by Shaykh Ubayd al Jabiree in Telelink for Sri Lanka:</p>
<div class="qa-faq-answer" style="color:#888888;">
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The original question was if the masjid has a qabr or a grave is it permissible to pray in it. So Shaykh Ubayd (hafidhahullah) he went on after praising Allaah and saying peace and blessings on the Messenger and his family and companions, he went on to say in regards to this question that there are basically two situations.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The first of them is that, if the grave came before the masjid, and the masjid was built because of the grave being there and was built so that the people would worship the person who was in that grave, worshipping besides Allaah.  And the Shaykh goes on to mention that there is a severe threat in regards to this affair. And he went on to mention some of the nusoos, some of the texts in regards to that, like the saying of the Messenger (sallalhualahi wa sallam) that the anger of Allaah is upon the people who take the graves of the Prophets as masaajids.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">And in another narration, that the Prophet (sallalhualahi wa sallam) asked for curse of Allaah to be upon the Jews and Christians, because they took the graves of their Prophets as Masaajids.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">So the Shaykh went on to say that there are many hadith on this issue. So he  said in regards to this, that it is not allowed to pray in it, because this masjid was built, because of the grave, because it was built, to worship other than Allaah. So the Shaykh said in this situation, then it is not allowed to pray in the masjid.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="open-sans"><!-- [themify_gfont id="Open Sans"] -->Then the Shaykh mentioned a second situation and that is, if the masjid is built and the grave is built inside the masjid intentionally.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="open-sans"><!-- [themify_gfont id="Open Sans"] -->So the Shaykh went on to mention that there are two things that can be done in this case.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="open-sans"><!-- [themify_gfont id="Open Sans"] -->Then one of them, that a wall or separation is built to separate the grave from the masjid; or the second situation that the grave is taken out of the masjid and the person who was in the grave and buried along with the other Muslims.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;"><span class="open-sans"><!-- [themify_gfont id="Open Sans"] -->So then the Shaykh was asked, what is the case if the grave remains inside and not separate from the masjid, then the Shaykh said then it is not allowed to pray in it. It is not allowed to pray in this masjid.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam <strong>Ibnul-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah</strong> (d.751H)<br />
Source : Kitaabur-Rooh<em> (p. 44)</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The soul (<i>ar-rooh</i>) is connected to the body in five different ways, to which different rules apply.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Its connection to the body as a fetus in his mother’s womb.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Its connection to the body after a person is born.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Its connection to the body when a person is asleep, when the soul is connected in one way and separated from it in another way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Its connection to the body in <i>al-Barzakh</i> (the period between a person’s death and the Day of Resurrection), when it has departed from the body and separated from it, but is not separated completely in such a way that there is no connection at all. We have mentioned at the beginning of this reply that there are <i>ahaadeeth </i>and reports which indicate that the soul is returned to the body when somebody sends the greeting of salaam to a deceased person. This returning is of a special nature which does not mean that the life is restored to the body before the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Its connection to the body on the Day when bodies will be resurrected. This is the most perfect type of connection to the body, and has no comparison to the previous types, because after that the body will never die, sleep or have anything wrong with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a person is asleep, his soul is in his body and he is alive, although his being alive is not the same as that of a person who is awake, for sleep is comparable to death. Similarly, when a dead person’s soul is returned to his body (when the greeting is sent upon him), he is in a state between one who is alive and one who is dead, whose soul is not restored to his body. This is like the case of a sleeping person who is in a state between life and death. We hope that this will dispel a lot of your confusion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: <strong>Al-Ibaanah Magazine</strong>, Issue No.2 &#8211; Rabi ul-Awwal 1416H / August 1995</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>PAST HISTORY:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From those early sects which denied <i>eemaan</i> (firm faith) in the Punishment of the Grave were the <i>Khawaarij</i> and a group from the <i>Mu’tazilah</i>. [1] The <i>Mu’tazilah</i> said, “Our scholars deny the Punishment of the Grave and its rewards.” [2] This is because they innovated a rule that only <i>mutawaatir</i> [3] <i>ahaadeeth</i> amount to knowledge, whereas the authentic <i>aahaad</i> [4] <i>ahaadeeth</i> do not.  And this statement of theirs, that the <i>aahaad ahaadeeth</i> do not amount to knowledge means that such <i>ahaadeeth</i> – in their false opinion – are not free from the possibility of falsehood, nor error.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this innovated principle, they denied those <i>ahaadeeth</i> affirming that the Punishment of the Grave in indeed a true fact, and that it will definitely occur for the disbelievers and some of the sinful ones from this <i>Ummah</i> – may Allaah protect us from it – since these <i>ahaadeeth</i> were to them of the <i>aahaad</i> category.  So this false principle caused them to deny <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave – not holding it as part of the <i>’aqeedah</i> (belief) which is in total opposition to that of the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> (Righteous Predecessors) and the <i>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah</i> who followed them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>PRESENT-DAY TRAGEDY:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the last few years, some of the innocent <i>du’aat</i> (callers to Islaam) have stumbled across the same innovated principle – that the authentic <i>aahaad hadeeth</i> does not amount to knowledge, and therefore cannot be taken as proof for matters of <i>’aqeedah</i> – causing a great number of them to doubt and to reject that the Punishment of the Grave is indeed a true fact; and that it was part of the <i>’aqeedah</i> held fast to by our <i>Salaf</i>.  The result is that discord – and it’s vile fruit – has raised it’s head again amongst some of the precious youth of this <i>Ummah</i>, encircling them just as a ring encircles the finger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Abul-Madhaffar as-Sam’aanee [5] – <i>rahimahullaah</i> – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“If a narration is authentically reported from the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) – and related by reliable narrators and scholars – and they report it in connected form – their latter people from their predecessors – back to the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>), and it is accepted by the scholars, then it necessitates knowledge, where it leads to knowledge.  This is the statement of the great majority of the People of <i>Hadeeth</i>, and those who are precise, and those who work to preserve the <i>Sunnah</i>.  But this saying of theirs, that the <i>aahaad</i> narration does not amount to knowledge, and that it must be narrated in <i>mutawaatir</i> form in order to result in knowledge, then this is something innovated by the <i>Qadariyyah</i> and the <i>Mu’tazilah</i>.  Their intention behind it was to reject the narrations.  It (the principle) was seized from them, without understanding, by some scholars of <i>Fiqh</i>, those who did not have a firm footing in knowledge, nor realize what the intent of this saying was.”[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE DESIRED HOPE:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this article will attempt to clarify – by the permission of Allaah – that having <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave is an obligation upon all Muslims, and that it was indeed part of the <i>’aqeedah</i> of our <i>Salafus-Saalih</i>, previously being denied only by a group of innovators.  It is hoped that those who have erred from the way of the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> – the way of <i>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah</i> – would re-assess their stance in light of the evidences presented, hoping that they will return to the truth.  “For indeed the truth is cherished by the Believer, and in returning to it is nobility.  Whereas remaining upon falsehood and defect is despicable.” [7]  Remembering that, “the select and correct way is that which the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> were upon – that being the truth.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>EVIDENCES FROM THE PURE SUNNAH:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We shall – for the sake of brevity – consider the evidences from the pure <i>Sunnah</i>, and then look at the sayings of our <i>Salafus-Saalih</i>, and the scholars of <i>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah </i>who followed them – omitting the evidences from the <i>Qur‘aan</i> and it’s explanation from the Companions and the <i>Taabi’een</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[i] From ’Aa‘ishah (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhaa</i>) who said that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Jewess came to her and mentioned the Punishment of the Grave, saying to her: May Allaah protect you from the Punishment of the Grave.  So she asked the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) about it and he said, “Yes, there is Punishment in the Grave!”  ’Aa‘ishah (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhaa</i>) said: After that, I never saw the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>), except that he sought refuge from the Punishment of the Grave in every Prayer that he prayed. [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ii] From Ibn ’Abbaas (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhumaa</i>) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) once passed by two graves and said, “They are being punished, not for something great.”  Then he said, “Rather one of them used to spread gossip and carry tales, whilst the other never protected himself from being soiled by his own urine.”  Ibn ’Abbaas said: He then took a green leaf and spread it into two pieces and places each piece upon each grave, and then he said, “May their punishment become lightened until these two pieces dry.” [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[iii] From Ibn Mas’ood (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhu</i>) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, “Indeed the dead are punished in their graves, and the animals hear them.” [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[iv] Haanee, the freed slave of ’Uthmaan, related:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever ’Uthmaan (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhu</i>) stood at a grave he would weep until his beard became soaked in tears.  It was said to him: Paradise and Hell are mentioned to you, and you do not weep, but you weep over this.  So he said: Indeed the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, “Indeed the grave is the first stopping place for the Hereafter.  So if he is saved therein, then what comes after that is easier than that.  If he is not saved therefrom, then that which comes after is harder.” [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[v] From Aboo Hurayrah (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhu</i>) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, “When one of you finishes the last <i>tashahhud</i> (testimony of faith), he should seek refuge in Allaah from four things: From the Punishment of Hell, from the Punishment of the Grave, from the trials of life and death, and from the evil trials of the <i>Maseehud-Dajjaal</i> (Anti-Christ).” [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[vi] From Umm Khaalid Bint Khaalid (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhaa</i>) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, “Seek the Refuge of Allaah from the Punishment of the Grave, since the Punishment of the Grave is <i>haqq</i> (a true fact).” [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE STATEMENTS OF THE SALAF OF THIS UMMAH:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now consider – O honourable reader – the statements of the <i>Salaf</i> of this <i>Ummah</i> with respect to having <i>’aqeedah </i>(firm belief) in the Punishment of the Grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<b>1</b>] Sufyaan Ibn ’Uyaynah (d.197H) – <i>rahimahullaah</i> – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The <i>Sunnah</i> is ten.  Whosoever accepts them has completed the <i>Sunnah</i>, and whosoever abandons anything from them has abandoned the <i>Sunnah</i>: Affirming <i>al-Qadar</i> (pre-destination), giving precedence to Aboo Bakr and ’Umar, the Pond in Paradise, <i>Shafaa’ah</i> (Intercession), the Scales, the Bridge over Hellfire, <i>eemaan</i> is statement and action, the <i>Qur‘aan</i> is the speech of Allaah, Punishment in the Grave, being raised-up on the Day of Judgement and not testifying that any Muslim will definitely be in Paradise or Hell.” [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<b>2</b>] Imaam ash-Shaafi’ee (d.204H) – <i>rahimahullaah</i> – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Indeed <i>al-Qadar</i> (pre-destination); both good and evil consequences are from Allaah – the Mighty and Majestic.  Indeed the Punishment of the Grave is a true fact, the Resurrection is a true fact, the Accountability is a true fact, Paradise and Hellfire are true facts.  Whatever else is related in the <i>Sunnah</i> and so mentioned by the scholars, and their followers throughout the lands of the Muslims is also true.” [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<b>3</b>] Imaam Ahmad (d.241H) – <i>rahimahullaah – </i>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“From the essential <i>Sunnah</i>, which if a person leaves any one of its points – not accepting it and not having <i>eemaan</i> in it – then he will not be from amongst its people are: (he then mentions) <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave.” [17] He also said, “Punishment in the Grave is a true fact.  The servant will be questioned about his Religion and his Lord.  Munkar and Nakeer and Paradise and Hellfire are also true facts.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<b>4</b>] Aboo Daawood (d.275H) – <i>rahimahullaah</i> – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Chapter: Questioning in the Grave and the Punishment of the Grave.’’ [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<b>5</b>] Ibn Qutaybah (d.278H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘The People of <i>Hadeeth</i> are united upon the fact that whatever Allaah wills, happens, and whatever He does not will, does not happen; that He is the Creator of good and evil; and that the <i>Qur‘aan</i> is the Speech of Allaah, uncreated; that Allaah will be seen on the Day of Judgement, giving precedence to Aboo Bakr and ’Umar, upon <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave.  They do not differ in need of these fundamentals.  Whosoever opposes them in any of these matters, then they reject, hate, and declare such a one an innovator, and cut themselves off from him.’’ [20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<b>6</b>] Imaam at-Tahaawee (d.321H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘This is an explanation of the <i>’aqeedah</i> of <i>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah</i> upon the way of the scholars of this Religion; Aboo Haneefah an-Nu’maan Ibn Thaabit al-Koofee, Aboo Yoosuf Ya’qoob Ibn Ibraaheem al-Ansaaree, and Aboo ’Abdullaah Muhammad Ibnul-Hasan ash-Shaybaanee &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with them all &#8211; and the beliefs they held concerning the fundamentals of the Religion, and their <i>’aqeedah</i> concerning the Lord of the Worlds.’’  Up until he said, ‘‘We have <i>eemaan</i> in the Angel of Death who is charged with taking the souls of all the worlds; and in the Punishment of the Grave for those who deserve it.’’ [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<b>7</b>] Abul-Hasan al-Ash’aree (d.324H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘The <i>Mu’tazilah</i> denied the Punishment of the Grave.  It has been related by the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) through many paths, and by his Companions (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhum</i>).  Nothing has been related from a single one of them denying or negating this, to the point where there is <i>ijmaa’</i> (consensus) from the Companions of the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>).’’ [22] He also said, ‘‘There is consensus that the Punishment of the Grave is a true fact, and that the people will be tested and questioned in their graves.  So may Allaah establish us upon that which He loves.’’ [23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<b>8</b>] Imaam al-Aajurree (d.360H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘Chapter: <i>Tasdeeq</i> (affirmation) and <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave.’’ Here he brings many of the <i>ahaadeeth</i> related by al-Bukhaaree and Muslims and ends the chapter by saying, ‘‘So what is the condition of those who deny these <i>ahaadeeth</i>, except that they have deviated very far and are in a huge loss.’’ [24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<b>9</b>] Ibn Abee Haatim (d.327H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘Our chosen way is to follow the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>), the Companions, the <i>taabi’een</i>, and all those who followed them in goodness; along with the abandonment of looking into the innovated matters, to hold fast to the way of <i>Ahlul-Athar</i> (People of Narrations), such as Aboo ’Abdullaah Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, Ishaaq Ibn Ibraaheem, Aboo ’Ubayd al-Qaasim Ibn Sallaam and ash-Shaafi’ee; to hold fast to the Book and the <i>Sunnah</i> upon the way of the <i>Imaams</i> who follow the narrations of the <i>Salaf</i>; adopting what was adopted by the <i>Ahlus-Sunnah</i> from the various cities.’’ Up until his statement, ‘‘Faith increases and decreases, and we have <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave.’’ [25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<b>10</b>] Imaam al-Barbahaaree (d.329H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[<b>13</b>] Ibn Abee Zamneen (d.399H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[<b>15</b>] Imaam al-Bayhaqee (d.458H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘Chapter: <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave.’’ [31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE MEANING OF EEMAAN:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajar (d.852H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘<i>Eemaan</i> in the language means: <i>tasdeeq</i>: (attesting to the truth).  In the <i>Sharee’ah</i>, it means: <i>tasdeeq</i> of what the Messenger (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) brought from his Lord &#8211; and this much is agreed upon.  Then there is difference.  Is anything else a condition on top of that, such as stating this <i>eemaan</i> upon the tongue, as well as it being in the heart, or action upon what is attested to by what is ordered and leaving what is forbidden.’’  Up until where al-Haafidh said, ‘‘So the <i>Salaf</i> say, <i>eemaan </i>is <i>’aqeedah</i> in the heart, statement of the tongue, and action of the limbs.  They mean by this, that actions are a condition for its completeness.  So from this comes their saying that it increases and decreases, as will follow.  The <i>Murji’ah</i> say, it is <i>’aqeedah</i> and a statement upon the tongue only.  The <i>Karraamiyyah</i> say, it is the statement of the tongue only.  And the <i>Mu’tazilah</i> say, it is action, statement and <i>’aqeedah</i>.  But the difference between the <i>Mu’tazilah</i> and the <i>Salaf</i> is that the <i>Mu’tazilah</i> make actions a condition for the correctness of <i>eemaan</i>, whereas the <i>Salaf</i> make it a condition for its completeness.  As for the second point, then the <i>Salaf</i> hold that it increases and decreases, whereas most of the people of <i>kalaam</i> (theological rhetoric) reject this by saying that if it is liable to decrease, then it is doubt.’’ [32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, the <i>Salaf</i> agreed that <i>eemaan</i> is <i>’aqeedah</i>, statement, and action.  So, whosoever denies <i>’aqeedah</i> in the Punishment of the Grave, has likewise denied <i>eemaan</i> in it.  Since <i>’aqeedah</i> in the heart is the foundation of <i>eemaan</i> &#8211; about which there is agreement from the scholars of <i>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Baghawee (d.535H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘The Companions and the <i>Taabi’een</i>, and those who came after them from the scholars of the <i>Sunnah</i> are agreed that actions are a part of <i>eemaan</i>…and they say: Indeed <i>eemaan</i> is a statement, action and <i>’aqeedah</i>.  It increases with obedience, and decreases with disobedience.’’ [33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having understood this, the falsehood of those who claim to have <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave, whilst denying <i>’aqeedah</i> in it, will become very clear.  Since our <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> held that the root of <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave is to have <i>’aqeedah</i> in it &#8211; so if there is no <i>’aqeedah</i> in the Punishment of the Grave, then there is &#8211; by default &#8211; no <i>eemaan</i> in it as well!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE GRAVE MISTAKE:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is thus clear, that the <i>Salaf</i> and those who followed them were agreed that the Punishment in the Grave will definitely occur (for the disbelievers and some of the sinful ones from amongst the Muslims) and that it is obligatory to have <i>eemaan</i> in it, and to consider it as part of the Islaamic <i>’aqeedah</i> &#8211; and no one whose saying is taken account of opposes them in that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the founder of the modernist party <i>Hizbut-Tahreer</i>, like the <i>Mu’tazilah</i> before, also denied <i>’aqeedah</i> in the Punishment of the Grave, explaining his position by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘Indeed from them (the <i>aahaad ahaadeeth</i>) are those which require an action, so it is acted upon.  So from Aboo Hurayrah who said: The Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: ‘‘When any of you finishes the last <i>tashahhud</i>, he should seek refuge in Allaah from four things: from the Punishment of the Hellfire, from the Punishment of the Grave, from the trials of life and death, and from the evil trials of the <i>Dajjaal</i>.’’  And from ’Aa‘ishah: from the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>), that he used to make supplication in the Prayer saying: ‘‘O Allaah!  I seek refuge in You from the Punishment of the Grave, I seek refuge in You from the trials of the <i>Maseehud-Dajjaal</i>, I seek refuge in You from the trials of life and death.  O Allaah!  I seek refuge in You from debt and sin.’’  So these two <i>ahaadeeth</i> are <i>aahaad</i> narrations, and they contain the requirement of an action, i.e. to carry out this supplication after finishing the <i>tashahhud</i>.  So it is recommended to make this supplication after finishing the <i>tashahhud</i>, and it is permissible to make <i>tasdeeq</i> (attest) of what is contained in them.  However, what is <i>haraam</i> (prohibited) is to hold it with certainty &#8211; meaning: to have it as part of ones <i>’aqeedah</i> &#8211; as long as it has only been reported in the <i>aahaad</i> <i>hadeeth</i>, a <i>dhannee</i> (non-<i>mutawaatir</i>) proof.  However, if it occurs in <i>mutawaatir</i> form, then it is obligatory to make it part of ones <i>’aqeedah</i>.’’ [34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This saying contains a number of short-comings:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[i] Differentiating between the <i>aahaad</i> and <i>mutawaatir</i> <i>ahaadeeth</i> in matters of <i>’aqeedah</i> is an innovation of the <i>Qadariyyah</i> and the <i>Mu’tazilah</i> &#8211; as has already been explained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ii] Making <i>tasdeeq</i> of the Punishment of the Grave, whilst prohibiting a person to have <i>’aqeedah</i> (belief) in it, is a contradiction in terms.  Since &#8211; as has preceeded from the words of al-Haafidh Ibn Hajar &#8211; <i>tasdeeq</i> is attesting to the truth of something in the heart, which is the same as <i>’aqeedah</i> and which thereby necessitates <i>eemaan</i>.  However, differentiating between <i>tasdeeq</i> and <i>’aqeedah</i> is innovated speech, opposing the way of our <i>Salaf</i>.  Unfortunately, the likes of this innovation has clearly been stated by the present leader of <i>Hizbut-Tahrir</i> in Britain, when he said: ‘‘We trust it; and I encourage all of you <i>’an tasaddiqoo bi ’adhaabil qabr</i> (to have <i>tasdeeq</i> in the Punishment of the Grave).  I encourage all of you <i>’an tasaddiqoo bi ’awdatil-Mahdee</i> (to have <i>tasdeeq</i> in the return of the <i>Mahdee</i>).  I encourage you for that, but whoever believes in that, then he is sinful.’’ [35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[iii] How is it possible to affirm the Punishment of the Grave upon the tongue, whilst prohibiting <i>’aqeedah</i> (belief) of it in the heart &#8211; is this not but <i>nifaaq</i> (hypocrisy)?!  Rather, <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave necessitates &#8211; as a foundation &#8211; <i>’aqeedah</i> in the heart!!  May Allaah have mercy upon Imaam Ahmad, who said: ‘‘You should beware of speaking about an issue in which you are not preceded by a scholar.’’ [36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[iv] Along with all this, it must be remembered that: ‘‘It is not permissible to invent an interpretation about an <i>aayah</i>, or about a <i>Sunnah</i>, which was not there in the time of the <i>Salaf</i>; nor did they have any knowledge about it; nor explain it to the <i>Ummah</i>.  Since this would imply that the <i>Salaf</i> were ignorant of the truth in this matter and failed to reach it, whereas the late-coming opponent is somehow guided to the truth!’’ [37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Awzaa’ee (d.157H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘Hold fast to the narrations of the <i>Salaf</i>, even if the people were to abandon you.  Beware of the opinions of the people, no matter how much they beautify it with their speech.’’ [38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Haneefah (d.150H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘Stick to the <i>athar</i> (narration) and the way of the <i>Salaf</i> and beware of newly invented matters, for all of it is innovation.’’ [39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So denying <i>’aqeedah</i> in the Punishment of the Grave, declaring this to be something sinful and prohibited, declaring also that it is not a matter which will definitely occur, but it is a matter which may possibly occur &#8211; is speech in opposition to that of the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> &#8211; the like of which was previously uttered by only the <i>Khawaarij</i>, and a group from amongst the <i>Mu’tazilah</i>; and there is no doubt in its being a deviation from the Straight Path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, outwardly affirming <i>tasdeeq</i> and apparently affirming <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave, whilst denying <i>’aqeedah</i> in it, is only a contradiction in terms &#8211; since <i>tasdeeq</i>, <i>eemaan</i>, and <i>’aqeedah</i> in the opinion of the <i>Salaf</i>, all imply certainty and being definite &#8211; even if the modernists dislike this!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad (d.241H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘The Punishment of the Grave is a true fact; and no one denies it except one who is misguided and misguiding others.’’ [40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Naasiree (d.652H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said in <i>an-Noorul-Laami’</i> (no. 110):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘We have <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave and its bliss…this is the <i>madhhab</i> of <i>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah</i>.  So it is obligatory to have <i>’aqeedah</i> in this.’’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam an-Nawawee (d.676H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said in <i>Sharh Saheeh Muslim</i> (5/85):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘This chapter shows the virtue of seeking refuge &#8211; between the <i>tashahhud</i> and <i>tasleem</i> &#8211; from these (four) matters; and in it is an affirmation of the Punishment of the Grave, and it is the position of the people of the truth &#8211; as opposed to the <i>Mu’tazilah</i>.’’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Qurtubee (d.671H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘To have <i>eemaan</i> in the Punishment of the Grave and its trials is obligatory, due to what the most truthful (Muhammad &#8211; <i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) has mentioned.  This is the belief of <i>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah</i>.’’ [41]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>NEED FOR VERIFICATION:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘So examine &#8211; may Allaah have mercy upon you &#8211; the speech of everyone you hear from, particularly in your time.  Do not act in haste, nor enter into anything from it until you ask and see: Did any of the Companions of the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) speak about it, or any of the Scholars.  So if you find a narration from them about it, then cling to it.  Do not go beyond it for anything, and do not give precedence to anything over it, and thus fall into the Fire.’’ [42]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Seereen (d.110) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘This knowledge is the Religion, so be careful from whom you take your Religion.’’ [43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qaadee Shareek (d.177H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">’Ibaad Ibnul-’Awwaam said: Shareek Ibn ’Abdullaah came to us more than fifty years ago, so we said to him: O Abaa ’Abdullaah!  There are a group of the <i>Mu’tazilah</i> who deny the <i>ahaadeeth</i> about Allaah descending to the lowest heaven and that the people shall see their Lord.  So Shareek quoted about ten <i>ahaadeeth</i> like that, and then said: ‘‘As for us, then we have taken our Religion from the sons of the <i>Taabi’een</i>, from the Companions.  From whom did they take theirs?’’ [44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there is in what has preceded &#8211; if Allaah wills &#8211; a clear explanation for those whose hearts have been enlightened by Allaah with the light of Revelation, and whose has hearts have found peace and delight in the narrations of the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i>.  Indeed it is this which brings about a firmness of understanding and is a remedy against the darkness of <i>hizbiyyah</i> (party-spirit).  This, in turn, produces the purity and quality, even if numbers are small.  Indeed mere numbers in opposition to the <i>manhaj</i> (methodology) of the <i>Salaf</i> &#8211; the <i>manhaj</i> of <i>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah</i> &#8211; leads to nothing but deception, destruction and extreme disappointment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Seeking Blessings from Graves</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">Is it permissible to stand or sit by a grave for supplication in favour of the deceased?</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The purpose of the legitimate visitation to graves is <strong>to get a lesson</strong>, <strong>remember death and heed</strong>, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not for seeking blessings from the buried</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When one enters a cemetery he should greet the dead saying: <em>As-Salaamu Alaikum, O people of this place, believers and Muslims, and we will &#8211; if Allah wills &#8211; follow you. We ask Allah safety for ourselves and yourselves</em>.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One may also recite other supplication in favour of the dead that are recommended by the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> But he should not ask the dead people to fulfil his needs, seek relief or benefit from them.</strong> Supplication alone is an act of worship which must be dedicated to Allah alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">There is not harm however, in standing or sitting by the grave while supplicating, but not for seeking blessings or taking rest.</span> Graveyards are not resting places or residential area for people to sit in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is legitimate to stand by the grave areas right after burial to supplicate in favour of the buried asking Allah to confirm him and forgive him. It is authentically reported that <span style="color:#008000;">whenever the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) buried a dead, he would stand by his grave and say: Ask Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for your brother, and ask him to make him give firm answers, for right now he is being questioned.</span>[2]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwas &gt; Sha`ban Fatwas &gt; Visits made during Sha‘ban to the grave of Prophet Hud</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Source : alifta.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">Q: A brother from Hadramawt asks: During the month of Sha‘ban, people come to out town Hadramawt to visit the grave of Prophet Hud (Peace be upon him), whose grave is thought to be located in Al-Ahqaf, near Hadramawt. The journey there takes five hours by car. With this false belief, from our viewpoint, a great number of people, i.e. thousands of people, drive to this place, where they ascend a mountain to a room at the top of it that contains two or three graves. They lean against these graves, touch them, weep over them, call upon them and seek their blessings. When they have finished doing this they descend. They do this for about four days. They liken this practice to Sa‘y (going between Safa and Marwah during Hajj). They appointed certain places incarnating the body of Prophet Hud (peace be upon him): There is a pebble they call the nose of Prophet Hud; there is another smooth one that has the trace of his foot, which is called Al-Dahqah and its length is about three cubits; and a third one is claimed to be his feet wherein women hoping for husbands put some pebbles in the hope that they will find what they aspire to and similarly this is practiced by wives hoping to have babies. They claim that it is advised that one should pay this visit and that the predecessors among the Awliya’ (pious people) established this visit and called people to make it, like for example, the Faqih (Jurisprudent) immigrating to Allah, Ahmad ibn ‘Isa, and so on. They continue in this way describing this practice. O Shaykh ‘Abdul-‘Aziz finally, we seek your instruction and advice. What should they do?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: First: The location of the grave of Allah’s Prophet, Hud (Peace be upon him), is not known. Their claim that this grave belongs to Prophet Hud in Al-Ahqaf is baseless. The only known graves among those attributed to the Prophets are that of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and that of Ibrahim Al-Khalil (Abraham, peace be upon him) in the well-known cave in Al-Khalil, the Levant, Palestine. The graves of Prophets Hud, Salih, Nuh, and the other prophets are not known. Likewise, the claim that the grave of Prophet Hud lies in Al-Ahqaf and that it is in the room mentioned by the inquirer, is all baseless and false. No graves are known among the graves of the Prophets other than that of our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and that of Al-Khalil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What these people are doing is Munkar (unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect) and is not permissible. Rather, it is one of the forbidden acts tantamount to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). Supplicating to Allah’s Prophet Hud and Tabarruk (seeking blessings) through the pebbles claimed to belong to his grave and his body are acts tantamount to major Shirk. Seeking blessings through this; seeking husbands or offspring are all Munkar and among the forbidden acts that are tantamount to Shirk. Children are to be sought only from Allah, Who (may He be Glorified and Exalted) gives progeny. The same applies to hoping for a husband as this is to be sought from Allah, not from stones attributed to Hud or a grave attributed to Hud. One’s needs cannot be demanded from Hud himself (peace be upon him). One cannot say: “O Hud, grant us children or bless them for us.” This is to be directed to Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted) Alone. All that is practiced by the ignorant people in this regard is Munkar that must be condemned. Muslims of sound intellect have to forbid them from this and scholars have to warn them against this. They should not be misled by the practice of ignorant people or acts introduced by some Sufis or some idolaters in this regard; all this is wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Ibadah (worship) is an exclusive Right of Allah (may He be Exalted):Surah Al-Fatihah, 1: 5 You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything). It is Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted) Who confers blessings that cannot be sought from neither stones, nor graves, nor trees, nor from Allah’s Prophet, Hud, nor from anyone else. When the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) saw a tree (called Dhat Anwat) that was loved by the Kafirs (disbelievers) who would hang their weapons on it hoping for its blessing, they asked the Prophet (peace be upon him), saying: “O Messenger of Allah! Make for us a Dhat Anwat as they have a Dhat Anwat.” He (peace be upon him) said, “Allahu Akbar (Allah is the Greatest)! Verily these are the ways of earlier nations. By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, you have said exactly as the Children of Israel had said to Musa (Moses): Make for us an ilah (a god) as they have alihah (gods).” The Prophet (peace be upon him) likened their saying: &#8220;Make for us a Dhat Anwat…&#8221; to the saying of the Children of Israel: &#8220;Make for us an ilah (a god)&#8230;&#8221; It is well-known that associating another god with Allah is major Kufr (disbelief). Accordingly, it is not permissible to associate any other god with Allah, neither from idols, nor from trees, nor from angels, nor from the Messengers, nor from any human beings or Jinn. Rather, ‘Ibadah is due only to Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted). The Right of Allah over His Slaves is that they should worship Him and not associate anything with Him. It is Allah (may He be Glorified) Who says:Surah Al-Baiyyinah, 98: 5 And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allâh, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him) And:Surah Al-Isra&#8217;, 17: 23 And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And:<br />
Surah Ghafir, 40: 14 So, call you (O Muhammad peace be upon him and the believers) upon (or invoke) Allâh making (your) worship pure for Him (Alone) (by worshipping none but Him and by doing religious deeds sincerely for Allâh’s sake only and not to show off and not to set up rivals with Him in worship), however much the disbelievers (in the Oneness of Allâh) may hate (it). And:Surah Al-Zumar, 39: 2 So worship Allâh (Alone) by doing religious deeds sincerely for Allâh’s sake only. The Prophet (peace be upon him) after asking Mu‘adh about the Right of Allah over His Slaves to which Mu‘adh answered, &#8220;Allah and His Messenger know best&#8221;, taught him saying, The Right of Allah over His Slaves is that they should worship Him and not associate anything with Him. Thus, the Right of Allah over His Slaves is that they should worship Him Alone in their making Du‘a’ (supplication), asking help, Salah (Prayer), Sawm (Fasting), sacrificing animals, vowing and seeking blessings. All this must be dedicated to Allah Alone (may He be Glorified and Exalted):Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 163 And your Ilâh (God) is One Ilâh (God &#8211; Allâh), Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (there is none who has the right to be worshipped but He), the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: If you ask, ask Allah; and if you seek help, seek help from Allah. The same ruling applies to what is practiced by some ignorant people by the grave of the Prophet (peace be upon him) regarding supplicating to him or seeking his help or support. All these are forbidden acts that are tantamount to Shirk. The same applies to what is practiced by some people by the grave of Al-Badawy, Al-Husayn ibn ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), or by the grave of Ibn ‘Araby in Syria or by the grave of Shaykh ‘Abdul-Qadir Al-Jilany in Iraq. With regard to the practices of ignorant people who call upon deceased people and seek their help, all this is tantamount to Kufr and Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory: to dedicate all ‘Ibadah (worship) to Allah Alone, to call upon none but Him (may He be Glorified and Exalted), and not to seek victory, support or remedy neither from the deceased, nor from trees or stones. All this is to be sought from Allah Alone (may He be Glorified and Exalted). Human beings are to be asked for what is within their ability to do, provided that they are alive and present, not dead or absent; the dead should not be sought out for anything. Rather, one can seek the help of those who are alive and present, if this is within their capacity. One can say: O brother, help me to do such and such a thing, if this is within their capacity; loan us such and such a thing; or help me repair my house or my car. There is nothing wrong to say this verbally, by sending a letter, or by phoning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the deceased, the trees, stones, idols, or stars, are not to be asked for anything because this is tantamount to major Shirk, may Allah protect us! In fact, this is tantamount to worshipping them besides or instead of Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted). Thus, Muslims should beware of what Allah forbade them from. They should have sound knowledge of their religion and address their questions to qualified scholars who are well-known for adhering to the Sunnah and have correct ‘Aqidah (creed). People should ask them about the Religion of Allah and about what is ambiguous for them. They should not blindly follow the customs and practices that are only done by ignorant people. Allah (may He be Glorified) says:Surah Al-An`am, 6: 163 He has no partner. And of this I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims. And:Surah Al-Kawthar, 108: 1 Verily, We have granted you (O Muhammad peace be upon him) Al-Kauthar (a river in Paradise). Surah Al-Kawthar, 108: 2 Therefore turn in prayer to your Lord and sacrifice (to Him only). Thus, Salah (Prayer) and sacrifice are to be made to Allah Alone. The same applies to Du‘a’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (May He be Glorified) says:Surah Al-Jinn, 72: 18 And the mosques are for Allâh (Alone); so invoke not anyone along with Allâh. Thus, it is Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted) Alone Who is to be supplicated and hoped in. It is He Who is to be drawn nearer to by vows, sacrifices, Salah, and Sawm. May Allah help Muslims be enlightened in their religion! May He set right the affairs of Muslim scholars and guide them to enlighten their brothers and teach them what confuses them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>It is permissible to make graveyards into roads and car parks, and to build shops upon them and other types of insults?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Answer, and Allaah is the One who Grants Success:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Verily, insult and oppression is prohibited whether that is upon the living or upon the dead. Rather, it is more severely prohibited upon the dead due to these two noble Prophetic Hadeeths:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 – From Abee Hurayrah (radiyAllaahu ‘anhu) who said: that Allaah’s Messenger ( Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam) said: ((That one of you should sit upon hot coals, and thereby burn his clothes and then his skin, is better for him than sitting upon a grave)). Reported by Muslim, no. 971.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 – From ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir (radiyAllaahu ‘anhu) who said: that Allaah’s Messenger ( Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam) said:<br />
((For me to walk on coal or on a sword is more beloved to me than to walk upon the grave of a Muslim. And I would take more caution around a grave than when I relieve myself or in the middle of the market)). Narrated by Ibn Maajah: 1/499 with an authentic chain of narration. See al-Jaami’ as-Saheeh of ash-Shaykh Muqbil (rahimahullaahu ta’aalaa) 2/280.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say:<br />
Based upon this, it is not permissible for a Muslim who believes in Allaah and the Last Day to harm his Muslim brother, be he living or be he dead. And it is upon the state authorities to prevent the oppression of those who take the graveyards as roads and markets and places of sitting and resting. And it upon the scholars to clarify the truth that is with them, and Allaah is the One who Grants success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah) said in al-Iqtidaa’, page 325:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">( For verily the grave of a Muslim has a status as has come in the Sunnah, as it is the house of the Muslim who has died. So nothing is to be placed upon it from the impure things (an-Najaasaah), and this is in agreement with all the scholars, nor is it to be walked upon, nor is it to be leaned upon, and this is with us and the majority of the scholars (Jamhoor al-‘Ulamaa’). And they are not be present in the neighbourhood of those who harm the dead with statements and evil actions. And it is beloved and wanted that a person visits and sends Salaams upon the person of the grave, and makes Du’aa’ for him. And if the status of the dead person is high, then this right is even more valid ).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And al-‘Allaamah al-Albaanee (rahimahullaah) said in Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz, pages 298-299:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(( And from this we know the prohibition of what some of the Islaamic governments do from the erasing of some of the graveyards of the Muslims, and the digging for the reason of improving living conditions, without any consideration for the status of these graveyards, and without any consideration of the prohibition of walking over them and the breaking of their bones, and other than this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And no one ponders if the arranging of housing affairs makes allowable these types of opposition. Verily, this is not allowed. For verily, these are not from the necessities (ad-Darooriyaat), but they are from that which reaches perfection. And it is not allowed to inflict this type of opposition and harm upon those who have died. So it is upon those who are living to arrange their affairs without harming those who have died.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is truly amazing that you find some of these governments that they have a great concern and value for some stones and old buildings which have been built around the graveyards of the dead, more than they have value and concern for those who have died themselves. And verily, if some of these stones and ancient sites were to suffer some damage in their building designs, then they would go out of their way to alter and fix their building designs. But if it were a dead person, they have no value for it. Because they consider this to be from ancient rare objects which must be preserved! As for the graves of the dead, then they do not preserve them from these people! )) End.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And Shaykh Muqbil ibn Haadee al-Waadi’ee (rahimahullaah) was asked – about making the graveyards into marketplaces. As is mentioned in Qama’i al-Ma’aanid 1/165.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he responded: (( The graves are considered the houses of the dead, and it is not allowed for anybody to sit on a grave, and it is not allowed for cars to drive over the graveyard, and it is not allowed for anyone to sit upon the grave … And it is not allowed for the people to walk upon the graveyard, and it is not allowed for the graveyard to be changed into a playground or a learning center or a school or a Masjid, and other than these from the interests of the people … And it is obligatory upon the Muslims that they stop doing this, and even if a person were to build a five-storey house or higher than this upon a graveyard, then it would still not be allowable for him to live in, because the Prophet ( Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam) has forbidden that people sit on the grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The End</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above is taken from Class 45 of the below most excellent book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a title="‘al-Qawl-ul- Mufeed Fee Adillatit-Tawhid’ [Beneficial Speech in Establishing the Evidences of Tawhid] – Shaykh Muhammad al-Wasabi" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2014/01/17/tawheed-lessons-wasabi/"><strong>Lessons on Tawhid &#8211; Approximately 50 Classes</strong> </a>&#8211; from Dar-ul-Hadith, Dammaj, Yemen<br />
These were lessons conducted on the book &#8216;al-Qawl-ul- Mufeed Fee Adillatit-Tawhid&#8217; [Beneficial Speech in Establishing the Evidences of Tawhid] written by one of the major scholars of the Sunnah in Yemen, Shaikh Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhab al-Wasabi (may Allah preserve him).</p>
