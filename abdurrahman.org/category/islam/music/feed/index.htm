										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Advising women who listen to music<br />
</b>Nur `Ala Al-Darb Program, Tape no. 11</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b></b><b></b><b>Q: Kindly advise those women who listen to songs.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody"><b></b>I advise all men and women not to listen to music, because they bring about evil consequences. Songs are presented on TV, broadcast on the radio, and recorded on cassettes. All Muslim men and women are thus required to beware the evil of these songs. Instead, they should listen to the Qur&#8217;an, Hadiths of the Prophet (peace be upon him) or Islamic lectures which benefit them in this life and the Hereafter.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">As for songs and music, their evil is great as they may cause Muslims to deviate from their religion. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Songs and music may <strong>sow seeds of hypocrisy in the heart</strong>, at which point one begins to develop a dislike for everything that is good and become fond of every other thing that is evil. This is the true meaning of hypocrisy in addition to its literal meaning of pretending to be a Muslim while concealing Kufr (disbelief). Therefore, music is one of the means that invites to hypocrisy. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Having the habit of listening to music may lead to hating the recitation of the Qur&#8217;an, being heedless of beneficial advice, or listening to Hadiths of the Prophet (peace be upon him). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Moreover, one may be deluded into committing obscenities and corruption. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Thus, it is the duty of faithful men and women to be cautious of evil of songs and music.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states in the Glorious Qur&#8217;an:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And of mankind is he who purchases idle talks (i.e. music, singing, etc.) to mislead (men) from the Path of Allâh without knowledge, and takes it (the Path of Allâh, or the Verses of the Qur’ân) by way of mockery. For such there will be a humiliating torment (in the Hell-fire). </strong></span>(Surah Luqman, 31: 6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And when Our Verses (of the Qur’ân) are recited to such a one, he turns away in pride, as if he heard them not &#8211; as if there were deafness in his ear. So announce to him a painful torment. </span></strong>(Surah Luqman, 31: 7)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Commentators of the Qur&#8217;an interpret <strong>&#8220;idol talk&#8221;</strong> to mean <strong>singing</strong> and it is equally applied to every sound produced by musical instruments and diversions. This is the view held by most scholars of the Qur&#8217;an (may Allah have mercy on them).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Commenting on the above Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse),<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `<strong>Abdullah Ibn Mas`ud </strong></span>(may Allah be pleased with him) swore: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody">&#8220;By Allah! The reference in this Ayah is to singing.&#8221; </span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">He would swear and say: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody">&#8220;Singing causes the seeds of hypocrisy to grow in the heart like water causes seeds of plants to grow.&#8221; </span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">This means that singing causes one to hate good and to love evil; to hate listening to the Qur&#8217;an and to love songs and diversion and other things of the sort. This is a type of hypocrisy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">A hypocrite pretends to be associated with Islam. He pretends to be a believer while in fact he conceals Kufr. He pretends to love the Qur&#8217;an while in fact he does not. Music causes one to hate listening to the Qur&#8217;an or listening to someone calling to the way of Allah. It encourages the love of falsehood, speaking evil and obscene words. It not only causes the heart to deviate from the straight path but also to develop a fondness for what Allah (Glorified be He) has declared prohibited. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><strong>This has been proven by experience. Those who are in close contact with singers know how corrupt and spoiled they are because of their love of music and song</strong>. This brings about great evil to those who are accustomed to it. There is no power or might except with Allah.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/a-look-at-anasheeds-dr-saleh-as-saleh.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>Download PDF Here</strong></a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful, I begin to write:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In pre-Islamic and early Islamic history, anasheeds involved wholesome poems (about battle victories, wisdoms, courage, etc) chanted in an un-orchestrated fashion without the accompaniment of musical instruments, except for the duff (similar to tambourine but without bells or cymbals) which was legally permitted for women on special occasions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the 2nd century after Hijrah, chanting of du&#8217;aa, remembrances, crept into the ummah by the innovations of the <strong>mystic Sufis</strong> who, in turn, took it from the Christians. It was then called <strong>at-Taghbeer</strong>. All of these forms were denounced by the early scholars of Islam, including Imaam ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee, Ibn Taymmeyah, Ibnul Qayyim, Ibn Katheer, Ibn Rajab, and many others.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sufis centered most of their methodology of worship on congregational <strong>Taraaneem</strong> (singing by way of trilling, or quavering and prolonging the voice with a musical sound), resembling the Christians in their churches. Then the Sufis began to introduce <strong>physical movements</strong> during remembrances and du’aa close to those practiced by the Jews. Rarely do you witness a Sufi &#8220;<strong>Hadrah</strong> [2]&#8221; without these innovated practices.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nowadays, the matter is not limited to the Sufi adepts. Many Muslim parties (groups) have innovated special bands for the emotional arousing of their followers and for the &#8220;ummah&#8221; at large! Much of what is being practiced with these anasheed does not escape, at least, one of the following observations:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Involving more and more people, especially children, keeping them busy with what could be, least to say, of a lesser benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Anasheed are accompanied with musical toning and chanting (Eastern and Western beats) in the name of &#8220;culture&#8221; and &#8220;tradition.&#8221; This is becoming more and more apparent, with bands competing in their selection of words and beats.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Remembrances of Allah are introduced in these anasheed in ways clearly resembling the intoning and chanting of the Christians in their churches.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The congregational chanting and singing that takes place resembles to a great extent that which goes on in the circles of the mystic Sufis in their singing circles. Former &#8220;stars&#8221; are being more involved with the mystic Sufi ways through so-called &#8220;Islamic anasheed.&#8221; Some bands sing the infamous Shirk poem known as &#8220;Burdah,&#8221; which involves shirk levels of exaggeration in the status of the Prophet Muhammad (sall Allaahu alayhi wa sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Luring the children to sing, especially the young girls, imitating the base of the infamous Muslim and Non-Muslim singers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. Replacing the Qur‘aan with the so-called anasheed in the Da’wah to the young, claiming that they don’t respond to the Qur‘anic texts, therefore, legitimizing their use. The same is done with the Sunnah, eventually turning people away from what constitutes the true life for the believers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. In many of these singing circles, musical instruments and intoning are gradually taking hold, something known to be forbidden in Islam, except for the duff for women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. The emergence of so-called professional singing groups performing at weddings, parties, schools and the like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. Development of so called more advanced ways of video singing as a modern way of contemplating and reflecting on the creation of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. Allowing taking pictures of young girls during different presentations of songs in itself is a fitnah (affliction and trial) and an opposition to the Sahree’ah. Some make movies and records of these young girls singing on special occasions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. Many things that are untrue are presented in these songs through acting, or through exaggeration in praise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. If you examine many of these songs, you will find a lot of them focusing on the Tawheed of Lordship only, something even the Mushriks confess to (i.e. matters pertaining to the signs of Allah in the creation, His running of the affairs, Him being in full authority and the like).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. Transgression against the Sharee’ah in the form of acting roles. You see a child taking the role of Salah, saying, &#8220;I am the Salah, and these are my merits!&#8221; Another takes the role of Fasting and so on. Worst of all those who claim to represent the Qur’aan. Yet we know that the Qur‘aan is the uncreated Speech of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. Assuming in some cases the movements and walks of some of the losers from the known male and female singers. Imagine when this is done while chanting the remembrances of Allah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15. Calling these anasheed Islamic itself is a transgression, especially when they call it an &#8220;art&#8221; and a means of education and nourishment for the Da&#8217;wah! &#8220;This is an innovation in Deen, and this from the deen of the innovators of the Sufis.&#8221; [3] The companions chanted poetry of wisdom, courage, generosity and of maroo&#8217;ah (describing good character), and not in congregations. They chanted poetry sometimes while working or during night travel. None of them claimed this &#8220;Islamic.&#8221; Rather, everything takes its own particular ruling, whether it is innovated, allowable, recommended, obligated, disliked or forbidden. Therefore, that which may be allowable of it we don’t call &#8220;Islamic&#8221; because if it is called so, people would think it to be from the Deen. And to label any matter as Islamic, requires textual proofs.4 In fact, Sh. Al-Albani (rahimahullaah) referred to them as &#8220;<strong>Sufi singing</strong>&#8220;, and a similar conclusion was reached by Sh. &#8216;Abdul &#8216;Aziz Aal Ash-Shaikh, the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, as well as by Sh. Bakr Abu Zayeed and Sh. &#8216;Abdul &#8216;Aziz Ar-Raajhi and other scholars (may Allah preserve them all). [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The following question was raised to our Skaykh Muhammed Ibn Saaleh al-‘Uthaimeen (Rahimuhullaah):</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“What is the ruling concerning the anasheeds? Is it permissible for the Caller to Allah to listen to &#8220;Islamic anasheed&#8221;?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Shaykh responded</strong>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“In the past, I listened in the past to these Islamic anasheed and there was nothing therein which shuns away. After listening to them recently, I found them to be rhythmic with delectation and entertaining, like the songs accompanied with musical instruments. Accordingly, I don’t see that it is permissible for people to listen to them. However, if they come natural without musical accompaniment and without delectation or entertainment, then there is no harm in listening to them. Still, however, it is conditional that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) the person does not make this a habit listening to them all the time, and<br />
(ii) make not that which benefits and admonishes the heart restricted to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because if he makes of this a habit, he will abandon that which is more important. Moreover, in doing so he will relinquish the greatest admonition and it is that which came in the Book of Allah and in the Sunnah of Allah&#8217;s Messenger. But if he listens to them sometimes, or if takes them as a means of help on his journey while driving his care in the wilderness, then there is no harm in that.&#8221; [6]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he was asked, <span style="color:#993300;">“Is it permissible for the man to chant the Islamic anasheed and is it permissible that the duff, which is the tambourine without any of these bells attached to it, is it permissible to use the duff with the chanting and is the chanting or the anasheed permissible in other than the Eed and other than the festivals?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The answer</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Bismillaahir Rahmaanir Raheem, In the Name of Allah The Most Beneficent, The Most Merciful”, then he returned the greeting to the person who asked the Question, and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Islamic anasheed is an innovated chanting innovated by the Sufis. Therefore, one should turn away from it and resort to the admonitions from the Qur‘aan and Sunnah, unless it is used in the battlefields to help as a motivation for Jihaad in the cause of Allah, the Most High, then this is good, however, if it accompanied with the duff, then it would be far away from the truth.” [7]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, on several occasions, he (rahimahullaah) directed the people to give the best of attention to the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah, since they are the greatest admonitions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A special warning concerning the infamous <strong>Burdah poem of Al-Busiri</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is plain shirk because it exaggerates the Prophet (sall Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) giving him attributes of divinity, as if he knows the unseen and what is written in the preserved tablet. So much of this, unfortunately, is spread throughout the Muslim world and particularly in Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia. Think about it. Moreover, they have musical groups in these countries only specialized to sing these poems, especially the &#8220;Burdah&#8221;. In some recent forms, it is &#8220;recited by Khalid Belrhouzi featuring Yusuf Islam (yes!) This is an ad on the net carrying the title: Burdah (audio tape) Khalid Belrhouzi and Yusuf Islam (Arabic + English) [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is stated in this poem, among other things, that ‘And of your knowledge is the knowledge of the pen and the preserved tablet’! The &#8220;pen” refers to the pen which Allah ? commanded it saying: &#8220;Write! It said, &#8216;What should I write, my Rabb (Lord)? Allah said: Write the record of all preordained matter until the commencement of the Hour.&#8221; [9] According to this poet, the Prophet (sall Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) knows what the pen already wrote and what is written in the preserved tablet. We seek refuge in Allah from these fabrications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) to guide us all to the truth and to make us accept and yield to it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] See Al-Qawlul Mufeed fee Hukmil-anasheed (including the fatwa of the reliable contemporary scholars of Islam). Authored by &#8216;Isaam Ibn &#8216;Abdul Mun&#8217;im al-Mir-ree (1423/2002), Maktabatu al-Furqaan, Ujmaan, UAE.<br />
[2] Hadrah: Presence. Used by the Sufis in its general meaning, “Being in the presence of Allah.” In the school of mystic Ibn ‘Arabi, however, there are “Five Divine Presences,” a metaphysical doctrine of the degrees of reality of which there are different versions. This concept is influenced by the Neo-Platonist chain of “Stages or Orders of Being.” [See Mu’jam Al-Mustalahaat As-Sufiyyah by Al-Hafnee, p. 237 and Shorter Encyclopedia of Islam, p. 125, edited by H.A.R. Gibb and J.H. Kramers, 4th impression, 1995. Published by E.J. Brill, Leiden, The Netherlands.] The Mureed is informed that the Hadrah is the start, then the Mukaashafah (Mystic spiritual revelation regarding the Truth [Allah] and the Ghayb (unseen). Through this stage, things will be manifested as if he sees them by his eyes). The next state is the Mushaahadah (Witnessing of the Truth). Sufi singing, clapping, and swaying accompanied by drum beats is part of the &#8220;ritual&#8221;! Some of the mystics also claim the actual attendance of the Prophet (?) in their circles!<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">So O you human being, who stands in need and who was created for a tremendous matter, you for whom the Hellfire and the Gardens of Bliss were created, if you devote your attention to the <strong>musical instruments</strong> with your ears; and you <strong>look at what Allaah forbade</strong> with your eyes; and you <strong>eat doubtful matters</strong> with your mouth, allowing them to enter your stomach; and you are pleased with yourself <strong>dancing and swaying</strong>; and you waste all of your precious time engaged in these despicable acts; and you throw away your life, which has no value, in trying to attain these condemnable things; and you busy your body, which was created for worship, with that which Allaah forbade for His servants; and you <strong>sit in the gathering of the people of falsehood</strong>; and you perform the acts of the sinners and the ignorant.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You will come to know, when the cover has been lifted, and the Command (of Allaah) comes to pass, what will befall you from regret on the Day when you see the positions of those who have preceded (you) and the reward of those who did good deeds. While you will be with those who were left behind, the squanderers, and you will be counted as being in the company of the people of falsehood, the neglectful. You have stopped proceeding, the pains have befallen you, and your regrets have become tremendous. For on that Day, the one who cries will not be shown mercy, nor will the one who complains be listened to. Nor will the one who regrets be comforted. Nor will anyone be saved from the Torment of Allaah except for he who is granted mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah awaken you and us from the sleep of heedlessness, and may He enable you and us to perform what He created us for (i.e. worship), by His mercy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwa no. 20842</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Most mobiles have musical ring tones. Is it permissible to use these musical tones instead of the regular ring tone?  Could you kindly advise and direct us to what is beneficial for Muslims? May Allah reward you and protect you from harm! </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>not permissible to use musical tones</strong></span> on mobiles or other devices, because listening to musical instruments is prohibited as indicated by Shar‘y (Islamic legal) evidence. It is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>enough to use the regular ring tone</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AUTHOR: Imaam Ibn Qudaamah Al-Maqdisee [Died 620H]<br />
TRANSLATED: isma&#8217;eel alarcon<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>About the Book</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a small booklet titled <strong>Dhammu maa &#8216;alayhi Mudda&#8217;oo at-Tasawwuf </strong>(Condemning the Practices of those who Claim Sufism) by Imaam Abu Muhammad Ibn Qudaamah Al-Maqdisee, may Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The booklet was published by Maktab al-Islami and is a short treatise containing a fatwa (religious verdict) from this great scholar of the seventh century on some of the practices that those who ascribed themselves to Sufism were upon in those days, and still are upon till this day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fatwa generally focuses on <strong>musical instruments and singing</strong>, which were practices the Sufis performed, taking it as part of the religion and using that as a means of drawing nearer to Allaah. The Shaikh has filled his response With Quranic verses, prophetic ahaadeeth and narrations from the Salaf.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And how good is what Abu Ahmad ash-Shayrazi said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘The <em>Soofeeyah</em> used to ridicule Shaytaan and now the Shaytaan ridicules them! !’</strong></span></p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Deception of the Shaytaan of the Soofeeyah</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Hamid al-Faqee <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>comments on the statement of <em>Imaam</em> Ibn al-Qayyim <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> when he spoke about the deception of the Shaytaan of the <em>Soofeeyah</em>, when he <em>Imaam</em> Ibn al-Qayyim <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">‘The Shaytaan caused them to buzz around (dance) and to beat/strike the ground whizzing around on their feet, then sometimes he makes them like donkeys going around a pivot, and sometimes like insects dancing  in the middle of the house…’</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Hamid al-Faqee said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘The Shaykh (Ibn al-Qayyim <em>-Rahimullaah</em>) intends the <em>Mutasawwafa</em> (<em>Soofeeyah</em>) who form into circles, then stand up in those circles and dance and swing from side to side to the tune of singing and musical instruments.  They shout, scream and dance together with what they call <em>Dhikr</em> (remembrance of Allaah), rather it is sinfulness, disobedience and the remembrance of Shaytaan, may Allaah guide them and free them and free Islaam from those evils and crimes.’</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Ighaatul al-Lafaan Fee Massaeed ash-Shaytaan’ with the checking by Shaykh Albani Vol. 1 p.409]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>How the Shaytaan Deceived the People that <span style="color:#993300;">Whistling and Clapping</span> is Prayer</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> speaks about the <em>Ayaah<br />
</em> &lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;">Their prayer at the House (of Allaah) was nothing but whistling and clapping of hands</span>. &gt;&gt; [Anfal: 35] and how the Shaytaan deceived the people that whistling and clapping is prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim quotes: ‘Ibn Arafah and Ibn al-Ambaari who said: ‘that whistling and clapping is not prayer. . .’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Muhammad Hamid al-Faqee</strong> commented on this by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘In reality this is not prayer, Allaah called it prayer because they used to whistle and clap in their thundering movements to the tunes of whistling and clapping, since they intended by it a means of coming closer to Allaah, so Allaah reprimanded them and criticized them, and Allaah clarified that He does not love that, He does not reward them for it except with a painful punishment.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And that whistling and clapping (of the polytheists) is like what takes place in the gatherings of the <em>Soofeeyah</em> of our time, like for like; dancing movements to the tune of whistling and clapping. Their deep-rooted desires beautified this, likewise their ignorance and the Shayateen from the men and Jinn, beautified this to make them think that it is <em>Dhikr</em> (remembrance of Allaah) and worship!!</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allaah is far from this.’</strong></span></p>
