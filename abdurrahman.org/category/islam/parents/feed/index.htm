										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 27 : Point 32 (Part A)</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know, that there is to be no obedience to any human in disobedience to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. </strong>And whoever is from the people of Islaam then do not bear witness (of Paradise or the Fire) for him on account of his having done a deed, whether good or bad, since you do not know what his deeds will be concluded with at the point of death. You hope for Allaah’s Mercy for him and you fear for him (because of his sins). You do not know what is destined for him at the point of death with regard to his repenting to Allaah and what Allaah may bring about for him at that time if he dies upon Islaam. You hope for (Allaah’s) Mercy for him and you fear for him because of his sins. And there is no sin except that the servant may repent from it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;">[only highlighted portion of the above point is covered in this post]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F369857102&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/there-is-no-obedience-to-a-created-being-in-disobedience-to-the-creator" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And know that there is to be no obedience to any human in disobedience to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.”</strong> This is an exception to what has preceded, referring to what he mentioned with regard to it being obligatory to obey the ruler, that it is not obligatory in everything. Rather, they are only to be obeyed in that which is not <em>ma`siyah</em> (a sin). As for if they command a sin, then they are not obeyed upon sin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;">And there occurs in the hadeeth: that the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> appointed a leader over an army detachment of the Companions. So when they proceeded upon the way, he (this leader) said to them, “Gather some firewood.” So, when they had gathered it, he said, “Set it on fire.” So, when they had set is blazing, he said, “Enter into the fire. Did not the Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> say, ‘Hear and obey’?” So some of them said, “We did not obey the Messenger except in order to flee away from the Fire so how can we then enter into it?!” So therefore they refused to enter into it. So when that (news) reached Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> he said, “If they had entered it then they would not have come out from it. Obedience is only in that which is good.” </span>[03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em>sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“There is to be no obedience to a created being in disobedience to the Creator.”</strong></span> [04]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said with regard to the parents:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And be thankful to Me and to your parents; the return will be to Me. And if those two strive&#8230;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning the parents,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8230; to make you associate along with Me that which you have no knowledge of then do not obey them; but live with them in this world in a good manner; and follow the way of those who turn to Me.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Soorah-Luqmaan (31), aayahs 14 and 15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">However that does not mean that obedience to the ruler ceases if he commands something sinful, but rather it means that he is not obeyed in that sin, whereas obedience to him remains in that which is not a sin.</span> This is the meaning of “There is no obedience to a created being in disobedience to the Creator.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not to be said that Allaah has commanded obedience to the ruler and He has commanded fine treatment and obedience to the parents in everything. We say, yes Allaah commanded obedience to those in authority (but), upon what is good; and He commanded obedience to the parents, however in what is good, not in disobedience to Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03](The hadeeth) has preceded. (Reported by al-Bukhaariyy (7145) and Muslim (1840) from a hadeeth of `Aliyy <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[04] It’s checking has preceded. (Reported by Imaam Ahmad and at-Tabaraaniyy and others from a hadeeth of `Imraan ibn Husayn <em>radiyAllaahu `anhu</em>)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> replied: ‘Your mother.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man said: ‘then who?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> replied: ‘Your mother.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man said: ‘then who?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> replied: ‘Your mother.’</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected in ‘Adab al-Mufrad’ no.3, Tirmidhi and ‘Irwaa al-Ghaleel’ 829/2232, declared Hasan by Albaani.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[In another narration: ‘A man came to the Prophet of Allaah  <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and said: ‘What do you order me with?’ The Messenger  <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Be good to your mother.’</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Nawawee said in his explanation of this hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Scholars have said: the reason for the superiority of the mother is due to her becoming tired on your account, her compassion, her serving you, suffering hardship while being pregnant with you, then giving birth to you, then suckling you, then bringing you up, serving you, nursing you and other things.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from the ‘Sharh Saheeh Muslim’ 16/80]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hajr quotes Ibn Battaal in the explanation of this hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Battaal said: ‘Malik was asked: my father requests me to do something but my mother prevents me from it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Malik answered: ‘Obey your father and do not disobey your mother.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[‘Fath ul Bari’10/402]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- ‘Asma bint Abu Bakr said: ‘My mother came to me and she is a <em>Mushrikah</em> (Non-Muslim) at the time of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>, so I asked the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> about this and I said to him: ‘My mother has come to me, and she is asking for me to be good to her, should I keep good relations with my mother?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Keep good relations with her.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari, Muslim and in the wording mentioned by Abu Daawood: ‘Asma <em>–RadhiAllaahu anha</em>&#8211; said: ‘… and she hates Islaam.’ ‘Saheeh Targheeb  wa Tarheeb’ p.657 no. 2500]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Uayainah said: Allaah –<em>Azza wa Jall</em> – revealed &lt;&lt; Allaah does not forbid you from dealing justly and kindly with those who did not fight against you on account of religion &gt;&gt; [al-Mumtahina: 8] regarding her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari in ‘Adab al-Mufrad’ no. 25, declared Saheeh by Albani in ‘Saheeh Abu Daawood’ (1468)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- It is narrated from Talha bin Muaaweeyah as-Sulamee <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>&#8211; who said I came to the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah! Indeed I want to participate in <em>Jihaad</em> in the path of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Is your mother alive?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: ‘Yes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Stay at her feet, for there is Paradise.’</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: ‘Yes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Stick to them, since indeed Paradise is under their feet.’</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">4 – From Ibn Umar <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>&#8211;  who said: ‘A man came to the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and said: ‘Indeed I have committed a major sin, is there any repentance for me?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Do you have a mother?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘No.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Do you have an aunt (mother’s sister)?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘Yes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘Then be good to her.’</p>

Chapter 41<br />
Prohibition of Disobeying Parents and severance of Relations</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Would you then, if you were given the authority, do mischief in the land, and sever your ties of kinship? Such are they whom Allah has cursed, so that He has made them deaf and blinded their sight.&#8221;</b></span><b> (47:22,23)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And those who break the Covenant of Allah, after its ratification, and sever that which Allah has commanded to be joined (i.e., they sever the bond of kinship and are not good to their relatives), and work mischief in the land, on them is the curse (i.e., they will be far away from Allah&#8217;s Mercy), and for them is the unhappy (evil) home (i.e., Hell).&#8221;</b></span><b> (13:25)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And your Rubb has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them but address them in terms of honour. And lower unto them the wing of submission and humility through mercy, and say: `My Rubb! Bestow on them Your Mercy as they did bring me up when I was young.&#8221;&#8217;</b></span><b> (17:23,24)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>336.</b> Abu Bakrah Nufai` bin Al-Harith (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Shall I not inform you of the biggest of the major sins?&#8221;</span> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) asked this question thrice. We said, &#8220;Yes, O Messenger of Allah. (Please inform us.)&#8221;. He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Ascribing partners to Allah, and to be undutiful to your parents&#8221;.</span> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) sat up from his reclining position and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;And I warn you against giving forged statement and a false testimony; I warn you against giving forged statement and a false testimony&#8221;.</span> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) kept on repeating that warning till we wished he would stop.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>337.</b>  Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`as (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;(Of the) major sins are: to ascribe partners to Allah, disobey parents, murder someone, and to take a false oath (intentionally)&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>338.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`as (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;It is one of the gravest sins to abuse one&#8217;s parents.</span>&#8221; It was asked (by the people): &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, can a man abuse his own parents?&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He abuses the father of somebody who, in return, abuses the former&#8217;s father; he then abuses the mother of somebody who, in return, abuses his mother&#8221;</span>.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;One of the major sins is to curse one&#8217;s parents&#8221;</span>. It was submitted: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! How can a man curse his own parents?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;When someone curses the parents of another man who in return abuses the former&#8217;s father; and when someone abuses the mother of another man who in return abuses his mother.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>339.</b> Abu Muhammad Jubair bin Mut`im (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The person who severs the bond of kinship will not enter Jannah&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>340.</b> Abu &#8216;Isa Al-Mughirah bin Shu`bah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah has forbidden you: disobedience to your mothers, to withhold (what you should give), or demand (what you do not deserve), and to bury your daughters alive. And Allah dislikes idle talk, to ask too many questions (for things which will be of no benefit to one), and to waste your wealth&#8221;.</span><br />

Chapter 42<br />
Excellence in doing Good to the Friends of Parents and other Relatives</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>341.</b> `Abdullah bin `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The finest act of goodness is that a person should treat kindly the loved ones of his father&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>342.</b> `Abdullah bin Dinar reported: `Abdullah bin `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) met a bedouin on his way to Makkah, he greeted him, offered him to mount the donkey he was riding and gave him the turban he was wearing on his head. Ibn Dinar said to him: &#8220;May Allah make you pious! Bedouins can be satisfied with anything you give them (i.e., what you have given the bedouin is too much). Upon this, `Abdullah bin `Umar said, the father of this man was one of `Umar&#8217;s friends whom he loved best, and I heard Messenger of Allah saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The finest act of goodness is the good treatment of someone whom one&#8217;s father loves&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration goes: When `Abdullah bin `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) set out to Makkah, he kept a donkey with him to ride when he would get tired from the riding of the camel, and had a turban which he tied round his head. One day, as he was riding the donkey, a bedouin happened to pass by him. He (`Abdullah bin `Umar) said, &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you so-and-so?&#8221; The bedouin said, &#8220;Yes&#8221;. He (`Abdullah bin `Umar) gave him his donkey and his turban and said, &#8220;Ride this donkey, and tie this turban round your head&#8221;. Some of his companions said, &#8220;May Allah forgive you, you gave to this bedouin the donkey which you enjoyed to ride for change, and the turban which you tied round your head&#8221;.`Abdullah bin `Umar said,&#8221;I heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `The finest act of goodness is the kind treatment of a person to the loved ones of his father after his death,</span>&#8216; and the father of this person was a friend of `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him).<br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>343.</b> Abu Usaid Malik bin Rabi<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">`</span>ah As-Sa`idi (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: We were sitting with Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) when a man of Banu Salamah came to him and asked, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Is there any obedience to parents left that I can show to them after their death?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Yes, to pray for them, to supplicate for their forgiveness, to fulfill their promises after their death, to maintain the ties of kinship which cannot be maintained except through them, and honour their friends.&#8221;</span><br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>344.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: I never felt jealous of any of the wives of the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) as much as I did of Khadijah (May Allah be pleased with her)<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">,</span> although I have never seen her, but the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) used to mention her very often. Whenever he slaughtered a sheep, he would cut it into pieces and send them to the women friends of Khadijah (May Allah be pleased with her). When I sometimes said to him: &#8220;You treat Khadijah in such a way as if there is no woman on earth except her&#8221;. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) would say,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Khadijah was such and such (commending her and speaking well of her), and I had children from her&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is: And if he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) slaughtered a sheep, he would send meat to the friends of Khadijah (May Allah be pleased with her) as a present as much as would suffice them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration is: When a sheep was slaughtered, he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) would say,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Send this meat to Khadijah&#8217;s friends.</span>&#8221; Once, Halah bint Khuwailid (May Allah be pleased with her)<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">,</span> sister of Khadijah (May Allah be pleased with her)<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">,</span> sought permission of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) to enter. He recognized and recalled to his mind the manner of Khadijah (May Allah be pleased with her) and was deeply moved. He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O Allah, she must be Halah bint Khuwailid&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>345.</b> Anas bin Malik (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I set out along with Jarir bin `Abdullah Al-Bajali (May Allah be pleased with him) on a journey and he served me. I said to him:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Don&#8217;t do that.</span>&#8221; Thereupon, he said,<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;I have seen the Ansar doing this with Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), and I swore by Allah, whenever I accompany anyone of the Ansar, I would serve him&#8221;.</span><br />

Chapter 40<br />
Kind Treatment towards Parents and establishment of the ties of Blood<br />
Relationship</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Worship Allah and join none with Him (in worship); and do good to parents, kinsfolk, orphans, Al-Masakin (the poor), the neighbour who is near of kin, the neighbour who is a stranger, the companion by your side, the wayfarer (you meet), and those (slaves) whom your right hands possess&#8221;.</b></span><b> (4:36)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And fear Allah through Whom you demand (your mutual rights), and (do not cut the relations of) the wombs (kinship)&#8221;.</b></span><b> (4:1)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And those who join that which Allah has commanded to be joined (i.e., they are good to their relatives and do not sever the bond of kinship)&#8221;.</b></span><b> (13:21)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And we have enjoined on man to be good and dutiful to his parents&#8221;.</b></span><b> (29:8)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And your Rubb has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them but address them in terms of honour. And lower unto them the wing of submission and humility through mercy, and say: `My Rubb! Bestow on them Your Mercy as they did bring me up when I was young&#8221;.</b></span><b> (17:23,24)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And We have enjoined on man (to be dutiful and good) to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship upon weakness and hardship, and his weaning is in two years- give thanks to Me and to your parents&#8221;</b></span><b>. (31:14)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>312.</b> `Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I asked the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) , &#8220;Which of the deeds is loved most by Allah?&#8221; Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Salat at its proper time.</span>&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What next?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Kindness to parents.</span>&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What next?&#8221; He replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Jihad in the way of Allah.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>313.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;No son can repay (the kindness shown by his father) unless he finds him a slave and buys him and emancipates him&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>314.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He who believes in Allah and the Last Day, let him be hospitable to his guest; and he who believes in Allah and the Last Day, let him maintain good the ties of blood relationship; and he who believes in Allah and the Last Day, must speak good or remain silent&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>315.</b>  Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah created all the creatures and when He finished the task of His creation, Ar-Rahm (ties of relationship) said: `(O Allah) at this place I seek refuge with You against severing my ties.&#8217; Allah said: `That I treat with kindness those who treat you with kindness and sever ties with those who sever ties with you.&#8217; It said: `I am satisfied.&#8217; Allah said: `Then this is yours&#8221;</span>. Then Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;Recite this Ayah if you like:<span style="color:#ff0000;"> `Would you then, if you were given the authority, do mischief in the land, and sever your ties of kinship? Such are they whom Allah has cursed, so that He has made them deaf and blinded their sight&#8221;.</span> (47:22,23).<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The words in Al-Bukhari are: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Allah (SWT) says: `He who maintains good ties with you, I maintain good ties with him; and he who severs your ties, I sever ties with him&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>316.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A person came to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and asked, &#8220;Who among people is most deserving of my fine treatment?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Your mother&#8221;.</span> He again asked, &#8220;Who next?&#8221;<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Your mother&#8221;</span>, the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied again. He asked, &#8220;Who next?&#8221; He (the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) said again,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Your mother.</span>&#8221; He again asked, &#8220;Then who?&#8221; Thereupon he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;">&#8221; Then your father.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Who is most deserving of my fine treatment?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Your mother, then your mother, then your mother, then your father, then your nearest, then nearest&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>317.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;May he be disgraced! May he be disgraced! May he be disgraced, whose parents, one or both, attain old age during his life time, and he does not enter Jannah (by rendering being dutiful to them)&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>318.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A man said to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam): &#8220;I have relatives with whom I try to keep the ties of relationship but they sever relations with me; and whom I treat kindly but they treat me badly, I am gentle with them but they are rough to me.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;If you are as you say, it is as if you are feeding them hot ashes, and you will be with a supporter against them from Allah as long as you continue to do so&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>319.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He who desires ample provisions and his life be prolonged, should maintain good ties with his blood relations&#8221;.</span> [Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>320.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Abu Talhah (May Allah be pleased with him) was the richest among the Ansar of Al-Madinah and possessed the largest property; and among his possessions what he loved most was his garden known as Bairuha&#8217; which was opposite the mosque, and Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) often visited it and drank from its fresh water. When this ayah was revealed:<span style="color:#ff0000;"> &#8220;By no means shall you attain Al-Birr (piety, righteousness &#8211; here it means Allah&#8217;s reward, i.e., Jannah), unless you spend (in Allah&#8217;s Cause) of that which you love,&#8221;</span> (3:92). Abu Talhah came to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), and said: &#8220;Allah says in His Book:<span style="color:#ff0000;"> `By no means shall you attain Al-Birr, unless you spend (in Allah&#8217;s Cause) of that which you love,</span>&#8216; and the dearest of my property is Bairuha&#8217; so I have given it as Sadaqah (charity) for Allah&#8217;s sake, and I anticipate its reward with Him; so spend it, O Messenger of Allah, as Allah guides you&#8221;. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Well-done! That is profitable property. I have heard what you have said, but I think you should spend it on your nearest relatives.</span>&#8221; So Abu Talhah distributed it among his nearest relatives and cousins.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>321.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`as (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: A man came to the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) of Allah and said, &#8220;I swear allegiance to you for emigration and Jihad, seeking reward from Allah.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Is any of your parents alive?</span>&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, both of them are alive.&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) then asked,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Do you want to seek reward from Allah?</span>&#8221; He replied in the affirmative. Thereupon Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Go back to your parents and keep good company with them&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration it is reported that a person came to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and sought his permission to participate in Jihad. The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) asked,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Are your parents alive?</span>&#8221; He replied in the affirmative. The Prophet a(sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;(You should) consider their service as Jihad.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>322.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr Al-`as (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The person who perfectly maintains the ties of kinship is not the one who does it because he gets recompensed by his relatives (for being kind and good to them), but the one who truly maintains the bonds of kinship is the one who persists in doing so even though the latter has severed the ties of kinship with him&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>323.</b> `Aishah (May Allah be pleased with her) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The bond of relationship is suspending from the Throne, and says: `He who keeps good relations with me, Allah will keep connection with him, but whosoever severs relations with me, Allah will sever connection with him&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>324.</b> It has been narrated that Maimuna bint Al-Harith (May Allah be pleased with her) had set free a slave-girl without the Prophet&#8217;s permission. When her turn came (the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)  used to visit his wives in turns), she made mention of that to him saying, &#8220;Did you know I have set slave-girl free?&#8221; He said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Have you, indeed?&#8221;</span> She replied, &#8220;Yes&#8221;. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) then remarked,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Had you given her to your maternal uncles, you would have your reward increased&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>325.</b> Asma&#8217; bint Abu Bakr As-Siddiq (May Allah be pleased with her) said: My mother came to me while she was still a polytheist, so I asked Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), &#8220;My mother, who is ill-disposed to Islam, has come to visit me. Shall I maintain relations with her?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Yes, maintain relations with your mother&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>326.</b> Zainab Ath-Thaqafiyah (May Allah be pleased with her) the wife of `Abdullah bin Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: When Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)<span style="color:#0000ff;"> told the women that they should give Sadaqah (charity), even if it should be some of their jewellery,</span> I returned to `Abdullah bin Mas`ud and said, &#8220;You are a man who does not possess much, and Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) has commanded us to give Sadaqah. So go and ask him if giving to you will serve the purpose; otherwise, I shall give it to someone else.&#8221; He asked me that I should better go myself. I went and found a woman of the Ansar at the door of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), waiting to ask a similar question as mine. The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) was endowed with dignity, and so we could not go in. When Bilal (May Allah be pleased with him) came out to us, we said to him: &#8220;Go to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and tell him that there are two women at the door who have come to ask him whether it will serve them to give Sadaqah to their husbands and to orphans who are in their charge, but do not tell him who we are. Bilal (May Allah be pleased with him) went in and asked him, and Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)<span style="color:#0000ff;"> asked him who the women were.</span> When he told him that they were a woman of the Ansar and Zainab,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> he asked him which Zainab it was</span>, and when he was told it was the wife of `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, he (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;They will have a double reward, one for maintaining the ties of kinship and another for Sadaqah&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>327.</b> Abu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb (May Allah be pleased with him) mentioned Heraclius in a long Hadith and said: Heraclius asked me, &#8220;What does this Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) teach you?&#8221; I said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;He orders us to worship Allah Alone and not to associate a thing with Him in worship, to discard what our ancestors said, to perform the Salat (prayer), speak the truth, and maintain the ties of kinship&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>328.</b> Abu Dharr (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;You will soon conquer a land where people deal with Qirat.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> And according to another version: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;You will soon conquer Egypt where Al-Qirat is frequently mentioned. So when you conquer it, treat its inhabitants well. For there lies upon you the responsibility because of blood ties or relationship (with them)&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>329.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: When this Verse was revealed:<span style="color:#ff0000;"> &#8220;And warn your tribe (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)) of near kindred&#8221;.</span> (26:214) Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) called the Quraish; when they gathered, he said to them:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;O sons of `Abd Shams; O sons of Ka`b bin Lu&#8217;ai, rescue yourselves from the Fire! O sons of Murrah bin Ka`b, rescue yourselves from the Fire! O sons of `Abd Manaf, rescue yourselves from the Fire! O sons of `Abdul-Muttalib, rescue yourselves from the Fire! O Fatimah, rescue yourself from the Fire, for I have no power (to protect you) from Allah in anything except that I would sustain relationship with you&#8221;.</span><br />
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>330.</b> Abu Abdullah `Amr bin Al-`as (May Allah be pleased with them) said: I heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying openly not secretly,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;The family of so-and-so (i.e., Abu Talib) are not my supporters. My supporter is Allah and the righteous believing people. But they (that family) have kinship (Rahm) with whom I will maintain good the ties of kinship&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>331.</b> Abu Ayyub Khalid bin Zaid Al-Ansari (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A man came to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and said, &#8220;Direct me to a deed which will admit me to Jannah and take me away from the Fire&#8221;. The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Worship Allah and associate no partner with Him, perform As-Salat, pay Zakat, and maintain the ties of kinship&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>332.</b> Salman bin `Amir (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;When you break fast, you should do it with a date-fruit for there is blessing in it, and if you do not find a date-fruit, break it with water for it is pure.&#8221;</span> Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) added:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Charity towards a poor person is charity, and towards a relation is both charity and maintaining the ties (of kinship)&#8221;.</span><br />
[Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>333.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: I had a wife whom I loved but `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) disliked her. He asked me to divorce her and when I refused, `Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) went to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and mentioned the matter to him. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)<span style="color:#0000ff;"> asked me to divorce her.</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi and Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>334.</b> Abud-Darda&#8217; (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A man came to me and said, &#8220;I have a wife whom my mother commands me to divorce&#8221;. I replied him that I had heard Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;A parent is the best of the gates of Jannah; so if you wish, keep to the gate, or lose it.&#8221;</span><br />
[At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>335.</b> Al-Bara&#8217; bin `Azib (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: I heard the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying:<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;A mother&#8217;s sister is equivalent to (real) mother (in status)&#8221;.</span><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Kaab Ibn Ujrah (radhi Allaahu anhu) relates that Rasulullah (peace be upon him) said Come near to the mimbar and we came near the mimbar. When He (peace be upon him) climbed the first step of the mimbar, He (peace be upon him) said &#8220;Aameen&#8221;, When He (peace be upon him) ascended the second step, He (peace be upon him) said &#8220;Aameen&#8221;, When He (peace be upon him) climbed the third step, He (peace be upon him) said &#8220;Aameen&#8221; When He (peace be upon him) came down, We said &#8220;O Rasool of Allah (peace be upon him), we have heard from you today something which we never heard before&#8221; He (peace be upon him) said When I climbed the first step, the angel Jibraeel (alaihi as-salam) appeared before me and said</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Destruction to him who found the blessed month of Ramdhan and let it pass by without gaining forgiveness&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">upon that I said &#8216;Aameen&#8217;. When I climbed the second step, he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Destruction to him before whom thy name is taken and then he does not make Dua for Allah&#8217;s blessing on me (by saying, for example , Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam).&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied &#8216;Aameen&#8217;. When I climbed the third step, he said</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Destruction unto him in whose lifetime his parents or either one of them reaches old age, and (through failure to serve them) he is not allowed to enter Jannah&#8221;.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said &#8216;Aameen&#8217;. (Hakim, Baihaqi)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Note In this Hadith, it appears that Jibraeel (alaihi as-salam) gave expression to three curses, upon which Rasulullah (peace be upon him) said Aameen every time. In al-Durr al-Mansoor it is reported that Jibraeel (alaihi as-salam) advised Rasulullah (peace be upon him) to say Aameen. Being an angel of such high mark, Jibraeel &#8216;s giving these curses is sure to be accepted. May Allah (Subhanahu wa Taala) in His infinite mercy grant us His help and save us from these three dangers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Q 7: <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Is it permissible to perform Ruku‘ (bowing) to one’s parents?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is impermissible and is tantamount to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ruku‘ is a form of worship, just like Sujud (prostration); therefore, it is impermissible to bow or prostrate before anyone other than Allah the Exalted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1 – Knowing that Allaah is the One Who forgives</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn Abbas -Radhi Allaahu anhu- said who said that the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: that Allaah Azza wa Jal said:</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">من علم أني ذو قدرة على مغفرة الذنوب غفرت له و لا أبالي ما لم يشرك بي شيئا</h4>
<p style="text-align:center;">‘Whoever knows that I have the capability to forgive sins, then I will forgive him and not care, as long as he did not associate anything with Me.’ <strong>[Collected by Tabrani and Albaani declared it to be Hasan in Saheeh al-Jamia no. 4330]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2 – Hundred times a Day</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From al Aghra -Radhi Allaahu anhu- who said I heard the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- saying:</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">يا أيها الناس ! توبوا إلى الله واستغفروه فإني أتوب إلى الله وأستغفره في كل يوم مائة مرة</h4>
<p style="text-align:center;">‘O you people repent to Allaah and seek His forgiveness, since indeed I repent to Allaah and I seek His forgiveness a hundred times every day.’ <strong>[Collected by Ahmad &amp; Albaani declared it to have a saheeh Isnad in Saheehah no. 1452]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3 – Seeking Forgiveness for Parents</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Tabaraka wa Ta’ala said:</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">رَّبِّ ٱغۡفِرۡ لِي وَلِوَٰلِدَيَّ وَلِمَن دَخَلَ بَيۡتِيَ مُؤۡمِنٗا وَلِلۡمُؤۡمِنِينَ وَٱلۡمُؤۡمِنَٰتِۖ</h4>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8211; My Lord! Forgive me, and my parents, and him who enters my home as a believer, and all the believing men and women. &#8211; <strong>[Nuh: 28]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Tabaraka wa Ta’ala said:</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">وَقُل رَّبِّ ٱرۡحَمۡهُمَا كَمَا رَبَّيَانِي صَغِيرٗا ٢٤</h4>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8211; and say: ‘My Lord! Bestow on them Your Mercy as they did bring me up when I was small.’ &#8211; <strong>[al-Isra: 24]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Abu Hurairah – Radi Allaahu anhu – who said that the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said:</p>
<h4 style="text-align:justify;">إن الرجل لترفع درجته في الجنة فيقول : أنى ( لي ) هذا ؟ فيقال : باستغفار ولدك لك</h4>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed Allaah raises the grade of a righteous slave of His in Paradise so much that the slave of Allaah says: ‘O My Lord! From where is all this for me? He will say: ‘By your son seeking forgiveness for you.’<strong> [Collected by Ibn Majah, Ahmad, Ibn Abi Shaybah in ‘al-Mussanaf’, Asbahani in ‘Targheeb’, Baghawi in ‘Sharh as-Sunnah’, and by ad-Diyaa &amp; Albaani declared its Isnad as hasan in Saheehah no.1598]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul Hasan as-Sindi -Rahimullaah- (d. 1138 A.H.) said in his explanation of ‘Sunnan Ibn Majah’:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Therefore it is necessary for the son to seek forgiveness for his parents.’ <strong>[From ‘Sunnan Ibn Majah’ No. 3660]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan was asked:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘My mother seeks forgiveness and makes Tasbeeh a hundred times a day for her parents daily, what is the ruling of seeking forgiveness for parents after they have passed away?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Shaykh answered:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This is a good thing, seeking forgiveness for parents and the Muslims, a person seeks forgiveness for himself, his parents and the Muslims, this is a matter which is legislated.</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">رَّبِّ ٱغۡفِرۡ لِي وَلِوَٰلِدَيَّ وَلِمَن دَخَلَ بَيۡتِيَ مُؤۡمِنٗا</h4>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; My Lord! Forgive me, and my parents, and him who enters my home as a believer- like Nuh – alayhi as-Salaam- said.</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">واستغفر لذنبك وللمؤمنين والمؤمنات</h4>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8211; Seek forgiveness for your sins and the believing men and women. – Like Allaah said to our Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Seeking forgiveness for a person, his parents, his relatives, and his Muslim brothers, the living and the dead, is a matter which is needed, and a person should do this a lot.’ <strong>[Taken from: <a href="http://www.alfawzan.af.org.sa/node/13605%5D" rel="nofollow">http://www.alfawzan.af.org.sa/node/13605%5D</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4 – Seeking Forgiveness for the Believers</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ubadah bin as-Samitt -Radhi Allaahu anhu- who said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- saying:</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">من استغفر للمؤمنين و للمؤمنات كتب الله له بكل مؤمن و مؤمنة حسنة</h4>
<p style="text-align:center;">‘Whoever sought forgiveness for believing men and believing women, Allaah writes a good deed for him for every believing man and woman.’ <strong>[Collected by Tabrani and Albaani declared it to be Hasan in Saheeh al-Jamia no. 6026]</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The story of Uwais Al-Qarni was mentioned in Sahih Muslim as well as in other books. Now even though he was from the Tabi&#8217;een and did not see the Messenger [Salah Allahu Alaihi wa salam], the Messenger [Salah Allahu Alaihi wa salam] had advised &#8216;Umar ibn Al-Khatab [Radiya Allahu &#8216;Anhu] that if he meets [Uwais] then he, &#8216;Umar, should ask [Uwais] to ask Allah to forgive him and to make supplication for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Asir ibn Jaabir radhiallahu `anhu narrated</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever people would come from Yemen, `Umar radhiallahu `anhu would ask them, &#8220;Is Uways Al-Qaranee amongst you?&#8221; until, one year, he met Uways.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8220;Are you Uways Al-Qaranee?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Umar continued, &#8220;From Muraad, then Qaran?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Umar then asked, &#8220;Were you once afflicted with leprosy and your skin healed except for a dirham&#8217;s area?&#8221; Uways said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Umar finally asked, &#8220;Do you have a mother (that is alive)?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Umar then said, &#8220;I heard the Messenger of Allah – sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam &#8211; say, &#8216;Uways ibn Aamir will come to you with the delegations from Yemen, from Muraad, then from Qaran. He was once afflicted with leprosy and his skin healed except for a dirham&#8217;s area. <strong>He has a mother, and he treats her kindly</strong>. If he was to ever swear by Allah (for something) Allah would fulfill his oath. If you can, request that he ask forgiveness for you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Umar then requested from Uways, &#8220;Ask forgiveness for me.&#8221; And Uways Al-Qaranee did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>~</em><strong>Sahih Muslim</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Uqbah b. ‘Âmir Al-Juhanî – Allâh be pleased with him – once passed by a man who looked like a Muslim, so he greeted him with salâm, and he replied, “And upon you [be peace] and the mercy of Allâh and His blessings.” A boy informed him, “He is a Christian!” So ‘Uqbah got up and followed the man, caught up with him and said, <span style="color:#008000;">“<em>The mercy of Allâh and His blessings are upon the believers; however, may Allâh give you a long life, and make plentiful your wealth and offspring</em>.”</span> [Al-Bukhârî, <em>Al-Adab Al-Mufrad]</em></p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Al-Albânî</strong> grades its chain of narration hasan in <strong><em>Sahîh Al-Adab Al-Mufrad</em></strong> p444, and notes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“In this narration this illustrious Companion indicates that it is permissible to supplicate for someone to have a long life, even if he is an unbeliever, and so [this can be done for] a Muslim <em>a fortiori</em>…However, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">the supplicant should make sure that the unbeliever is not an enemy of the Muslims</span>. It is also taken from this [narration] that such an unbeliever can be commiserated with what has been mentioned therein [i.e. the believers are the ones who will receive the mercy of Allâh and His blessings].”</p>
