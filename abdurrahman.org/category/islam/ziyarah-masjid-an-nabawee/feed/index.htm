<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">31-Ruling on making Du&#8217;a&#8217; the dead</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: What is the ruling on those who make Du&#8217;a&#8217; (supplication) to the dead?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ans by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who make Du`a&#8217; (supplication) to the dead are Mushriks (those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). If they make Du&#8217;a&#8217; to the dead, idols, trees, stones, angels or jinn, they will be regarded as Kafirs (disbelievers) as making Du&#8217;a&#8217; to all these leads to one thing; namely, Kufr (disbelief that takes the Muslim out of Islam),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One thing that can be excluded from this ruling which is seeking help from his fellow Muslim brother or non-Muslim like buying a commodity from a non-Muslim, asking him to build a shop or mend a car while the person while he is alive. This case is considered to be exceptional and is not a kind of Shirk. It is similar to what Allah (Exalted be He) mentions in the story of Musa (Moses): <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(The man of his own) party asked him for help against his foe)</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one asks his fellow Muslim brother or the non-Muslim, who is present, to do something for him like building a house, mending the car, or plowing the land in return for something, or they agree upon doing something that is legally permitted, there will be nothing wrong as all these things are normal and can be done by human beings who are alive and present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But what is Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect) is making Du&#8217;a&#8217; to those who are not present and cannot hear him, the dead or a living person whom he thinks to be supernatural and has a mysterious power. This understanding leads him to think that if he makes Du&#8217;a&#8217; to this person for forgiveness and admittance to paradise, he will be able to do this because of something secret about this person. This is Munkar even if the person who is invoked besides Allah (Exalted be He) is living.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Sufis who worship their Shaykhs and their senior and prestigious persons who are dead. They ask them for help and make Du&#8217;a&#8217; to them to cure the sick. All these things are considered to be major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) <strong>even if the person whom they make Du`a&#8217; to is alive because they ask him something beyond his abilities</strong>. This behavior differs from asking a person to lend you something, build a house for you, cultivate some land, mend a car, bring your belongings from the car, and so on. All these things are normal and contain there is nothing wrong in them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q : A brother from Dar&#8217;a, Syria asks: What is the correct opinion about the stories narrated from one of the famous leaders of Sufism, Al-Sayyid <strong>Ahmad Al-Rifa&#8217;y</strong> that he visited the Mosque of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in Al-Madinah and supplicated at the Prophet&#8217;s grave. The Messenger (peace be upon him) then stretched his hand out to him and he kissed it?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">This is a widespread belief among the followers of his Tariqah (Sufi order). It is a belief they hold firmly, even though he lived in the 6th century A.H. How true is this story?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph">A : This is false and baseless, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) died as decreed by Allah (Glorified be He) who says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Zumar, 39: 30" target="_blank" name="Verilyyou(OMuhammad%D8%B5%D9%84%D9%89%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Verily you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will die, and verily they (too) will die.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> [Surah Al-Zumar, 39: 30]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph">According to a Sahih Hadith, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph"><span id="ContentParagraph"><span style="color:#008000;">Allah has angels roaming around the land; if they find anyone greeting me, they carry back these greetings to me.</span></span><span style="color:#008000;">There is no one who sends greetings upon me but Allah will restore my soul to me so that I may return his greeting.</span></span><span id="ContentParagraph">[1]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (peace be upon him) said: <a name="Themostexcellentofyourdays"></a><span id="ContentParagraph"><span style="color:#008000;">The most excellent of your days is Friday; so invoke more blessings on me on that day, for your blessings will be submitted to me.</span> The people asked: O Messenger of Allah, how can it be that our blessings will be submitted to you while your body is decayed? He replied: <span style="color:#008000;">Allah, the Exalted, has prohibited the earth to consume the bodies of the prophets. </span></span><span id="ContentParagraph">[2]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Hadiths which say similar things but it is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>not narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said that he would shake hands with anybody</strong></span>. This indicates that this story is false. Even if we were to assume that it is true, then it could be that this was a <strong>shaytaan</strong> (devil) who shook hands with him in order to deceive him and lead him and others astray.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What all Muslims have to do is to fear Allah and adhere to His Shari`ah, which is indicated in His Noble Book and in the Sunnah of His trustworthy Messenger, and beware of anything that goes against that. May Allah reform the Muslims and grant them understanding of His religion and cause them to adhere to His Shari`ah, for He is the Most Generous, Most Kind.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Book 30:</p>
<h3 align="center">Virtues of Madinah</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.030.091"></a>Volume 3, Book 30, Number 91:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Medina is a sanctuary from that place to that. Its trees should not be cut and no heresy should be innovated nor any sin should be committed in it, and whoever innovates in it an heresy or commits sins (bad deeds), then he will incur the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 409, Vol 9).</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 92:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet came to Medina and ordered a mosque to be built and said, &#8220;O Bani Najjar! Suggest to me the price (of your land).&#8221; They said, &#8220;We do not want its price except from Allah&#8221; (i.e. they wished for a reward from Allah for giving up their land freely). So, the Prophet ordered the graves of the pagans to be dug out and the land to be levelled, and the date-palm trees to be cut down. The cut date-palms were fixed in the direction of the Qibla of the mosque.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 93:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;I have made Medina a sanctuary between its two (Harrat) mountains.&#8221; The Prophet went to the tribe of Bani Haritha and said (to them), &#8220;I see that you have gone out of the sanctuary,&#8221; but looking around, he added, &#8220;No, you are inside the sanctuary.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 94:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have nothing except the Book of Allah and this written paper from the Prophet (where-in is written:) Medina is a sanctuary from the &#8216;Air Mountain to such and such a place, and whoever innovates in it an heresy or commits a sin, or gives shelter to such an innovator in it will incur the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people, none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted. And the asylum (of protection) granted by any Muslim is to be secured (respected) by all the other Muslims; and whoever betrays a Muslim in this respect incurs the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people, and none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted, and whoever (freed slave) befriends (take as masters) other than his manumitters without their permission incurs the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people, and none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 95:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;I was ordered to migrate to a town which will swallow (conquer) other towns and is called Yathrib and that is Medina, and it turns out (bad) persons as a furnace removes the impurities of iron.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 96:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Humaid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We came with the Prophet from Tabuk, and when we reached near Medina, the Prophet said, &#8220;This is Tabah.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 97:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If I saw deers grazing in Medina, I would not chase them, for Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;(Medina) is a sanctuary between its two mountains.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 98:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;The people will leave Medina in spite of the best state it will have, and none except the wild birds and the beasts of prey will live in it, and the last persons who will die will be two shepherds from the tribe of Muzaina, who will be driving their sheep towards Medina, but will find nobody in it, and when they reach the valley of Thaniyat-al-Wada&#8217;, they will fall down on their faces dead.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 99:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Zuhair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Yemen will be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families, and those who will obey them to migrate (to Yemen) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew. Sham will also be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families and those who will obey them, to migrate (to Sham) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew. &#8216;Iraq will be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families and those who will obey them to migrate (to &#8216;Iraq) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 100:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Verily, Belief returns and goes back to Medina as a snake returns and goes back to its hole (when in danger).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 101:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;None plots against the people of Medina but that he will be dissolved (destroyed) like the salt is dissolved in water.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 102:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Usama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once the Prophet stood at the top of a (looked out from upon one) castle amongst the castles (or the high buildings) of Medina and said, &#8220;Do you see what I see? (No doubt) I see the spots where afflictions will take place among your houses (and these afflictions will be) as numerous as the spots where rain-drops fall.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 103:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The terror caused by Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal will not enter Medina and at that time Medina will have seven gates and there will be two angels at each gate guarding them.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 104:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;There are angels guarding the entrances (or roads) of Medina, neither plague nor Ad-Dajjal will be able to enter it.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 105:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;There will be no town which Ad-Dajjal will not enter except Mecca and Medina, and there will be no entrance (road) (of both Mecca and Medina) but the angels will be standing in rows guarding it against him, and then Medina will shake with its inhabitants thrice (i.e. three earth-quakes will take place) and Allah will expel all the nonbelievers and the hypocrites from it.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 106:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle told us a long narrative about Ad-Dajjal, and among the many things he mentioned, was his saying, &#8220;Ad-Dajjal will come and it will be forbidden for him to pass through the entrances of Medina. He will land in some of the salty barren areas (outside) Medina; on that day the best man or one of the best men will come up to him and say, &#8216;I testify that you are the same Dajjal whose description was given to us by Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8217; Ad-Dajjal will say to the people, &#8216;If I kill this man and bring him back to life again, will you doubt my claim?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;No.&#8217; Then Ad-Dajjal will kill that man and bring him back to life. That man will say, &#8216;Now I know your reality better than before.&#8217; Ad-Dajjal will say, &#8216;I want to kill him but I cannot.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 107:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A bedouin came to the Prophet and gave a pledge of allegiance for embracing Islam. The next day he came with fever and said (to the Prophet ), &#8220;Please cancel my pledge (of embracing Islam and of emigrating to Medina).&#8221; The Prophet refused (that request) three times and said, &#8220;Medina is like a furnace, it expels out the impurities (bad persons) and selects the good ones and makes them perfect.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 108:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Thabit:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet went out for (the battle of) Uhud, some of his companions (hypocrites) returned (home). A party of the believers remarked that they would kill those (hypocrites) who had returned, but another party said that they would not kill them. So, this Divine Inspiration was revealed: &#8220;Then what is the matter with you that you are divided into two parties concerning the hypocrites.&#8221; (4.88) The Prophet said, &#8220;Medina expels the bad persons from it, as fire expels the impurities of iron.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 109:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah! Bestow on Medina twice the blessings You bestowed on Mecca.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 110:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever the Prophet returned from a journey and observed the walls of Medina, he would make his Mount go fast, and if he was on an animal (i.e. a horse), he would make it gallop because of his love for Medina.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 111:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The people of) Bani Salama intended to shift near the mosque (of the Prophet) but Allah&#8217;s Apostle disliked to see Medina vacated and said, &#8220;O the people of Bani Salama! Don&#8217;t you think that you will be rewarded for your footsteps which you take towards the mosque?&#8221; So, they stayed at their old places.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 112:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, &#8220;There is a garden from the gardens of Paradise between my house and my pulpit, and my pulpit is on my Lake Fount (Al-Kauthar).&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 113:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah&#8217;s Apostle reached Medina, Abu Bakr and Bilal became ill. When Abu Bakr&#8217;s fever got worse, he would recite (this poetic verse): &#8220;Everybody is staying alive with his People, yet Death is nearer to him than His shoe laces.&#8221; And Bilal, when his fever deserted him, would recite: &#8220;Would that I could stay overnight in A valley wherein I would be Surrounded by Idhkhir and Jalil (kinds of good-smelling grass). Would that one day I could Drink the water of the Majanna, and Would that (The two mountains) Shama and Tafil would appear to me!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah! Curse Shaiba bin Rabi&#8217;a and &#8216;Utba bin Rabi&#8217;a and Umaiya bin Khalaf as they turned us out of our land to the land of epidemics.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said, &#8220;O Allah! Make us love Medina as we love Mecca or even more than that. O Allah! Give blessings in our Sa and our Mudd (measures symbolizing food) and make the climate of Medina suitable for us, and divert its fever towards Aljuhfa.&#8221; Aisha added: When we reached Medina, it was the most unhealthy of Allah&#8217;s lands, and the valley of Bathan (the valley of Medina) used to flow with impure colored water.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 114:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Aslam from his father:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar said, O Allah! Grant me martyrdom in Your cause, and let my death be in the city of Your Apostle.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;" align="center">By the <i>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ </i>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani<br />
<span lang="EN-GB">Translated by </span>Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"><strong> The questioner:</strong> &#8216;Regarding the Hadeeth &#8216;What is between my house and my <i>Mimber</i> is a garden from the gardens of Paradise&#8217;</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Is the intent a multiplication of reward or is it for blessings?&#8217;</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Albaani </strong><i><span lang="EN-GB">-Rahimullaah- </span></i> answered:<i></i></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">The intent of this Hadeeth is not for the people to pounce and attack this place as they do nowadays and that they crowd around for the prayer in this place which the Messenger <i>-alayhi as-Sallat wa Sallam-</i> described that it is a garden from the gardens of Paradise, this Hadeeth is information of the unseen which is obligatory to believe in, that this place is a garden from the gardens of Paradise, how? I swear by Allaah I do not know how.</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">Many of the scholars say that it will be in Paradise on the Day of Judgement, that is why it is a garden from the gardens of Paradise, it is possible that this is the case and it is possible that the case is something else, we do not comprehend this Hadeeth, just like other Ahadeeth, for example:</p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" dir="RTL" style="color:#444444;text-align:center;" align="center"><span lang="AR-SA" style="color:#545454;">جبل أحد يحبنا</span><span dir="LTR" style="color:#545454;"> </span><span lang="AR-SA" style="color:#545454;">ونحبه</span></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:center;" align="center"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;Mount Uhud is a mountain which loves us and we love it.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">This does not mean that you intend that place in itself and seek blessings from it,  and pray there, no, this is just information we believe in, Mount Uhud loves us and we love it, similarly for example:</p>
<p dir="RTL" align="center"><span lang="AR-SA">أحد</span><span dir="LTR"> </span><span lang="AR-SA">ركن</span><span dir="LTR"> </span><span lang="AR-SA">من</span><span dir="LTR"> </span><span lang="AR-SA">أركان</span><span dir="LTR"> </span><span lang="AR-SA">الجنة</span></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:center;" align="center"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;Mount Uhud is a pillar from the pillars of Paradise.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">This also does not have the same meaning which we have mentioned,i.e. that you intend that place in itself, seeking blessings from it and to pray there, no, this is information of the unseen. It was authentically reported from the Messenger of Allaah <i>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </i>so we believe in this, and we do not carry this meaning to be a legislated action in the Sharia&#8217; so that we worship Allaah by that, since our righteous Salaf did not explain this, not by their speech or by their actions.&#8217;<i></i></p>
<p class="ecxMsoNormal" style="color:#444444;text-align:justify;">[Taken from: &#8216;Silsilah Huda wa Noor&#8217; tape 93 at <span dir="RTL" lang="AR-SA">00:45:06</span>]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Following is taken from Tafseer Ibn Kathir</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah encouraged His Prophet to pray in Masjid Quba&#8217; which, from the first day, was built on Taqwa, obedience to Allah and His Messenger , for gathering the word of the believers and as an outpost and a fort for Islam and its people. This is why Allah the Exalted said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Verily, the Masjid whose foundation was laid from the first day on Taqwa is more worthy that you stand therein (to pray).)</span></strong> in reference to the Masjid of Quba&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An authentic Hadith records that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(One prayer in Masjid Quba&#8217; is just like an `Umrah.)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah used to visit Masjid Quba&#8217; while riding and walking.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Other Notes:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">It is prescribed for the visitor to Madeenah and for the one who lives there to go to the Mosque of Quba’ and pray there, following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and seeking the reward of ‘Umrah. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">It was narrated that Sahl ibn Haneef said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: </span><b style="line-height:1.5em;">“</b><span style="color:#008000;"><strong><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Whoever goes out until he comes to this mosque – meaning the Mosque of Quba’ – and prays there, that will be equivalent to ‘Umrah</span></strong></span><b style="line-height:1.5em;">.”</b><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> Narrated by Ahmad, 3/437; al-Nasaa’i, 699; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in </span><i style="line-height:1.5em;">Saheeh al-Targheeb</i><span style="line-height:1.5em;">, 1180, 1181.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">In </span><em style="line-height:1.5em;">Sahih Muslim </em><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> it is narrated that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to go to the mosque of Quba’ every Saturday, walking or riding, and he would pray two rak’ahs there</span><b style="line-height:1.5em;">.</b><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1191; Muslim, 1399</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The heart of the Prophet&#8217;s masjid houses a very special but small area named <i>ar-Rawdah an-Nabawiyah</i>, which extends from Muhammad&#8217;s tomb to his pulpit. Pilgrims attempt to visit and pray in ar-Rawdah, for there is a tradition that supplications and prayers uttered here are never rejected. Entrance into <i>ar-Rawdah</i> is not always possible (especially during the Hajj season), as the tiny area can accommodate only a few hundred people. <i>Ar-Rawdah</i> has two small gateways manned by Saudi police officers. The current marble pulpit was constructed by the Ottomans. The original pulpit was much smaller than the current one, and constructed of palm tree wood, not marble. <i>Ar-Rawdah an-Nabawiyah</i> is considered part of Jannah (Heaven or Paradise).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is prescribed for the one who visits the Prophet’s Mosque to pray two rak’ahs in the Rawdah or whatever he wants of naafil prayers, because it is proven that there is virtue in doing so. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: <b>“The area between my house and my minbar is one of the gardens ( <i>riyaad</i>, sing. <i>rawdah</i>) of Paradise, and my minbar is on my cistern (<i>hawd</i>)” </b>Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1196; Muslim, 1391.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it was narrated that Yazeed ibn Abi ‘Ubayd said: <b>“I used to come with Salamah ibn al-Akwa’ and he would pray by the pillar which was by the mus-haf, i.e. in the Rawdah. I said, ‘O Abu Muslim, I see that you are keen to pray by this pillar!’ He said, ‘I saw that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was keen to pray here.’”</b> Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 502; Muslim, 509.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Being keen to pray in al-Rawdah does not justify being aggressive towards people or pushing the weak aside, or stepping over their necks. </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Women who want to pray in Rawdah area can enter the masjid through the Gates 21 &#8211; 25. Rawdah area for women is open after Fajr, Zuhr and Isha Prayers. It is open after Fajar for long time and 15 &#8211; 20 min after Zuhr prayer</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Hamad al-Ansaari</strong> (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I searched for the origin of what people say these days of al-Madina ‘al-Munawarah’ and I found that the first people to label it ‘al-Munawarah’ were the ‘Uthmaanyoon’.  As for the Companions and the Successors and those after them, then for many centuries they called it al-Madina an-Nabaweeyah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>AbdulAwal bin Hamad al-Ansaari</strong> commented:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I noticed from my father -Rahimullaah- that if he saw a person write ‘al-Munawarah’, he would say to him to wipe out the word ‘al-Munawarah’ and write ‘an-Nabaweeyah.’[28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed the people of knowledge apply the term ‘an-Nabaweeya’ to al-Madina.’[29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Applying the word ‘al-Munawarah’ after the word al-Madina was introduced by the non-Arabs.  What was well known by the Companions and the Successors was the addition ‘an-Nabaweeyah’. Likewise, adding the term ‘<strong>al-Mukkarama</strong>’ to Makkah is not known.’[30]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillah hirrahamanirraheem , Alhamdu lillahi Rabbil Aalameen</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We begin by relating to you the story of the just king Nooruddin Mahmoud zunki , May Allah’s mercy be upon him, that took place in the year 557 after hijra. He was ruling the Greater Syria area and he saw a magnificent dream, which made him go to the city of Madina. He saw Prophet Muhammad sallahu alaihi wassalam three times in one night and in every time Prophet Muhammad sallahu alaihi wassalam telling him O’ Mahmoud save me from these two individuals while pointing towards to blond individuals in front of him. So the king summoned his minister before dawn and told him about this so the minister said this is a matter which may have taken place in Madina, the Madina of Prophet Muhammad sallahu alaihi wassalam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he prepared himself and quickly hastened over 1000 mounts and horses and other than that until he entered in Madina quietly and secretly with his minster and he came to Prophet Muhammad sallahu alaihi wassalam’s masjid not knowing what to do. So the minister said do you recognize these two individuals if you see them ?. He said yes .So he summoned the people to give them charity and distributed to them plenty of gold and silver and he said that no one in Madina should stay except, known in madina should stay but rather should come to receive the charity. Only two people didn’t come to collect the Sadaqa. They remained close by the masjid from Andulisya (currently Spain), in a place which in the direction of the qibla from the side of the apartment of Prophet Muhammad sallahu alaihi wassalam close to the house of Umar Ibn Al Khattab that is where they stayed so they came or he summoned them to come for the sadqa, they refused and they said that “what we have is sufficient. We don’t accept anything”. So he stressed they should come and insisted and so they were brought. When the minister saw them, he said to him are they the same individuals? So he asked them on their condition and what brought them here .they said “we came to be close by the Prophet Muhammad sallahu alaihi wasalam” . He said you should speak the truth and repeated the question several times until <strong>they confessed that they were christians and that they were on a mission to remove the body of the Prophet Muhammad sallahu alaihi wassalam </strong>in agreement with their teams and he found that they dug a tunnel from the side of the qibla by the wall of the masjid in the direction of the Prophet Muhammad sallahu alaihi wassalam’s apartment and they collected the dust of the soil in a well inside their residence. So he beheaded them outside the masjid and returned to as shams and he commanded that the area around the Prophet Muhammad sallahu alaihi wassalam’s site of burial be dug and he commanded that lead be poured around lest some enemies or to prevent anyone from reaching Prophet Muhammad sallahu alaihi wassalam’s site of burial .</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">While mentioning what one should and should not do in the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque, and near the grave of the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alaihiwasallam), Shaikh ibn Baaz said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Similarly, those who, at the time of offering Salaam to the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alaihiwasallam) put their right hand on the left side of their chest: this posture is not lawful at the time of offering Salaam to him (salallaahu &#8216;alaihiwasallam) or to any ruler or leader, for this posture signifies one&#8217;s humility and submission which is valid in the case of Allaah alone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This point is made by Hafidh Ibn Hajar on the authority of the great &#8216;Ulama. This point will be clear to anyone who gives attention to it, provided he intends to follow the way of the righteous predecessors [salaf]. However, those who are swayed by prejudice, selfish desires and blind imitation, and those who are biased against the way of the righteous people, Allaah would decide their fate. We seek from Allaah for us and for them guidance, and preference of the truth over everything.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, those who face the Prophet&#8217;s grave at a distance and move their lips for Salaam or supplication, it also belongs to the category of bid&#8217;ah. It is not permissible for a Muslim to invent such things in Faith as they are not permitted by Allaah. By doing such things, he transgresses rather than expressing love for the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alaihiwasallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Condemning such practices, Imam Malik said that reform of the later generations will only be in the same manner as of earlier generations. It is common knowledge that what reformed the earlier generations was their observance of the way of of the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alaihiwasallam), and his Rightyly-Guided Caliphs, his companions and successors. Later generations of the Ummah too, would find the right path by adhering close to the Prophet&#8217;s way. This alone can reform them. May Allaah grant Muslims the ability to do such things which may ensure their welfare and success both in this world and the hereafter.&#8221;</p>
