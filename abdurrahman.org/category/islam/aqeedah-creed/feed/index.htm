<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Difference between Kufr and Shirk</strong></span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: A Muslim sister N. S. `A from Riyadh says: What is the difference between Kufr (disbelief) and Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship)? Please, advise. May Allah reward you!</span></strong></p>



<p><strong><span style="color:#808080;">Answer by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah):</span></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Kufr</strong> </span>is the denial and concealment of the Truth such as those who deny the obligation of Salah, Zakah, Sawm, Hajj in case of being financially and physically able, and dutifulness to one&#8217;s parents, and so on.&nbsp;It is also like those who deny the prohibition of Zina (premarital sexual intercourse and/or adultery), consuming Khamr (intoxicants), and disobeying one’s parents.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Shirk</span> </strong>is to devote the acts of worship to anything beside Allah (Exalted be He) such as those who seek the help of the dead, the absent, the Jinn, idols, the stars, and so on or those who offer sacrifices or make vows to them.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">A Kafir (disbeliever) may be called a Mushrik (one who associates others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and vice versa. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says,</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever invokes (or worships), besides Allâh, any other ilâh (god), of whom he has no proof; then his reckoning is only with his Lord. Surely! Al­Kâfirûn (the disbelievers in Allâh and in the Oneness of Allâh, polytheists, pagans, idolaters) will not be successful.</span></strong>&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Allah (may He be Praised) also says, <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily, whosoever sets up partners (in worship) with Allâh, then Allâh has forbidden Paradise to him, and the Fire will be his abode.&#8221;</span></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In Surah Fatir, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says, <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Such is Allâh, your Lord; His is the kingdom. And those, whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmîr (the thin membrane over the date­stone). If you invoke (or call upon) them, they hear not your call; and if (in case) they were to hear, they could not grant it (your request) to you. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will disown your worshipping them. And none can inform you (O Muhammad ملسو هيلع اللها ىلص) like Him Who is the All­Knower (of everything).&#8221;</span> </strong>Here, Allah (Exalted be He) names their call upon things other than Him as Shirk and in Surah Al­Mu&#8217;minun, Allah (Exalted be He) names it Kufr.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In Surah Al­Tawbah, Allah (Glorified be He) says, <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;They (the disbelievers, the Jews and the Christians) want to extinguish Allâh’s Light (with which Muhammad ملسو هيلع اللها ىلص has been sent ­ Islâmic Monotheism) with their mouths, but Allâh will not allow except that His Light should be perfected even though the Kâfirûn (disbelievers) hate (it). It is He Who has sent His Messenger (Muhammad ملسو هيلع اللها ىلص) with guidance and the religion of truth (Islâm), to make it superior over all religions even though the Mushrikûn (polytheists, pagans, idolaters, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh) hate (it).&#8221;</strong></span> Here, Allah (Exalted be He) calls the disbelievers as Kuffar and Mushriks. This indicates that a Kafir may be called a Mushrik and vise versa. There are many Ayahs and Hadith that stress the same meaning.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Verily, between a man and Shirk and Kufr is the negligence of prayer.</strong></span>&#8221; (Related by Muslim in his Sahih (authentic) book of Hadith on the authority of Jabir Ibn `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with them).He (peace be upon him) also said, &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The covenant that distinguishes between us and them (the hypocrites) is Salah. Anyone who abandons it is a Kafir.</strong></span>&#8221; (Related by Imam Ahmad, Abu Dawud, Al­Tirmidhy, Al­Nasa&#8217;y, and Ibn Majah with a Sahih chain of transmission on the authority of Buraydah ibn Al­Hasib, may Allah be pleased with him).May Allah grant us success!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allah Alone! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are repeated questions about some who claim that Allah is incarnate among His creation and mingles with them. <strong><span style="color:#993300;">They claim that</span> </strong>this is the meaning of the general Ma`iyyah (association or being with). They take as evidence the Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse): &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(O Muhammad sallallaahu alaihi wasallam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> were not on the western side</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (of the Mount)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;</span></strong> and:  &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">You were not with them, when they cast lots with their pens as to which of them should be charged with the care of Maryam </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Mary)</span>; <strong><span style="color:#008000;">nor were you with them when they disputed&#8221;</span></strong>. They claim that the two Ayahs denote that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) was not with them, but Allah was there in His Self ­Entity, as he exists everywhere.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since those people misunderstand the whole point and made a big mistake, opposing the true `Aqidah (creed) as shown in the Holy Qur&#8217;an and the Prophetic Sunnah and as adopted by the Salaf (righteous predecessors) of the Muslim nation, I think I should show the right opinion on such a false belief and what seems to be confusing about this point pertaining to Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (may He be Exalted and Glorified) can be described only with the Names and Attributes with which He has described Himself and the Names and Attributes with which His Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) described Him, which suit His Majesty without Takyif (questioning Allah&#8217;s Attributes), Tamthil (likening Allah&#8217;s Attributes to those of His Creation), Tahrif (distortion of the meaning), or Ta`til (denial of Allah&#8217;s Attributes). This is because Allah (Exalted be He) says: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him; and He is the All­ Hearer, the All­ Seer&#8221;</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As stated in the Holy Qur&#8217;an and the Prophetic Sunnah and unanimously agreed upon by the Salaf of the Muslim nation, Allah (Glorified be He) is above His creatures and is seated on His Throne in a manner that suits His Majesty, unlike the seating of His creation. Allah (Exalted be He) is among His creatures with His knowledge and nothing is concealed about them from Him. This is what has been proven by the Holy Qur&#8217;an with its rhetoric Ayahs and by the Prophetic Sunnah with its direct authentic Hadiths.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>There are many Qur&#8217;anic proofs</strong></span> that Allah exists in the heavens above His creatures and is seated on His Throne. Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">To Him ascend </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(all)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> the goodly words, and the righteous deeds exalt it (i.e. the goodly words are not accepted by Allâh unless and until they are followed by good deeds) ; </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">I will take you and raise you to Myself ; </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The angels and the Rûh</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> [Jibrîl (Gabriel)]</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> ascend to Him ; </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Then He </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Istawâ)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> rose over the Throne </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(in a manner that suits His Majesty)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">. The Most Gracious </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Allâh)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">! ; </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Allâh)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, will not cause the earth to sink with you Or do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Allâh)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, will not send against you a violent whirlwind? ; </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The Most Gracious </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Allâh)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> rose over </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Istawâ)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> the </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Mighty)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> Throne </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(in a manner that suits His Majesty)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">. and: O Hâmân! Build me a tower that I may arrive at the ways The ways of the heavens, and I may look upon the Ilâh </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(God)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> of Mûsâ </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Moses)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">: But verily, I think him to be a liar.</span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">As for the proofs from the Prophetic Sunnah</span></strong>, there are uncountable numbers of Sahih (authentic) and Hasan (good) Hadiths, such as: the Hadith about the Prophet&#8217;s Mi`raj (Ascension to the heavens) to his Lord and the Hadith about the Ruqyah (reciting Qur&#8217;an and saying supplications over the sick seeking healing) which was reported by Abu Dawud and others: &#8220;<strong>Our Lord is Allah Who is in the heaven; Holy is Your Name, Your command reigns supreme in the heaven and the earth</strong>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Hadith about the mountain goats, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;</strong></span><strong>..and the Throne is above this; Allah is above the Throne; and He knows your states</strong><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;</strong></span>. (Related by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and others)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In an authentic Hadith he (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) said to the bonds woman: &#8220;Where is Allah?&#8221; She replied: &#8220;In the heaven.&#8221; He (peace be upon him) asked her: &#8220;Who am I?&#8221; She replied: &#8220;You are the Messenger of Allah.&#8221; Then he (peace be upon him) said to her master: &#8220;Release her for she is a believer.&#8221; (Related by Muslim in his Sahih book of Hadith)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are other Hadiths that were authentically reported from the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) stating that Allah&#8217;s Messenger said that Allah is above His Throne and that He is above the heavens, as naturally known by all nations, Arabs and non­-Arabs both in the pre­Islamic period and under Islam, except those whom Satan has allured. Also, there are hundreds or thousands of statements by the Salaf on the same topic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing in the Holy Qur&#8217;an, the Prophetic Sunnah or the statements of the Salaf, neither from among the Prophet&#8217;s Companions nor those who followed their guidance or the Imams who lived in the age of allurement and difference, that opposes what has been mentioned above whether explicitly or implicitly. None of them ever said that Allah is not above the heavens, not above the Throne, not exist anywhere in His Self ­Entity, all places are the same to Him, or not exist in the world nor outside it, not permissible to use your fingers, etc. to point at Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Contrarily, it was authentically reported in the Sahih book of Hadith on the authority of Jabir Ibn `Abdullah that on concluding a famous sermon by Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) on the Day of `Arafat in the biggest gathering attended by Allah&#8217;s Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam), he said: &#8220;<strong>Haven&#8217;t I conveyed Allah&#8217;s message to you, haven&#8217;t I conveyed Allah&#8217;s message to you</strong>.&#8221; They said: &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then He (peace be upon him) raised his finger to the sky and pointed at the people and said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;</strong></span><strong>O Allah! Bear witness to this</strong>.&#8221; There are many similar Hadiths on this point.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was also discussed by Shaykh­ul ­Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and others who were well ­versed in such matters (see Al ­Fatawa, v., p. 14).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Generally, the corrupt belief adopted by the impairing <strong><span style="color:#993300;">Jahmiyyah</span> </strong>(a deviant Islamic sect denying some Attributes of Allah, claiming they are ascribed to people and cannot be ascribed to Allah) and those following them from among the people who introduced innovations to the religion is one of the most wicked and harmful beliefs. It detracts from Allah&#8217;s Majesty ­ we seek refuge in Allah from our hearts&#8217; deviation from the right path! There are many pieces of evidence of such misleading and corrupt beliefs. There can be no doubt that a sound mind and upright natural disposition deny such corrupt beliefs. Besides, there is hard legal evidence that denies such corrupt beliefs. Regarding the practice of taking the above ­mentioned Ayahs as evidence to support their corrupt belief, it is a wicked practice, as they claim that Allah was incarnate in the earth beside Mount Sinai, taking as evidence the Qur&#8217;anic Ayahs on such an event. May Allah be Glorified and High from their grave falsehood!</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those claiming Allah is incarnate among His creation do not know that Ma`iyyah is of two types; general and private.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Examples of the <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>private Ma`iyyah</strong></span> are the Ayahs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Truly, Allâh is with those who fear Him (keep their duty unto Him), and those who are Muhsinûn (good­doers)&#8221;</strong></span>. See the footenote of V.9:120). ;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Be not sad (or afraid), surely Allâh is with us&#8221;</span></strong>. and:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>I am with you both, hearing and seeing&#8221;</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are similar Ayahs on the private Ma`iyyah that Allah (Exalted be He) is with His prophets and pious believing servants through support, help, guidance and care. This is confirmed by Allah (Glorified be He) in a Qudsi Hadith related by His Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;<strong>My slave keeps on coming closer to Me through performing Nawafil (praying or doing extra deeds besides what is obligatory) until I love him, so I become his sense of hearing with which he hears; his sense of sight with which he sees; his hand with which he grips; and his leg with which he walks&#8221;</strong>. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, this does not mean that Allah becomes a servant&#8217;s extremities ­ may Allah be Glorified and High from such meaning! Conversely, it denotes that Allah becomes with a servant through support and guidance, as explained in another narration of the Qudsi Hadith mentioned above:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>With Me he hears, with Me he sees, with Me he grips, and with Me he walks</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the second narration Allah explains the meaning of His saying, &#8220;<strong>I become his sense of hearing, etc.<span style="color:#000000;">,</span></strong>&#8221; which implies Allah&#8217;s guidance to and support of His servants and protecting them from committing what displeases Him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <strong><span style="color:#993300;">general Ma`iyyah</span></strong>, it means perfect knowledge. Such a type of Ma`iyyah is mentioned in many Qur&#8217;anic Ayahs, such as:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is no Najwâ </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(secret counsel)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> of three but He is their fourth </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(with His Knowledge, while He Himself is over the Throne, over the seventh heaven)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, nor of five but He is their sixth </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(with His Knowledge)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, nor of less than that or more but He is with them </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(with His Knowledge)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> wheresoever they may be&#8221;</span></strong>. ;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He is with you (</strong>by His Knowledge)<strong> wheresoever you may be&#8221;</strong></span>. ;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Then surely, We shall narrate unto them (</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">their whole story) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">with knowledge, and indeed We have not been absent</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">Neither you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(O Muhammad sallallaahu alaihi wasallam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> do any deed nor recite any portion of the Qur’ân, ­ nor you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(mankind)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> do any deed </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(good or evil)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> but We are Witness thereof, when you are doing i</span></strong>t.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many similar Ayahs on such a type of Ma`iyyah. Allah (Glorified be He) is seated on His Throne in a manner that suits His Perfection and Majesty. Also, He is All ­Knowing of His creation and a Witness over them wherever they exist; on land or in the sea, by night or by day, at their homes or in the open desert. All are equal with regard to Allah&#8217;s Knowledge, as He surrounds them all in His Knowledge and they all are under His Sight and Hearing that He hears their speech, sees them wherever they are, and knows their secrets and private counsel.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">No doubt! They did fold up their breasts, that they may hide from Him. Surely, even when they cover themselves with their garments, He knows what they conceal and what they reveal. Verily, He is the All ­Knower of the </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(innermost secrets) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">of the breasts.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Allah (Exalted be He) says:<strong><span style="color:#008000;"> It is the same </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(to Him)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> whether any of you conceal his speech or declares it openly, whether he be hid by night or goes forth freely by day</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">that you may know that Allâh has power over all things, and that Allâh surrounds all things in </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(His)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> Knowledge. There is no god or lord but Allah</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) begins the Ayahs on general Ma`iyyah with knowledge and finishes them with knowledge so that His servants may know that Allah is All ­Knowing of their affairs, not that He is incarnate among them in their dwellings, etc. Allah is Exalted above such falsehoods.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">The falsehood that the general Ma`iyyah means that Allah is incarnate among His creation is adopted by those believing in incarnation</span>. They claim that Allah exists everywhere in His Self­ Entity and that He is Exalted above being seated on His Throne and existing in the heavens over His creation. They never exalt Him above being existent in the dirtiest places ­may Allah disgrace them all!</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Great scholars from among the Salaf fought such falsehoods such as Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, `Abdullah Ibn Al­Mubarak, Ishaq Ibn Rahawayh, Abu Hanifah Al­Nu`man and others. Similarly, scholars from among the Imams of Guidance did the same such as Shaykh­ul ­Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, the great scholar Ibn Al­Qayyim, Al­ Hafiz Ibn Kathir and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since this point has been clear, the Ayah: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">And He is with you (by His Knowledge)</span></strong> and similar Ayahs do not denote that Allah is incarnate among His creation, neither explicitly nor implicitly. The preposition &#8220;with&#8221; in these Ayahs does not mean this at all, but it only denotes Ma`iyyah and association. Such Ma`iyyah has a different meaning in each situation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As said by Abu `Umar Al­ Tallamanky (may Allah be merciful with him), Muslims from among Ahl­ul­Sunnah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim main body) unanimously agree that the meaning of the Ayah: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">And He is with you (by His Knowledge) wheresoever you may be</span></strong>. and similar Qur&#8217;anic Ayahs is that Allah is with His creation by His knowledge and that He, may He be Exalted, is established on His Throne above the heavens.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, great scholars and Imams from among the Salaf were of the opinion that Allah is established on His Throne above the heavens.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Nasr Al­Sijzy said our great Imams, such as Sufyan Al­Thawriy, Malik, Hammad Ibn Salamah, Hammad Ibn Zayd, Sufyan Ibn `Uyaynah, Al­Fudayl, Ibn Al­Mubarak, Ahmad, and Ishaq unanimously agree that Allah (Glorified be He) is established on His Throne by His Self­ Entity and everywhere by His Knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu `Umar Ibn `Abdul­Bar said: &#8220;Great scholars from among Sahabah (Prophet&#8217;s Companions) and Tabi`un (Followers, the generation after the Companions of the Prophet) known for Ta&#8217;wil (allegorical interpretation) were of the opinion that the Ta&#8217;wil of the Ayah: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There is no Najwâ (secret counsel) of three but He is their fourth</strong></span> (with His Knowledge, while He Himself is over the Throne, over the seventh heaven) is that Allah is seated on His Throne above the heavens in His Self­ Entity and that He exists everywhere by His Knowledge. It is worth mentioning that no notable scholar opposed their opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al­ Hafizh Ibn Kathir (may Allah be Merciful with him) said, &#8220;The Ayah: &#8216;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And He is with you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(by His Knowledge) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">wheresoever you may be. And Allâh is the All ­Seer of what you do&#8217;</span></strong>. means that Allah is a witness of our deeds wherever and whenever we exist; on land or in the sea, by night or by day, in our homes or in the open desert, as we are all equal with regard to Allah&#8217;s Knowledge because He surrounds us all with His Knowledge. We are all under His Sight and Hearing that He hears our talk and sees us wherever we are, and knows our secrets and private counsels. Allay (Glorified be He) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">No doubt! They did fold up their breasts, that they may hide from Him. Surely, even when they cover themselves with their garments, He knows what they conceal and what they reveal. Verily, He is the All ­Knower of the (</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">innermost secrets) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">of the breasts</span></strong>. Allah (Exalted be He) also says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">It is the same (to Him) whether any of you conceal his speech or declares it openly, whether he be hid by night or goes forth freely by day. There is no God or lord but Him</span></strong>. Regarding the Tafsir (explanation) of the Ayah quoted from Surah Al­Mujadalah in which Allah says: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is no Najwâ (secret counsel) of three he said that there are no three persons with a secret but He is their fourth (with His Knowledge, while He Himself is over the Throne, over the seventh heaven), nor of five but He is their sixth (with His Knowledge), nor of less than that or more but He is with them (with His Knowledge) wheresoever they may be&#8221;</span></strong>. that He is All­Knowing of their affairs, hearing their talk and knowing their secrets and private counsels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Allah&#8217;s messengers write down people&#8217;s private counsels though Allah is All­ Knowing of such private counsels and hears them. Allah (Glorified be He) says: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Know they not that Allâh knows their secret ideas, and their Najwa (secret counsels), and that Allâh is the All­ Knower of things unseen&#8221;</strong></span>. and: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsel? (Yes We do) and Our messengers (appointed angels in charge of mankind) are by them, to record&#8221;</span></strong>. As said, many scholars reported consensus over the meaning of this Ayah is that Allah exists among His creation by His Knowledge. There can be no doubt with regard to this point. In addition, His hearing as well as His Knowledge encompasses them. Moreover, they are under His Sight, as He (Exalted be He) is All­ Knowing of the affairs of His creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There can be no doubt that the statements of the Salaf about such a point are too many to be counted. Therefore, the belief that Allah is incarnate among His creation, the claim that Allah exists among His creation in His Self­ Entity according to the Ayah: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">And He is with you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(</span><span style="color:#008000;">by His Knowledge)</span> and that it is not permissible to point at Him are totally wrong and false as shown from the many direct proofs mentioned here and the consensus of Muslim scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consequently, it becomes clear that those who say that Allah is incarnate among His creation and those who follow them are not right at all. Rather, they ascribe to Allah what does not suit His Majesty. In addition, they give the Ayahs on Ma`iyyah explanations that are different from those given by great scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah protect us from disgrace and from ascribing to Allah that which does not suit Him, out of ignorance! We ask Allah (Glorified be He) to make us adhere to the right path, as only He is Able to do all things! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">7- The most authentic books on “Aqidah</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Q: Please guide me to the most authentic book on true Islamic Aqidah (creed)! May Allah grant you success!</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">A: The most authentic, noblest and greatest book dealing with the subject of Aqidah and other subjects is <strong>the Glorious Qur&#8217;an</strong>. It contains the most truthful speech. </span><span style="color:#000000;">No falsehood can approach it from before or behind it. It is a revelation from Allah, the All-Wise, the Praiseworthy. I advise the inquirer and all Muslims to hold fast to the Qur&#8217;an and to give it due attention by reciting it often, reflecting on its meanings and trying hard to memorize as many chapters of it as possible. It is the Greatest Book which Allah has sent down to His servants so that they may memorize it, follow its teachings and act upon it. It contains plain truths and clear guidance. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states, «<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Verily, this Qur’an guides to that which is most just and right</strong></span>» </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">He (Glorified be He) also says,« <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>it is an honourable well-fortified respected Book (because it is Allah’s Speech, and He has protected it from corruption)</strong></span>» «<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it: (it is) sent down by the All-Wise, Worthy of all praise (Allah azza wa jal)</strong></span></span>».<span style="color:#000000;"> and: «<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We have sent down to you the Book (the Qur’an) as an exposition of everything, a guidance, a mercy, and glad tidings for those who have submitted themselves (to Allah as Muslims)</span></strong>.»</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">I thus advise the inquirer to care for this Great Book, recite it frequently, ponder over its meanings, study it together with colleaques and fellows, and refer to reliable books of Tafsir (exegesis of the meanings of the Qur&#8217;an), such as the book entitled <strong>&#8220;Adwa&#8217; Al-Bayan&#8221;</strong> for Al-Baghawy, <strong>Tafsir Ibn Kathir </strong>(may Allah be merciful to them all), and the like. They may also refer to commentaries of other Mufassirs (exegetes of the Qur&#8217;an) who clarified the meanings of the Ayahs of the Qur&#8217;an, citing related Hadiths of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">I advise you my fellow brother to study the Book of Allah and to pay due concern to the <strong>Sunnah</strong> (whatever reported from the Prophet) of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), which contains guidance and light. You may refer to such books as <strong>Sahih Al-Bukhari</strong>, <strong>Sahih Muslim</strong> and the remaining four collections of Hadith (<strong>Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhi, Al-Nasa&#8217;i, and Ibn Majah</strong>). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">There are also many other books which </span><span style="color:#000000;">explain the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him), including the <strong>Muwatta&#8217; of Imam Malik</strong> (may Allah be merciful to him), the <strong>Sunan of Al-Darimi</strong> (may Allah be merciful to him), the <strong>Sahih of Ibn Khuzaymah</strong>, the <strong>Sahih of Ibn Hibban</strong>, <strong>Al-Hakim</strong> and other books which are very beneficial. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">If you have some knowledge of Hadith, you will be able to differentiate between authentic and false Hadiths cited in the books referred to above. The Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) are an exception to this. The Muslim Ummah (community) has unanimously agreed on the authenticity of all the Hadiths compiled in them. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">You are also advised to follow in the footsteps of the righteous scholars of Hadith. The Two Sahih Books of Hadith have gained the credibility of AhI-ul- Sunnah wal-Jama ‘ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream). The Muslim Ummah has also acknowledged them as authentic. Therefore, you must adhere to them tenaciously. You must also hold fast to the Book of Allah, the remaining four books of Sunan and the books we just mentioned. Scholars of Hadith have pointed out weak Hadiths and have given reasons for their weakness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">As for books on the topic of “Aqidah, they are many. One of the best books in this regard is the <strong>&#8220;Kitab Al-Tawhid&#8221; by Ibn Khuzaymah</strong>, <strong>&#8220;Kitab Al-Sunnah&#8221; by *Abdullah Ibn Ahmad Ibn Hanbal</strong>, <strong>&#8220;Minhaj Al-Sunnah&#8221;, by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah</strong>, which refutes the claims of the Mutazilites, and <strong>&#8220;Zad Al-Ma‘ad&#8221; by Ibn Al-Qayyim</strong>, knowing that the latter is very good reference in the field of “Aqidah and rulings of Shariah (Islamic Law). Other books include <strong>&#8220;Ijtima Al-Juyush Al-Islamiyyah&#8221; by Ibn Al-Qayyim</strong> which refutes the claims of innovators in religious matters, &#8220;<strong>Al-Sawa ‘iq Al-Mursalah&#8221; by Ibn Al-Qayyim</strong>, which also involves refutation of the claims of innovators in religious matters, and <strong>&#8220;Al- Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah&#8221; by Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah</strong>. This is a concise book which involves great benefit to Muslims. It is in line with the guidance of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama ‘ah, and Shaykh- ul-Islam advised all Muslims, particularly seekers of knowledge, to memorize it, as it contains clear illustration of the doctrine of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama ‘ah. Shaykh-ul-Islam also authored a book entitled <strong>&#8220;Al-Risalah Al-Hamawiyyah&#8221;</strong> which answers questions posed by the people of Hamah </span><span style="color:#000000;">concerning proper understanding of Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes, and other questions related to Aqidah. Upon visiting the people of Tadmur, he also wrote an epistle which he entiteled <strong>&#8220;Al-Risalah Al-Tadmuriyyah&#8221;.</strong> It is a great piece which clarifies sound Aqidah. There is also a book entitled &#8220;<strong>Al- Aqidah Al-Tahawiyyah&#8221; by Imam Al- Izz</strong>. It is wonderfully written. There is also another book called <strong>&#8220;Kitab Al-Tawhid&#8221; written by Shaykh-ul-Islam Muhammad Ibn Abdul-Wahhab</strong> (may Allah be merciful to him), which is a valuable book. He also wrote <strong>“At-Thatlathat Al-Usul&#8221;</strong>. He also wrote a short treatise on Aqidah. Another book called <strong>&#8220;Fat-h Al-Majid Sharh Kitab Al-Tawhid&#8221;</strong> was written by his grandson Shaykh ‘Abdul-Rahman Ibn Hasan Ibn Al-Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Abdul-Wahhab. It is a great and useful book. The book was annotated by Shaykh Sulayman Ibn ‘Abdullah Ibn Muhammad Ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhab. He titled it &#8220;<strong>Taysir Al- Aziz Al-Hamid li-Sharh Kitab Al-Tawhid</strong>&#8220;. It is also a great and useful book.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">I advise all Muslims to refer to and benefit from these and other beneficial books on the subject of Aqidah. I again stress the fact that the Qur&#8217;an is the greatest, noblest and most truthful of all books. It is the greatest remedy for those who seek healing for their souls. The Salaf (righteous predecessors) did not have any other book except the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). The Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) and the Tabi‘un (Followers, the generation after the Companions of the Prophet) had only the Glorious Qur&#8217;an and the Hadiths of the Prophet (peace be upon him), and they were sufficient for them. They contain every type of guidance. However, there is nothing wrong in referring to the books of well known and reliable scholars as has been mentioned.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">There is no harm in making use of their writings, benefiting from them or calling other people to benefit from them. Some people may not trust their own understanding of the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah, and when they refer to books written by reliable scholars and such references happen to be in conformity with their understanding, their knowledge is further enhanced and their hearts are set at ease. Allah alone grants success.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Fifteenth Event</strong></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Believers See Their Lord</strong></span></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ نَّاضِرَةٌ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهَا نَاظِرَةٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Some) faces that day will be radiant, looking at their Lord</span>. [Sūrah al-Qiyāmah, 75:22-23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To explain the verse, &#8220;<strong>faces that day</strong>&#8221; means on the last day, the Day of Resurrection. &#8220;<strong>radiant</strong>&#8221; here includes beauty because the word used in the verse comes from the Arabic word نَضَارَة (naḍārah) which means beauty. This meaning is also indicated in the statement of Allah (in which a similar form of the same word is used):</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَوَقَاهُمُ اللَّهُ شَرَّ ذَٰلِكَ الْيَوْمِ وَلَقَّاهُمْ نَضْرَةً وَسُرُورًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">So Allah will protect them from the evil of that day and give them radiance and happiness.</span> [Sūrah al-Insān, 76:11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In other words: beauty in their faces and happiness in their hearts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for &#8220;<strong>looking at their Lord</strong>&#8220;, it is real sight which occurs from the faces and by the eyes. This is different from insight that may occur within the heart (similar to the English usage, “I will look into it.”) which means thinking about or considering something. Here, however, the looking occurs from the faces and is directed toward the Lord (عزّ وجلّ) just as is explicitly indicated by &#8220;<strong>at their Lord</strong>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This noble verse means that these radiant, beautiful faces will be looking directly at their Lord (عزّ وجلّ) and, consequently, will increase in beauty. Look at how these faces were prepared, made ready to look at Allah (عزّ وجلّ) – they will have been made bright and beautiful in preparation to look upon the face of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse is a clear proof that Allah will actually be seen with actual eyes and this is the position of mainstream Muslims who follow the Sunnah (<em>Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamā’ah</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They have proven this with the same verses mentioned herein and they also learn this from the numerous statements of the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) transmitted to the companions and to their followers and so on. So these texts are explicitly clear as evidence confirming this (the believers seeing Allah in the hereafter) because they are within the book of Allah (تعالى) and the Sunnah of his messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) and they are reported by many different chains of narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So mainstream Muslims who follow the Sunnah hold the belief that the looking, the sight mentioned here, is real. It does not mean “perception” or “complete awareness” because Allah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">لَّا تُدْرِكُهُ الْأَبْصَارُ وَهُوَ يُدْرِكُ الْأَبْصَارَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Vision does not perceive him. </span>[Sūrah al-An’ām, 6:103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as knowing with one’s heart does not necessarily equate to perceiving his true reality. Allah (تعالى) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِهِ عِلْمًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">But they do not encompass him with knowledge. </span>[Sūrah ṬāHā, 20:110]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We know our Lord with our hearts yet we still do not know exactly how he is. Similarly, on the Day of Resurrection we will see our Lord with our own eyes, yet our sight will still not completely perceive him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second verse indicating that believers will see their Lord is the statement of Allah:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">عَلَى الْأَرَائِكِ يَنظُرُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">On thrones, looking. </span>[Sūrah al-Muṭaffifīn, 83:23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah did not mention in this verse specifically what they are looking at so it is general, including anything that is pleasing to look at. The greatest and most pleasing sight is to look upon Allah (تعالى) as he says in the very next verse:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">تَعْرِفُ فِي وُجُوهِهِمْ نَضْرَةَ النَّعِيمِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">You will recognize in their faces the radiance of pleasure.</span> [Sūrah al-Muṭaffifīn, 83:24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the context of the verse is similar to the first one, &#8220;faces that day will be radiant, looking at their Lord&#8221; and they will be looking at everything that pleases them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third verse regarding the believers looking at Allah is:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لِّلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُوا الْحُسْنَىٰ وَزِيَادَةٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">For those who have done good is the best (reward) and even more.</span> [Sūrah Yūnus, 10:26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for &#8220;the best&#8221;, it is Paradise and &#8220;even more&#8221; is the believers looking at the face of Allah. This is how the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) explained this verse as is confirmed in the ḥadīth recorded by Muslim and others:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا دَخَلَ أَهْلُ الْجَنَّةِ الْجَنَّةَ ، قَالَ : يَقُولُ اللَّهُ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى : تُرِيدُونَ شَيْئًا أَزِيدُكُمْ.؟ </span><span style="color:#000000;">فَيَقُولُونَ : أَلَمْ تُبَيِّضْ وُجُوهَنَا ؟ أَلَمْ تُدْخِلْنَا الْجَنَّةَ وَتُنَجِّنَا مِنْ النَّارِ ؟ قَالَ : فَيَكْشِفُ</span><span style="color:#000000;"> الْحِجَابَ فَمَا أُعْطُوا شَيْئًا أَحَبَّ إِلَيْهِمْ مِنْ النَّظَرِ إِلَى رَبِّهِمْ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">When the people of Paradise have entered Paradise, Allah (تبارك وتعالى) will ask, “Do you want me to give you something more?” They will say, “Have you not brightened our faces? Have you not already admitted us into Paradise and saved us from the fire?” He will then remove the covering and they will not have been given anything more beloved to them than looking at their Lord (عزّ وجلّ)</span> [Recorded by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After saying that, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) then recited the verse, &#8220;For those who have done good is the best (reward) and even more.&#8221; So this verse is evidence of seeing Allah as the messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) has explained, and no doubt, he is the most knowledgeable person of the Quran’s meanings. He explained that it means looking at the face of Allah and this is the &#8220;even more&#8221; reward the believers will be given in addition to the previous delights of Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, this blessing is not the same types of blessing as are well-known of Paradise. Many of the delights of Paradise are physical in nature: rivers to enjoy, physical rewards, fruits, pure spouses, etc. Then the blessings and pleasures of the heart follow. But looking at Allah is a direct delight pleasing to the heart. The people of Paradise will have never seen anything more enjoyable or satisfying than that. We ask Allah to make us those who see him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This blessing is in no way comparable to anything else, not the fruits of Paradise, its rivers, or anything else. Because of this, Allah said &#8220;For those who have done good is the best (reward) and even more.&#8221; because it is in addition to even the best rewards of Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth verse is:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَهُم مَّا يَشَاءُونَ فِيهَا وَلَدَيْنَا مَزِيدٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">There they will have all that they desire and with us is even more.</span> [Sūrah Qāf, 50:35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many scholars have explained &#8220;but with us is even more&#8221; just how the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) explained it – that it is looking at the face of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So those are the four verses the author (Ibn Taymiyyah) mentions as proof of the believers seeing Allah. There is also a fifth verse from which Imam al-Shāfi’ī deduced that the believers will see Allah. It is the statement of Allah (تعالى) about the wicked sinners:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">كَلَّا إِنَّهُمْ عَن رَّبِّهِمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ لَّمَحْجُوبُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">No! Surely, they will be veiled from (seeing) their Lord that day.</span> [Sūrah al-Muṭaffifīn, 83:15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point he makes from the verse is that since such people will be veiled from Allah due to his anger with them, then it can be understood that those with whom he is pleased will not be veiled. So if the people who gain his anger are veiled from Allah then the people who gain his pleasure will see Him (عزّ وجلّ)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This deduction of Imam al-Shāfi’ī is definitely very strong because if everyone was going to be veiled, prevented from seeing their Lord, then there would have been no reason to specifically mention only the wicked people in the verse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also believe that seeing Allah in this life is impossible. This is because the current nature and condition of humans is one that cannot bear looking at Allah (عزّ وجلّ). How could it when the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) told us about his Lord:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">حِجَابُهُ النُّورُ ، لَوْ كَشَفَهُ لأَحْرَقَتْ سُبُحَاتُ وَجْهِهِ مَا انْتَهَى إِلَيْهِ بَصَرُهُ مِنْ خَلْقِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">His veil is light. If he were to remove it, the splendor of his face would burn his creation, consuming it as far as his sight reaches.</span>[Recorded by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for seeing Allah in the hereafter, it is certainly possible because people that day will be in a different world. Their nature and condition will be different than they are in this life. And this is known from all the texts of the Quran and Sunnah that tell about how people will be, what they will experience during the events of the resurrection and of their final abode in either the home of bliss or Hell.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">About the believers seeing their Lord, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) was once with his companions on a night when the full moon was out. He looked up at the moon and said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّكُمْ سَتَرَوْنَ رَبَّكُمْ كَمَا تَرَوْنَ هَذَا الْقَمَرَ ، لا تُضَامُونَ فِي رُؤْيَتِهِ ، فَإِنْ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ أَنْ  لا تُغْلَبُوا عَلَى صَلاةٍ قَبْلَ طُلُوعِ الشَّمْسِ وَصَلاةٍ قَبْلَ غُرُوبِ الشَّمْسِ فَافْعَلُوا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">You will certainly see your Lord just as you can see this moon; you will have no trouble in seeing him. So if you can avoid missing a prayer before the sun rises and a prayer before it sets, then do so.</span> [Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The statement, “You will certainly see your Lord” is addressed to the believers. As for “just as you can see this moon,” this is a real, actual seeing because when we see the moon, it is actual sight with our eyes. The comparison here is between the sight of the moon and the sight of Allah, and it is not a comparison between the moon and Allah because there is nothing like or comparable to Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) would sometimes try to bring the meaning of what he is talking about closer to people by mentioning what they understand of perceptible things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, Abū Razīn al-‘Uqaylī, a companion of the messenger, once asked him, “Messenger of Allah, will each one of us see his Lord, individually on the Day of Resurrection? And what is a sign similar to that among his creation?” He ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم .) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَبَا رَزِينٍ ، أَلَيْسَ كُلُّكُمْ يَرَى الْقَمَرَ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ مُخْلِيًا بِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Abū Razīn, do you not each individually see the full moon?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abū Razīn answered, “Yes.” The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) then told him:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَاللَّهُ أَعْظَمُ ، فَإِنَّمَا هُوَ خَلْقٌ مِنْ خَلْقِ اللَّهِ ، فَاللَّهُ أَجَلُّ وَأَعْظَمُ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Allah is even greater. That (the moon) is only a single creation from Allah’s creation, but Allah is even more exalted and greater.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[Recorded by Imām Aḥmad (4/11) and Abū Dāwūd (no. 4731). al-Albānī said it is authentic in “Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan Abī Dāwūd” (3957)</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for “<strong>you will have no trouble in seeing him</strong>” in the earlier ḥadīth, different wordings have come in similar narrations, but the point is that no one will prevent another from seeing Allah due to crowding or anything else. Each person will see him ( (سبحانه وتعالى while he is in the utmost state of tranquility and peace.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for “<strong>So if you can avoid missing a prayer before the sun rises and a prayer before it sets, then do so</strong>,” the prayer before sunrise is Fajr, the morning prayer, and before sunset is ‘Aṣr, the afternoon prayer. ‘Aṣr is even better than Fajr because it is the middle prayer which Allah has specifically told us to safeguard after mentioning prayers in general.[167] But Fajr is better than ‘Aṣr from a different perspective in that it is the prayer that is specifically witnessed by the angels as Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَقِمِ الصَّلَاةَ لِدُلُوكِ الشَّمْسِ إِلَىٰ غَسَقِ اللَّيْلِ وَقُرْآنَ الْفَجْرِ ۖ إِنَّ قُرْآنَ الْفَجْرِ كَانَ مَشْهُودًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Keep up prayer from the declining of the sun till the darkness of night and the morning recitation; surely the morning recitation is witnessed</span>. [Sūrah al-Isrā, 17:78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There also occurs in an authentic ḥadīth:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَنْ صَلَّى الْبَرْدَيْنِ دَخَلَ الْجَنَّةَ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Whoever prayers the two cool ones will enter Paradise.</span>[Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The two cool prayers are Fajr and ‘Aṣr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What practical benefit do we gain from knowing these verses (and ḥadīth) about the believers seeing their Lord in Paradise? There is no greater effect on a person’s behavioral approach and direction in life than this. When anyone realizes that his main objective, the height of his reward is to look upon the face of his Lord, this life and everything in it then becomes almost worthless to him in comparison. Nothing else would compare or be as precious to him as reaching that moment of seeing Allah (عزّ وجلّ). It is the goal of every seeker; it is the final achievement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you know that you will one day see your Lord with your own eyes, then by Allah this life would not mean a thing to you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everything of this world is nothing in comparison because the sight of Allah’s face is the prize for which the competitors compete, the goal to which the racers race, and it is the greatest triumph of everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if you know this, will you strive to reach it or not?</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[167] This occurs in Sūrah al-Baqarah, 2:238:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">حَافِظُوا عَلَى الصَّلَوَاتِ وَالصَّلَاةِ الْوُسْطَىٰ وَقُومُوا لِلَّهِ قَانِتِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Attend constantly to prayers and (in particular) to the middle prayer, and stand up truly obedient to Allah.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Great Importance Given to the <em>’Aqeedah</em> in the Madinan Period</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  and his Companions migrated to al-Madeenah, and the Islamic state was established through the efforts of the <em>Muhaajirs</em> and the <em>Ansaar</em>, and upon the foundation of <em>tawheed</em>, then the greatest importance continued to be given to <em>tawheed</em>. The <em>Aayaat</em> of the Qur&#8217;aan continued to be sent down with it, and the directions and the orders of the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  revolved around it.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  did not suffice even with all this. Rather he used to take pledge of allegiance from the greater Companions, not to mention the others, upon it from time to time. Whenever the opportunity arose, he would take their pledge of allegiance upon it. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ إِذَا جَاءَكَ الْمُؤْمِنَاتُ يُبَايِعْنَكَ عَلَىٰ أَن لَّا يُشْرِكْنَ بِاللَّهِ شَيْئًا وَلَا يَسْرِقْنَ وَلَا يَزْنِينَ وَلَا يَقْتُلْنَ أَوْلَادَهُنَّ وَلَا يَأْتِينَ بِبُهْتَانٍ يَفْتَرِينَهُ بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِنَّ وَأَرْجُلِهِنَّ وَلَا يَعْصِينَكَ فِي مَعْرُوفٍ ۙ فَبَايِعْهُنَّ وَاسْتَغْفِرْ لَهُنَّ اللَّهَ ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<span style="color:#008000;">When the Believing women come to give you their pledge that they will not associate anything in worship with Allaah; nor steal; nor commit fornication; nor kill their children; nor attribute to their husbands children which are not theirs; nor disobey you, O Muhammad </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(</span><span style="color:#008000;">صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, in that which is good and commanded by Allaah; </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(and not wail over the dead)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, then accept their pledge and ask Allaah to forgive them. Indeed Allaah forgives those who repent to Him and is Most Merciful to them.</span>”</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]  </a>Soorah al-Mumtahinah (60):12</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though this <em>Aayah</em> is with regard to the women’s pledge, Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  also used to take pledge from the men upon its contents.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From ’Ubaadah ibn as-Saamit, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“Allaah’s Messenger (</em><em>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</em><em>) was in an assembly (of his Companions) and said, ‘Swear allegiance to me with the pledge that you will not associate anything in worship with Allaah, and that you will not steal, nor commit fornication, nor kill your children, (and upon the Aayah which was taken as a pledge from the women [60:12]). So whoever fulfills this pledge from you, then he will be rewarded by Allaah. And whoever falls into sin with any of that and is punished for it, then it is an expiation for it. And whoever falls into any of these sins and Allaah conceals his sin, then it is up to Allaah: if He wills He may forgive him, and if He wills He may punish him.’” </em><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also Ibn Katheer quotes a large number of <em>ahaadeeth</em> that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  used to take pledge from the women upon that which this <em>Aayah</em> contains.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> From these <em>ahaadeeth</em> is that of ’Aa’ishah; the <em>hadeeth </em>of Umayyah bint Ruqayqah;<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> the <em>hadeeth</em> of Umm ’Atiyyah;<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> the <em>hadeeth</em> of Salmaa bint Qays, one of the maternal aunts of the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) ;<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6)</a> and the <em>hadeeth </em>of Raa’itah bint Sufyaan al-Khuzaa’iyyah.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> Then he (i.e. Ibn Katheer) said, “<strong>And Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  used to take this pledge from the women repeatedly</strong>.” Then he quoted the <em>hadeeth</em> of Ibn ’Abbaas,<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> and other <em>ahaadeeth</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also used to take this pledge repeatedly from the men. This is indicated by the <em>hadeeth</em> of ’Ubaadah ibn as-Saamit which has preceded, and also by the <em>hadeeth</em> of ’Auf ibn Maalik al-Ashja’ee, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“We were with Allaah’s Messenger (</em><em>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</em><em>)  and numbered nine, eight or seven people, so he said, ‘Will you not give your pledge to Allaah’s Messenger?’ So we said, ‘We have already given you our pledge, O Messenger of Allaah!’ Then he said, ‘Will you not give your pledge to Allaah’s Messenger?’ So we stretched out our hands and said, ‘We will indeed give you our pledge, O Messenger of Allaah, but what will our pledge be?’ He said, ‘That you will worship Allaah and not worship anything else besides Him; the five obligatory Prayers; that you obey (and he said a word quietly); and that you do not ask the people for anything.’ So I have as a result seen some of those people, their whip would fall down from their hand (while riding) and he would not ask anyone to pick it up for him.” </em><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) He (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  used to send callers, teachers, judges and governors, to kings and tyrants, and to various areas, calling to <em>tawheed</em>. From Anas, <em>radiyallaahu ’anhu, </em>the servant of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) ,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Prophet of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  sent letters to Kisraa (Chosroes), and Caesar, and the Najaashee (Negus) and to every tyrant ruler calling them to Allaah. And this Negus was not the one whom the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  prayed Funeral Prayer for.”<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This point is shown very clearly by the text of his letter to the Caesar, and that his purpose was to call to <em>tawheed</em>. Its text is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“In the Name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Muhammad, the Slave of Allaah and His Messenger, to Hiraql, the Emperor of the Byzantines.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Peace and safety are for those who follow the Guidance. To proceed. I invite you with the call of Islaam. Accept Islaam and you will be safe, and Allaah will grant you a double reward. But if you turn your back upon it, then you will carry the burdens of the sins of your subjects.”<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said, “Whoever calls to guidance then there is for him a reward similar to the reward of those who follow him, nothing being reduced from their reward. And whoever calls to misguidance, then there is a burden of sin upon him similar to the sin of those who follow him, nothing being reduced from their sins.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O People of the Book, come to a word of justice between us, that we will single Allaah out with all worship and will not worship anything besides Him and disassociate ourselves from everything that is worshipped besides Him. Nor will we take one another as lords besides Allaah by obeying one another in that which involves disobedience to Allaah. So if they turn away, then say, ‘Bear witness that we are Muslims, submitting to Allaah and making our worship purely and sincerely for Him and not worshipping anything else besides Him.’”</strong><a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the letter reached the Caesar he sent for Aboo Sufyaan ibn Harb and some riders of Quraysh. They were at that time trading in the area of Palestine/Syria, and were within the time of the truce period agreed between Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  and the unbelievers of Quraysh. So they came to Caesar at Jerusalem and he asked Aboo Sufyaan a number of questions. From them was that he asked, “What does he (i.e. Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) ) command you?” Aboo Sufyaan said, “I replied, ‘He says, “<em>Worship Allaah alone and do not worship anything else besides Him and abandon the saying of your fathers. He orders prayer, truthfulness, chastity and joining ties of relationship</em>.”’”<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) Furthermore he used to organise armies to fight <em>Jihaad</em> in the path of Allaah in order to establish and raise high the word of <em>tawheed</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“He who fights in order that Allaah’s Word is the highest then he is the one who is fighting in the Path of Allaah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Buraydah ibn al-Husayyib, <em>radiyallaahu ’anhu</em>, who said, “When Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  appointed the chief of a raiding party or an army, he used to counsel him to have taqwaa of Allaah concerning himself and with regard to good treatment of the Muslims with him, and he said, ‘When you meet your enemy from the mushriks then call them to accept one of three things, whichever of them they agree to, then accept it and leave them alone:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) Invite them to accept Islaam. If they accept that then accept it from them, and leave them alone. Invite them in that case to leave their homes and to migrate to the land of the Muhaajirs&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) But if they refuse (to accept Islaam), then ask them to pay the <em>jizya</em> tax. If they agree to that then accept that from them and leave them alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(iii) But if they refuse then seek the aid of Allaah and fight them. And if you besiege a fortified place and they ask you to allow them to surrender upon the judgement of Allaah, then do not allow them to surrender upon that since you do not know what Allaah’s judgement concerning them is. Rather allow them to surrender in accordance with what you judge in the matter. Then decide as you wish concerning them.’”<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Like the <em>hadeeth</em> of Buraydah is the <em>hadeeth</em> of an-Nu’maan ibn Muqarrin al-Muzanee, <em>radiyallaahu</em> <em>’anhu, </em>which is indicated by Muslim, Aboo Daawood and Ibn Maajah, who all said, “’Alqamah said: I narrated it to Muqaatil ibn Hayyaan. He said: Muslim ibn Haysam narrated to me, from an-Nu&#8217;maan ibn Muqarrin from the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  with its like.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">(4) Furthermore he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  sent Mu’aadh to Yemen as a Governor, a judge and a teacher. Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said to him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“You are a going to a people from the People of the Book, so let the first thing you call them to be the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, (and in a narration: that they should single Allaah out with all worship), and I am the Messenger of Allaah. So if they obey you in that, then inform them that Allaah has made five Prayers obligatory upon them in each day and night. So if they obey you in that, then inform them that Allaah has obligated upon them a charity which is to be taken from their rich and given to their poor. If they obey you in that, then beware of taking the best parts of their wealth, and beware of the supplication of the oppressed, because there is no screen between it and Allaah.”</em><a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that he used to give this same advice to all the callers, governors and judges whom he sent out.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">(5) <em>Jihaad </em>was prescribed for the establishment of <em>tawheed</em> and to purify the earth from the scourge of <em>shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَاتِلُوهُمْ حَتَّىٰ لَا تَكُونَ فِتْنَةٌ وَيَكُونَ الدِّينُ لِلَّهِ ۖ فَإِنِ انتَهَوْا فَلَا عُدْوَانَ إِلَّا عَلَى الظَّالِمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Fight the <em>Mushriks</em> until there remains no worship of anything besides Allaah, and all worship is for Allaah alone and His religion is uppermost. So if they desist from <em>shirk</em> and enter into Islaam then let there be no transgression except those that worship others along with Allaah”</span> </strong><a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>  [Soorah al-Baqarah (2):193]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jareer (at-Tabaree),<em> rahimahullaah</em>, said in his <em>Tafseer</em> (2/194-195):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah, the Most High, says to His Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم),  Meaning: &#8220;so that there is no <em>shirk</em> with Allaah, and no one besides Him is worshipped; and worship of the idols, false gods and those set up as rivals is extinguished. And worship and obedience is for Allaah alone to the exclusion of idols and images&#8230; Qataadah said, ‘So that there is no <em>shirk</em>.’ He quotes his chain of narration with this explanation from Qataadah, Mujaahid, as-Suddee and Ibn &#8216;Abbaas. He said, ‘What is meant by <em>Deen </em>(religion) which Allaah mentions in this place is: Worship and obedience to Allaah in what He orders and forbids.’ He said, ‘With this meaning there occurs the saying of al-A’shee: He caused the (tribes of) ar-Ribaab to submit and become obedient when they hated obedience &#8211; Achieving it through continual fighting and attacks.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he quoted his chain of narration of ar-Rabee’ who said concerning,  Meaning: “Until none but Allaah is worshipped,” which is the meaning of <em>laa ilaaha illallaah</em> (none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah). That is what Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  fought for and called to.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Aboo Hurayrah, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“I have been ordered to fight the people until they say laa ilaaha illallaah (none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah). So whoever says: laa ilaaha illallaah, then his wealth and his person is safe from me, except due to any right of it, and his reckoning is with Allaah.”</em><a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also the Chief of the Believers &#8216;Umar, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>said to Aboo Bakr, the <em>Khaleefah</em> of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) , when he resolved to fight the apostates and also those with them who refused to hand over the <em>zakaat</em>, ’Umar, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>said, “How can you fight those people when Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said, ‘I have been ordered to fight the people until they testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, so whoever says this then his wealth and his person are safe from me except due to any right of it, and his reckoning is with Allaah.’” So Aboo Bakr, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>said, “By Allaah, I will fight those who seek to separate between the Prayer and the <em>zakaat</em>. Indeed the <em>Zakaat</em> is a right due upon wealth. By Allaah, were they to hold a single young goat from me which they used to pay to Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) , I would fight them for it.”<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Jaabir ibn ’Abdillaah, <em>radiyallaahu ’anhumaa, </em>who said that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“I have been ordered to fight the people until they say, ‘None has the right to be worshipped except Allaah.’ So when they say that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah then their blood and their property are safe from me except due to a right pertaining to it, and their reckoning is with Allaah.” </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he recited,<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَذَكِّرْ إِنَّمَا أَنتَ مُذَكِّرٌ  لَّسْتَ عَلَيْهِم بِمُصَيْطِرٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">Indeed We have only sent you, O Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم), as an admonisher to them. You are not to force them to believe against their will</span>.”  [Soorah al-Ghaashiyah (88):21-22] <a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>, <a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn &#8216;Umar, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhumaa, </em>who said that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“I have been ordered to fight the people until they bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah, and they establish the Prayer, and pay the zakaat. So if they do that then their blood and their wealth are safe from me except due to its right, and their reckoning is with Allaah.”</em><a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it may be noticed that the <em>ahaadeeth</em> of ’Umar, Aboo Bakr, Aboo Hurayrah and Jaabir are restricted to mentioning the matter of <em>tawheed</em> and do not mention the other matters. So perhaps the reason for this is the very great concern which the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  gave to this matter so that he would mention it to them time after time on its own, as an indication of its greatness and importance. Also because of the fact that he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  realised that they understood that all the other affairs of Islaam follow on from it, and are required by it and are from its rights, particularly the pillars of Islaam and <em>eemaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say, because of the fact that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  often used to mention only that which related to <em>‘aqeedah</em>, &#8216;Umar used this saying as an evidence. Then the reply of Aboo Bakr to support his stance, was to make a direct analogy between the <em>Zakaat</em> and the Prayer, “By Allaah, I will fight anyone who makes a difference between the Prayer and the <em>Zakaat</em>&#8230;” So if he knew the narration as it was reported by Ibn ’Umar he would have used that as a clear and decisive proof.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also if ’Umar knew of the narration as reported by his son he would not have raised any objection to the saying of Aboo Bakr. Then if those present at the time, included Aboo Hurayrah, knew the naration of Ibn ’Umar, then they would have mentioned it to the two <em>Shaykhs</em>.<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a> So perhaps the reason behind this was indeed as we have said, the great importance which the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  gave to <em>’aqeedah</em>, and his propogation of it, and the frequency with which he spoke about it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then also because the most prominent and most important aspect of the teachings which the Prophets conveyed from their Lord was <em>Tawheedul-Uloohiyyah</em> (singling out Allaah with all worship), and this was the greatest reason for strife between the Prophets and their enemies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore the most significant of the aspects of falsehood and misguidance, against which the Prophets (<em>’alayhimus-salaatu was-salaam</em>) fought, and which the <em>Mushriks</em> who denied the truth of their message furiously fought to defend, in every nation was: the worship of images and idols, and the building of tombs upon the graves of the pious and the Prophets, and veneration of them, and making offerings to them, and attachment of people’s hearts to them, both of the rulers and the ruled, an attachment of hope and fear, desiring and anticipating that they would intercede for them with Allaah, enabling the accomplishment of their wishes. This was indeed major <em>shirk</em> which will not be forgiven, so we must mention, along with that which we have already quoted whilst speaking about the methodology of the Prophets, particularly when we spoke concerning Ibraaheem, the <em>Imaam</em> of the Pious and the destroyer of the worthless idols, something about the full scale war which Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  waged against major <em>shirk</em> which was seen in his smashing the idols physically and by blocking up all the ways which Satan uses to lead his followers to worshipping them and taking them as rivals to Allaah, by using the terms ‘gods’ or <em>awliyaa</em>&#8216; (pious ones beloved to Allaah) or hiding beneath any of the misleading titles they use.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from this war which is clearly seen in the Qur&#8217;aan and was waged by the Messenger of the One Who sent the Qur&#8217;aan, is the saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَفَرَأَيْتُمُ اللَّاتَ وَالْعُزَّىٰ  وَمَنَاةَ الثَّالِثَةَ الْأُخْرَىٰ  أَلَكُمُ الذَّكَرُ وَلَهُ الْأُنثَىٰ  تِلْكَ إِذًا قِسْمَةٌ ضِيزَىٰ  إِنْ هِيَ إِلَّا أَسْمَاءٌ سَمَّيْتُمُوهَا أَنتُمْ وَآبَاؤُكُم مَّا أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ بِهَا مِن سُلْطَانٍ ۚ إِن يَتَّبِعُونَ إِلَّا الظَّنَّ وَمَا تَهْوَى الْأَنفُسُ ۖ وَلَقَدْ جَاءَهُم مِّن رَّبِّهِمُ الْهُدَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Have you seen, O <em>Mushriks</em>, (the idols:) <em>al-Laat</em>, <em>al-’Uzzaa, </em>and the other one <em>Manaat</em>, the third of them</strong></span>.<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> You prefer and love the male offspring for yourselves and then falsely attribute daughters, which is something you hate for yourselves, to Allaah. This is indeed an unjust division. Rather these idols are mere names which you <em>Mushriks</em> and your forefathers have invented. Allaah has sent down no proof for that. Rather they follow only conjecture and their own deisres, even though clear guidance has come to them from their Lord proving the futility of worshipping these idols and that worship is the right of Allaah alone.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24"><span style="color:#008000;">[24]</span></a><span style="color:#008000;"> </span>[Soorah an-Najm (53):19-23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a clear statement of contempt for the idols which they worshipped, and war against them. Also, Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ذَٰلِكَ وَمَن يُعَظِّمْ حُرُمَاتِ اللَّهِ فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّهُ عِندَ رَبِّهِ ۗ وَأُحِلَّتْ لَكُمُ الْأَنْعَامُ إِلَّا مَا يُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ ۖ فَاجْتَنِبُوا الرِّجْسَ مِنَ الْأَوْثَانِ وَاجْتَنِبُوا قَوْلَ الزُّورِ  حُنَفَاءَ لِلَّهِ غَيْرَ مُشْرِكِينَ بِهِ ۚ وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَكَأَنَّمَا خَرَّ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ فَتَخْطَفُهُ الطَّيْرُ أَوْ تَهْوِي بِهِ الرِّيحُ فِي مَكَانٍ سَحِيقٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“So shun the filth of worshipping idols and shun false speech. Worshipping Allaah alone in <em>tawheed</em> making worship purely for Him, and not worshipping anything besides Him. And whoever worships anything else along with Allaah, then he is like one who fell down from the sky and was ripped to pieces by the birds, or like one cast by the wind in a far distant place.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a> [Soorah al-Hajj (22):30-31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِنَّمَا الْخَمْرُ وَالْمَيْسِرُ وَالْأَنصَابُ وَالْأَزْلَامُ رِجْسٌ مِّنْ عَمَلِ الشَّيْطَانِ فَاجْتَنِبُوهُ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“O you who believe, intoxicants, gambling, stone altars erected for sacrifice and divining-arrows are an abomination from the handiwork of Satan. So shun all of that so that you may be successful.”</span> </strong><a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a> [ Soorah al-Maa’idah (5):90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from ’Amr ibn ’Abasah, <em>radiyallaahu ’anhu, </em>and his <em>hadeeth</em> has preceded, and in it there occurs, <em>“I said, ‘Did Allaah send you as a Messenger?’ He said, ‘Yes,’ I asked, ‘With what message did he send you?’ He replied, ‘That Allaah should be singled out and worshipped in tawheed, and that nothing should be worshipped besides Him, and to smash the idols and to join ties of relationship.’”</em><a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in the <em>hadeeth </em>of Ja’far which has preceded there occurs, “&#8230;until Allaah sent a Messenger to us from amongst us. We knew his lineage and his truthfulness and his chastity. He called us to single out Allaah in <em>tawheed</em> and to worship Him alone, and to renounce the stones and idols and whatever we and our fathers used to worship besides Him&#8230;”<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the <em>hadeeth </em>of Aboo Sufyaan and his conversation with Heraclius, the King of the Byzantines, there occurs, “He says, (i.e., the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) ), <em>‘Worship Allaah alone and do not worship anything along with Him, and renounce what the forefathers say&#8230;’”</em><a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the <em>hadeeth</em> of Aboo Umaamah, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>there occurs, <em>“Indeed Allaah sent me as a mercy for the worlds, and as a guide for the worlds, and my Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, ordered me to destroy all musical instruments and flutes, and idols and the cross, and such things from the days of Ignorance&#8230;”</em><a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the leaders of Quraysh went out of their minds in anger, unable to put up with the attack of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  against their idols, whether it was concerning the Qur&#8217;aan sent down to him, or his <em>da’wah</em> in secret, or his <em>da’wah</em> in the open. This was something about which there could be no indulgence, and it was something which had to be due to his true and sincere call.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn ’Abbaas, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhumaa,</em> who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“When Aboo Taalib became ill a group of Quraysh entered upon him, amongst them Aboo Jahl, and they said, ‘The son of your brother abuses our gods, and does such and such, and says such and such. So if only you were to send a message forbidding him.’ So he sent a message and the Prophet (</em><em>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</em><em> )   came and entered the house&#8230; Aboo Taalib said to him, ‘O son of my brother! Why is it that your people complain about you? They claim that you abuse their idols and say such and such?!’ They spoke a great deal against him, and Allaah’s Messenger (</em><em>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</em><em> )   spoke and said, ‘O Uncle! I only desire that they should say a single phrase which if they say it, then the Arabs will become obedient to them and the non-Arabs will pay the Jizyah tax to them.’ So they were very surprised at what he said and they said, ‘A single phrase? Yes, by your father, even ten.’ So they asked, ‘And what is it?’ Aboo Taalib said, ‘And which saying is it, O son of my brother?’ So he (</em><em>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</em><em> )   said, ‘None has the right to be worshipped except Allaah.’ So they stood up, shaking their clothes saying, ‘Does he declare that worship should be for a single God?! this is something bizarre.’”</em><a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from Jaabir, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Quraysh gathered together one day and said, ‘See who is the most knowledgeable of you with regard to sorcery, divining and poetry, then let him go to this man who splits our united body, causes schism between us and abuses our religion. So let him speak to him and see how best to reply to him.’ So they said, ‘We do not know anyone but ’Utbah ibn Rabee’ah.’ So they said, ‘Then it is to be you O Abul-Waleed.’ So ’Utbah went to him and said, ‘O Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) ! Are you better or ’Abdullaah?’<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a> Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  remained silent. ‘Are you better or ’Abdul-Muttalib?’<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a> Again Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  remained silent. So he said, ‘If you claim that they are better than you, then they certainly worshipped the idols which you abuse. If however you claim that you are better than them, then speak so that we may hear what you have to say. Indeed we have never seen a youngster who has boded evil for his people more so than yourself. You have split our unity and caused schism in our affair, and you have abused our religion and shamed us in front of the Arabs. It has spread amongst them that there is a sorceror within Quraysh, and a diviner within Quraysh. By Allaah we do not expect that we will have to wait for the time it takes a new-born to cry out before we will fight amongst oursleves with swords and wipe oursleves out. O man, if it is poverty that is your problem, then we will gather wealth for you until you will be the richest man of Quraysh. If it is that you have a need to marry, then choose whichever of the women of Quraysh you like and we will marry you ten of them.’ So Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said, ‘Have you finished?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ So Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">until he reached</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">حم  تَنزِيلٌ مِّنَ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ&#8230;.  فَإِنْ أَعْرَضُوا فَقُلْ أَنذَرْتُكُمْ صَاعِقَةً مِّثْلَ صَاعِقَةِ عَادٍ وَثَمُودَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“In the name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy. <em>Haa Meem</em>. This Qur&#8217;aan is the Revelation sent down by the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy &#8230;. So if these <em>mushriks</em> turn away from the proof which We have made clear to them, O Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  , then say, ‘I warn you of a terrible punishment like that which befell ’Aad and Thamood.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a>  [Soorah Fussilat (41):1-13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">’Utbah said, ‘Enough! Enough! Do you have nothing other than this?’ He said, ‘No.’ So he returned to Quraysh and they said, ‘What has occurred?’ He said, ‘I didn&#8217;t leave anything which I thought that you would wish to say except that I said it to him.’ They said, ‘Did he respond to you?’ He said, ‘No, by the one who caused the <em>Ka’bah</em> to be built, I did not understand anything which he said except that he warned you of a terrible punishment like that of ’Aad and Thamood.’ They said, ‘Woe to you, the man speaks to you in Arabic and you don&#8217;t understand what he says?!’ He said, ‘No, by Allaah, I did not understand anything that he said except for his mention of the terrible punishment.’”<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this war was fought with words and the soul, with biting attacks and belittlement and derision, by overcoming the falsehood and ignorance of the <em>Mushriks. </em>At the same time, establishing the proof against them so that whoever went to destruction did so aware of the clear proof, and those who lived did so upon the clear proof. So from the results of this war, and from the results of this clear declaration was that Allaah guided many of the Arabs from the Quraysh and from the other tribes, and from <em>Aws</em> and the <em>Khazraj</em>. Allaah granted them clear discernment and they realised the reality of <em>tawheed</em> and its status. They also knew the vileness of committing <em>shirk</em> with idols or anything else, and also, at the same time, its seriousness and evil consequences for the <em>Mushriks</em> in this world and the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these were the great and good fruits which came as a result of the <em>Jihaad</em> of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  and his Companions and their steadfastness in the field of true <em>da’wah</em> to Allaah, and their intensive striving against the idols and false objects of worship. Then when Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  took <em>tawheed</em> to a new practical level which was to physically annihilate, smash and eradicate the idols and purify the earth from them, being fully aware of their seriousness, since they are the primary source of danger for every generation of mankind since the dawn of history until the end of history, just as the leader of those upon the true and straight religion said:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols, O my Lord, they have indeed caused the misguidance of many people.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a>  [Soorah Ibraaheem (14):35-36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore the greatest Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  resolved to carry out the task of purifying the earth from idols, and to level the graves since tombs are the partner of the idols in causing the misguidance of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From ’Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  entered Makkah and there were three hundred and sixty idols erected around the <em>Ka’bah</em>. So he began striking them with a stick which he had in his hand and was saying, ‘<em>The truth has arrived and falsehood has perished. The truth has arrived and falsehood cannot begin or return</em>.’”<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  prepared an attachment to go from al-Madeenah to the tribe of Khath’am to attack Dhul-Khalasah, which they did. From Jareer ibn ’Abdullaah, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said, “There was a house<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a> called Dhul-Khalasah, or the <em>Yemeni Ka’bah</em> or the <em>Shaamee Ka’bah</em>, and the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said to me, <em>‘Will you not relieve me of Dhul-Khulasah?’</em> So I set out with a hundred and fifty riders of the Ahmas tribe. So we broke it down and killed whomever we found there. Then I came to the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  and informed him, so he made supplication for blessing for us and for the tribe of Ahmas.”<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The wording used by al-Bukhaaree, Muslim and Ahmad is, <em>“Will you not relieve me of Dhul-Khalasah?”</em> See the wording used by the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) ?! It was as if the existence of idols deprived him of sleep and disturbed him, so that he could not settle or be at ease.<a href="#_ftn79" name="_ftnref79"></a></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref23" name="_ftn23">[23]</a> <strong>Translator’s Note:</strong> <em>Al-Laat</em> had its origin in a man of the tribe of <em>Thaqeef</em> who used to mix gruel for pilgrims in the times of ignorance near to a certain rock in <em>Taa’if</em>. Then after his death the people built a tomb around the rock, upon his grave. They then worshipped this and gave it the name <em>al-Laat</em> which they invented by twisting the name of Allaah. Allaah’s Messenger (*) sent al-Mugheerah ibn Shu’bah and Aboo Sufyaan to destroy it. They did so and in its place the mosque of Taa’if was built.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <em>al-’Uzzaa</em>, then it was in the form of a tree surrounded by a curtained building in a palm grove between Taa’if and Makkah. The Quraysh used to venerate it. An-Nasaa’ee reports in his <em>Tafseer</em> (2/357 no.567) that when Allaah’s Messenger (*) conquered Makkah he sent Khaalid ibn al-Waleed to it. He found that it was built around three trees, so he cut them down and destroyed the building. He then went to the Prophet (*) and informed him, but he said, “Return for you have done nothing.” So he returned and saw the keepers of the idol fleeing into the hills saying, “O <em>&#8216;Uzzaa</em>!” So Khaalid came and found a naked female with dishevelled hair, throwing dust upon her head. So he struck her with his sword and killed her, then he returned to the Prophet (*) and informed him. So he said, “That was <em>al-’Uzzaa.</em>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <em>Manaat</em> then it was situated at <em>Mushallal,</em> near to Qudayd, between Makkah and al-Madeenah. It was venerated by various tribes in the times of ignorance. Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (*) sent ’Alee to demolish it in the year of the Conquest of Makkah. Ibn Ishaaq said in his <em>Seerah</em>, “The Arabs took other structures besides the <em>Ka’bah</em>, buildings which they worshipped and venerated just as they honoured the <em>Ka’bah</em>. These shrines had keepers and guards, and offerings would be made to them just as with the <em>Ka’bah</em>. The people would also make <em>tawaaf</em> around them and make sacrifices there&#8230;” (<em>Tafseer Ibn Katheer</em> and <em>Tayseerul-’Azeezil-Hameed</em>, (p.177)).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The <em>Dawah</em> of Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The noblest of all the Prophets and the last of them, Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdullaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم). The one sent with the greatest, most complete and most comprehensive message. The one whom Allaah sent as a mercy for the worlds, and as a bringer of good tidings and a warner, and as a Caller to Allaah with His permission, and a shining light. He did not leave anything good except that he guided his <em>ummah</em> to it and pointed it out to them, nor anything evil except that he warned them against it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">So which of the fundamentals of Islaam did this exalted Prophet begin with? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">What was the starting point for his <em>da’wah</em>? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) began with what all the Prophets began with, and started where they started in their <em>da’wah</em>: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>calling to the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of <em>tawheed</em>, and calling for all worship to be made purely and sincerely for Allaah alone</strong></span>. He began with the testification, “None has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah,” (<em>Laa ilaaha illallaah Muhammadur Rasoolullaah</em>). Can it be imagined that he or any of the other Prophets would begin with anything but this great principle, the foundation of all the divine Messages?! Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) began with this fundamental principle, so the first thing which the people heard was, &#8216;Witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah.&#8217; So the proud and haughty said.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَجَعَلَ الْآلِهَةَ إِلَٰهًا وَاحِدًا ۖ إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَشَيْءٌ عُجَابٌ  &#8211; وَانطَلَقَ الْمَلَأُ مِنْهُمْ أَنِ امْشُوا وَاصْبِرُوا عَلَىٰ آلِهَتِكُمْ ۖ إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَشَيْءٌ يُرَادُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“The unbelievers said, ‘Has he made all that is to be worshipped a single God, who alone is to be called upon and hears all invocations. This is a very curious thing which we have not heard of.’ So the leaders amongst them went off saying to one another, ‘Continue in what you are upon and persist in worshipping your idols. He only says this to gain ascendancy over us.’”  </strong></span>[Soorah Saad (38):5-6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continued calling to this lofty principle and highest goal throughout the Meccan period of his Messengership, for thirteen years. He did not become weary or languid. He patiently bore all types of harm to propagate this principle, since no religious duties or pillars of Islaam were obligated upon him, except for the Prayer which was obligated in the tenth year of Prophethood, and apart from the excellent manners of keeping ties of relationship, truthfulness and chastity which he commanded his people with. However the core of his <em>da’wah</em> and the cause of dispute and opposition to him was that great fundamental principle. So Allaah charged this noble Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) with the particular duty of establishing this great principle. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّا أَنزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ الْكِتَابَ بِالْحَقِّ فَاعْبُدِ اللَّهَ مُخْلِصًا لَّهُ الدِّينَ  &#8211; أَلَا لِلَّهِ الدِّينُ الْخَالِصُ ۚ وَالَّذِينَ اتَّخَذُوا مِن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَاءَ مَا نَعْبُدُهُمْ إِلَّا لِيُقَرِّبُونَا إِلَى اللَّهِ زُلْفَىٰ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَهُمْ فِي مَا هُمْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Indeed We have sent down the Book to you, O Muhammad, with the truth, so worship Allaah alone making all religion purely and sincerely for Him. Indeed the religion that is free of all taint of <em>shirk</em> is alone what is acceptable to Allaah. As for those who take and invoke helpers and protectors besides Allaah, then they say, ‘We only worship them so that they should intercede for us and bring us nearer to Allaah.’ Indeed Allaah will establish judgement between them regarding the matters of religion about which they dispute.”</span>  [</strong>Soorah az-Zumar (39):2-3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ إِنِّي أُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَعْبُدَ اللَّهَ مُخْلِصًا لَّهُ الدِّينَ  &#8211; وَأُمِرْتُ لِأَنْ أَكُونَ أَوَّلَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ &#8211;  قُلْ إِنِّي أَخَافُ إِنْ عَصَيْتُ رَبِّي عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ &#8211; قُلِ اللَّهَ أَعْبُدُ مُخْلِصًا لَّهُ دِينِي</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Say, O Muhammad </strong>(صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, ‘Allaah has commanded that I should worship Him alone, purely and sincerely, not associating anything with Him, and I am commanded to be the first of this nation who submits to Him as a Muslim, making all worship purely for Him.’ Say, O Muhammad, ‘I fear should I disobey my Lord in this, the torment of a great Day.’ Say, ‘It is Allaah alone that I worship, making all of my worship purely and sincerely for Him, and not worshipping anything else besides Him.’”</span></strong>[Soorah az-Zumar (39):11-14]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ إِنَّ صَلَاتِي وَنُسُكِي وَمَحْيَايَ وَمَمَاتِي لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ &#8211; لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ ۖ وَبِذَٰلِكَ أُمِرْتُ وَأَنَا أَوَّلُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Say, O Muhammad </strong>(صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, ‘Indeed my Prayer, my sacrifice, my living and my dying are all purely and solely for Allaah, Lord of all the Worlds. There is no share of any of that for other than Him. That is what My Lord ordered me, and I am the first of this nation to submit to Allaah as a Muslim.’”</span></strong>[Soorah al-An’aam (6):162-163]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also commanded him to call all of the people to fulfil and implement this principle, and to proceed upon it. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اعْبُدُوا رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ وَالَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ &#8211; الَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الْأَرْضَ فِرَاشًا وَالسَّمَاءَ بِنَاءً وَأَنزَلَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَاءً فَأَخْرَجَ بِهِ مِنَ الثَّمَرَاتِ رِزْقًا لَّكُمْ ۖ فَلَا تَجْعَلُوا لِلَّهِ أَندَادًا وَأَنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“O Mankind, single out your Lord with worship; He who created you and all those who came before you so that you may be of those who seek to avoid Allaah’s punishment and anger; those whom Allaah is pleased with. He Who has made the earth a resting place for you and has made the sky a canopy, and sent down rain from the sky, and brought out with it crops and fruits from the earth as provision for you. So do not set up rivals with Allaah in your worship whilst you know that you have no Lord besides Him.”</span>  </strong>[Soorah al-Baqarah (2):21-22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِلَٰهُكُمْ إِلَٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ ۖ لَّا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الرَّحْمَٰنُ الرَّحِيمُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“The God Who alone has the right to be worshipped is a Single God. So do not worship anything besides Him, nor associate anything in worship with Him, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.”</span>  </strong>[Soorah al-Baqarah (2):163]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنِّي رَسُولُ اللَّهِ إِلَيْكُمْ جَمِيعًا الَّذِي لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۖ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ يُحْيِي وَيُمِيتُ ۖ فَآمِنُوا بِاللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ النَّبِيِّ الْأُمِّيِّ الَّذِي يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَكَلِمَاتِهِ وَاتَّبِعُوهُ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Say, O Muhammad </strong>(صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)<strong>, to all of the people, ‘I am the Messenger of Allaah to you all. Allaah, to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and everything therein. None has the right to be worshipped but Him. He Who alone gives life and death. So affirm true faith in Allaah and in His sole right to worship, and believe in His Messenger, the Unlettered Prophet </strong>(Muhammad صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> who believes in Allaah and His Words, and follow him, so that you may be rightly guided.’”</span></strong>[Soorah al-A’raaf (7):158]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Aayaat </em>in this regard are very many, and what we have quoted is an example showing the methodology of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   in calling to <em>tawheed</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then with regard to the<em> Sunnah</em>, there are many things clearly showing that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) began his <em>da’wah</em> with <em>tawheed</em> and completed it with it, and continued calling to it from the beginning to the end, throughout his (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) ’Amr ibn ’Abasah as-Sulamee, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“During the times of Ignorance I used hold that the people were upon error and futility, and they used to worship the idols, then I heard of a man in Makkah who received revelation. So I set out upon my riding beast and came to him. At that time he was in hiding due to oppression of his people. So I behaved in a way that enabled me to gain access to him in Makkah, which I did. So I said to him, ‘What are you?’ He replied, ‘I am a Prophet.’ So I said, ‘And what is a Prophet?’ He said, ‘Allaah has sent me as a Messenger.’ So I said, ‘And what is it that He has sent you with?’ He said, ‘I have been sent to order the joining of ties of relationship, to break the idols, so that Allaah is worshipped alone and nothing at all is associated in worship along with Him.’ So I said, ‘And who is with you upon this?’ He said, ‘A free man and a slave.’ He said, ‘And at that time Aboo Bakr and Bilaal were with him from those who believed in him&#8230;’“ </em></p>
<p>[Reported by Muslim (Eng. trans. 2/395 no.1812) and Ahmad in <em>al-Musand</em> (4/112)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) When ’Amr ibn al-’Aas and ’Abdullaah ibn Rabee’ah al-Makhzoomee went to an-Najaashee, the ruler of Abyssinia, to speak to him in order to incite him against the Muslims who had emigrated to Abyssinia, they said, ‘O king, some of our foolish youths have abandoned their religion and come to your land. They have split away from their own people and have not entered your religion. Rather they have come up with an innovated religion which is not known either to us or to you&#8230;’ So the Najaashee asked the Muslims, ‘What is this religion which you have split from your people and not entered my religion or the religion of any of these nations?!’ So Ja’far ibn Abee Taalib was the one who replied, and he said to him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O king, we were a people from the people of ignorance who worshipped idols, and we ate unslaughtered meat and committed foul acts, and we cut off ties of relationship, treated our neighbours in an evil manner and the strong amongst us used to devour the weak. So we were upon that until Allaah sent a Messenger to us from amongst us. We knew his lineage, his truthfulness, his trustworthiness and his chastity. <strong>So he called us to Allaah, that we should single Him out and worship Him alone and renounce everything which we and our fathers used to worship besides Him, all stones and idols</strong>; he commanded us to speak the truth and to fulfil trusts; to join ties of relationship; to live in a good manner with our neighbours; to avoid forbidden acts and shedding blood; and he forbade us from foul acts and from falsehood; and he forbade us from unlawfully devouring the wealth of orphans and falsely accusing chaste women. <strong>He ordered us to worship Allaah alone and not to worship anything along with Him&#8230;</strong>’ He said, ‘So he told him the affairs of Islaam,’ &#8216;So we attested to his truthfulness and believed him and followed him in that which he came with. So we worshipped Allaah alone, and did not worship anything else besides Him, and we made forbidden that which He forbade us, and declared lawful that which He allowed for us. So our people became enemies to us and tortured us and tormented us to turn back from our religion to the worship of idols, and so that we should allow the filthy actions which we used to allow. So when they oppressed us, treated us cruelly and made it unbearable for us, and came between us and our religion, then we left and came to your land, and we preferred you to others and wished to live in your company, and we hoped that we would not be oppressed while with you&#8230;’” [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) Also amongst the questions which Hirqal (Heraclius) asked Aboo Sufyaan, at the time of the peace of Hudaybiyyah, about Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) was that he asked Aboo Sufyaan, “What does he command you?” So Aboo Sufyaan replied, “He says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Worship Allaah alone and do not worship anything else along with Him, and abandon what your fathers say. And he orders Prayer, charity, chastity and the joining of ties of relationship.</strong>’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Reported by al-Bukhaaree (Eng. trans. 1/7/no. 6) and it is a long <em>hadeeth]</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these <em>ahaadeeth</em> clearly show us what the <em>da’wah</em> of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  was in both the Makkan and Madinan periods.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Reported by Imaam Ahmad in his <em>Musnad</em> (1/202) and (5/290). Ahmad said, “Ya’qoob (meaning Ibraaheem ibn Sa&#8217;d az-Zuhree) narrated to us (reliable): My father narrated to us, from Muhammad ibn Ishaaq: Muhammad ibn Muslim ibn ’Ubaydillaah ibn Shihaab narrated to me: from Aboo Bakr ibn ’Abdir-Rahmaan ibn al-Haarith ibn Hishaam al-Makhzoomee:from Umm Salamah bint Abee Umayyah (meaning the Mother of the Believers, <em>radiyallaahu ’anha</em>).” It is a chain of narration that is fully <em>saheeh</em>, except for Muhammad ibn Ishaaq, but he clearly states that he heard it directly and so his narration is <em>hasan</em> (good and acceptable).</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 67 : Point 113 (Part C)</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Whoever allows anything contrary to what occurs in this book, then he is not practicing Allah’s religion and he has rejected all of it, just as if a servant were to believe in everything that Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, said, except that he doubted about a single letter, then he has rejected everything that Allah,the Most High, said and he would be disbeliever, just as the testification that ‘<span style="color:#800000;"><em>None has the right to be worshipped except Allah</em></span>’ will not be accepted from a person unless it is accompanied by true and sincere  intention  and by complete certainty.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Likewise Allah will not accept anything from the Sunnah from one who rejects a part of it. So whoever rejects anything from the Sunnah then he has rejected the whole of the Sunnah. So it is upon you to accept, leave aside contending and disputing; it is not from Allah’s religion at all. And your time, in particular, is a time of evil, so fear and be dutiful to Allah.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 66 : Point 113 (Part B)</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p>Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>.. So fear and be dutiful to Allah, O servant of Allah! And upon you is to affirm, to submit, to surrender to and to be pleased with what is contained in this book. Do not hide this book from any one from the people of the <em>Qiblah</em>. Perhaps, by means of it, Allah may bring a confused person back from his state of confusion, or  a person of innovation back from his  innovation, or one astray back from his misguidance so that he is saved through it. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>So fear and be dutiful to Allah and adhere to the original old affair. And it is what I have described to you in this book. May Allah have mercy upon a servant, and may be mercy on his parents who reads this book, distributes it, acts upon it, calls to it and uses it as a proof for it is the religion of Allah </strong></span>[1] <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>and  the religion of Allah’s Messenger (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] The Religion of Allah, as is well known, is the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (<em>sallallaahu alihi wa sallam</em>) as understood by the Pious Predecessors. As for the speech of people, everyone is correct in some things and incorrect in others, except for the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alihi wa sallam</em>).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 21 : Point 24</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And to have faith that <em>eemaan</em> is speech and action and intention and acting correctly. It increases and decreases. It increases as Allaah wishes and it can decrease until nothing remains of it.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F366690143&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/eeman-is-belief-of-the-heart-expression-upon-the-tongue-action-upon-the-limbs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-eemaan</em> in the language means <em>at-tasdeequl- jaazim</em> (definite affirmation) which is accompanied by faith and not affected by doubt. So it is said <em>aamana lahu</em> – meaning, &#8216;he believed him&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You will not believe us</strong></span><br />
(Soorah Yoosuf (12), aayah 17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: you will not believe us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And Loot believed in him</span></strong><br />
(Sooratul-`Ankaboot (29), aayah 26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He believed his paternal uncle Ibraaheem <em>`alayhis-salaatu was-salaam.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in the legislation then it is: belief of the heart and expression upon the tongue and action upon the limbs. It increases with obedience and it decreases with disobedience. It will not be <em>eemaan</em> except with these things combined.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever believes with his heart, but does not believe with his tongue, then he will not be a believer. Because Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, said with regard to the disbelievers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">We know that what they say grieves you, however they do not hold you to be a liar, but rather the wrongdoers just outwardly reject Allaah’s signs.</span></strong> (Sooratul-An`aam (6), aayah 33)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said with regard to Fir`own:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And you know that no one sent down these signs except for the Lord of the heavens and the earth.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Israa· (17), aayah 102)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Majestic and Most High, said about the disbelievers who denied His signs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they denied them outwardly but they were certain of them in themselves, doing so as a result of their wrongdoing and haughtiness.</strong></span> (Sooratun-Naml (27), aayah 14)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So believing in the heart will not suffice, as is said by the<strong> Murji·ah</strong>; and it is not <em>eemaan</em>. And likewise <em>eemaan</em> upon the tongue also will not suffice, because this is the <em>eemaan</em> of the hypocrites, the <strong>munaafiqeen</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">They (the hypocrites) say upon their tongues that which is not in their hearts</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Fat.h (48), aayah 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And having belief in the heart and speech upon the tongue, these two will not suffice also, as is said by some of the Murji·ah. This is not sufficient. There must be action upon the limbs. So the person who believes in his heart and upon his tongue, however he does not pray ever, and nor does he fast, nor does he perform the obligatory Hajj, nor does he do any action from the actions at all, this is a disbeliever. Even if he believes upon his tongue and speaks (upon his tongue) and has belief in his heart and bears witness to that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah. But however his leaving off action without any excuse, this will not make him a believer. Unless it is the case that he has left off action due to an excuse, such as a person who has been forced, or a person who forgets, or a person who is ignorant; and likewise the person who enters into Islaam and is not able to act, such that he accepts Islaam and then he dies in that condition. Then this person, his lack of action is not counted against him, because he was not able to act. And likewise the mentally handicapped; this person is not able to act. But as for the person who is able to act but he abandons it altogether, then he is not a Mu·min (not a believer).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of them add to the definition of <em>eemaan</em>, just as the author mentioned, a fourth matter: ‘<strong>following the Sunnah</strong>’. And they say <em>eemaan</em> is speech and belief and action and Sunnah, meaning, following the Sunnah, excluding by that the innovators, those who do not act upon the Sunnah, rather they only act upon newly introduced affairs. And this was mentioned by the author here in his saying, “<strong>and intention and acting correctly</strong>,” meaning acting upon the Sunnah. As for the person who does actions wrongly, acting upon innovations and false superstitions and newly introduced affairs, then he will not be a believer. [05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘And it increases through obedience.’</strong> This is from the completion of the definition, that <em>eemaan</em> increases through obedience. And this is clear in the Qur·aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And Allaah increases those who are guided in guidance</span></strong><br />
(Sooratul-Maryam (19), aayah 76)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And when His ayaahs are recited to them, it increases them in eemaan</span></strong><br />
(Sooratul-Anfaal (8), aayah 2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And so that those who believe can increase in eemaan</span></strong><br />
(Sooratul-Muddaththir (74), aayah 31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This clearly shows that <em>eemaan</em> increases through obedience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘And it decreases through sin/disobedience to Allaah’.</strong> Because something which can increase, then it can also decrease. And also there occurs in the hadeeth that the person who does not refuse an evil with his heart, then there is no <em>eemaan</em> even to the level of a mustard seed beyond that.6 So this shows that <em>eemaan</em> can become so weak that it becomes like a mustard seed. And there occurs in the authentic hadeeth that there will come out from the Fire whoever has in his heart the slightest slightest mustard seed of <em>eemaan</em>. [07] So this proves that <em>eemaan</em> can become weak, until it is just like a mustard seed. And He the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">On that day they were closer to disbelief than they were to <em>eemaan </em></span></strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), aayah 167)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With them their <em>eemaan</em> was weak, and it was closer to disbelief. So this shows that the <em>eemaan</em> can be so weak to the extent that a person can become closer to disbelief. And Allaah’s refuge is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the meaning of his saying, <strong>“and it can decrease until nothing remains of it.”</strong> It can decrease until nothing remains from it. There may remain from it the amount of a mustard seed. And this will benefit the person on the Day of Resurrection. He will exit the Fire with it. And if there does not remain even a mustard seed, then he will be from the people of the Fire, those who will remain forever in it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sharhu Sunnah : Lesson 12 : Point 09</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author Imam Barbahaaree rahimahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And know, may Allaah have mercy upon you, that there is no making analogies with regard to the Sunnah, nor reasoning with examples and desires are not to be followed regarding it. Rather it is just a case of affirming the narrations from Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam without asking how, or explaining it away and without saying, “Why is that?” or “How can that be?”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F363542144&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/there-is-no-qiyaas-analogy-in-the-matters-of-aqeedah-creed-and-belief" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Explanation </strong>(Transcription of above Audio)<strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is meant by the Sunnah here is the `aqeedah (creed and belief) because this book is on the topic of `aqeedah, and the (correct) creed is the Sunnah. And this book is called Sharhus-Sunnah, an explanation of the Sunnah (the correct creed). It is called Sunnah because the Sunnah is the (correct) path. And the `aqeedah (creed and belief) is towqeefiyyah, dependent upon text. There is no scope at all for adding anything to it. It hinges upon what occurs from Allaah and from His Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam. And whatever is contrary to what came from Allaah and His Messenger, then it is false and futile and it is misguidance. So this is the meaning of the saying of the scholars that `aqeedah is towqeefiyyah (depends upon text). Analogy does not enter into it because qiyaas (analogy) can only be in issues of fiqh. They are where analogy can enter, and they are the rulings of what is lawful and what is forbidden. As for the matters of `aqeedah, then there is no analogy in them. Rather it is just tasleem, submission, and inqiyaad, compliance, to that which came from Allaah and his Messenger without any interference. [03]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“And desires are not to be followed regarding it.”</strong> Meaning it is not to be said concerning the `aqeedah (creed and belief) “Whatever agrees to your desires can be accepted and whatever goes against your desires, you should reject it,” as is the way of the people of misguidance. And therefore they were called ahlul-ahwaa (the people of desires). He, the Most High, said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So if they do not respond to you </strong></span>[04]<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>, then know that they are just following their desires. And who is more astray, than one who follows his desires without guidance from Allaah.</strong> </span>(Sooratul-Qasas (28), aayah 50)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever does not submit to the `aqeedah (creed and belief) that is established in the Book and the Sunnah, then he is just following his desires. And therefore the people of innovations in creed and belief are called ahlul-ahwaa, the people of desires, because they are just following their desires, as occurs in the aayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And who is more astray, than one who follows his desires without guidance from Allaah.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Qasas (28), aayah 50)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“Rather it is just a case of affirming the narrations from Allaah’s Messenger sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam without asking how and without explaining it away and without saying, “Why is that?” or “How can that be?”</strong> Meaning submission to the sayings of the Messenger of Allaah sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam with regard to the Names and Attributes of Allaah and the matters of creed and belief. “Without explaining” meaning, not giving an explanation which is contrary to its correct meaning. And it is an explanation which is contrary to what the texts indicate. And this became widespread amongst the Jahmiyyah, the Mu`tazilah and the Ash`arees. Such as their claiming that what is meant by al-Yad, Allaah’s Hand, is al-Qudrah, ability. And what is meant by al-Wajh, Allaah’s Face, is ath-Thaat, His Self. And what is meant by al-Istiwaa·, Allaah’s ascending is al-Isteelaa·, Allaah’s overcoming. This is a false and futile explanation. This is not the meaning of these texts. So his saying “without explanation” means without any false explanation. As for explaining them with the meaning of making clear/explaining their correct meaning, then this is true.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[03] <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Shaykh Saalih ibn Sa`d as Suhaymee hafizahullaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“What is meant by analogy is that which texts are rejected on account of. That is prohibited in the Sunnah. Indeed it is prohibited in all of the Islaamic rulings. As for the analogy which is well known with the people of Usool (people of fundamental of fiqh) and it is joining a matter for which we do not have a text, joining it to a matter which we do have a text for, based upon a ruling in that matter built upon a reason that is common to both of them, when there is no text to be found.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for this matter here (analogy in this way) then this is a matter which is acted upon and is something which the Salaf stated. However, it is only resorted to when there is a dire need. So it is a supplementary principle and it is not a fundamental principle. It is resorted to, just in the same way that dead meat is resorted to, it is just like eating dead meat. When a text is not present or the text cannot be understood (or so on and so forth) then in that case analogy can be resorted to. And it is particular to the detailed rulings of legislation. But as for the Sunnah in general, then there is no analogy in the Sunnah. Because it is either a text from the Book of Allaah, or from the way of the Messenger, sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.”</p>

<p>[The following is the continuation of the article @ <em><a title="Permanent Link to The Call to Allah : Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/01/27/the-call-to-allah/">The Pillars which support the correct Da’wah</a></em> – Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">.. So whichever call is not <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/01/27/the-call-to-allah/"><strong>built upon these foundations</strong></a>, and whatever methodology is not from the methodology of the Messengers &#8211; then it will be frustrated and fail, and it will be toil without any benefit. The clearest proofs of this are those present day groups (<em>jamaa&#8217;aat</em>) which set out a methodology and programme for themselves and their <em>da’wah</em> which is different to the methodology of the Messengers. These groups have neglected the importance of <em>‘aqeedah</em> (correct belief and creed) &#8211; except for a very few of them &#8211; and instead call for the correction of side-issues. So one group calls for the correction of rule and politics, and demands establishment of the prescribed punishments, and that Islamic Law be applied in judging amongst the people, and this is indeed something very important, but it is not what is most important &#8211; <strong>since how can one seek to establish and apply Allaah’s Judgement upon the thief and the fornicator before seeking to establish and apply Allaah’s Judgement upon the <em>mushrik</em>, the one who attributes worship to others besides Allaah?! How can we demand that Allaah’s Judgement be applied to two men disputing about a sheep or a camel before demanding that Allaah’s Judgement be applied to those who worship idols and graves, and those who deny or hold heretical beliefs with regard to Allaah’s Names and Attributes, divesting them of their true meanings, or distorting them?! </strong>Are these people not greater criminals than those who fornicate, drink wine and steal?! Those are crimes against mankind, whereas <em>shirk</em> and denial of Allaah’s Names and Attributes are crimes against the Creator, the One free of all imperfections, and the right of the Creator has precedence over the rights of the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah says in his book, <em>al-Istiqaamah</em> (1/466): “<span style="color:#ff0000;">So these sins along with correct <em>tawheed </em>are better than corrupted <em>tawheed</em> in the absence of these sins</span>.”[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then another <em>jamaa&#8217;ah</em> affiliates itself with <em>da’wah</em>, except that its methodology is also at variance with the methodology of the Messengers. They give no importance to correct <em>‘aqeedah</em>, rather they give importance to worshipping and practising some <em>dhikr </em>(remembrance of Allaah) in the way of the <em>Sufis</em>.[2]They concentrate upon going out (<em>khurooj</em>) and touring the lands, and what is important to them is that they manage to attract the people to join them, without caring about their beliefs and creed (<em>‘aqeedah</em>). All of these are innovated ways, taking as their starting point matters which were justify until last in the call of the Messengers. This is just like the case of one who seeks to cure a body whose head has been cut off, since the place of <em>‘aqeedah</em> in the religion is like the head with regard to the body. So it is necessary for these groups to correct their concepts and understanding by referring back to the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em> in order to know the methodology of the Messengers in calling to Allaah. For indeed Allaah, the One free of all imperfections, informed that correct rule and sovereignty, which is the central part of the call of the former <em>Jamaa&#8217;ah</em> whom we mentioned, cannot be achieved except after correcting <em>‘aqeedah</em> such that all worship is for Allaah alone, and worship of everything else is abandoned. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Allaah has promised those who truly believe (have true <em>eemaan</em>) amongst you, and act in obedience to Allaah and His Messenger, that He will grant them rulership upon the earth just as He granted it to those before them, and that He will establish their religion for them, grant them authority to practise the religion which He chose for them and ordered. And He will certainly change their situation to one of security, after their fear, providing that they worship and obey Me, not associating anything else in worship with Me. Then whoever rejects this favour by disobedience to their Lord, then they are the rebellious transgressors.”</strong>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these people wish to establish the Islamic State before purifying the lands of idolatrous beliefs which take shape in the worship of the dead, and devotion to tombs, such as is no different to the worship of al-Laat, al-’Uzzaa and the third of them <em>Manaat</em>,[4] rather it is worse. So they are attempting that which is impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed establishment and application of the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> and the prescribed punishments; establishment of the Islamic State; avoidance of whatever is prohibited; and achievement of whatever is obligatory &#8211; all of these things are from the rights of <em>tawheed</em>, and matters which perfect it and follow on from it. So how can we give attention to that which is subsidiary whilst neglecting that which is of primary importance?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is my view that the fact that these groups are at variance with the methodology of the Messengers in calling to Allaah is a result of their ignorance of this methodology, and the ignorant person is not suitable to be a caller, since one of the most important conditions for <em>da’wah</em> is knowledge, as Allaah, the Most High, says about His Prophet,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Say, Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  , this is my way, I call to Allaah (i.e. to the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, alone, with no partner) upon certain knowledge &#8211; I, and those who follow me. I declare Allaah free and far removed from all that they associate as partners with Him, and I am free of those who worship anything else along with Him.”</strong>[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So one of the most important qualifications for a caller (<em>daa&#8217;ee</em>) is knowledge.[6] Then we see that these groups (<em>Jamaa&#8217;aat</em>) which attribute themselves to <em>da’wah</em> are at variance with each other. Each group lays down a programme different to the programme of the others and follows a different methodology to it. This is the inevitable consequence of contradicting the methodology of the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , since the way and methodology of the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   is a single way, containing no division, nor divergence, as Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Say, Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  , this is my way, I call to Allaah (i.e. to the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, alone, with no partner) upon certain knowledge &#8211; I, and those who follow me.”</strong>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the followers of the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   are upon this single way and are not divided and split. Rather those who contradict this way are the ones who divide amongst themselves, as Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“This is my Straight Path, so follow it, and do not follow any of the other paths, for they will split you and take you away from that way which He prescribed for you.”</strong>[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So because these groups (<em>Jamaa&#8217;aat</em>) are a threat to Islaam which may obstruct it, or prevent people from entering into it, then this is something which must be properly explained, and it must be made clear that this is something which is not from Islaam at all. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Those who divide up the true religion and break up into sects and parties, you, O Muhammad, have nothing to do with them.”</strong>[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So since explanation of this is obligatory and it is binding to make it clear, a group of scholars having sincere concern for Islaam and the required level of knowledge and research took on the task of indicating the mistakes of these groups and explaining where they are at variance in <em>da’wah</em> with the methodology of the Prophets, so that they may return to what is correct. Indeed the truth is that which the Muslim always seeks, and so that those who do not realise their errors may not be beguiled by them. So from these scholars who took on this great duty of acting upon the saying of the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , <em>“The religion is sincerity/sincere advice, the religion is sincerity/sincere advice, the religion is sincerity/sincere advice.” We said, “To whom, O Messenger of Allaah?” He said, “To Allaah, and to His Book, and to His Messenger, and to the rulers of the Muslims and their common folk,”</em> &#8211; from those who explained this matter and gave sincere advice about it is the noble Shaykh, Dr. Rabee’ ibn Haadee al-Madkhalee in his book entitled, &#8216;The Methodology of the Prophets in Calling to Allaah, That is the Way of Wisdom and Intelligence.&#8217; For he explains, may Allaah grant him success and reward him with good, the Methodology of the Messengers in calling to Allaah, as it is shown in the Book of Allaah and the <em>Sunnah </em>of His Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  . He presents the methodologies of the variant groups in the light of this in order to clearly show the difference between the methodology of the Messengers and these differing and contrasting methodologies which are at variance with it. He discusses these methodologies in the scholarly way and in a just way, whilst quoting examples and witnesses to what he says. So his book, and all praise and thanks are for Allaah, accomplishes the goal, and is fully sufficient for those who desire the truth, and is a proof upon those who are stubborn and obstinate in opposing what is correct.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we ask Allaah to reward him for his work, and to cause it to be of benefit, and may Allaah send praise and blessings of peace upon Muhammad, his family and true followers, and His Companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] The proof for this is the Saying of Allaah, the Most High, <strong>“Allaah does not forgive that partners should be set up with Him in worship, but He forgives whatever is lesser than that to whom He pleases.”</strong> [Soorah an-Nisaa (4):48]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Soorah Yoosuf (12):108.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] But some of those who claim to be callers to Islaam, if you were to ask them, “What is Islaam?” “What are the things which negate Islaam?” Then they would not be able to give a correct answer, so how can it be permissible for such a person to be a caller (<em>daa&#8217;ee</em>)?!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>.. So I am amazed at the situation of many callers today who see the manifestation of <em>shirk </em>in front of their eyes, yet it does not cause them any concern whatsoever and they do not give any attention to it. Indeed what is even worse is that they complain about those who criticise it and who feel pained by this evil state of affairs which remains from the days of ignorance.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">.. intellect, wisdom and the natural way therefore necessitates that the starting point is to wage war against the danger of <em>shirk</em>, and that the call of the Prophets and their followers should continue fighting it for as long as anything of it remains, or any form or manifestation of it continues. So if a nation is afflicted by matters damaging to its <em>‘aqeedah</em>, and <em>shirk</em> which destroys its <em>‘aqeedah</em>, and also is beset by economic and political problems, then where is wise treatment of the problems to begin?! As for the Prophets, then they did not begin except with applying their full efforts to treating problems facing <em>‘aqeedah</em>. Then beginning by seeking to treat the most dangerous problem is a matter about which all humans with intellect agree upon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So, for example, if a person with intellect saw a snake and an ant moving towards a person, then his intellect would lead him to hasten to repel or kill the snake due to the greater danger which it poses to a person. It is not possible that he would divert his attention to the ant, nor even to a thousand such ants. Also if a number of people possessing intellect saw that a fierce lion and a number of rats attacked them all at once, then they would all strive together to prevent the attack of the lion and they would forget all the rats, even if a group of frogs came with them. And if a group of travellers came to a point where they had no choice but to take one of two roads: the first passed by volcanoes which were emitting flames and fire, and flinging out rocks and boulders. Then the second road passed through areas of thorny bushes, and sun-baked ground and was subject to the heat of the sun. Then anyone with intellect would not choose except to take the second road.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So now let us think about the most severe problems and ills. I mean the problems in political affairs, social affairs and economic affairs, and the worst of these is corruption in matters relating to rulership and judgement. Then let us weigh this against corruption in matters of <em>‘aqeedah</em>. So are these two things equal in weight with Allaah and with the Prophets, or is it the case that one is more severe, dangerous and worse in its consequences?!! So in the scale of Allaah and the scale of the Prophets the most dangerous of these two, and the one which has the greater demand for attention throughout the ages, and with all the Messengers, is <em>shirk</em> and its manifestations, whose evil and corruption cannot be matched by any other evil no matter how great. So upon this we repeat and say, “<span style="color:#ff0000;">All of the Prophets began with correction of matters of <em>‘aqeedah</em>, and by waging war upon <em>shirk</em> and its manifestations</span>,” and this is what is demanded by wisdom and intellect and that is due to the following reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">Firstly</span>,</strong> that corruption relating to matters of the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of the people: <em>shirk</em>, false superstitions and beliefs, and the various types of misguidance, is thousands of times more dangerous than the corruption resulting from the corruption in rulership and other affairs. Indeed if we do not say and firmly believe this then we have without knowing it discredited and belittled the Messengers, and we seek Allaah’s refuge from misguidance. Indeed this corruption encompasses the ruler and the ruled. So the rulers themselves in every time and place, except for the Believers from them, humble themselves to the idols, false-gods and tombs. They construct them, protect them, worship them and present offerings to them. They firmly believe that they have some supernatural power over and above their own authority. So they hold that these things cause harm and benefit for them due to the unseen power and authority which they think they possess, or at the very least they think they can intercede with Allaah in order for their problems to be reduced. The clearest example of the submission of the rulers to the idols is the example of the despot who claimed divinity, the Pharaoh, who said, boasting:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“I am your Lord, the Most High.”</strong>[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“I know of no other god for you besides me.”</strong>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since the leaders of his people said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Will you leave Moosaa and his people to cause mischief in the land when they have abandoned worship of you and worship of your gods?”</strong>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also Namrood, the king of the Chaldeans who claimed lordship for himself. When Ibraaheem, <em>‘alayhis-salaam, </em>broke the idols, Namrood sought to burn Ibraaheem to take revenge for these idols, because they were the gods which he worshipped. Likewise the kings of India and Persia worship idols and worship fire. The kings of Rome in the past and the present-day rulers of Europe and America worship the cross and worship images. And how many of the past and present-day rulers of the Muslims are afflicted by the trial caused by the dead, so that they build tombs over them, and their hearts are attached to them in love, hope and fear. They fall into that which Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) feared for his <em>ummah</em> and which he warned against. So the seriousness and the soundness of the methodology will therefore be clear to you, and also the importance of the firm stance taken by the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) with regard to idols and tombs. Furthermore the wisdom of Ibraaheem will become clear to you, and the depth of his thinking and its extent when he made the enduring call which resounds in all corners and in every generation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And keep me and my sons far removed from worshipping the idols. O my Lord, they have caused the misguidance of many of the people. So whoever follows me in what I am upon (<em>eemaan</em> in Allaah, making worship purely for Allaah and disassociation from the worship of idols) then he is from my people (upon my way and religion), and whoever disobeys me, then indeed You are the Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.”</strong>[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So you see Ibraaheem, who was fully upon the truth and the right way, seeking Allaah’s refuge from the evils and danger of the idols, and not seeking His refuge from the evils and danger of the rulers, despite the level of their corruption and their danger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">Secondly</span>,</strong> the people were upon a single religion (Islaam), upon guidance, but then they diverged from it, so Allaah sent the Prophets as bringers of good tidings of reward for the obedient Believers, and warners of Allaah’s punishment for the disobedient unbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“We do not send Our Mesengers except with good news for the obedient that Paradise and success on the Day of Resurrection is the reward for obedience to Me, and with a warning for those who disobey and reject My commands that We will punish them, so that they may die aware of that. So whoever believes the Messengers and acts righteously in this world by following what they are upon then there will be no fear upon them when they meet their Lord, nor will they grieve about what they justify behind in the world.”</strong>[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Messengers who were sent with the good news of Allaah’s reward for those who obey Allaah, do as He commands and believe in His Messengers, and warners of Allaah’s punishment for those who disobey Allaah, contravene His commands and disbelieve in His Messengers, so that those who disbelieve in Allaah and worship others besides Him may have no excuse to avoid punishment after the sending of the Messengers.”</strong>[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Mesenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said, <em>“There is no one to whom granting excuse is more beloved than Allaah, therefore He sent the bringers of good-tidings and the warners.”</em>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“So are the Messengers charged with anything but to clearly convey the Message?”</strong>[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The Messenger’s duty is but to clearly convey the Message.”</strong>[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“So if you deny Our Messenger, O people, and reject his command for you to worship your Lord and to free yourselves from the worship of idols, then nations before you denied their Messengers who called them to the truth, so Allaah sent His punishment upon them and will do the same with you. The Messenger&#8217;s duty is but to clearly convey the Message.”</strong>[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this duty of warning and bringing good tidings and conveying the Message is a very exalted, sublime and lofty duty. It is enough in this regard that it was the duty of the Prophets and fully concorded with their lofty station, since it the hardest and the greatest task taken up by mankind. It was then taken up by their inheritors from the true and sincere callers who follow their methodolgy, therefore Allaah’s Mesenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said, <em>“The people who are most severely tried are the Prophets, then those most like them, then those most like them.”</em> We have also already mentioned the extent of the difficulties faced by the caller to <em>tawheed</em> and that others are unable to persevere in this sphere.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">Thirldy</span>,</strong> Allaah, the One free of all imperfections, and the Most High, did not start by commanding and making it a duty upon them, as is seen from the stories of their lives, that they should establish states and cause the downfall of others, and this is perfect wisdom since the call to establish a state attracts the seekers of this world, and those who seek after self-elevation and positions of power, and those who have personal goals and grudges, and aspirations and ambitions.[11] So these types of people quickly respond to the call to establish a state which they think will enable them to attain their goals, their desires and their ambitions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to the like of these considerations, and Allaah knows best, and due to other reasons known by Allaah, the Creator, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, the calls of the Prophets and their methodologies were far removed from using these flashy and attractive slogans or those which clearly appeal to short-term ambitions and desires. Rather they followed a methodology which is wise, unblemished and noble. It involves being tried and tested. So they are followed upon this way and believed in by every true and sincere person free of selfish ambitions and personal goals. Such a person does not desire through his <em>eemaan</em>, his <em>tawheed</em> and his obedience to Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) except Paradise and the Pleasure of his Lord. He does not fear except from His Anger and His severe punishment. Therefore they are only followed generally by the poor, the needy and the weak. Allaah, the Most High, says, quoting what the people of Nooh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“They said, ‘Are we to believe in you, O Nooh, and affirm what you call us to, when it is only the lowly people who follow you?’”</strong>[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said concerning the people of Saalih:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The heads of the people who haughtily rejected Faith said to those who they held to be lowly, to those who believed in and followed Saalih and what he came with, ‘Do you really know that Saalih is one sent by Allaah?’ They said, ‘We indeed attest and believe in the truth and guidance which Allaah has sent him with.’ The haughty ones said, ‘We deny and disbelieve that which you believe in.’”</strong>[13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also amongst the questions which Heraclius asked Aboo Sufyaan was, “Is it the noble of the people who follow him or the weak amongst them?” Aboo Sufyaan replied, “Rather it is the weak amongst them.” So Heraclius said, “I asked you ‘Is it the noble of the people who follow him or the weak amongst them,’ and you mentioned that it is the weak amongst them, and it is they who are the followers of the Mesengers.” So the call to establish a state is far far easier, and people respond more quickly to it since most people are seekers after this world and followers of desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also because of the reasons, the consequences and the difficulties in the way of the calls of the Messengers we find that they are not followed except by a small number of people. So Nooh remained, for nine hundred and fifty years,[14] calling to Allaah, yet despite this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“None but a few believed along with him.”</strong>[15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn &#8216;Abbaas, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhumaa, </em>who said, <em>“Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said, ‘The nations were presented before me, and I saw a Prophet and with him was a small group of people, and I saw a Prophet along with one man or two men, and a Prophet accompanied by nobody. Then I saw a huge crowd of people and I thought that they were my ummah. So it was said to me, “This is Moosaa and his people. But rather look to the horizon.” So I looked and saw a huge crowd, so it was said to me, “This is your ummah, and from them are seventy thousand who will enter Paradise without any reckoning.”’”</em>[16]<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Ibraaheem, the chosen and beloved Friend of Allaah, who refuted and silenced the <em>mushriks </em>with irrefutable and clear proofs. Allaah says regarding him and those who believed along with him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“So Loot belived in him and attested to the truth of what he came with, and Ibraaheem said, ‘Indeed I will emigrate (to the land of <em>Shaam</em>) for the sake of my Lord. Indeed He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.’”</strong>[17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to Loot and those who were saved from the punishment along with him, and perhaps they were his daughters alone:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“So We brought out those who were Believers from the town, and We did not find there except a single household of Muslims.”</strong>[18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But none of this diminishes the rank of the Prophets by the slightest degree, rather they are upon the highest rank and are the noblest and most distinguished of the people and the most honourable. They stand above all the people in manhood, bravery, excellence of language and eloquence, and in their clarity of explanation, their sincerity and sacrifice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They also established their duty of calling to <em>tawheed</em>, propagating the Message, giving the good tidings and the warnings, and they fulfilled this in the most complete manner. So the fact that they had few followers or some of them had no followers, is purely the fault of the nations which refused to accept the call since, in their view, they did not satisfy their lowly goals. Then it may be that they respond to his call, or a large number of them do so, and so they gain a state, as a goodly fruit due to their <em>eemaan</em>, their affirmation of what the Prophet came with, and their righteous actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They thus establish the obligation upon them of fighting <em>Jihaad</em> to raise up the Word of Allaah, and of following and applying the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> and the prescribed punishments and other matters prescrbed for them by Allaah. This is what happened with our Prophet Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) and his noble Companions. Allaah crowned their <em>eemaan</em>, their righteous actions, and their exemplary perseverance when facing the harm and oppression of the <em>mushriks</em>, by aiding them and making their <em>Deen</em> uppermost, and by establishing them upon the earth as Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Allaah has promised those who truly believe (have true <em>eemaan</em>) amongst you, and act in obedience to Allaah and His Messenger, that He will grant them rulership upon the earth just as He granted it to those before them, and that He will establish their religion for them grant them authority to practice the religion which He chose for them and ordered. And He will certainly change their situation to one of security, after their fear, providing that they worship and obey Me, not associating anything else in worship with Me.”</strong>[19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then sovereignty was offered to Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) in Makkah but he refused and he continued calling to <em>tawheed</em> and waging war against <em>shirk</em> and the idols. So when Quraysh became troubled by the call of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) they sent ’Utbah ibn Rabee’ah and he came to Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) and said, “O son of my brother, you know the excellence you hold amongst us with regard to your position in the tribe and your lineage, but you have brought a matter which is very serious for your people. Because of it you have split their united body, caused their youth to behave foolishly and you have abused their idols with it, and their religion. You have also declared their fore-fathers to be infidels because of it. So listen to me and I will offer you some things which you may consider, and hopefully some of them will be acceptable to you.” So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said, “Speak, O Abul-Waleed, I will listen.” He said, “O son of my brother, if what you desire by this matter that you have come with is wealth, then we will gather wealth for you from our wealth until you are one of the richest of us. <strong>And if you wish by it for high position, then we will give you such authority that we will not do anything without your approval, and if you wish by it for sovereignty, then we will make you sovereign over us.</strong> But if it is the case that what comes to you is a demon which you see and cannot get rid of, then we will seek after a medical cure for you and will expend our money until we can get you cured of it. Since a demon may take hold of a person until he is cured and relieved of it,” or as he said. Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) was listening to him, then he said, “Have you finished, O Abul-Waleed?” He said, “Yes.” He said, “Then listen to me.” He said, “I will do so.” He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“In the name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy. <em>Haa Meem</em>. This Qur&#8217;aan is the Revelation sent down by the Most Merciful, the Bestwoer of Mercy. A Book whose <em>Aayaat</em> are made clear, a recital in pure Arabic for those who know (the pure Arabic language), bringing them good tidings of Paradise if they believe in it and act upon it, and as a warning to those who disbelieve in it and do not act in obedience to Allaah, that they will receive punishment and dwell forever in Hell in the Hereafter. But most of them turn away haughtily and refuse to listen to it.”</strong>[20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) continued reciting it to him. When ’Utbah heard it he remained silent and sat with his hands behind his back, resting upon them and listening. So when Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) came to the <em>Aayah</em> of prostration in it he prostrated and then said, “You have heard what you have heard O Abul-Waleed, so now it is up to you&#8230;” So ’Utbah went back to Quraysh and when he sat with them they said, “What has happened with you, O Abul-Waleed?” He said, “What happened is that I heard the like of which, by Allaah, I have never heard. By Allaah, it is not sorcery, nor poetry, nor divining. O Quraysh, obey me and let the decision be mine. Leave the man and let him continue in what he is upon. Keep away from him since, by Allaah, his saying which I heard will come to have great importance. So if the (other) Arabs kill him, then you will be rid of him due to the action of others, and if he conquers the Arabs, then his sovereignty is your sovereignty, his power is your power and you will be the ones fortunate with regard to him.” They said, “By Allaah, he has performed magic upon you with his tongue, O Abul-Waleed.” He said, “This is my opinion with regard to him, you may do whatever you see fit.”[21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Ishaaq reports with his chain of narration to Ibn ’Abbaas that a group of Quraysh gathered and made an offer close to the offer made by ’Utbah and his saying to Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) . So he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) answered them by saying, “I am not afflicted by what you say. I have not come with that which I have come with seeking your wealth, nor seeking status above you, nor sovereignty over you, but rather Allaah has sent me as a Messenger to you, and has sent down a Book to me, and has ordered me to be a bringer of good tidings and a warner to you. So I have conveyed to you the revealed Messages from my Lord, and I have sincerely advised you. So if you accept what I have brought to you then you will have your share in this world and the Hereafter. But if you refuse to accept it from me then I will patiently await Allaah’s Order, until Allaah judges between me and you&#8230;”[22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) rejected the request of one of the tribes that they should be in charge of the affairs after his death, if the report is authentic. Ibn Ishaaq said that az-Zuhree narrated to me that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) came to Banoo ’Aamir ibn Sa’sa’ah and called them to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and presented himself to them. So a man from them called Bayharah ibn Firaas said, “By Allaah, if I were to take hold of this young man from Quraysh I would devour the Arabs with him,” then he said, “If we give you our pledge of allegiance upon your affair, then Allaah gives you victory over those who oppose you, then will we be in authority after you?” He said, “The affair is for Allaah, He places authority wherever He wills.” So he said to him, “Are we to risk our necks before the Arabs for you, then when Allaah grants you victory, authority will be for other than us?! We have no need of your affair.” So they rejected him.[23]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">And we have <em>eemaan</em> in the Preserved Tablet (<em>Al-Law<u>h</u></em>) and in the Pen (<em>Al-Qalam</em>), and in everything which has been inscribed in it.</span></p>

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Explanation – Point [105]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This follows on from what preceded from the speech about Pre-ordainment and Pre-decree. And it has already preceded that from the levels of having <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in Pre-ordainment and Pre-decree is having <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in whatever He wrote in <em>Al-Law<u>h</u> Al-Ma<u>h</u>foo<u>z</u></em> (the Inscribed or Preserved Tablet).  And that is, that Allaah created the creation and the first thing that He created was the Pen (<em>Qalam</em>) and He said to it, “Write!” So it replied, “What should I write?” So He said, “Write whatever is going to happen until the Day of Resurrection.” So the Pen wrote down, by the command of Allaah for it to write down, whatever was going to happen until the Day of Resurrection, as occurs in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And no one knows how the Preserved Tablet (<em>Al-Law<u>h</u></em>) is, and how the Pen is, except Allaah. And they are two created things from the things which Allaah the Mighty and Majestic has created; we have <em>eemaan</em> in that. And so, therefore, the author said: <strong>“We have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in the Preserved Record and in the Pen, and in whatever has been inscribed in it.” </strong>Meaning: <em>Al-Law<u>h</u> Al-Mahfoo<u>z</u></em> (The Preserved Tablet) and the writing that is in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is the second level from the levels of <em>eemaan</em> in Pre-ordainment and Pre-decree, and it is: <em>eemaan</em> in the writing in the Preserved Tablet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [105][2]<span style="font-size:13.3333px;">[3]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] This is a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Aboo Daawood and At-Tirmi<u>dh</u>ee and Aboo Ya`laa from the statement of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, and it is also reported by Al-Bayhaqee as a statement of the Companion, which carries the ruling of being from the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. It was declared <em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Translator’s Side Point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Mu<u>h</u>ammad ibn `Abdul `Azeez ibn Manee`, made a note on this point: <strong>We have eemaan in the Preserved Tablet</strong>; he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah, the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Indeed, it is a Praiseworthy Qur·aan contained in a Preserved Tablet.<br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Burooj (85), <em>aayaat </em>21-22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the Noble Qur·aan is written down in the Preserved Tablet, just as Allaah, the Perfect, mentioned. And Jibreel <em>`alayhis-salaam</em> heard it from Allaah and conveyed it to our Prophet Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em>`alayhi<u>s</u> <u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>. So it was sent down from your Lord in truth, and He did not say ‘from the Preserved Tablet’. And there is no contradiction between its being in the Preserved Tablet and between its being sent down from Allaah, as was clarified by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah. And <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>ul-Islaam said also, that the Preserved Tablet is above the heavens and there occurs in a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> that no one looks into it except Allaah, the Mighty and the Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: So this shows the misguidance of those who state that the soul of a person can see what is contained in the Preserved Tablet. This is just a statement from the philosophers and from the people of superstitious stories from the worshippers – whether righteous or unrighteous, as is their firm belief. So beware of it because it is a lie.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Pen which is mentioned, then it is what Allaah created; and it wrote the measure of everything in the Preserved Tablet just as occurs in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Ubaadah ibn A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>aamit reported by Aboo Daawood from the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The first thing that Allaah created was the Pen and He said to it, “Write!” So it said, “O my Lord, and what shall I write?” He said, “Write down the decreed measure of everything right until the Hour is established.”’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the scholars disagree – was the Pen the very first thing that was created or was it the <em>`Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Allaah’s Throne)? They have two sayings in that regard. Ibn Al-Qayyim mentions both of them in his Nooniyyah and he preferred the view that the Pen was created after the <em>`Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne).”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Translator’s Side Point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah, </em>he said on this point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I say, with regard to the Preserved Tablet, it is what is mentioned in the saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed, it is a Praiseworthy Qur·aan contained in a Preserved Tablet.</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-Burooj (85), <em>aayaat </em>21-22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that is from the <em><u>Gh</u>ayb</em> (Hidden and Unseen) which it is obligatory that we have <em>eemaan</em> (truly believe) in it. And its true reality is not known except to Allaah. And the belief that some righteous people can look into what’s contained in it – this belief is <em>kufr</em> (unbelief) in the <em>aayaat</em> and <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> which clearly state that no one knows the <em><u>Gh</u>ayb</em> (Hidden and Unseen) except Allaah, the Most High.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s Side Point:</strong> With regard to the point about which was created first: the Pen or the Throne, <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>)<em>, </em>he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The explainer (Ibn Abil-`Izz in his explanation of A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>a<u>h</u>aawiyyah), he explained here, that the scholars differed whether the Pen was the very first thing created or the Throne (`<em>Ar<u>sh</u></em><u>)</u>. The scholars had two sayings in that regard and there is no third (saying). (Some of the scholars of the <em>Sunnah</em> said that Allaah’s Throne was first and then the Pen was created and some said that the Pen was created and then after that, Allaah’s Throne was created, and there is no third saying).”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And in my view the most preferable one is the first (that the Pen was the very first thing created) as is clearly stated in my note (that he made for A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>a<u>h</u>aawiyyah). And I say now, whether what is most correct is this or that, then this difference shows that the scholars are agreed that there was a first created thing. And the idea that created things came into creation and there is always something before it, they are contrary to this agreement (of the scholars).”</p>

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Explanation – Point [84] [Part 01]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>A<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>sh</u>afaa`ah</em> (the intercession) is also from the important matters of `<em>aqeedah </em>(creed and belief)[1] because people have gone astray with regard to affirming it. Some people went beyond the due limits in affirming it and others took a middle way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, with regard to the intercession on the Day of Resurrection, then the people have become divided about it, into <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>three categories:</strong></span></p>
<p>A people who went beyond the limits in affirming it to such an extent that they seek it from the dead and from the graves and from the idols and (from) the trees and (from) the stones.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> And they worship besides Allaah that which cannot harm them and cannot benefit them; and they say, “These are our intercessors with Allaah.”</strong></span> (Soorah Yoonus (10), <em>aayah </em>18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(The people of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>, they say,) “We do not worship them except so that they should draw us closer in nearness to Allaah.” </span></strong> (Sooratuz-Zumar (39), <em>aayah </em>3)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And a group who go beyond bounds in denying intercession, such as the <em>Mu`tazilah</em> and the <em><u>Kh</u>awaarij</em>. So they denied that there would be any intercession regarding the people who commit major sins (<em>ahlul-kabaa·ir</em>). And they contradict the proofs from the Book and the Sunnah which are <em>mutawaatir</em> (reported by huge number of narrators at each level of narration) affirming the intercession (<em>a<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>sh</u>afaa`ah</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whereas the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah</em> (the people of the Sunnah and the <em>Jamaa`ah</em>), they took a middle path. So, they affirmed the <em><u>sh</u>afaa`ah</em> (intercession) in the manner mentioned by Allaah and His Messenger; and they truly believe in it – without <em>ifraa<u>t</u></em> (إفراط – exceeding the limits) and <em>tafree<u>t</u></em> (تفريط – falling short of what is required).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em>a<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>sh</u>afaa`ah</em> (intercession) in the language, is derived from <em>a<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>sh</u>af`</em> (الشفع – that which is even) meaning: the opposite of ‘odd’ (الوتر – <em>al-witr</em>) because the word <em>al-witr</em> means: ‘a solitary person’ (that which is single), whereas <em>a<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>sh</u>af` </em>(that which is even) means: ‘more than one’, be it two or four or six; it is what is called ‘the even numbers’.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the Legislation it means: acting as an intermediary to carry out needs; that an intermediary comes in-between the person who has a need and the one who possesses what he wants. And it is of two categories: (the first is) interceding with Allaah and (the second is) interceding with the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <strong>intercession with the creation</strong>, then that is of two categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A <strong>good intercession</strong> (شفاعة حسنة &#8211; <em><u>sh</u>afaa`atun <u>h</u>asanah</em>) which is, when it is done with regard to affairs which are good, beneficial and permissible; that you mediate with someone who possesses the needs required by the people, in order that he should carry out those needs for them. He, the One free of all imperfections said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> Whoever intercedes for a good cause will receive a share of the reward for it. </span></strong> (Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), <em>aayah </em>85)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he, <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em> said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Intercede and you will receive reward, and Allaah will bring about whatever He wills upon the tongue of His Messenger.”</strong> [3]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is <em><u>sh</u>afaa`atun <u>h</u>asanah</em> (good intercession) and there is reward for it because it involves bringing about benefit for the Muslims in their needs being carried out and in their attaining that which they seek which is beneficial for them, and as long as it does not involve transgression or wrong-doing against anyone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <strong>the second category</strong> (of intercession amongst the creation) is: <strong>evil intercession</strong> (شفاعة سيئة &#8211; <em><u>sh</u>afaa`atun sayyi·ah</em>) which means: interceding for affairs which are forbidden; such as interceding so that prescribed punishments which have become binding should be dropped. And the like of this, enters into those who the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> cursed in saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Allaah has cursed whoever gives shelter to a person of transgression.”</strong> [4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, interceding with regard to seizing the property of other people without right and giving it to those who do not deserve it; Allaah the Most High said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever intercedes for an evil cause then he will have a share of the sin of it. </span></strong> (Sooratun-Nisaa· (4), <em>aayah </em>85)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <strong>intercession with Allaah</strong>, then it is not like interceding with the creation. For intercession with the Creator, that means: that Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, honours some of His servants by granting them that they may supplicate for some of the Muslims who deserve punishment because they have committed major sins (other than <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>), so the person intercedes with Him that He should pardon those people and not punish them because that person was a believer upon <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>. So therefore, the one interceding, he intercedes with Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, that He should pardon that person. Or, regarding someone who has entered the Hellfire because of sins, so the one who is interceding, intercedes with Allaah for that person to be taken out and for the punishment to be removed from him. And this is called ‘the intercession regarding the people who committed major sins’[5].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, interceding with Allaah has two conditions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first condition</strong> is that it is done only with the Permission of Allaah. So no one can intercede with Allaah, except with His Permission. So, He is the One who permits the person who intercedes, to intercede. And as for before He has granted Permission, then no one can precede Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Who is there that can intercede with Him, except with His Permission? </span></strong> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>255)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He is not like the created beings whom people come to in order to interceded with them even if they do not give permission for it. So Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, no one can intercede with Him except with His Permission.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second condition</strong>: that the person you are interceding for is one of the people of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed </em>(one who worships Allaah alone) and he is from the people of <em>eemaan</em> (he is a true believer – a <em>mu·min</em>) from those whom Allaah is pleased with – being pleased with their sayings and their actions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they cannot intercede except on behalf of those He (Allaah) is pleased with.</span></strong>  (Sooratul-Anbiyaa· (21), <em>aayah </em>28)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Allaah is pleased with that person’s sayings and actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And these two conditions occur together in the saying of Allaah the Most High,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Except, after Allaah has granted permission for whomever He wishes and is pleased with.</span></strong>  (Sooratun-Najm (53), <em>aayah </em>26)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘After Allaah has granted permission’ – this is the first condition; ‘and someone He is pleased with’ – that is the second condition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the unbeliever (<em>kaafir</em>), he will not be benefitted by any intercession.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Then they (the unbelievers) will not be benefitted by the intercession of those who intercede. </span></strong> (Sooratul-Mudda<u>thth</u>ir (74), <em>aayah </em>48)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">For the wrongdoers (from the unbelievers), there will be no devoted friends nor anyone to intercede for them, who will be of aid.</span></strong>  (Soorah <u>Gh</u>aafir (40), <em>aayah </em>18)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the intercession mentioned in the Qur·aan is of two types: intercession which is negated or denied, and that is intercession which has its conditions (one or both of them) absent; and intercession which is affirmed, which is intercession which fulfils those conditions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So as for the unbeliever, then he will not be benefitted by intercession. Even if all the inhabitants of the heavens and of the earth were to intercede for him, Allaah still would not accept their intercession because this person is a <em>mu<u>sh</u>rik</em> (one who worships others besides Allaah), he is an unbeliever (<em>kaafir</em>) in Allaah the Majestic and Most High. Allaah is not pleased with him in his sayings and his actions. Except, for what occurs with regard to the intercession of the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> with regard to his uncle – Aboo <u>T</u>aalib, for this is a special and particular intercession; and also, it is not an intercession for him to come out from the Hellfire, but rather an intercession for the punishment to be reduced upon this man because of the assistance he gave to the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and because of his sheltering him and defending him <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>. So the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> will intercede for the punishment to be reduced for him, only.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the confirmed intercession with its conditions, and it is of different types.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Point [84][6] to be continued <em>inshaa· Allaah</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] As is indicated in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of <em>a<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>sh</u>afaa`ah</em>, reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree as <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> 3340, 4712, 7510, and also by Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s Side Point: It’s a long <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> mentioning the Day of Resurrection, when the people would be suffering from the length of the waiting. Then they will go to the Oolul-`azm from the prophets – Aadam <em>`alayhis-salaam</em>, then Noo<u>h</u>, then Moosaa and `Eesaa, asking each of them to intercede with Allaah for the judgment to begin. Finally it will be said to them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Go to the Prophet <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam; so they will come to me and I will prostrate beneath the Throne, and it will be said, ‘O Mu<u>h</u>ammad, raise your head and intercede, your intercession will be accepted, and ask and you will be given.’”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Translator’s Side Point: Some of the explainers mention that’s why, the way it’s derived in the Arabic language, is that when somebody has a need, the person who intercedes to help him, it’s as if he makes that first person, he makes him two by going and joining him in his request and going and interceding with the person who can fulfil that request.  (He is one person and you have made him even, <em><u>sh</u>af`</em>). That’s why it’s called <em>a<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>sh</u>afaa`ah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] <em><u>H</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree as <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> 1432 and reported by Muslim; it is from a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Aboo Moosaa <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The full wording of Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree begins: that the companion Aboo Moosaa <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em> said, “Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam,</em> when a beggar used to come to him, or someone having a need (and) this was transmitted to him, he used to say this, ‘Intercede and you will receive reward…’.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] From a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Alee <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em> who said, “We do not possess anything with us except for the Book of Allaah and this scroll from the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam, </em>containing the wording that he said, ‏</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Al-Madeenah is a sacred area between `Aa·ir and such-and-such. Whoever introduces transgression within it, then upon him is the Curse of Allaah and the angels and all of mankind. No obligatory deed and no optional deed will be accepted from him…’<em>” </em>Reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree as <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> 1870 and by Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] الشفاعة في أهل الكبائر &#8211; <em>a<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>sh</u>afaa`ah fee ahlil-kabaa·ir</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] Translator’s Side Point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) said about the <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> about the <em><u>sh</u>afaa`ah</em>, “The <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> about that are <em>mutawaatir</em> (reported by a huge number of people at every level) also. And Ibn Abee `Aa<u>s</u>im, in his book: As-Sunnah, he brings six chapters about this – chapters 163 to 168, and he brings the <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> in that regard numbering <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> number 784 to 832 (about 48-49 <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em>) and the explainer (Ibn Abil-`Izz) in his explanation mentions a good number of them and they include the fact that the intercession of the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is of eight (8) different types. So whoever wishes can refer back to that (the explanation of Ibn Abil-`Izz).”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">[86]  And Allaah, the Most High, has always known the number of those who will enter into Paradise, and the number of those who will enter the Fire, altogether. So, that number will not be increased, nor will it be decreased.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [86][1]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This speech and that which follows it from the speech of the <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>, <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah, </em>all of it refers to the topic of <em>Al-Qa<u>d</u>aa· wal-Qadr</em> (القضاء والقدر – Ordainment and Pre-decree).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And having <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in Ordainment and Pre-decree is one of the six pillars of <em>eemaan</em>, just as he, <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>, said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Eemaan (true faith) is that you truly believe in Allaah and in His angels and in His Books and in His Messengers and in the Last Day, and that you truly believe in the Pre-decree – the good of it and the bad of it.” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the Qur·aan there occurs the saying of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>We have created everything with a pre-decreed measure </strong></span><br />
(Sooratul-Qamar (54), <em>aayah </em>49)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">He (Allaah) created everything and gave it a pre-decreed measure</span></strong><br />
(Sooratul-Furqaan (25), <em>aayah </em>2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, there is nothing without a pre-decreed measure, or nothing which randomly occurs, or nothing that just happens unexpectedly; rather, everything which happens, does so in accordance with a pre-decreed measure and having been written.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And having <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in <em>Al-Qa<u>d</u>aa· wal-Qadr</em> (Pre-ordainment and Pre-decree) includes four (4) levels and we will abridge them as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First Level</strong>: To have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in Allaah’s comprehensive Knowledge (<em>Al-`Ilm</em> &#8211; العلم) which covers everything, and that Allaah has known all things, always. He knew whatever happened and whatever was going to happen and whatever was not going to happen and if it had happened, how it would have been. Nothing whatsoever is hidden from His Knowledge, He, the One free of all imperfections and the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second Level</strong>: (<em>Al-Kitaabah</em>) That Allaah the Majestic and the Most High, He wrote in <em>Al-Law<u>h</u> Al-Ma<u>h</u>foo<u>z</u></em> (The Preserved Tablet) the pre-decreed measures of every created thing, after having known them, He the Perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is the Universal and all-inclusive Writing which covers everything. And there occurs in a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u> </em>(that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>said),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The first thing that Allaah created was the Pen. He said, ‘Write!’ It said, ‘What shall I write?’ He said, ‘Write down whatever will occur until the Day of Resurrection.’” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the Pen wrote down whatever was going to happen until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Third Level</strong>: The level of <em>Al-Ma<u>sh</u>ee·ah</em> (Allaah’s Wish and Will). So nothing occurs in this creation except by the Will and Wish of Allaah from that which is in the Preserved Tablet (<em>Al-Law<u>h</u> Al-Ma<u>h</u>foo<u>z</u></em>) and what is within His Knowledge, He the Perfect and Most High. Nothing happens without His Will and nothing occurs within His Sovereignty unless He wills it (if He doesn’t will it, it doesn’t occur), He the Perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah does whatever He wills.</span></strong><br />
(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ajj (22), <em>aayah </em>14)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Likewise, Allaah does whatever He wishes.</span></strong><br />
(Soorah Aal-`Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, everything which occurs in this creation, whether life or death, whether someone being rich or someone being poor, whether someone having <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) or being an unbeliever; all of that was in accordance with Allaah’s Wish and Will. He wished the good and He wished the evil. He wished true faith (<em>eemaan</em>) and He wished unbelief (<em>kufr</em>). So, everything enters into His <em>Al-Ma<u>sh</u>ee·ah</em> (His Universal Wish); whatever He wished to occur, occurred; and whatever He did not wish, did not occur.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Fourth Level</strong>: The level of creating and bringing into existence (<em>al-<u>kh</u>alq wal-eejaad</em> &#8211; الخلق والإيجاد). So whatever things He wished and willed, then He brought it into existence and created it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah is the Creator of everything and He is a Guardian and Disposer of Affairs over everything.</strong></span><br />
(Sooratuz-Zumar (39), <em>aayah </em>62)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The Creating and the Command are His</strong></span><br />
(Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> No calamity strikes upon the earth nor in your selves, except that it is written down in a Book before We created it.</strong></span> (Sooratul-<u>H</u>adeed (57), <em>aayah </em>22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proofs of (Allaah’s) Knowledge are very many.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from that which Allaah has described Himself with, is <em>Al-`Ilm</em> (العلم &#8211; Knowledge). So He, the One free of all imperfections and the Most High, He knows the number of people who will enter into Paradise and those who will enter into the Fire, and that is in His Eternal Knowledge (He has always known that).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that whatever Allaah, the Most High had decreed, that will not be added to nor will it be decreased. And from that, is that He knows the inhabitants of Paradise and the inhabitants of the Fire, and He knows what they were going to do. We have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in that and we apply ourselves to action. We do not debate concerning Ordainment and Pre-decree, saying “how?” and “why?” and “how can a person be taken to account for something which Allaah pre-decreed?” to the rest of the foolish talk and wastage of time, and raising objections against Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is obligatory upon you, is rather, to perform the acts of obedience and to avoid the sins. It is not the business of a slave to try and investigate the Secret of Allaah, the Mighty and the Majestic, and to dispute with the Lord, the Majestic and Most High. Rather, his business is to act. So therefore, when the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>informed his Companions that there is no one from them except that his place is written down – whether it be in Paradise or it be in the Fire, they said, “O Messenger of Allaah, shall we not then depend upon what is written down for us and leave off actions?” So he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“No, act, for everyone will have that which he was created for, made easy for him.”</strong> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Your deeds are diverse. So whoever spends in Allaah’s cause and fears and is dutiful to Him, and believes in Allaah’s reward, then We will make easy for him, acts which are pleasing to Allaah.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Layl (92), <em>aayaat </em>4-7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the reason here, is from the servant himself (why Allaah will make good deeds easy for the person) – either he is a person who is fortunate or a person who is wretched.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever is miserly, withholding from spending in Allaah’s cause, and thinks himself self-sufficient and does not act in obedience to Allaah, and denies Allaah’s reward, then We will make actions which Allaah hates, easy for him.</span></strong> (Sooratul-Layl (92), <em>aayaat </em>8-10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is required from us, is performing righteous and correct actions and leaving off evil actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for using Pre-ordainment and Pre-decree as an argument, then it is not an excuse because Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, has made the good clear to us, and the evil; so therefore there is no excuse. And the people fall into problems because of their entering into affairs which they are not qualified for. So he says, “If Allaah has written for me that I will enter into Paradise, then I will enter it and if He has written for me that I will enter the Fire then I am going to enter it,” and he doesn’t perform any actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then it is to be said to him: You, yourself don’t apply this saying upon yourself. Do you just sit in your house and leave off seeking provision? And do you say, “If Allaah has written down provision for me, He will make it easy for me.” Or is it that you go out and you strive and you seek for your provision? Even the animals and the birds don’t just sit in their homes; rather, they go out and they seek for their provision. And there occurs in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>, the saying of the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“If you truly had reliance upon Allaah, then He would provide for you just as He provides for the birds. They go out hungry and they return with full bellies.”</strong> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah created them (the birds and animals) upon the inborn nature of seeking for provision and of using the necessary means; and they are animals and you are a man will intellect!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also, if someone stole something from you, would you say, “This was just something pre-decreed and ordained,” or would you make a complaint against him? Rather, indeed you would make a complaint against him and you would seek it and you would argue your case; you would not use as an argument Pre-ordainment and Pre-decree!</p>

</span><span style="color:#ff0000;">[87]  And the same applies to their deeds; He knew whatever they were going to do.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation – Point [88]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">So whoever gives in Allaah’s cause and spends in obedience to Allaah, and fears Him and is dutiful to Him and believes in His reward, then We will make easy for him actions which are pleasing to Allaah. And whoever is miserly, and withholds from giving in Allaah’s cause, and thinks of himself as being self-sufficient and does not act in obedience to Allaah, and who denies His reward, then We will make actions which Allaah hates and is not pleased with, easy for him. </span></strong>(Sooratul-Layl (92), <em>aayaat </em>5-10)</p>

<p>At-Ta`leeqaat Al-Mukhtasarah `alaa Matn Al-`Aqeedah At-Tahaawiyyah<br />
By Shaykh Saalih ibn Fawzaan al-Fawzaan hafizahullaah<br />
Pages 105-110 (Point 86-88)<br />
Translated by Aboo Talhah Daawood Burbank, rahimahullaah, in 1426AH<br />
Transcribed by Sideeqa Ali</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Footnotes:</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s Side Point: The author, <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, moves on to a few points connected to <em>Qadr</em> (Pre-decree) and we already had something with regard to Pre-decree in the book, that being points number 28-37 where the author, <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“He created the creation whilst having full Knowledge (of them). And He decreed fixed limits for them. And He laid down fixed time-spans for them. And nothing was hidden from Him before He created them. And He knew whatever they were going to do, before He created them. And He commanded them to obey Him and He forbade them from disobeying Him. And everything occurs in accordance with His Pre-decree. And His Will is enacted, not the will of the servants except what He wills for them. So whatever He willed for them occurs, and whatever He did not will for them does not occur. He guides whomever He wishes, and protects and keeps safe as a favor upon them; and He misguides whomever He wishes and humiliates and puts to trial from (His) Justice. All of them vary within His Will, between His Favor and His Justice.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] <em><u>H</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree (no. 50) and by Muslim in his Book of <em>Eemaan</em> (no. 10) as the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] This <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> is reported by Aboo Ya`laa from the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and it was declared <em><u>S</u></em><em>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (Authentic) by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee in A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah (no. 133). Also reported by Al-Bayhaqee in his book As-Sunan Al-Kubraa as being <em>mawqoof</em> from (the statement of the Companion) Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>. Also reported by Aboo Daawood and At-Tirmi<u>dh</u>ee from the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Ubaadah ibn A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>aamit <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em> and declared <em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (Authentic) by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] <em><u>H</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree (no. 6605) and likewise by Muslim. It is from a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Alee <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Reported by A<u>h</u>mad in his Musnad, and by `Abd ibn <u>H</u>umayd, and by At-Tirmi<u>dh</u>ee and Ibn Maajah, and At-Tirmi<u>dh</u>ee said it is <em><u>H</u>asan-<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em>. And it was declared authentic by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> A<u>h</u>mad <u>Sh</u>aakir in his checking of the Musnad. Likewise, it was declared <em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah.</em> It is from a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Umar <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s Side Point: This is a <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> that sometimes the Sufis beggars try and use to say that they are not begging but they are depending and relying upon Allaah. But as the scholars say, they are just begging from the people and they try to use this <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> as it mentions, “If only you had reliance upon Allaah, then He would provide for you just as He provides for the birds.” The scholars and explainers say that the last part of this hadeeth is a refutation of them because it mentions that the birds “go out hungry and they return with full bellies.” So, they go out and look for food and when they’ve found it, they come back with their bellies full.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] Translator’s Side Point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) said regarding this point: “The author <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> is indicating the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Abdullaah ibn `Amr <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em> who said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Allaah’s Messenger <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam came out to us and in his hand he had two books and he said, “Do you know what these two books are?” So we said, “No, O Messenger of Allaah, not unless you inform us.”  So he said about the book in his right hand, “This is a book from the Lord of the whole of the creation. It contains the names of the inhabitants of Paradise and the names of their fathers and their tribes, and then their total number is mentioned; it will not be added to and it will not be taken away from, ever.” Then he said about the book in his left hand, “This is a book from the Lord of the whole of the creation, containing the names of the inhabitants of the Fire and the names of their fathers and their tribes, and then He mentioned their total number; so it will not be added to, nor will it be decreased, ever.” So his Companions said, “Then on what basis is there to be any action if the affair has been finished?” So he said, “Strive to act correctly and to be justly balanced because the person of Paradise will have his actions sealed for him with the actions of the people of Paradise, no matter what he may have done; and the person of the Fire will have his actions sealed for him with the actions of the people of the Fire, no matter what he may have done.” Then Allaah’s Messenger <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam said motioning with his hands and he threw them (the two books) away. Then he said, “Your Lord has finished with regards to the servants,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>A group in Paradise and another group in the Fire.</strong></span><br />
(Sooratu<u>sh</u>&#8211;<u>Sh</u>ooraa (42), <em>aayah </em>7)”’</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> was reported by At-Tirmi<u>dh</u>ee and he declared it authentic, and others as well. And I have researched it in my book A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah as <em><u>h</u></em><em>adee<u>th</u></em> no. 848.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, in his checking of At-Tirmi<u>dh</u>ee, <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee declared it <em><u>H</u>asan</em> (good).</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Points discussed in this excerpt include:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Having <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in Ordainment and Pre-decree (القضاء والقدر) is one of the six pillars of <em>eemaan</em></li>
<li>There is nothing without a pre-decreed measure, or which randomly occurs, or that just happens unexpectedly</li>
<li>The four (4) levels of <em>eemaan</em> in <em>Al-Qadaa</em><em> wal-Qadr: Al-`Ilm, Al-Kitaabah, Al-Mashee</em><em>·</em><em>ah </em>and <em>Al-<u>Kh</u>alq</em></li>
<li>Obligation upon a person to perform acts of obedience and avoid sins</li>
<li>Pre-ordainment and Pre-decree is not to be used as an argument/excuse</li>
<li>Allaah knows those who will enter the Paradise and the Fire, their total number and their deeds</li>
<li>Everyone will have what he was created for, made easy for him</li>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">            والعرشُ والكرسيُّ حقٌّ.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[Point 117] <strong><span style="color:#008000;">  And the Throne (<em>Al-`Ar<u>sh</u></em>) and the Footstool (<em>Al-Kursee</em>) are true.</span></strong></p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F330334335&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe><br />
—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Explanation – Point [117]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, created the heavens and He created the earth, and He created the Footstool (<em>Kursee</em>) and He created the <em>`Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne), all of these are things created by Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. The heavens are above the earth, and above the heavens is <em>al-ba<u>h</u>r</em> (البحر &#8211; the ocean) and above the ocean is the Footstool, and above the Footstool is the <em>`Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne). So that is the highest of all of the created things; and that is as occurs in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That the seven heavens compared to the Kursee (Footstool) are just like seven dirhams (small silver coins) thrown in a shield. [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: the seven heavens and their greatness, and whatever is within them, compared to the Kursee (Footstool) are just like seven dirhams (small silver coins) thrown in the like of a large circle of metal which the fighter uses as a shield. So what are seven dirhams compared to the large circular shield? In comparison, they are very little. In that regard, there is His saying, He the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">His (Allaah’s) <em>Kursee</em> (Footstool) extends over the heavens and the earth.</span><br />
</strong> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah 2</em>55)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne) is even greater than the <em>Kursee</em> (Footstool). So the <em>Kursee</em> (Footstool) compared to the <em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne) is just like a ring thrown in a desert, as occurs in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>. So if you were to throw a little ring into a broad, expansive piece of land, what would the size of the ring be compared to the size of that whole desert? Nothing!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These created things are tremendous and extremely vast, (so vast) as is known to none except Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the <em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne) is the highest of all the created things. And Allaah, the Perfect, is High and Exalted above His <em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne), above His creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, the <em>Kursee </em>(Footstool) is beneath the<em> `</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne). And there occurs in a narration that it (the <em>Kursee &#8211; </em>Footstool) is the place of the two Feet.[2] So, the <em>Kursee </em>(Footstool) is something created and it does not mean <em>al-`Ilm</em> (العلم &#8211; Knowledge) as has been attributed to Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>, that he said with regard to the saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>His <em>Kursee</em> extends over …</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That he (Ibn `Abbaas) said it means: “His Knowledge;”[3] meaning that His Knowledge extends over the heavens and the earth. This meaning is correct; however, that is not what is meant by the <em>aayah</em>. So, the <em>Kursee </em>(Footstool) is something created whereas <em>al-`Ilm</em> (Allaah’s Knowledge) is an Attribute from the Attributes of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic; it is not from that which He has created. So therefore, it is obligatory to have <em>eemaan </em>(truly believe) in the <em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne) and in the<em> Kursee </em>(Footstool); this being something true upon its true reality. And the <em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne) is not as the <em>A<u>sh</u>`arees</em> say, and whoever proceeds along their way, that the <em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne) means <em>Al-Mulk</em> (الملك &#8211; Kingship or Sovereignty). So they say, with regard to His saying, He the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Allaah) ascended over the Throne</span><br />
</strong> (Sooratul-A`raaf (7), <em>aayah </em>54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They (the <em>A<u>sh</u>`arees</em>) say it means: “He gained control over Sovereignty or Kingship.” And this is misguidance. So the Throne (<em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em>) is something created.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And His Throne was above the water</span><br />
</strong> (Soorah-Hood (11), <em>aayah </em>7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, beneath the Throne (<em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em>) is the <em>Kursee </em>(Footstool), and beneath the <em>Kursee </em>(Footstool) is the heavens, and the earth is beneath the heavens. And there occurs in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> (the saying of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>),</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So if you ask Allaah for Paradise (Jannah), then ask Him for the highest Firdaws because it is the middle part of Paradise and the highest part of Paradise, and above it is the Throne (`Ar<u>sh</u>) of the Most Merciful.” [4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, <em>Al-Firdaws</em> is the highest of the Gardens of Paradise and above it is the Throne (<em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em>) of the Most Merciful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, His Throne (<em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em>) is something created and it has carriers/bearers (حملة – <em><u>h</u>amalah</em>) and they are groups from the Angels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And on that Day (the Day of Resurrection), eight carriers will carry the Throne of your Lord</span> </strong> (Sooratul-<u>H</u>aaqqah (69), <em>aayah </em>17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So before the Day of Resurrection, it will be carried by four (Angels) but when the Day of Resurrection comes they will be doubled and they will become eight. And each one of the Angels (who will carry the Throne) is such that his created form, his tremendous size and his strength cannot be imagined.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And could it be said: if someone says that the Throne means ‘Sovereignty’, could it be said that Sovereignty will be carried by the Angels?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of explanation of point [117][5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Footnotes:</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s Note: Reported as a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> by Ibn Jareer At-Tabaree in his Tafseer, and by others; and verifiers make it clear that its chain of narrations is weak – it is not authentic. Its chain of narrations contains a weak narrator called `Abdur-Ra<u>h</u>maan ibn Zayd ibn Aslam; and its chain of narration is also broken after that. This is pointed out by the verifiers of Kitaab At-Taw<u>h</u>eed such as <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Jaasim ad-Dawsaree in his book An-Nahaj As-Sadeed (النهج السديد) his checking of Kitaab At-Taw<u>h</u>eed. And this point is also made by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> in Silsilah Al-A<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u> A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah (سلسلة الأحاديث الصحيحة) no. 109. So this <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> with this wording is not authentic. An authentic wording will follow <em>in<u>sh</u>aa· Allaah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Translator’s Side Point: As for this narration, then it is declared <em><u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> (Authentic) by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee and others as a saying of Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa </em>with an authentic chain of narration reported by Al-<u>H</u>aakim and Ibn Abee <u>Sh</u>aybah in his book and <u>S</u>ifatul-Jannah (صفة الجنة) that Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em> stated this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Translator’s Side Point: The verifiers, amongst them <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Muqbil <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, in his checking of Ibn Ka<u>th</u>eer, and other verifiers as well, they make clear that this report from Ibn `Abbaas is not authentic. The reason being, that the narrator from Ibn `Abbaas is quoted as being his student Sa`eed ibn Jubayr, and the narrator from Sa`eed ibn Jubayr is Ja`far ibn Abil-Mu<u>gh</u>eerah, and the verifiers such as Ibn Mandah, they mention this narrator (Ja`far ibn Abil-Mu<u>gh</u>eerah) is weak in his narrations from Sa`eed ibn Jubayr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] This <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> is reported by Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree as <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> 2790 and 7423; and it is from a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Aboo Hurayrah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Translator’s Side Point: <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>, he said in his notes:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Know that the <em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em> (Throne) is a very great creation as is proven in the <em>aayaat</em> of the Qur·aan and in the <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> of the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam.</em> And this is why He, the Most High, attributed it to Himself in His saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah described Himself as being “<strong>the Possessor or the Owner of the Throne</strong>”, and you will find other <em>aayaat</em> (about the Throne) in the explanation (of Ibn Abil-`Izz).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the language, it (<em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em>) means: the throne (seat) of the king. And from its characteristics mentioned in the Qur·aan is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And eight (Angels) will bear the Throne of your Lord on the Day of Resurrection</span><br />
</strong>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>aaqqah (69), <em>aayah </em>17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that it is upon the water. And in the <em>Sunnah</em> there is mentioned that from the Angels who bear the Throne, there is one Angel who, from his earlobe to his shoulder is a distance of seven hundred (700) years (he authenticates it in A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah (no. 151) – a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Aboo Daawood from Jaabir <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anh</em>). And also that it (the <em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em>) has supports, and also that it is the ceiling of <em>Jannatul-Firdaws</em>. That occurs in authentic <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> which are mentioned in the explanation (of Ibn Abil-`Izz). And all of this nullifies the false interpretation that the <em>`</em><em>Ar<u>sh</u></em> means <em>Al-Mulk</em> (Kingship) and extensive Sovereignty!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the <em>Kursee </em>(Footstool) then regarding that is His saying, He the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">His Footstool extends over the heavens and the earth</span><br />
</strong> (Sooratul-Baqarah (2), <em>aayah </em>255)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>Kursee </em>(Footstool) is in front of the Throne, and it is authentic from Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa</em>, as his saying, that he said, “The <em>Kursee </em>(Footstool) is the place of the two Feet, and the Throne – no one knows its size except Allaah, the Most High.” (Reported by Al-<u>H</u>aakim and Ibn Abee <u>Sh</u>aybah in his book <u>S</u>ifatul-Jannah, and <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee said that it is authentic.)”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Al-Albaanee then mentions that he has verified this narration in his book Mu<u>kh</u>ta<u>s</u>ar Al-`Uloo of A<u>dh</u>&#8211;<u>Dh</u>ahabee (مختصر العلو للذهبي), and he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There is nothing authentic from the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> as his saying, except for his saying <em>`alayhi<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>s</u>alaatu was-salaam</em>, (with regard to the <em>Kursee </em>(Footstool)),</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The seven heavens compared to the Footstool are just like a ring thrown into a desert, and the size of the `Ar<u>sh</u> compared to the Footstool is like the size of that desert compared to the size of that ring.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So that nullifies also, the misinterpretation of the Footstool to mean <em>al-`Ilm</em> (Knowledge) and this interpretation is not authentic from Ibn `Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhumaa, </em>as I have verified in my book A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah (no. 109).”</p>

<span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong> &amp; That They are Both Created</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[91] Ahl us-Sunnah testify and believe that Paradise and Hell are both created. They will remain eternally and the people of Paradise will never leave it. Also the inhabitants of Hell, who were created for it, will never come out of it. Death will be sacrificed on the wall between Paradise and Hell, then a call will be made that day:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">..O people of Paradise, there is eternity and no death. O people of Hell, there is eternity and no death.</span></strong>&#8220;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Explanation of the Creed of the Salaf</strong>,  by Imaam Abee Uthmaan Ismaa’eel bin Abdir-Rahmaan As-Saaboonee,<em>rahimahullaah</em>, as explained by our noble sheikh al-Allaamah Rabee’ bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee, <em>hafidhahullaah</em>.</p>
<p>Audio Lecture by: <strong>Abu Muhammad al Maghribee</strong> (<em>hafidhahullaah)</em></p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;"><strong>[The below is the Text from the Book]</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Hawd &amp; The Kawthar (The Pool &amp; The River)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[89] They believe in the Hawd [102] and the Kawthar. Also in the entering of a group of Ahl ut-Tawheed into Paradise without account. There will also be a group from them who will have an easy reckoning, without any harm befalling them, or any punishment overtaking them. A group from them who had sinned will enter the Fire, then they will be freed and led out of it and joined up with their brothers who preceded them in entering Paradise. [103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They ( i.e. Ahl Hadeeth ) know with certainty and truth that the sinful from amongst the Ahl ut Tawlieed will not remain in the Fire eternally, and will not be left there forever.

<p>Audio Lecture by: <strong>Abu Muhammad al Maghribee</strong> (<em>hafidhahullaah)</em></p>
<p><strong>[The below is the Text from the Book]</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Chapter 20: The Outcome of the Slaves is Unknown</strong></span></p>
<p>[115] The People of <em>Hadeeth</em> believe and testify that the end of the slave is unknown. No one knows what his end shall be. They (People of <em>Hadeeth</em>) do not pass judgement on a specific person that he will be from the people of Paradise or from the people of Hell, because that is something which is hidden from them. They do not know in which state a person will die, whether it is upon <em>Islaam</em> or unbelief, so due to this fact they say:</p>
<p>“Indeed we are Believers, if Allaah wills.”</p>
<p>That is, from those Believers who will have a good end, if Allaah wills [134]</p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;">[134] TRANSLATORS NOTE ~ The Prophet(صلى الله عليه وسلم), said:</span></p>
<p><em><span style="color:#008000;">Do not be delighted by the actions of anyone until you see how he ends up&#8221;.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;">Related by Ahmad [ 3:120,223 ] and lbn Abee ‘Aasim [ 393-395 ]. The isnaad is Saheeh.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Chapter 21: The Ruling Upon On One Who Died Upon Belief Or Unbelief</strong></span></p>
<p>[l16] And the People of <em>Hadeeth</em> witness for the one who dies upon <em>Islaam</em> that his end will be Paradise even if their fate was written by Allaah that they will be punished with the Fire for a period, as a result of their sins which they committed and did not repent from. They will eventually enter Paradise and no one from amongst the Muslims will remain in Hell eternally. This is a great blessing and favour from Allaah. If one dies upon unbelief, and Allaah’s protection is sought from this, he will be thrown into the Fire and he will not be saved from it, and he will stay there forever.</p>

<p><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>[The below is the Text from the Book]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Chapter 14: We do not Call a Muslim an Unbeliever Due to his Sins</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[100] Ahl us-Sunnab believe that if a Believer commits sins, however small or large they may be, he does not become an unbeliever. If he leaves this world without making any repentance from them and he dies upon Tawheed and Ikhlaas, then his affair is entirely up to Allaah, The Most Mighty and The Most Majestic. If He wills, He may forgive him and enter him into Paradise on the Day of judgement, safe and sound without being afflicted by the fire and without being punished for his perpetration of the sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He will be brought on the Day of judgement with his sins and misdeeds. If Allaah wills, He will punish him for a period in the Fire. If He punishes him, he will not however remain in the Fire forever, but he will eventually be freed and taken out from it, to the place of tranquility and content.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[101] Our Shaykh, the Imaam Aboo Tayyeb Sahl ibn Muhammad as- Sa’lookee, raheemahullaah, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The sinning believer, even if he is punished by the fire, he will not be thrown in there the same way as the unbeliever is thrown in the fire. He will not remain there the same way as the unbeliever will remain there nor will he be wretched and miserable the same way the unbeliever is wretched and miserable.”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[102] This means that the unbeliever will be dragged to the Fire on his face, he will be thrown in there chained, and then hung upside down, shackled by having his hands tied to his neck with strong and heavy chains. However, the sinning believer, if he is afflicted by the Fire, he will enter it like a criminal enters a prison in this world on his feet, not upside down nor thrown in. The meaning of his statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8230;he will not, be thrown in there the same way as the unbeliever is thrown in the fire&#8230;,” means that the unbeliever will have all his body burned and every time his skin is roasted through it will be replaced with another, so that he may taste the punishment again, as Allaah informs us in His Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Indeed, those who have disbelieved in our signs, we shall burn them in a fire. We shall change their skins for other skins, so that they may taste the punishment again.&#8221;</span> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4;56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the believers they will not have their faces scorched by the Fire, and their limbs which they used for sujood will not be burned. For Allaah has forbidden the Fire from burning them. “ [113]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[103] His saying: “&#8230;he will not stay in the Fire like the unbeliever would&#8230;”, means that the unbeliever will remain in it forever and never come out of it. Allaah will never leave any sinning believer in the Fire forever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying: “&#8230;he will not be afflicted like the unbeliever”, means that the unbeliever has no hope of the Mercy of Allah and no opportunity for reprieve from the punishment. As for the believer he will never be cut off from the hope of the Mercy of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The final outcome for all the believers is Paradise, as they were created for it and it was created for them, as a Mercy and a Blessing from Allaah.</p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Chapter 25: Their Position With Regards To The Dispute Between The Companions</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[130] The People of Hadeeth hold that one must refrain ( from discussing the dispute between the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم). The tongues must be purged from mentioning anything which entails the attribution of shortcomings and deficiencies to them. [146] They (The People of Hadeeth ), hold that one should seek Allaah’s Mercy for all of them and have love and defend each and every one of them. They also hold that one should exalt the status of the Prophet’s wives, radiyallaabu ‘anhum, supplicate for them, recognise their excellence and acknowledge that they are the Mothers of the Believers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Explanation of the Creed of the Salaf</strong>,  by Imaam Abee Uthmaan Ismaa’eel bin Abdir-Rahmaan As-Saaboonee,<em>rahimahullaah</em>, as explained by our noble sheikh al-Allaamah Rabee’ bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee, <em>hafidhahullaah</em>.</p>
<p>Audio Lecture by: <strong>Abu Muhammad al Maghribee</strong> (<em>hafidhahullaah)</em></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Chapter 28: The Whisperings of the Devils (Shayaateen)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>[The below is the text from the Book]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[134] The People of Hadeeth believe that Allah, The One free from all deficiencies, Created the devils with the characteristic of whispering to mankind and they intend their downfall, so they lie in wait for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَإِنَّ الشَّيَاطِينَ لَيُوحُونَ إِلَىٰ أَوْلِيَائِهِمْ لِيُجَادِلُوكُمْ ۖ وَإِنْ أَطَعْتُمُوهُمْ إِنَّكُمْ لَمُشْرِكُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Indeed the devils do inspire their friends to dispute with you and if you obey them, then indeed you will become an polytheist.&#8221;</span> (Sooratul-An&#8217;aam 6:121)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[135] Allaah empowers them (the devils ) over whomsoever He wishes and He protects whomsoever He wishes from their plots and deceptions. Allaah The Most Mighty and Majestic says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَاسْتَفْزِزْ مَنِ اسْتَطَعْتَ مِنْهُم بِصَوْتِكَ وَأَجْلِبْ عَلَيْهِم بِخَيْلِكَ وَرَجِلِكَ وَشَارِكْهُمْ فِي الْأَمْوَالِ وَالْأَوْلَادِ وَعِدْهُمْ ۚ وَمَا يَعِدُهُمُ الشَّيْطَانُ إِلَّا غُرُورًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إِنَّ عِبَادِي لَيْسَ لَكَ عَلَيْهِمْ سُلْطَانٌ ۚ وَكَفَىٰ بِرَبِّكَ وَكِيلًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And Istafziz [literally means: befool them gradually] those whom you can among them with your voice (i.e. songs, music, and any other call for Allah&#8217;s disobedience), make assaults on them with your cavalry and your infantry, mutually share with them wealth and children (by tempting them to earn money by illegal ways usury, etc., or by committing illegal sexual intercourse, etc.), and make promises to them.&#8221; But Satan promises them nothing but deceit.Verily! My slaves (i.e the true believers of Islamic Monotheism), you have no authority over them. And All-Sufficient is your Lord as a Guardian.</span>(Sooratul-Israa 17:64-65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إِنَّهُ لَيْسَ لَهُ سُلْطَانٌ عَلَى الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ<br />
إِنَّمَا سُلْطَانُهُ عَلَى الَّذِينَ يَتَوَلَّوْنَهُ وَالَّذِينَ هُم بِهِ مُشْرِكُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Verily! He has no power over those who believe and put their trust only in their Lord (Allah).His power is only over those who obey and follow him (Satan), and those who join partners with Him (Allah)</span>  (Sooratul-Nahl 16:99-100)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-justify">Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Abu Bakr (May Allah be pleased with him) said:<span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> &#8220;Show reverence to Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) by honouring the members of his family.&#8221;</strong></span> </span>[Al-Bukhari].</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Yazid bin Haiyan reported: I went along with Husain bin Sabrah and `Amr bin Muslim to Zaid bin Arqam (May Allah be pleased with them) and, as we sat by his side, Husain said to him,<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;</span>Zaid, you acquired great merits, you saw Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), listened to him talking, fought by his side in (different) battles, and offered Salat (prayer) behind him. Zaid, you have indeed earned great merits. Could you narrate to us what you heard from Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam)?&#8221; Zaid said, &#8220;By Allah! I have grown old and have almost spent up my age and I have forgotten some of the things which I remembered in connection with Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), so accept what I narrate to you, do not compel me to narrate what I fail to narrate&#8221;. He then said, &#8220;One day Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) stood up to deliver a Khutbah at a watering place known as Khumm between Makkah and Al-Madinah. He praised Allah, extolled Him, and exhorted (us) and said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> `Amma Ba`du. O people, I am a human being. I am about to receive a messenger (the angel of death) from my Rubb and I will respond to Allah&#8217;s Call, but I am leaving with you two weighty things: the first is the Book of Allah, in which there is right guidance and light, so hold fast to the Book of Allah and adhere to it.&#8217; He exhorted (us to hold fast) to the Book of Allah</span> and then said,<strong><span style="color:#0000ff;"> `The second is the members of my household, I remind you (to be kind) to the members of my family. I remind you (to be kind) to the members of my family.</span></strong> Husain said to Zaid, &#8220;Who are the members of his household, O Zaid? Aren&#8217;t his wives the members of his family?&#8221; Thereupon Zaid said, &#8220;His wives are the members of his family. (But here) the members of his family are those for whom Zakat is forbidden&#8221;. &nbsp;He asked, &#8220;Who are they?&#8221; Zaid said, &#8220;Ali and the offspring of `Ali, `Aqil and the offspring of `Aqil and the offspring of Ja`far and the offspring of `Abbas.&#8221; Husain asked, &#8220;For all of them the acceptance of Zakat is forbidden?&#8221; Zaid (May Allah be pleased with him) said, &#8220;Yes&#8221;.</p>

<p><span style="color: #008000">As for the <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jammah</em>, and they are the Companions of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>– and those who followed them in goodness, they say that the sinner does not stay in the Hell-Fire for eternity as a long as he does not make something prohibited as permissible. &nbsp;However, if he dies knowing that it is a sin, but the Shaytaan prompted him to commit the sin, then he does not stay in the Hell-Fire for eternity, in fact he is under the Will of Allaah, if Allaah wants He will pardon him and enter him into Paradise due to his Islaam and <em>Eemaan</em> and if Allaah wants, He will punish him in the Hell-Fire according to the amount of sin, then after he has been purified and cleared Allaah will take him out of the Hell-Fire to Paradise.</span></p>



<p>.. <span style="color: #008000">Therefore, <strong>whatever is less than <em>Shirk</em> then it is under the Will of Allaah</strong>, and committing suicide is less then <em>Shirk</em>, likewise is <em>Zina</em> (adultery &amp; fornication), stealing and drinking alcohol.&nbsp; All of these things are sins that are less than <em>Shirk</em>, and those who carry them out are under the Will of Allaah.&nbsp; If a person dies while committing that sin then it is up to Allaah <em>– Subhanahu –</em> if He wants to forgive him due to righteous actions and the Islaam which is with him, or if Allaah wants, He will punish him in the Hell-Fire according to the amount of sins that he had committed.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1 &#8211; Reading Star Signs</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Salih Alaa ash &#8211; Shaykh -hafidhullaah- said :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Whoever reads the page which contains star signs and he knows the star sign of when he was born, or he knows that star sign which is significant for him, and he reads the comments mentioned in that star sign then it is as if he has asked a soothsayer/fortune teller. So his prayer would not be accepted for forty days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he attests to it and believes in that star sign then he has disbelieved in that which was revealed to Muhammad &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- . . .&#8217; (the Shaykh continues saying: ) &#8216;and if he brings home newspapers which contain these type of things then it is as if he brought a soothsayer / fortune teller into his house.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Tamheed Sharh Kitaab al Tawheed p. 349 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2 &#8211; Watching Magical Acrobatic Stunts &amp; Circus Antics </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzaan -hafidhullaah- said :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;It is not permissible to use magic in the form of acrobatic stunts or circus antics or anything similar to that. Like the one who pulls a car with his hair, or a car is driven over him and does not harm him. . . . . all of this is magical imagery, so it is not allowed to perform it or to be happy with it, nor to attract your friends to do this in front of Muslims. Because it is clear evil, it is obligatory to reject and terminate it and to cleanse the Muslim lands of it . . . if those who go to see magic in the form of acrobatic stunts even though they are not pleased with going to see them, they have carried out something which is prohibited and they are sinful for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If they are pleased with this and they know that this is done by magic then they have fallen into disbelief because of it.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Daroos fee sharh Nawaqid al Islaam p. 152-156]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3 &#8211; Wearing an Engagement Ring</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This enters under the saying of the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8216;Indeed incantations, amulets and Tiwalah [1] (a form of magic) are Shirk.&#8217;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Ahmad and Abu Dawood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Uthaymeen -rahimullaah &#8211; gave the example that an engagement ring is a Tiwalah and he explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;If the people believe that it can benefit or harm, then with this intention it is from the minor Shirk, and even if this intention is not there &#8211; and this is highly unlikely that he does not have this intention &#8211; it is resemblance of the Christians since it is taken from them.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Qawl al-Mufeed ala Kitaab al Tawheed 1 /228-229]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4 &#8211; Wearing Brass Bracelets to Battle Against Rheumatism</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh AbdulAziz Ibn Baz &#8211; rahimullaah &#8211; said regarding these type of bracelets after having exhausted all the evidences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;The opinion which I hold in this issue is leaving these previously mentioned bracelets and not to use them; this is to block the path leading to Shirk, to terminate the aspect of any Fitnah with these bracelets and to incline to them, also that souls become attached to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, in having the incentive in turning the Muslim with his heart to Allaah -Subhanahu- and to have trust in Him, and reliance on Him sufficing with the means which are in accordance with the Sharia&#8217; and their allowance is well known with committing Shirk.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Majmoo&#8217; Fatawa ash-Shaykh Ibn Baaz vol.1 p.207]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">O Brothers, know that the Muslim ummah is divided into three groups with respect to Allaah’s Pre-Decree:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The First Group:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They went <strong>overboard</strong> in their affirmation of Allaah’s Pre-Decree, denying that the human being has any ability or choice in the matter. They hold that “<strong>A person has no ability or choice – he is controlled and has no free will, just like a tree when it is blown by the wind</strong>.” They do not distinguish between a person’s action that occur as a result of his choice and an action of his that occurs without him choosing so. No doubt, these people are astray, because what is known from the Religion by necessity, and from the intellect and customs, is that a human being knows the difference between an action he chooses to do and an action he is forced into doing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Second Group:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They went to <strong>extremes in their affirmation of a person’s ability and choice</strong>, such that they negated Allaah having any part in Willing or Choosing or Creating what action a person does. And they claimed that a person is independently responsible for producing his action. This is such that a group amongst them went too far, saying: “<strong>Allaah does not know what actions His servants will do until after it occurs from them</strong>.” These people have also gone to extremes and shown great radicalism in affirming a human being’s ability and choice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Third Group:</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the ones who truly believe, and so Allaah has guided them concerning that which is disagreed upon from the truth. They are Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah. They have treaded the moderate path and the middle course, which is based on religious and logical proofs and evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they say: The actions that Allaah introduces into existence are divided into two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: The actions from Allaah that He causes to occur in His Creation. No one has any choice in regard to these actions, and they are such as when rain descends, when the earth produces vegetation, when life or death occurs, when health or sickness befalls and so on and so forth – from the many things that can be observed occurring within the creation. Without doubt, no one has any part in choosing or willing for these things to transpire, but rather it is only Allaah who wills that to happen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: The actions that the creation, i.e. all of the various types of creatures that possess a willingness, do. These actions occur as a result their choosing and wanting to do them, since Allaah gave them the ability to do that, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“To whoever amongst you wills to go straight.”</strong> [Surah At-Takweer: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Among you is he who desires the worldly life and among you is he who desires the Hereafter.”</strong> [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 152]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“So whoever wishes, then let him believe, and whoever wishes then let him disbelieve.”</strong> [Surah Al-Kahf: 29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A human being knows the difference between what occurs from him as a result of his own free will and what occurs from him as a result of being compelled and forced. So for example, when a human being climbs a ladder to get to the roof of a house, he ascends the ladder out of his own free will, and while knowing that he freely chose to do so. But when he trips and falls down from the roof, he knows that he did not choose to do that. So he can tell the difference between these two actions – that he freely chose to do the former, while he was compelled to do the latter. Every human being knows this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, when a person is stricken with a sickness in which his urine constantly flows out, this urine comes out from him without his desiring or choosing that. But when he is in a healthy state and free from this sickness, the urine comes out from him when he wills and chooses. So he knows the difference between this and that. No one can deny the difference between the two.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the same goes with everything else that occurs to a person – he can tell the difference between what occurs due to his free will and what occurs due to his being coerced and forced. As a matter of fact, due to Allaah’s Mercy there are some actions a person may do on his own free will, yet not be held accountable for any of them, as is the case with a person when he sleeps or forgets. In the story of the people of the Cave, Allaah tells us:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And you would have thought them to be awake whereas they were asleep. And We turned them on their right and on their left sides.”</strong> [Surah Al-Kahf: 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They were the ones who turned around in their sleep, yet Allaah ascribes the action to Himself. This is because when a person sleeps, he has no choice or free will in his actions, and he will not be held accountable for actions done in this state, so the act is attributed to Allaah. The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>“Whoever forgets while fasting, and eats or drinks, then he should complete his fast because it was only Allaah who fed him and gave him to drink.”</strong> [2] So he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) attributed this act of feeding and quenching thirst to Allaah, because the action occurred from the individual without him being aware of it, so it is as if it happened without him choosing to do it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of us know the difference between when a person experiences pain or joy within himself at times without choosing so, and not knowing the reason why and between him experiencing these pains or these joys as a result of an act that he did himself. This matter, all praise be to Allaah is clear and there is no confusion over it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brothers: If we were to take the view of the first group (i.e. the Jabariyyah) who went to extremes in affirming the Divine Pre-Decree, the Religion would be invalidated from its very foundation. This is since the belief that a person has no choice or free will in his actions necessitates that he not be praised for a praiseworthy act or that he be blamed for a blameworthy act, since in reality they were not done by his choice or free will. So then this would mean that Allaah, may He be far removed from it, is oppressing those who sin when He punishes and recompenses them for their acts because He has punished them for something they had no free choice or free will in! This no doubt clearly contradicts the Qur’aan. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And his companion (angel) will say: ‘Here is (his record) ready with me!’ (Allaah will say to the angels): ‘Both of you, throw into the Hellfire every stubborn disbeliever, hinderer of good, transgressor, doubter, he who set up another god with Allaah. So both of you cast him into the Severe Torment.’ His (devil) companion will say: ‘Our Lord! I did not push him to transgress, but rather it was he himself who was in error, far astray. Allaah will say: ‘Do not dispute in front of Me, I had already sent the threat to you in advance. The Word (Ordainment) that comes from Me cannot be changed, and I am not unjust to the slaves.’”</strong> [Surah Qaaf: 23-29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah clarifies that this punishment is not oppression from Him, but rather that it is complete justice since He had previously given them a warning and clarified to them the various paths and explained the truth and falsehood to them, but they chose for themselves the path of falsehood. So there didn’t remain any proof for them before Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if we were to take this false view, it would invalidate Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Messengers, bearing glad tidings and warning in order that mankind would not have any argument (i.e. proof) against Allaah after the (coming of) Messengers.”</strong> [Surah An-Nisaa: 165]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah denies that mankind should have any excuses after the sending of Messengers because the proof has been established against them with that. So if the Divine PreDecree was an excuse for them, this excuse would be infinite even after the advent of the messengers since Allaah’s Pre-Decree did not cease and will not cease to exist before and after the sending of messengers. So therefore, this view is invalidated by the religious texts, and it is invalidated by reality, as we have explained in the previous examples.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who hold the second view, then the religious texts and reality also refute them since the texts clearly state that a person’s will is subject to Allaah’s Will:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“To whoever amongst you wills to go straight. However, you cannot will unless Allaah, Lord of the Universe, wills.”</strong> [Surah At-Takweer: 28-29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And your Lord creates whatever He wills and chooses.”</strong> [Surah Al-Qasas: 68]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> “And Allaah calls (you) to the Abode of Peace, and guides whomever He wills to the Straight Path.”</strong> [Surah Yoonus: 25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who hold this view (i.e. the Qadariyyah) are in reality invalidating one of the aspects of Allaah’s Lordship, and they are also claiming that there can be found in Allaah’s dominion that which Allaah did not will or create, when in fact Allaah wills everything, creates everything and has pre-decreed everything. They also contradict that which is known by necessity, which is that everything that is created belongs to Allaah, their essence as well as their attributes, there being no distinction between the attribute and the essence. Therefore, everything belongs to Allaah so it is not possible for there to be anything in His dominion that He did not desire. So what path should a person take and what is his solution if Allaah has pre-decreed that He go astray and not be guided?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We say: The answer to this is that Allaah only guides those who deserve to be guided, and He leads astray only those who deserve to be led astray. Allaah says:<strong> “So when they turned away, Allaah turned their hearts away.”</strong> [Surah As-Saff: 5] And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“So because they breached their covenant, We cursed them and made their hearts grow hard. They change the words from their (right) places and have abandoned a good part of the Message that was sent to them.”</strong> [Surah AlMaa’idah: 13] So Allaah clarified that what caused the person to go astray was himself. A person, as we have explained previously, doesn’t know what Allaah has pre-decreed for him since he doesn’t know what has been pre-decreed until after it occurs. So he doesn’t know if Allaah has decreed for him to be astray or guided. So if this is the case, how can he take the path of misguidance, then use as an excuse the argument that this is what Allaah willed for him? Wouldn’t it be more befitting for him to tread the path of guidance and then say that Allah has guided me to the Straight Path?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it right for him to be a Jabaree, i.e. claim that he is forced, when he is misguided, and a Qadaree, i.e. that Allaah has no part in his deeds, when he obeys?! Never! II does not befit a person to claim that he was forced when he finds himself upon misguidance and sin. So when he goes astray and disobeys Allaah, he says: “This is something that has been written and pre-decreed for me, and I am not able to remove myself from what Allaah has ordained for me.” Yet when he does good deeds and Allaah grants him obedience and guidance, he claims that this came solely from himself, saying: “I attained this by myself.” So he becomes a Qadaree when it comes to guidance and a Jabaree when it comes to disobedience. This is not possible ever. So in reality, a person has ability and will. The door to guidance is not any more hidden than the door to sustenance and the door to seeking knowledge. A person, as is well known to everybody, has pre-decreed for him whatever he has from sustenance. But yet in spite of this, he strives for the means of sustenance in his country and outside of it, on the right and on the left. He doesn’t just sit at home and say: “Provision has been pre-decreed for me and it will come to me.” On the contrary, he strives for the means of sustenance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet sustenance itself goes hand and hand with actions/works, as has been authentically reported on the Prophet, in the narration of Ibn Mas’ood, who said that he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said:<strong> “Verily, the creation of each of you is brought together in his mother’s womb for forty days in the form of a seed. Then he becomes a clot of blood for the same amount of time, then a morsel of flesh for the same amount of time. Then an angel is sent to him and commanded with four things: to record his sustenance, his lifespan, his actions, and whether he will be miserable or happy.”</strong> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this sustenance is written just as the good and evil actions are written. So how is it that you can go here and there, traversing land and sea, seeking the sustenance of the world and yet you don’t perform any righteous deed seeking the sustenance of the Hereafter or the success of Paradise? Indeed, these two aspects are one and the same. There is no difference between the two of them. So likewise, you strive for your sustenance and you strive for your livelihood and to prolong your lifespan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But when you become ill with a sickness, you travel through all the regions of the world looking for a skilled doctor who will cure your sickness. This is even though whatever has been pre-decreed for you as your lifespan will come to be and it will not increase or decrease. Yet you do not rely on this and say: “I will remain sick and bedridden at home, and if Allaah has decreed that my lifespan will be prolonged, then it will be prolonged.” Rather, we will find you striving with all of your might and energy to find a doctor whom you regard will be the best one at whose hands Allaah will ordain your recovery. So why don’t you do acts for the Hereafter and righteous deeds the same way you do acts for this worldly life?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We stated previously that: The Divine Pre-Ordainment is a hidden secret, you have no way of finding out about it. So right now, you are between two paths – a path that will take you to salvation and success, and a path that will take you to destruction and regret. So right now, you are standing between these two paths with a free choice. There is no one in front of you preventing you from taking the right path or the left path. If you wish, you can go here, and if you wish, you can go there. So how can you take the left path and say: “This has been pre-decreed for me!” Isn’t it more befitting for you to take the right path and say: “This has been pre-decreed for me?!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if you want to go on a journey to some other country and before you lies two roads, one of which is paved, short and safe, while the other is unpaved, long and dangerous, we would find you choosing the short, paved and safe road and not the other one. So this figurative road is similar to it and doesn’t differ from it at all. However, it is the souls and desires that sometimes govern and take over the mind. The believer must take over and control his desires. And when his mind judges, the mind, according to its correct meaning, should prevent a person from what harms it and lead it to what benefits and pleases it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With this it becomes clear that people have a free choice when it comes to their actions, and that they are not coerced. And just as he has a free choice in the acts of his worldly affairs, if he wills he will put out this product or make that his business, then likewise he has a free choice with regard to the affairs of the Hereafter. In fact, the paths of the Hereafter are clearer by far than the paths of this worldly life, because the One who clarifies the paths of the Hereafter is Allaah, in His Book and upon the tongue of His Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam). So the paths of the Hereafter are clearer and more lucid than the paths of the worldly life. But in spite of this, people still tread the paths of the worldly life, which have no guaranteed results and abandon the paths of the Hereafter, whose results are guaranteed and known since they are affirmed by Allaah’s promise, and Allaah does not break His promises.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having said this, we say that Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah affirm all of this and make it their Creed and Belief that: A person acts on his own free will and says what he wants. However, his desire and choosing are subject to Allaah’s Will and Desire. Furthermore, Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah believe that Allaah’s Will is subject to His Wisdom, and that it is not a pure and absolute Will, but rather a will that is dependent on His Wisdom. This is because one of Allaah’s Names is Al-Hakeem (The MostWise), and the Most-Wise is the One who judges matters precisely realistically and religiously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And based on His Wisdom, He decrees guidance for the one who desires it and for the one whom He knows wants the truth and whose heart is upon steadfastness. And He decrees misguidance for the one who is not like this – the one who when Islaam is presented to him, his heart becomes constricted as if he were being forced to ascend to the sky. So Allaah’s Wisdom refuses to let this person be from among the guided, unless Allaah renews his determination for him and changes his desire to another desire. And Allaah is Able to do all things. However, Allaah’s Wisdom insists that the causes be closely linked to the effects.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">One thing we must understand is that defaming these chosen and unique individuals is equal to defaming the Religion itself, since it was none other than them who passed the Religion down to those who came after them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we already mentioned the words of Abu Zur&#8217;ah, in which he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;The only ones who brought this Qur&#8217;aan and Sunan (plural of Sunnah) to us are the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger. (So) they only wish to disparage and demolish our witnesses so that they can nullify the Book and the Sunnah, whereas they are more deserving of being disparaged for they are the heretics (zanaadiqah).&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This refers to those who seek to belittle any of the Companions. It implies that the one who defames them does not harm them in the least but rather he only benefits them, based on afore-mentioned hadeeth of the &#8220;<strong>bankrupt person</strong>.&#8221; The one who defames them only causes harm to himself. So whoever finds in his heart love for them and a lack of hatred for them, and withholds his tongue from mentioning anything but good about them, then he should praise Allaah for this blessing. And He should ask Allaah to keep him firm upon this guidance. And whoever holds any hatred for them in his heart and his tongue is loose in mentioning them with that which does not befit them, then he must fear Allaah and desist from these crimes. And he must repent to Allaah while the door of repentance remains open in front of him, before he regrets it at a time when regrets will be of no benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Lord do not cause our hearts to go astray after having guided us and grant us mercy from Yourself, indeed You are the One who grants all requests.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Our Lord! Forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in Faith. And put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed. Our Lord, You are indeed full of kindness, most Merciful.&#8221;</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align:center;"><strong>بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم </strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>IMAAM AN-NASAA·EE</strong> reported in his &#8220;`Amalul-Yawm wal Laylah&#8221; (no. 250):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong>Aboo Bakr ibn Naafi` related to us, saying: Bahz narrated to us, saying: Hammaad ibn Salamah narrated to us, saying: Thaabit narrated to us: from Anas: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">that some people said to Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم): &#8220;O best one of us, and the son of the best of us! O our chief and the son of our chief!&#8221; So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: &lt;&lt; O people! Say what you have to say, and do not let Satan mislead you into following desires. I do not want you to raise me above the position which Allaah -the Most High &#8211; gave to me. I am Muhammad the son of &#8216;Abdullaah. His Slave and His Messenger</span>.</strong> &gt;&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also reported by Ahmad, Ibn Humayd in &#8220;al-Muntakhab&#8221;, Ibn Mandah in &#8220;atTawheed&#8221;, and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaikh al-Albaanee</strong> said: &#8220;Its chain of narration is &#8220;Saheeh&#8221; to the standard of Muslim.” [&#8220;Ghaayatul-Maraam&#8221; (no. 127); &#8220;as-Saheehah&#8221; (nos. 1097 &amp; 1572).</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>***</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Shaikh Saalih al-Fawzaan</strong></span> -hafizahullaah- said in &#8220;I`aanatul-mustafeed bisharh Kitaabit-Tawheed&#8221; (2/435- ):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8230;Their saying: &#8220;O our chief and the son of our chief!&#8221; was something the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) rebuked; and likewise their saying: &#8220;O best one of us and the son of the best of us! &#8220;The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) also criticised this, because the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not desire praise. Rather he wanted to be described with that which Allaah-the Most High &#8211; described him with: with Messengership and Prophethood, and that is sufficient honour for him (صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying: &lt;&lt; And do not let Satan mislead you into following desires ( laa yastahwiyannakumush-Shaytaan). &gt;&gt; : (yastahwiyannakum) means: that he leads you into following desires which lead away from the path of Allaah -the Mighty and Majestic; or it is from &#8220;al-Hawiyy&#8221;, which means falling into destruction; meaning: let not Satan cause you to fall into misguidance, or let him not cause you to fall into desires which lead you astray from the path of Allaah -the Mighty and Majestic; for Satan misleads people in gradual stages, until he brings about their destruction. So the Muslim should be aware of Satan, and his misleading in gradual stages, and his leading into following desires. He should not relax with regard to Satan about anything, even if it is something slight, since it will become greater and larger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &lt;&lt; I am Muhammad, Allaah’s Slave and His Messenger. &gt;&gt;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the correct way to mention him (صلى الله عليه و سلم) with praise: servitude and Messengership.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&lt;&lt; I do not love that you raise me above the position which Allaah -the Mighty and Majestic-gave to me. &gt;&gt;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the wisdom behind his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) forbiddance: that he feared for them, in their praising of him, that they would raise him above the position which Allaah gave to him; and that is Servitude (`Uboodiyyah) and Messengership (Risaalah). So he feared that they would start to believe that he had some aspects of Lordship ( Ruboobiyyah), just as happened to the Christians with regard to `Eesaa -`alaihis-Salaatu was-Salaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the saying &#8220;His Slave&#8221; (`Abduhu ) prevents excessive praise (ghuluww); and the saying &#8220;His Messenger&#8221; (Rasooluhu) prevents belittlement of him (صلى الله عليه و سلم). So you should not just say that he is only a man and a human, and think that he has no distinction over the rest of mankind, as is said by the Unbelievers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;You are nothing but a man like us&#8221;</span></em> [Sooratush-Shu`araa·. (26): 154]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>SO THESE TWO HADEETH [1] GIVE US SOME TREMENDOUS POINTS OF BENEFIT:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] i.e. This hadeeth along with a similar hadeeth of `Abdullaah ibn ash-Shikhkheerradiyallaahu `anhu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THE FIRST POINT OF BENEFIT:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is a warning against going beyond the limits (al-ghuluww) with regard to him (صلى الله عليه و سلم), by way of excessive praise; and that he should only be described with those attributes given to him by Allaah: Servitude ( al-`Uboodiyyah) and Messengership (ar-Risaalah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for going beyond the limits regarding him, and describing him as removing troubles and forgiving sins, and that rescue and relief can be sought from him- `alaihis-Salaatu was-Salaam-after his death: as actually occurs with many of those who have deviated today, in what they call &#8220;poems of praise of the Prophet&#8221;- such as &#8220;al-Burdah&#8221; of al-Boosayree; and its like from what has been said by the deviants; then this is excessiveness ( ghuluww) which has led to shirk; such as the saying of al-Boosayree:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>‘O noblest one of the creation! I have none to seek protection</em><br />
<em> and shelter with besides </em><em>you, when disasters strike;</em><br />
<em> And if you do not take hold of my hand in the Hereafter,</em><br />
<em> as a favour from you, then O how I shall fall!</em><br />
<em> Since from your generosity comes the whole world and its treasures;</em><br />
<em> and from your knowledge is the knowledge of the Preserved Tablet and the </em><em>Pen.’</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is going beyond the due limits (ghuluww), and Allaah&#8217;s refuge is sought, which led to Unbelief and Shirk, to such an extent the he did not leave anything for Allaah at all! He ascribed everything to the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم): This world and the Hereafter ascribed to the Messenger. The Preserved Tablet and the Pen ascribed to the Messenger. That none can save from the Torment on the Day of Resurrection except the Messenger. So what then remains for Allaah- the Mighty and Majestic?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a poem which they circulate, memorise, and recite during the &#8220;mawlid&#8221; (Innovated birthday celebrations). Likewise other poems of Kufr and Shirk, particularly that which they recite during the innovated mawlid (birthday celebrations) from poems of Shirk. The cause of all of this is exceeding the bounds (ghuluww) with regard to the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for praising him (صلى الله عليه و سلم) with that which Allaah described him with, that he is a Slave [of Allaah] (`Abd) and Messenger (Rasool), and that he is the best of the creation, then there is no harm in this ; just as occurs in the poetry of the Companions who praised him, like the poetry of Hassaan ibn Thaabit, and Ka`b ibn Zuhayr, and likewise Ka`b ibn Maalik, and `Abdullaah ibn Rawaahah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are pure and good poems. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) heard them and approved of them because they did not contain any excessive praise (ghuluww); rather they contained a mention of his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) characteristics…. &gt;&gt;. ”</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>***</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Shaikh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-`Uthaymeen</strong></span> &#8211; rahimahullaah- said in &#8220;alQawlul-Mufeed `alaa Kitaabit-Tawheed&#8221;. ( 2/519-521):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;His saying: &#8220;I am Muhammad, the Slave of Allaah and His Messenger&#8221;: Muhammad is his personal name and &#8220;`Abdullaah’ (Allaah&#8217;s Slave) and &#8220;Rasooluhu&#8221; (His Messenger) are two attributes of his; and these two characteristics are the finest and most profound of the characteristics of the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم). So therefore Allaah -the Most High &#8211; described him with Servitude with regard to the greatest of positions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">in the position of His sending the Qur·aan down to him. He-the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Exalted is He who sent down the Criterion to His Slave&#8221;</span></em> [Sooratul-Furqaan (25):1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and He described him with it in the situation of the Night-Journey. He-the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Perfect is He who took His Slave on a journey by night&#8221;</span></em> [Sooratul-Israa· (17):1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and He described him with it in the situation of his ascent through the heavens. He -the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;So He revealed to His Slave whatever He revealed&#8221;</span></em> [Sooratun-Najm (53): 10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and He described him with it in the situation of defending him and challenging his opponents. He-the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And if you are in doubt concerning that which We sent down to Our Slave&#8221;</span></em> [Sooratul-Baqarah (2):23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and the same was the case with the (rest of the) Prophets, such as in His Saying &#8211; He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;O descendants of those whom We carried in the ship along with Nooh. Indeed he was a thankful slave&#8221;</em></span> [Sooratul-Israa· (17): 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a special and specific Servitude, and it is the highest of the types of servitude. Then servitude to Allaah is the greatest of the attributes of mankind, since man will either worship Allaah or Satan. He-the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;Did I not command you, O descendants of Aadam, that you should not worship Satan. Indeed he is a clear enemy to you. And that you should worship Me alone. That is the Straight Path&#8221;</em></span> [Soorah YaaSeen: (36):60-61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibnul-Qayyim</strong> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;They fled away from the Servitude for which they were created, and were afflicted instead with servitude to the self and to Satan… (And His Messenger): Meaning: The One sent by Him to the whole of mankind. He- the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;Say: O Muhammad! I am indeed the Messenger of Allaah to you all&#8221;</em></span> [Sooratul-A`raaf (7):158]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is at the pinnacle of the levels of righteousness. He the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And whoever obeys Allaah and the Messenger, then they will be along with those whom Allaah has bestowed favour upon; from the Prophets, their true and sincere followers, the martyrs, and the righteous; and what a fine company they are&#8221;</span></em> [Sooratun-Nisaa· (4):69]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So amongst the Prophets was the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم), indeed he was the most excellent of them…</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And two groups went to extreme with regard to the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A group who went to such an extreme that they worshipped him, and they took him for times of ease and hardship, and they worshipped him and called upon him besides Allaah;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A group denied him; and claimed that he was a liar, a sorcerer, a poet, a madman, a soothsayer, and the like;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying &#8220;Allaah’s Slave and His Messenger’ is a refutation of both of the groups…”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 43:</strong> It was reported from the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) that he was bewitched. So we would like you to talk about the means by which he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was bewitched. Furthermore, is it contradictory to the status of Prophethood that bewitchment of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) took place?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong> It has been confirmed in the Saheehayn (al- Bukhaaree and Muslim collections of Ahaadeeth) and in other traditions that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was enchanted. <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>His bewitchment, however, did not affect him from the aspect of Legislation or Revelation</strong></span>. The utmost thing in this respect is that he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) reached a stage whereby he began to fancy that he was doing a thing which he was not actually doing. The magic material intended for the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was the cast of a Jew known by the name Labeed ibn al-A’sam. Allaah, The One free of all imperfection and The Most High, protected the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) from it, until he was informed of what occurred to him by way of inspiration. He used to seek refuge in Allaah against evil by the recitation of al-Mu’awwithatayn, soorat al- Falaq and soorat An-Naas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And this kind of magic does not influence the state of Prophethood, since it did not affect the behavior of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) regarding the Revelation and acts of worship</strong></span>, as we have mentioned earlier. Some people have denied that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was bewitched under the pretext that such saying necessitates believing the unbelievers, and even the wrongdoers who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">You follow none but a witched man.</span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-Israa’ (17): 47].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt, however, that such saying does not obligate approving those unbelievers and wrongdoers in what they have attributed to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم). Since they claim that the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is bewitched in what he utters from Revelation, and what he has brought is mere hallucination, like the hallucination of the bewitched. However, the bewitching that occurred to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not affect him in anything of the Revelation whatsoever, or in anything of the acts of worship. And it is forbidden that we deny his enchantment based upon our misunderstanding of the texts.</p>

<p>This short clip was extracted by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/">AbdurRahman.Org</a> from # 01 of the Audio Series: <strong><a title="Permanent Link to Explanation of Aqeedah at-Tahaawiyyah – Dawud Burbank [Audio|En]" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/09/25/explanation-of-aqeedah-at-tahaawiyyah-dawud-burbank/" rel="bookmark">Explanation of Aqeedah at-Tahaawiyyah</a> </strong>– Dawud Burbank [Audio|En]</p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Transcription of the above audio clip:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aqeedah (creed and belief) is the <strong>foundation</strong> of the religion and it (&#8216;aqeedah) is what is contained in the <strong>testification</strong> (shahaadah) that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah. And it is the first pillar from the pillars of Islaam.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, it is an <strong>obligation to give importance</strong> to it (`aqeedah) and to give care and attention to it and to acquire knowledge of it and knowledge of whatever will damage it so that the person can be upon clear insight and can be upon a correct creed and belief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since if the person&#8217;s religion is established upon a sound, correct foundation then it will be a straight and true religion that he is upon &#8211; one that is acceptable to Allaah and if it (his religion) is based upon a shaky or disturbed `aqeedah (creed) or if his religion is based upon an &#8216;aqeedah (creed) which is corrupt then his religion will not be correct and it will be without a foundation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this is why the <strong>scholars</strong> rahimahumullaah used to give importance to the affair of &#8216;aqeedah and they were not laxed about explaining it in their lessons and whenever they had an opportunity. The later person used to transmit it from the one who came before him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <strong>Companions</strong> radiyAllaahu `anhum did not have any doubts about what came in the Qur&#8217;aan and what came in the Sunnah of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallAllaahu`alayhi wa sallam. So their `aqeedah (creed and belief) was based upon the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallAllaahu`alayhi wa sallam and they were not afflicted by any doubt in that regard nor any hesitation. So, whatever Allaah said and whatever His Messenger sallAllaahu`alayhi wa sallam said, they took it as their creed and belief and they took it as their religion. And they did not need any further book to be written for them after that since this was something fully accepted by them and something that was certain with them; their creed (&#8216;aqeedah) was the Book and the Sunnah. And then their students proceeded upon that from the <strong>Taabi`een</strong> (the next generation after the Companions) &#8211; those who took from them. So, there was no disputing in `aqeedah (creed and belief); it was an affair which was fully accepted (undisputed); and their source was the Book and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But when the <strong>sects and the differences</strong> arose and appeared, and when people entered into the religion who were such that the creed and `aqeedah was not firmly grounded in his heart or those who entered into Islaam whilst still carrying some deviated ideas with them, and when there arose in Islaam people who did not refer back to the Book nor to the Sunnah in `aqeedah, rather, they referred back to principles and methodologies which had been established by people of misguidance by themselves. When all of this happened then the a&#8217;immah (the imaams) of Islaam at this time needed to clarify (make explanation and clarification of) the correct `aqeedah (belief and creed) and they needed to carefully record it and write it down and narrate it from the scholars of the Ummah. So therefore, they wrote down the <strong>books of creed and belief</strong> and they gave attention to that; and this became a reference for those who came after them from the Ummah and it will be so until the establishment of the last Hour.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is an example of the Protection of Allaah, the Most High for this religion and Allaah&#8217;s taking care of this religion &#8211; that He provided for it trustworthy carriers to convey it just as it came from Allaah and His Messenger and to repel the false interpretations of the negators and the false declarations of the Creator&#8217;s being like the creation<span style="color:#000000;"><a style="color:#000000;" href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/belief/aqeedah/">.</a> </span>So these scholars came and passed on as inheritance this creed (`aqeedah), the later ones taking it from the earlier ones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from as-Salaf as-Saalih (the pious predecessors) who used to be upon the sound and firm belief and creed (i`tiqaad) taken from Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallAllaahu`alayhi wa sallam and from his Companions and from the Taabi`een were the <strong>four imaams</strong>: Imaam Aboo Haneefah, Imaam Maalik, Imaam ash-Shaafi`ee and Imaam Ahmad and others from the imaams, those who stood and defended the correct `aqeedah (belief and creed) and who confirmed it, explained it and taught it to the students.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <strong>followers of the four imaams</strong> (their students who came after them) used to give attention to this creed and belief; they used to study it and caused their students to learn it. And many books were written about it upon the methodology of the Book and the Sunnah and upon what the chosen Messenger, al-Mustafaa sallAllaahu`alayhi wa sallam was upon and his companions radiyAllaahu `anhum and the Taabi`een. So, they refuted the false beliefs and the deviated beliefs, and they clearly explained how they were counterfeit and baseless. And the same was done by the <strong>imaams of hadeeth</strong> such as: Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh and al-Bukhaaree and Muslim and Imaam Ibn Khuzaymah and Imaam Ibn Qutaybah; and from the imaams of tafseer (explanation) of the Qur&#8217;aan such as Imaam at-Tabaree and Imaam Ibn Katheer and Imaam al-Baghwee and others from the imaams of tafseer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They (all) wrote works in this regard (explaining the correct belief) and they called them <strong>Kutub As-Sunnah</strong> &#8211; books of the Sunnah; for example, Kitaab as-Sunnah of Ibn Abee `Aasim and the book as- Sunnah of `Abdullaah ibn Ahmad ibn Hanbal and the book as-Sunnah of Al-Khallaal and the book ash-Sharee`ah of Al-Aajurree and other than that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] As is shown by the hadeeth of Ibn `Umar radiyAllaahu anhumaa who said, &#8220;Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallAllaahu`alayhi wa sallam said, &#8216;Islaam is built upon five: the shahaadah (testification) that none had the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah, and correct establishment of the prayer, and giving the zakaat, and the hajj, and fasting in Ramadaan&#8217;.&#8221; The hadeeth is reported by Bukhaaree as no.8 and reported by Muslim.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">We are obligated to have Faith in everything that the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) informed us about and in what has been authentically attributed to him through reports, whether we witnessed it or it was hidden from us. We know that it is a reality and the truth. This is the same with regard to whether we comprehend it or we do not comprehend it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We do not go beyond the outer actuality (i.e. literalness) of its meaning, such as the hadeeth concerning the <strong>Israa and the Mi&#8217;raaj</strong>.[20] It occurred while the Prophet was awake and not in a dream, for indeed the Quraish denied it and considered it something incredible. And they did not used to deny dreams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example of that, is when the <strong>angel of death approached Moosaa</strong> in order to take his soul. He (Moosaa) struck him and gouged his eye, so he returned to his Lord who gave him his eye back.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example of that: are the signs of the Hour, such as the emergence of the <strong>Dajjaal</strong>, the <strong>descent of &#8216;Eesaa</strong> bin Maryam, who will then kill him, the coming out of <strong>Ya&#8217;jooj and Ma&#8217;jooj</strong>, the emergence of the <strong>Beast</strong>, the <strong>rising of the sun from the west</strong>, and all that is related to this from what has been authentically reported. [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <strong>punishment and pleasure of the grave</strong> are true. The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) would seek refuge from it (the punishment) and he commanded that it be done in every prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The trial of the grave is true. The questioning of Munkar and Nakeer is true. The resurrection after death is true, and that will occur when Israafeel blows on the trumpet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And behold from the graves they will come out quickly to their Lord.”</span> [Surah YaaSeen (36): 51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mankind will be gathered on the Day of Judgement, barefoot, naked, uncircumcised, and having nothing with them (i.e. possessions). They will stop at the final place of standing, until our Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) intercedes for them and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, Blessed and Exalted, reckons with them (i.e. judges them). The <strong>Balances</strong> will be set up, the <strong>records</strong> will be distributed and the pages containing the deeds of each individual will be dispersed into the right hands and the left hands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Then as for him who will be given his record in his right hand, he surely, will receive an easy reckoning. And will return back to his family in joy! But whoever is given his record behind his back (or in his left hand), he will invoke (for his) destruction. And he shall enter a blazing Fire and made to taste it’s burning flames.”</span> [Surah Al-Inshiqaaq (84): 7-12]</p>
<p>The <strong>Balance (Al-Meezaan)</strong> has two scales and a tongue, with which it will weigh the deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Then those whose Balances (of good deeds) are heavy, they are the successful. And those whose Balances (of good deeds) are light, they are those who lose their own selves, in Hell will they abide.”</span> [Surah Al-Mu&#8217;minoon (23): 102103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Prophet Muhammad (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) will have the <strong>Fountain (AlHawd)</strong> on the Day of Judgement. Its water is whiter than milk and sweeter than honey. Its drinking vessels are as numerous as the stars in the sky. Whosoever drinks a serving from it, will never thirst again after that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Bridge</strong> is true. The righteous ones will cross it and the evil ones will fall from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) <strong>will intercede</strong> for the members of his ummah who have entered the Hellfire due to their major sins. Thus they will be extracted from it due to his (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) interceding (for them), but only after having been set ablaze and burned to ashes and charcoal. Then they will enter Paradise due to his intercession.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There will also be interceding done by the rest of the prophets, believers and angels. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And they cannot intercede except for him with whom He is pleased. And they stand in awe for fear of Him.”</span> [Surah Al-Anbiyaa (21): 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The intercession of the interceders will be of no avail to the disbelievers. <strong>Paradise and the Hellfire</strong> are two creations that will not cease to exist. Paradise is the abode of the close friends of Allaah, while the Hellfire is the place of punishment for His enemies. The inhabitants of Paradise will abide therein (i.e. Paradise) forever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Verily, the sinful evildoers will be in the torment of Hell to abide therein forever. (Their torment) will not be lightened for them, and they will be plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows.”</span> [Surah Az-Zukhruf (43): 74-75]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Death</strong> will be brought in the form of a sturdy ram and slaughtered between Paradise and Hellfire. Then it will be said: <span style="color:#008000;">“O inhabitants of Paradise! Eternity for you and no (more) death! And O inhabitants of Hellfire! Eternity for you and no (more) death!”</span> [22]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaikh-ul-lslaam Ibn Taimiyyah said in his book AI-&#8216;Aqeedat-ul-Waasitiyyah:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Among the Principles of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah is maintaining pure hearts and tongues towards the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم), as Allaah has described them in His saying: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;And those who come after them say: &#8216;Our Lord! Forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in Faith. And put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed. Our Lord, You are indeed full of kindness, most Merciful.&#8217;</span> [Surah Al-Hashr: 10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And (from their principles is) obedience to the Prophet with regard to his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) saying: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;Do not revile my Companions! For by the One whose Hand my soul is in, if one of you were to give away the size of mount Uhud in gold for charity, it would not equal a mudd of one of them nor even half of it.&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They accept what is stated in the Qur&#8217;aan, the Sunnah and the Consensus concerning their (the Companion&#8217;s) virtues and high status. And they give preference to those who spent their wealth and fought (in the Way of Allaah) before the Victory, which refers to the Treaty of al-Hudaibiyah, over those who gave their wealth and fought after it. They give precedence to the Muhaajireen over the Ansaar. And they believe that Allaah said to the people who fought in (the Battle of) Badr &#8211; who numbered over three hundred people: <strong>&#8216;Do whatever you wish, for I have already forgiven you.&#8217;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they believe that no one who pledged their allegiance to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) under the tree will enter the Hellfire, as the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) informed us. In fact, Allaah was pleased with them and they were pleased with Him. And they were more than one thousand four hundred people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They designate to Paradise whoever the Messenger of Allaah testified will be in Paradise, such as the Ten (Companions), Thaabit bin Qays bin Shammas and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They confirm what has been reported in tawaatur form on the Commander of the Believers, &#8216;Alee Ibn Abee Taalib and others that: The best of this ummah after its Prophet are Abu Bakr; then &#8216;Umar. Then they place &#8216;Uthmaan third and &#8216;Alee fourth, may Allaah be pleased with all of them. This is as is indicated in the athaar (reports from the Sahaabah) and as was unanimously agreed upon that &#8216;Uthmaan had precedence (over &#8216;Alee) for being pledged allegiance to (for the Khilaafah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In spite of this, after unanimously agreeing to the precedence of Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar, some of Ahl-us-Sunnah have disagreed with regard to &#8216;Uthmaan and &#8216;Alee as to which of them is better. So a group of them gave precedence to &#8216;Uthmaan and then remained silent, and placed &#8216;Alee as the fourth. And another group gave precedence to &#8216;Alee. And yet another group remained neutral. But the affair of Al-us-Sunnah settled upon giving precedence to &#8216;Uthmaan and then &#8216;Alee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regardless, this issue of &#8216;Uthmaan and &#8216;Alee is not from the principles by which the one who disagrees concerning it becomes misguided (and deviant), according to the majority of the (scholars of) Ahl-us-Sunnah. Rather, the issue in which the one who opposes becomes misguided is the issue of the Khilaafah &#8211; and it is that they (must) believe that the Khaleefah after Allaah&#8217;s Messenger was Abu Bakr, then &#8216;Umar, then &#8216;Uthmaan, then &#8216;Alee. And whoever attacks the Khilaafah of any one of them, then he is more astray than the donkey of his people.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Then he mentioned that they have love and affection for the Members of the Household of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger and that they preserve the Will (final requests) of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger concerning them. And that they have affection for the Wives of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger, the Mothers of the Believers and believe that they will be his wives in the Hereafter.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Then he said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;They absolve themselves from the way of the Rawaafid &#8211; those who hate the Companions and revile them &#8211; and from the way of the Nawaasib &#8211; those who abuse the Members of the (Prophet&#8217;s) Household &#8211; through speech or action. And they refrain from (delving into) the disputes that occurred between the Companions. And they say: These narrations that have been reported concerning their faults have in them some that are false, some that have had things added to them, some that have had parts omitted from them, and some that have been changed from their original state. As for those narrations that are authentic (concerning their faults), then they (the Companions) are excused (and forgiven) &#8211; either they made Ijtihaad and were correct or they made Ijtihaad and were wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, they do not believe that each of the Companions is infallible and free from committing major or minor sins. Rather, they are capable of committing sins in general, however, they possess from precedence and virtues that which necessitates that they be forgiven for whatever (sins) they commit &#8211; if they did commit any. This is even to the point that they will be forgiven for evil deeds the likes of which those who come after them will not be forgiven for. This is because they possess good deeds that wipe out the evil deeds, the likes of which will not be for those after them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is established from the saying of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) that they are the best of generations and that if one of them were to give a mudd (of gold) in charity it would be better than if someone who came after them were to give the whole of Mount Uhud in gold. And if it was the case that one of them committed a sin, then either he repented from it or he performed some good deed that wiped it out. Or he will be forgiven for it due to the virtue of his precedence or because of the intercession of Muhammad H, of which the Companions have the most right among people of receiving. Or perhaps he was tested by some affliction in this world, by which it was expiated from him. So if this is with respect to the sins that were actualized (by them), then what about the matters in which they did Ijtihaad? If they were correct they will have two rewards and if they were incorrect they will have just one reward and their error will be forgiven.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the amount of (bad) deeds committed by some of them, that is forsaken yet forgiven, is tiny in comparison to their virtues and good qualities, such as their belief in Allaah and His Messenger, their Jihaad for His Cause, their performance of Hijrah, their support (of the Religion), as well as their beneficial knowledge and good deeds. And whoever studies the history of the &#8216;people&#8217; (i.e. the Sahaabah) with knowledge and insight, and studies the merits that Allaah bestowed unto them, he will come to know with full certainty that they are the best of creation after the prophets. There was not nor will there be anyone like them. They are the safwah (chosen elite) from all the generations of this nation (of Muslims), which is itself the best and most honorable of all nations with Allaah.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The madh-hab of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah concerning the Companions is that of moderateness between the two ends of extremism and heedlessnessThe madh-hab of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah concerning the Companions is that of moderateness between the two ends of extremism and heedlessness. It is moderateness amidst the extremist fanatics who elevate the esteemed ones amongst them to a level that is only befitting for Allaah or for His messengers and moderateness amidst the heedless and harsh ones who belittle and revile them. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The madh-hab of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah concerning the Companions is that of moderateness between the two ends of extremism and heedlessnessThe madh-hab of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah concerning the Companions is that of moderateness between the two ends of extremism and heedlessness. It is moderateness amidst the extremist fanatics who elevate the esteemed ones amongst them to a level that is only befitting for Allaah or for His messengers and moderateness amidst the heedless and harsh ones who belittle and revile them. So they are in the middle between those who are excessive and those who fall short &#8211; they love all of them and put each one of them in the due place that they deserve, with fairness and justice. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So they do not elevate them to a level they don&#8217;t deserve, nor do they belittle them, taking away what they are worthy of</strong></span>. Their tongues are moist with mentioning them only in good, according to what is befitting for them. And their hearts are filled with love for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whatever disputes and differences that occurred between (some of) them, that can be authentically confirmed, we hold that they were Mujtahideen in that regard &#8211; either they were correct and will receive one reward for their Ijtihaad and one reward for being correct, or they were wrong and will receive just one reward for their Ijtihaad while their error will be forgiven. They were not infallible since they were human beings. At times they were correct and at times they erred. But how much more were they correct as compared to others being correct, and how fewer were their errors as compared to the errors of others? And on top of this, they will receive Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness and contentment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The books of Ahl-us-Sunnah are filled with a clarification of this pure and radiant Creed concerning these elite people, who were chosen amongst mankind to accompany the best of mankind (صلى الله عليه و سلم). May Allaah be pleased with them all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of this is the statement of <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>At-Tahaawee</strong> </span>in his (book on the) Creed of Ahl- us-Sunnah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;We love the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger. But we do not go to extremes in our love for anyone amongst them, nor do we absolve ourselves from any of them. And we hate anyone that hates them or anyone that talks about them in a bad way. And we do not mention them except with good. Loving them is Deen (Religion), Eemaan (Faith) and Ihsaan (Goodness) and hating them is Kufr (Disbelief), Nifaaq (hypocrisy) and Tughyaan (transgression).&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal</strong></span> said in his book as-Sunnah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And from the Sunnah is mentioning the good qualities of the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger &#8211; all of them &#8211; and to refrain from (speaking about) what disputes occurred between them. <strong>So whoever reviles the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger or (just) one of them, then he is an innovator, a Raafidee</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;"><strong>Loving them is a Sunnah and making du&#8217;aa (supplication) for them is a means of getting close to Allaah (taqarrub). Following them is a means and taking from their example is a virtue&#8230;</strong></span>&#8220;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">All of the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger are trustworthy based on Allaah&#8217;s testifying that for them and because of His praise for them and the praise of His Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>An-Nawawee said in at-Taqreeb</strong></span>, which As-Suyootee explained in his Tadreeb-ur-Raawee:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;All of the Companions are trustworthy &#8211; those who were involved in the afflictions (fitan) and other than them &#8211; according to the consensus of the scholars.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr</strong></span> said in al-lsaabah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Ahl-us-Sunnah have unanimously agreed that all of them (the Sahaabah) are trustworthy and no one opposed this except some deviants amongst the innovators.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why there is no harm in not knowing a Companion in a chain of narration. So if a Taabi&#8217;ee says: &#8220;On the authority of a man who accompanied the Prophet&#8230;&#8221; this does not affect the report. This is because not knowing the Companions (in the chain) causes no harm since they are all trustworthy.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Al-Khateeb Al-Baghdaadee</strong></span> said in his book al-Kifaayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Every hadeeth that has a chain of narration that is connected between the one who reported it and the Prophet is not to be acted upon until first having affirmed the trustworthiness and reliability of all the narrators (in the chain). It is an obligation to investigate all of their conditions, except for the Sahaabee (Companion) who raises it (or attributes the hadeeth) to the Prophet. This is because the trustworthiness of the Companions is established and well known based on Allaah&#8217;s affirming that for them, His informing us of their pure state and His preference of them in the texts of the Qur&#8217;aan&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he (rahimahullaah) went on to list some ayaat and ahaadeeth concerning their virtues and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And even if Allaah or His Messenger had not mentioned anything about them from what we just stated now (of their virtues), the condition they were upon of having made Hijrah, fought in Jihaad, of having offered their support, sacrificed their lives and wealth, experienced the killings of their parents and children, of mutually advising for the Religion and having strong Faith and unshakeable certainty, (all of this) would be enough to prove their trustworthiness and enough for one to have firm faith in their honesty and integrity. And it would necessitate the understanding that they are the best from those who receive testimony and approval as to their trustworthiness and reliability from all of the people that will come after them forever and ever.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q]: <span style="color:#993300;">There are some people here, who keep away from [attending] lessons on &#8216;aqeedah (creed/beliefs), and they say: &#8216;We are Muslims, we are not unbelievers or idol-worshippers such that we have to learn &#8216;aqeedah or attend lectures about it&#8217; So, O noble Shaykh, what is your view regarding this!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: Teaching the Muslims [the correct] &#8216;aqeedah does not mean that we have judged them to be unbelievers. Rather, we teach the Muslims about &#8216;aqeedah in order for them to know about it thoroughly, and know what matters nullify it and what matters are contrary to it. Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamaan, one of the distinguished Companions &#8211; radiallaahu &#8216;anhu &#8211; said: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;People used to ask the Messenger about the good, but I used to ask him about the evil, for fear of falling into it.&#8221;</span> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise &#8216;Umar ibn al-Khattaab radiallaahu &#8216;anhu said: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Soon the bonds of Islaam will be loosened bit by bit, because people will enter into Islaam but will be unaware of Jaahiliyyah (ignorant practices that Islaam opposes).&#8221;</span> [3] Thus, when we teach &#8216;aqeedoh, this does not imply that we have judged those whom we are teaching to be non-Muslims. Rather, what it means is that we desire that they should be thoroughly aware of the correct Islaamic &#8216;aqeedah; so as to cling to it, and to be aware of what opposes it; so as to keep far away from it. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said, whilst addressing His Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;So have knowledge about Laa ilaaha illallaah (i.e, have knowledge that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah), and seek forgiveness for your sins, and for the believing men and women.&#8221;</span> [Soorah Muhammad 47:19].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is essential that a person learns and that he does not content himself with merely saying: &#8216;I am a Muslim.&#8217; Yes indeed, you are a Muslim &#8211; and ail praise is for Allaah! However, if one of you were asked as to what Islaam means, or you were asked to explain what Islaam is, then many of you would not be able to correctly explain this. If one of you were to be asked to explain what are those factors which nullify Islaam, then many of you would not be able to explain this. Thus, if a person is ignorant [of such fundamentals], it is possible that he may fall into falsehood without realising it. If one of you were asked to explain the pillars of Islaam or eemaan (faith) that the Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam explained and taught, we would find that most people would be unable to do so. So how is it that a person [suffices with] saying: &#8216;l am a Muslim,&#8217; yet does not know these [basic] matters!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unfortunately, many of the daa&#8217;ees (callers to Islaam) are themselves unaware of [basic matters such as] what are the conditions for Prayer, or unaware of the rules and regulations concerning wudhoo (ablution) and those matters which</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">invalidate wudhoo. Some of them do not even know what matters form the arkaan (pillars) of the Prayer, or form its waajibaat (obligations), or those matters which invalidate the Prayer. So what Islaam are they calling to! Islaam is not merely a call, rather it is a reality to be learnt and practiced. So it is essential to acquire sound knowledge and understanding of the Religion. This is because a person who does not have sound knowledge, may fall into dangers without even realizing it; just like a person who walks down a path, but is ignorant of the fact that along this path there is a ditch, or a hole, or even an ambush. Yet [due to his ignorance] he ends up falling into the hole, or the ambush, without even realizing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus it is essential to learn about tawheed, since it is tawheed that is the basic foundation [of both the Religion and the correct Islaamic &#8216;aqeedah]. Indeed, no one abstains from learning about tawheed [and those matters it necessitates, as well as its limits, conditions, fundamentals, clear proofs, fruits and consequences, and those matters which increase and strengthen it, and those that decrease and weaken it, etc.] except one of two people: [i] an ignorant person &#8211; and the ignorant person&#8217;s [view] is not to be given any weight; or [ii] a bigoted deviant &#8211; one who desires to avert people from the &#8216;aqeedah of pure tawheed, and who wishes to conceal from the people his own false beliefs, and those other deviant beliefs that are [falsely] ascribed to Islaam. And this is possibly the Ease of many of those who abstain from learning about tawheed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And it is not proper for all the Believers to go out together and fight. From every troop of them only a party of them should go forth, so that those who remain behind may gain understanding of the Religion so that they may [instruct and] warn their people when they return to them, in order that they may beware.&#8221;</span> [Soorah at-Tawbaa 9:122].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, the Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Whoever Allaah desires to show goodness to, He gives him the understanding of the Religion.&#8221;</span> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of this hadeeth is that whenever Allaah does not want to show goodness to a person, He does not give him the understanding of the Religion. So the one who says: &#8216;l do not need to learn &#8216;aqeedah.&#8217; It is as if he is saying: &#8216;l do not need to gain understanding of the Religion!&#8217; And this is said by either an ignorant person, or one who is misguided!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 60:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>What is the creed of the Righteous Predecessors regarding the Noble Qur’aan?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The creed of the as-Salaf pertaining to the Noble Qur’aan <strong>is like their creed with regard to the rest of the Attributes and Names of Allaah</strong>, and it is based upon what is proven by the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم). And we all know that Allaah, The One free of all imperfection, The Most High, described the Qur’aan as being His Words, and that it is sent down from Him. So, He, Most Magnificent and Most High, Says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِنْ أَحَدٌ مِّنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ اسْتَجَارَكَ فَأَجِرْهُ حَتَّىٰ يَسْمَعَ كَلَامَ اللَّهِ ثُمَّ أَبْلِغْهُ مَأْمَنَهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And if anyone of the Mushriks seeks your protection, then grant him protection so that they may hear the Word of Allaah [the Qur’aan], and then escort him to where he can be secure&#8221;</span> [Qur’aan, soorat at-Tawbah (9): 6].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the intended by the “<strong>Word of Allaah</strong>” here, without any doubt, is the Noble Qur’aan. And furthermore, He, the Most High, Says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ هَٰذَا الْقُرْآنَ يَقُصُّ عَلَىٰ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ أَكْثَرَ الَّذِي هُمْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily, this Qur’aan narrates to the Children of Israel most of that in which they differ&#8221;</span> [Qur’aan, soorat an-Naml (27): 76].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the Qur’aan is the Word of Allaah, The Most High, letter and meaning. He really Spoke it and bestowed it upon Jibreel, the trustworthy, who then brought it down upon the heart of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) so that he may be one of those who warn, in the plain Arabic language.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Salaf also believe that the Qur’aan is a Revelation</strong>, brought down by Allaah (عزّ وجلّ) upon Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) in parts over a period of twenty three years as necessitated by Allaah’s Wisdom. In addition, its revelation is either original or occasional, meaning that some of it is brought down in response to a certain occasion that necessitated its revelation, and some of it is revealed without being due to a certain reason. Also some of it is revealed as a narration of a past condition that occurred to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and his companions, whilst some of it comes down as original legislations, revealed for the first time. This is according to what has been mentioned by the people of knowledge pertaining to this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the Salaf say: <span style="color:#808000;">“<strong>The Qur’aan is in the beginning from Allaah (عزّ وجلّ), and to Him it shall return at the end of tim</strong>e.”</span> This constitutes the saying of the Salaf regarding the Noble Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is something well known to us all that Allaah, The Most High, described the Qur’aan with great qualities. He described it as <strong>hakeem</strong> (wise), <strong>kareem</strong> (an honourable reciter: Noble), ‘<strong>atheem</strong> (great), and <strong>majeed</strong> (glorious). And these qualities with which Allaah has described His Words <em>applies to the one who holds to this Book and works according to it openly and inwardly</em>. So Allaah, The Most High, grants him from the glory, greatness, wisdom, might, and authority, something that it would not be given to the one who does not cling to the Book of Allaah (عزّ وجلّ). That is why I call upon, from this pulpit, all of the Muslims, rulers and ruled, scholars and common people, to cling hold to the Book of Allaah (عزّ وجلّ), openly and inwardly, so that they attain the might, happiness, glory, and prevalence in the East and West.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 18:</strong> If a person is asked about Eemaan, should he say that it means the attestation that obligates acceptance and submission, or should he say that it means to believe in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers as the Messenger صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم explained?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Meaning of Eemaan And Its Pillars<br />
<strong>Question 19:</strong> We would like to expound on the meaning of Eemaan and also know of its pillars?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2015/05/12/dahrees-deny-the-existence-of-allaah-and-claim-that-ad-dahr-time-manages-world/">How to Respond to the Dahrees</a><br />
<strong>Question 20:</strong> We know that the Dahrees, who are many nowadays and who are considered from the intellect because they think and infer, are agreed upon the belief in the non-existence of Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic. So, how to respond to people like this?</p>
<p>The Eemaan (Belief) and its Pillars<br />
<strong>Question 21:</strong> What are the Pillars of Eemaan?</p>
<p>The Belief in the Angels<br />
<strong>Question 22:</strong> Are there other things related to the belief in the angels?</p>
<p>The Belief in the Books<br />
<strong>Question 23:</strong> What about the Third Pillar of Eemaan?</p>
<p>The Belief in the Messengers<br />
<strong>Question 24:</strong> What do you say regarding the Fourth Pillar of Eemaan–Belief in the Messengers?</p>
<p>The Belief in the Last Day<br />
<strong>Question 25:</strong> How can the belief in the Last Day be?</p>
<p>The Belief in al-Qadar<br />
<strong>Question 26:</strong> What about the pillar of belief in al-Qadar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Increase and Decrease of Eemaan (Faith)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 27:</strong> Does Eemaan increase or decrease? What are the things that make it increase or decrease?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 28:</strong> There are those of the opinion that Eemaan neither increases nor decreases, and that sin wipes out Eemaan entirely, and that the person who commits it becomes a Kaafir! How to respond to those people?</p>
<p>Denying that Eemaan Increases and Decreases</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 29:</strong> But what is the Islamic Ruling vis-à-vis the unattestation to the increase and decrease of faith?</p>
<p>The Manner of Judging by other than that which Allaah has revealed</p>
<p><strong>Question 30:</strong> What is the manner of judging by other than what Allaah has revealed?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Difference Between the Thaalim (Transgressor) and Faasiq (Disobedient Sinner`)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 31:</strong> You mentioned, however, about the Faasiq and the Thaalim things that are close, or possibly intermixed. And it is that the Thaalim rules by that which Allaah has not sent down whilst knowing that Allaah’s Judgment is better. But that he intends to gratify his thirst for revenge from someone. So he applies a judgment on someone that Allaah has not approved of. And then the Faasiq rules while knowing the Judgment of Allaah and that it is the right Judgment, but because of his own interest or lowly desire, or due to a certain bias to fulfill the desires of someone else, he rules by that which Allaah has not sent down. So what is the difference between the two?</p>
<p>SOOTHSAYING (Fortune-Telling)<br />
<strong>Question 32:</strong> What is Soothsaying?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Ruling Regarding Those Who go to Diviners<br />
<strong>Question 33:</strong> It would be nice if we could know of the status of people who go to fortune-tellers.</p>
<p>Astrology and Its Ruling<br />
<strong>Question 34:</strong> What is astrology (At-Tanjeem) and it’s ruling?</p>
<p>The Relation of Astrology with Fortune-Telling<br />
<strong>Question 36:</strong> Is there a connection between astrology and divination?</p>
<p>Which One is More Dangerous?<br />
<strong>Question 37:</strong> Which one, however, is more dangerous on the Muslims?</p>
<p>The Reality of Magic</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 38:</strong> You mentioned in your talk that astrology is a form of magic, so what is magic?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 39:</strong> What is meant by subtleness in your saying, “Magic is everything that is subtle and whose cause is hidden”?</p>
<p><strong>Question 40:</strong> What is the legal judgment regarding magic and its learning?</p>
<p>Is There a Reality to Magic?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 41:</strong> Is magic a true thing, or it is just conveying doubts, and fantasies to the people?</p>
<p>The Relation of Divination with Magic</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 42:</strong> You mentioned divination and you defined the fortune-teller as well as the magician. Is there, however, a connection between divination and magic?</p>
<p><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2015/05/24/was-the-prophet-bewitched-shaykh-ibn-utahymeen/">Was the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم ) Bewitched?</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 43:</strong> It was reported from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) that he was bewitched. So we would like you to talk about the means by which he (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) was bewitched. Furthermore, is it contradictory to the status of Prophethood that bewitchment of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) took place?</p>
<p>The Reality of Ilhaad?</p>
<p><strong>Question 44:</strong> What is Ilhaad–concerning Allaah’s Names and Attributes?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Types of Shirk</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 45:</strong> Shall we then change [the topic] from knowledge concerning the types of Ilhaad to that regarding knowledge of the types of Shirk?</p>
<p>Defining the Types of Shirk</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 46:</strong> We knew the types of shirk, but is there a specific definition for each type of it?</p>
<p>Is the relinquishing of worship called Shirk?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 47</strong>: It was mentioned, as in the narration reported by Saheeh Muslim, the saying of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم): “Verily between man and between Shirk and Kufr (unbelief) is the abandonment of prayers.” –Is the abandonment of worship considered Shirk?</p>
<p>The Reality of the Deen of Islaam?</p>
<p><strong>Question 48:</strong> What is the Religion of Islaam?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 49:</strong> So should we then understand that we have a general and a particular definition of Islaam?</p>
<p>The Taaghut and Its Types?</p>
<p><strong>Question 50:</strong> What is the meaning of at-Taaghut and its derivations?</p>
<p>The Creed of the Muslims Regarding ‘Eesaa (Jesus alaihissalam)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 51:</strong> What is the creed of the Muslims with regard to ‘Eesaa, son of Maryam? Also what is the ruling as to the saying that he was killed and crucified.</p>
<p>The Division of the Ummah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 52:</strong> What is the extent of the split up within the Ummah after the death of its Prophet Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)?</p>
<p>The Characteristics of the Saved Group</p>
<p><strong>Question 53:</strong> What is the most distinguished qualities of the saved group?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 54:</strong> Is it necessary that the characteristics in the four matters: ‘Aqeedah, worship, manners and transaction be totally or completely present without diminution? And in case anything of it is gets diminished, does this take the person out of the folds of the saved group or it doesn’t ?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 55:</strong> Is there something you want to add concerning the qualities of the saved sect?</p>
<p>The Correct and False Tawassul</p>
<p><strong>Question 56:</strong> What is the correct and false Tawassul ?</p>
<p>A Fifth Kind of Tawassul</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 57:</strong> Are there any other types of Tawassul in addition to the four that you have mentioned?</p>
<p>The Incorrect and Futile Tawassul and its Types.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 58:</strong> Having known the Correct Tawassul and its Types, then it is inevitable for us to know the Incorrect Tawassul and its Types.</p>
<p>The Affirmed and Annulled Intercession.<br />
<strong>Question 59:</strong> What is the affirmed and nullified intercession?</p>
<p>The Creed of The Salaf with Regard to the Noble Qur’aan</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 60:</strong> What is the creed of the Righteous Predecessors regarding the Noble Qur’aan?</p>
<p>The Most Prominent Rulings Regarding The Qur’anic Recital</p>
<p><strong>Question 61:</strong> What is the most distinguished ruling of Qur’anic Recital?</p>
<p>The Recitation of Soorat al-Faatihah For the Prophet’s (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)Soul</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 62:</strong> As regard those who bequeath that the Faatihah be recited on behalf of the Prophet’s soul, or on his behalf by the Prophet’s grave?</p>
<p><strong>Appendix</strong><br />
Definition of Taaghut<br />
Every Kufr is Taaghut, but not every Taaghut is Kufr<br />
Very Important to Remember</p>

And (I ask) that He make you from those who when they are given, are thankful; when they are tested, are patient; and when they sin, seek forgiveness (from Allaah).

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Imaam Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdil-Wahhaab [Died 1206H]<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of the classical treatise of Imaam Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab <b><i>“Masaa’il-ul-Jaahiliyyah”</i></b><i></i> (Aspects of the Days of Ignorance), which is a list of 128 points &#8211; each point representing one aspect of belief or practice that the people of the Days of Ignorance were upon, which Islaam came to oppose. The source used for this translation can be found on sahab.org.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The original Arabic text of the treatise is included within this translation so as to make this e-book a comprehensive reference guide and an easily-accessible study guide. Footnotes were added by the translator in order to clarify and provide evidence for some of the points that the author mentioned but didn’t provide proof or an explanation for. In recent times, this treatise has been explained by Shaikh Saalih Al-Fawzaan in several lectures. These lectures were recorded and transcribed and put into a book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The subject matter of this treatise is one of great importance, for the aspects of the Days of Ignorance have not ceased to be acted upon till this very day. And the people that call towards these misguided beliefs and practices of the Days of Ignorance are many, such as innovators and people of desire. So it is important for the Muslim to learn what the People of the Days of Ignorance were upon in terms of beliefs, actions and practices, so that he may avoid that, since Islaam came to oppose these aspects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b> “These are the aspects that the people of the Days of Ignorance – both the people of the Book and the non-People of the Book – were upon, which the Messenger of Allaah opposed. They are from the matters that every Muslim is required to possess knowledge of. This is since with (understanding) one side of the opposite, the goodness of the other side of the opposite can be made apparent. And it is by (making apparent the) opposite of something that matters become clarified. The most important of these aspects (of the Days of Ignorance) and most severe in terms of danger was the absence of faith (Eemaan) in the heart, for what the Messenger of Allaah came with. And if approval for what the people of the Days of Ignorance were upon is further added to this (absence of faith), then the total ruin is achieved, as Allaah says: <b>‘And those who believe in the falsehood while disbelieving in Allaah, it is they who are the losers.’</b> [Surah Al-‘Ankaboot: 52]”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<b>[3]</b> They held the acts of opposing the figure of authority and failing to comply with him as being something virtuous. And they saw the acts of hearing and obeying as being humiliating and degrading. So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger opposed them and commanded that patience be observed when facing the oppression of the rulers. And he commanded with hearing and obeying them, as well as advising (them). And he spoke extensively in regards to that and he constantly brought it up and repeated it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<b>[5]</b> From their greatest principles was that they were deceived by (following) the majority, using that as a proof against the correctness of a matter. And they also used as evidence for declaring the falsehood of something, the fact that it was strange and that its adherents were few. So Allaah prescribed the opposite of that and He clarified this in many places of the Qur&#8217;aan.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<b>[23]</b> They were deluded by the life of this world. So they perceived Allaah’s bestowal of worldly material (on someone), as an indication of He was pleased (with that person), as He says: <b>‘And they say: We are abundant in wealth and in children. And (because of that) we are not going to be punished.’</b> [Surah Saba’: 35]”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Imaam Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translated transcription of a lecture delivered by Imaam Al-Albaanee (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) that was recorded and distributed under the title <b><i>“Hadhihi Da’watunaa”</i></b><i></i> (This is Our Call). The present translation was translated directly from the Arabic audio.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this lecture, Imaam Al-Albaanee explains the basis of the Salafee Manhaj, which is following the way, understanding and practical application of the Salaf, who were namely the first three generations of Muslims: The Sahaabah, Taabi’een and Atbaa’ at-Taabi’een. They are the ones referred to in the Prophet’s saying: <b>“The best of mankind is my generation, then those that come after them, then those that come after them.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the basis that distinguishes the true call to Islaam from all other false and erroneous calls, regardless if they claim to be “upon the Qur’aan and the Sunnah.” Al-Albaanee goes into depth discussing this fact, that one cannot truly understand and apply the Qur’aan and Sunnah unless he follows the understanding and application of the Salaf. We ask Allaah to accept this effort and benefit the Muslims with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So here we have given the answer from the ayah and the two hadeeth, we just mentioned. Follow the way of the Believers! The way of those believers from present times? The answer is no, we mean the Believers from the past &#8211; the first era &#8211; the era of the Companions &#8211; the Salaf As-Saalih (pious predecessors). These are the people whom we should take as our example and as the ones whom we follow. And there is absolutely no one equal to them on the face of the earth. Therefore, the essence of our call is based on three pillars &#8211; on the (1) Qur&#8217;aan, the (2) Sunnah and (3) Following the Salaf As-Saalih (pious predecessors).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So everyone claims to follow the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah, and how often have we heard this kind of talk from the youth who are in confusion, when they say: ‘Ya akhee, these people claim to follow the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah and those people claim to follow the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah.’ So what is the clear and decisive distinction? It is the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah and the Methodology of the Salaf As-Saalih. So whoever follows the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah without following the Salaf As-Saalih, he in fact has not followed the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah, rather he has only followed his intellect, if not his desire.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“After making clear this important condition of &#8220;upon the methodology of the Salaf As-Saalih&#8221;, I must give you some examples. In the past, the Muslims split up into many sects. You hear about the Mu&#8217;tazilah, you hear about the Murji&#8217;ah, you hear about the Khawaarij, you hear about the Zaidiyyah, not to mention the Shi&#8217;a and the Raafidah and so on. There is no one amongst these groups, no matter how deep in misguidance they are, that does not share the same saying as the rest of the Muslims, which is that: &#8220;We are on the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah.&#8221; No one amongst them says: &#8220;We don’t follow the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah.&#8221; And if one of them were to say that, he would completely leave the fold of Islaam. So then why did they split up so long as all of them rely on the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah &#8211; and I bear witness that they do rely on the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah for support. But how is this relying done? It is done without relying on the third foundation, which is what the Salaf As-Saalih were upon.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Shaikh &#8216;Abdul-Muhsin bin Hamad Al-&#8216;Abbaad<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah.Com<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a small treatise entitled <b>“<i>’Aqeedatu Ahlis-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah fis-Sahaabat-il-Kiraam</i>”</b> (The Creed of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah concerning the Companions) written by Shaikh ‘Abdul-Muhsin Al-‘Abbaad. The source for this treatise was an article the Shaikh wrote for the Islamic University of Madeenah Newsletter (Issue 2 of their fourth year) Shawaal 1391H. This article was distributed together with a transcribed lecture from the Shaikh entitled “Sending Salaat on the Prophet” in a booklet published by the Islamic University of Madeenah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this brief presentation, Shaikh Al-‘Abbaad, one of the senior scholars and a Muhaddith in Saudi Arabia, may Allaah preserve him, outlines the proper belief a Muslim should have with regard to the Companions, and that is of moderateness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Muslim should not go to either extreme of being fanatical towards individuals amongst the Companions or being lenient and heedless about the rights they deserve. Rather, it is upon the believer, the adherent of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, to have love and respect for all of them, as well as to acknowledge their virtues and refrain from mentioning their errors and mishaps. The Shaikh presents the material in a concise but educational manner, quoting numerous ayaat, ahaadeeth and statements of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The <i>madh-hab</i> of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah concerning the Companions is that of moderateness between the two ends of extremism and heedlessness. It is moderateness amidst the extremist fanatics who elevate the esteemed ones amongst them to a level that is only befitting for Allaah or for His messengers and moderateness amidst the heedless and harsh ones who belittle and revile them. So they are in the middle between those who are excessive and those who fall short &#8211; they love all of them and put each one of them in the due place that they deserve, with fairness and justice. So they do not elevate them to a level they don’t deserve, nor do they belittle them, taking away what they are worthy of. Their tongues are moist with mentioning them only in good, according to what is befitting for them. And their hearts are filled with love for them.“</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And whatever disputes and differences that occurred between (some of) them, that can be authentically confirmed, we hold that they were Mujtahideen in that regard – either they were correct and will receive one reward for their Ijtihaad and one reward for being correct, or they were wrong and will receive just one reward for their Ijtihaad while their error will be forgiven. They were not infallible since they were human beings. At times they were correct and at times they erred. But how much more were they correct as compared to others being correct, and how fewer were their errors as compared to the errors of others? And on top of this, they will receive Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness and contentment.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;These are five examples from the sayings of the Salaf As-Saalih (righteous predecessors), which demonstrate what we are obligated to believe in with respect to the best of creation after the Prophets and Messengers. One thing we must understand is that defaming these chosen and unique individuals is equal to defaming the Religion itself, since it was none other than them who passed the Religion down to those who came after them. And we already mentioned the words of Abu Zur&#8217;ah, in which he said: &#8216;The only ones who brought this Qur&#8217;aan and Sunan (plural of Sunnah) to us are the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger. (So) they only wish to disparage and demolish our witnesses so that they can nullify the Book and the Sunnah, whereas they are more deserving of being disparaged for they are the heretics (<i>zanaadiqah</i>).'&#8221;</p>

TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p><strong>About the Book:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a short yet highly beneficial treatise from Imam Ibn Baaz called <strong>Al Aqeedat-us-Saheehah wa maa Yudaaduhaa</strong> (<strong>The Correct Belief and what Opposes It</strong>). The Arabic source for this translation can be found on Imaam Ibn Baaz&#8217;s web site at <a href="http://www.binbaz.org.sa" rel="nofollow">http://www.binbaz.org.sa</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">In this treatise, Imaam Ibn Baaz. may Allaah have mercy on him, outlines the Creed of Ahlus-Sunnah with regard to Eemaan (Faith), Tawheed, Worship, and Allaah&#8217;s Names and Attributes in a concise and informative manner. He divides his discussion into six sections basing iron the six pillars of Eemaan (Faith), which are: Belief in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, and Divine Pre-Decree. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">At the end of the treatise, the Imaam presents ten of the most significant things that nullify and invalidate a person&#8217;s Islaam, basing that on the famous treatise of Imaam Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdul-Wahhaab known as The Nullifiers of Islaam.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This treatise is an excellent resource for new and beginning Muslims to learn about the fundamentals of their Religion in a brief and simple manner. It is for this reason that we chose this essay, hoping that it may be of benefit to those whom it reaches.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/the-correct-belief-and-what-opposes-it-the-nullifies-of-islaam-bin-baaz-al-ibaanah-com.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Download the PDF eBook</strong></a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Full content of the Book below :</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">INTRODUCTION</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy. All praise is for Allaah alone, and may the peace and blessings be upon the one after whom there is no messenger, as well as his family and Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">To Proceed:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since having the correct belief is the foundation and basis of the Religion of Islaam, I felt that it should be the topic of this lecture.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is well known from the religious texts of the Qur’aan and the Sunnah that a person’s statements and actions are only considered valid and acceptable (by Allaah) if they are produced as a result of having the correct belief. So if one’s beliefs are not correct, he invalidates whatever statements and actions branch out from it, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And whoever rejects Faith (Eemaan), then he has nullified his good deeds, and in the Hereafter, he will be from among the losers.”</strong> [Surah Al-Maa’idah: 5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And it has been revealed to you (O Muhammad) and to those before you that: If you mix partners in worship with Allaah, your good deeds will surely be cancelled out, and you will indeed be from the losers.”</strong> [Surah Az-Zumar: 65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The verses (from the Qur’aan) bearing this same meaning are many. The clear Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His trustworthy messenger, may the best of his Lord’s peace and blessings be on him, indicate that the Correct Belief can be summed up in:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Faith in Allaah, His Angels, His (revealed) Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, and the Divine Pre-Decree, the good and the bad of it. So these six things form the foundations of the Correct Belief, with which Allaah sent down His mighty Book, and with which Allaah sent His messenger, Muhammad, peace and blessings be on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everything that one is obligated to have faith in from the matters of the Unseen, as well as everything that Allaah and His Messenger have informed of branch out from these six foundations. The proofs for these six foundations in the Qur’aan and the Sunnah are many.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among them is the saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Righteousness (Birr) is not that you turn your faces towards the east and the west (in prayer), but rather righteousness is (for) the one who believes in Allaah, the Last Day, the Angels, the Books and the Prophets.”</strong> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 177]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The Messenger believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and so do the believers – all of them believe in Allaah, His Angels. His Books and His Messengers. (And they say): We make no distinctions between any of His Messengers.”</strong> [Surah AlBaqarah: 285]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O you who believe! Believe in Allaah and His Messenger and the Book that was revealed to His Prophet and the Scripture that was revealed in the past (before him). And whoever disbelieves in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers and the Last Day has gone far astray.”</strong> [Surah An-Nisaa: 136]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Don’t you know that Allaah knows all that is in the heaven and on the earth? Verily, it is all (written) in the Book (Preserved Tablet). Verily, that is easy for Allaah.”</strong> [Surah AlHajj: 70]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the authentic ahaadeeth that indicate these foundations, then they are many. Amongst them is the famous authentic hadeeth reported by Muslim in his Saheeh in which ‘Umar bin AlKhattaab (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) narrated that (the angel) Jibreel asked the Prophet about Eemaan (Faith). So he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) replied to him: <strong>“Eemaan (Faith) is to believe in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, and to believe in Divine pre-Decree, the good of it and the bad of it.”</strong> This hadeeth was transmitted by AlBukhaaree and Muslim from Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the six foundations from which everything a Muslim is obligated to believe in originates, whether it be with respect to Allaah, the Day of Judgement, and anything else from the Unseen (Ghaib).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>FIRST: FAITH IN ALLAAH</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Faith in Allaah entails: Believing that He is the only true God that has the right to be worshipped apart from everyone else, due to His being the Creator of the servants (i.e. humans/jinn), the One who is kind to them, the Grantor of their sustenance, the All-Knower of their inner and outer actions, the One who is All-Able to reward those who obey Him and punish those who disobey Him. Allaah created these two species (the Jinn and mankind) for the purpose of this worship, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And I did not create the Jinn and mankind except to worship Me. I do not seek any provision from them nor that they should feed Me. Verily, Allaah is the All-Provider, Owner of Power, Most Strong.”</strong> [Surah Adh-Dhaariyaat: 56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O you who believe! Worship your Lord who created you and those before you in order that you may gain Taqwaa (fear and dutifulness to Allaah). He is the One who made the earth a resting place for you and the sky as a canopy, and sent down water (i.e. rain) from the sky and brought forth therewith fruits as a provision for you. So do not set up rivals with Allaah while you know (that only He is to be worshipped).”</strong> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah sent Messengers and revealed Scriptures to clarify this truth and call to it and to warn from what opposes it, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And we have indeed sent to every nation a Messenger (saying): Worship Allaah alone and avoid the false deities.”</strong> [Surah An-Nahl: 36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And We did not send any messenger before you except that We revealed to Him: No one has the right to be worshipped but I, so worship Me.”</strong> [Surah Al-Anbiyaa: 25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“(This is) a Book, the Verses whereof are perfected and then explained in detail from One (Allaah) who is All-Wise and Well-Acquainted (with all things): (Saying) worship none but Allaah. Verily, I (Muhammad) am unto you from Him a warner and a bringer of glad tidings.”</strong> [Surah Hood: 1-2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reality (meaning) of this worship is to: Single Allaah out in everything that the servants worship Him with, such as supplication, fear, hope, prayer, fasting, sacrificing, making oaths and all the other types of worship with full submission, whilst fearing (His Punishment) and hoping (for His reward), having complete love for Him, and humbling oneself to His Grandness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A large part of the noble Qur’aan was revealed concerning this great principle (i.e. worship), such as Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;So worship Allaah, making the worship sincerely for Him alone. Verily, to Allaah belongs the pure (sincere) religion (i.e. worship).”</strong> [Surah Az-Zumar: 2-3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Israa: 23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“So call upon Allaah, making your worship purely for Him alone, even though the disbelievers may hate it.”</strong> (Surah Ghaafir: 14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the two Saheeh collections, Mu’aadh reported that the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>“The right Allaah has over His servants is that they worship Him alone and not ascribe any partners to Him.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having Faith in Allaah also entails believing in everything that He has ordered and made obligatory upon His servants, such as the five outer pillars of Islaam, which are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Testifying that there is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah<br />
2. Establishing the Prayer<br />
3. Giving the Zakaat<br />
4. Fasting in Ramadaan, and<br />
5. Making the pilgrimage (Hajj) to the Sacred House of Allaah, for those who are able to perform it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This goes as well for the other obligations that have come with the pure legislation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most important and greatest of these (five) pillars is: Testifying that there is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Testifying that there is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah requires that worship be performed purely for Allaah alone, and negates it from everyone else besides Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what is intended by the statement Laa Ilaaha IllaaAllaah, for it’s meaning is: There is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah. So everything that is worshipped besides Allaah, such as a human being or an angel or a Jinn or anything else, then they are worshipped wrongfully. The One who is worshipped truthfully is Allaah alone, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;That is because Allaah, He is the Truth (only true God), and what they invoke on besides Him is falsehood.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Hajj: 62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have explained previously that Allaah created the two species (Jinn and mankind) for the purpose of this great principle, and that He commanded them with it, sent His messengers because of it and revealed His Books for it. So think about this and reflect on it much so that it could become clear to you what a majority of the Muslims have fallen into from manifest ignorance of this fundamental principle such that they worship others along with Allaah and direct His sole rights to other than Him, may Allaah aid us!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Faith in Allaah also entails: Believing that Allaah created all that exists and manages and administers all of their affairs, through His Knowledge and Ability, as He wills. And it entails believing that He is the Owner of this world and the Hereafter, and the Lord of all of the worlds, there being no Creator besides Him or Lord like Him. He sent Messengers and revealed Scriptures to rectify the servants and to call them to that which contains their salvation and success in the current life as well as the Hereafter. And it entails believing that He has no partner in all of that, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Allaah is the Creator of everything, and He is the Guardian of all affairs.&#8221;</strong> [Surah AzZumar: 62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Indeed your Lord is Allaah, Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then rose over the Throne (in a manner that befits His Majesty). He covers the night with the day, seeking it rapidly, and (He created) the sun, the moon, and the stars, (all) are subjected to His Command. Surely, to Him belongs the Creation and the Command. Blessed be Allaah, Lord of all that exists.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-A’raaf: 54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Faith in Allaah also entails: Believing in Allaah’s Perfect Names and Attributes, which have been mentioned in His mighty Book and authentically reported on His trustworthy Messenger, without distorting their meanings (tahreef), denying them (ta’teel), describing their manner (takyeef) or making similarities to them (tamtheel). Rather, they must be left in the manner they were reported without describing how they are, whilst believing in the great meanings they carry, which are descriptions of Allaah. It is obligatory to describe Him with them (i.e. these Names and Attributes) in a manner that befits Him without allowing for His creation to resemble Him in any of His Attributes, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“There is nothing like Him in comparison and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.”</strong> [Surah Ash-Shooraa: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“So do not put forth similarities to Allaah. Verily, Allaah knows and you know not.&#8221;</strong> [Surah An-Nahl: 74]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Creed and Belief of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, from the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger and those who succeeded them upon goodness. And this is what Imaam AbulHasan Al-Ash’aree, may Allaah have mercy on him, reported in his book “Al-Maqaalaat ‘an As’haab-il-Hadeeth wa Ahlis-Sunnah”, as did other scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Awzaa’ee, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “Az-Zuhree and Mak’hool were asked about the verses regarding Allaah’s Attributes, so they replied: ‘Leave them as they have been reported.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Waleed bin Muslim, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “Maalik, Al-Awzaa’ee, Al-Layth bin Sa’ad, and Sufyaan Ath-Thawree were asked about the texts that were reported concerning Allaah’s Attributes, so they all said: ‘Leave them as they have been reported without describing how (they are).’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Awzaa’ee, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “We used to say, while the Taabi’oon (Successors of the Companions) were present and abundant, that Allaah is above His Throne and that we believe in what has been stated in the Sunnah regarding His Attributes.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Rabee’ah bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan, the teacher of Maalik, was asked about Allaah’s rising over His Throne, he replied: “The Rising is not (something) unknown and how it is done is incomprehensible. From Allaah is the Message and upon the Messenger is to openly convey it, and upon us is to believe in it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when Imaam Maalik was asked about it, he said: “The Rising is well known, how it is done is unknown, believing in it is an obligation and asking concerning it is an innovation.” Then he said to the questioner: “I do not consider you to be anything but an evil man.” And he put someone in charge of him and he was cast out, Something with the same meaning was also reported on the Mother of the Believers, Umm Salamah (radyAllaahu ‘anhaa).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Abu ‘Abdir-Rahmaan ‘Abdullaah bin Al-Mubaarak, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “We know our Lord as being above His heavens and over His Throne, apart from His creation.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The statements of the Imaams regarding this subject are many and cannot all be quoted in this small treatise. Whoever wants to come across many of these narrations should refer to what the scholars of the Sunnah wrote regarding this topic, such as the book “As-Sunnah” of Imaam ‘Abdullaah, son of Imaam Ahmad, the book “At-Tawheed” of the noble Imaam, Muhammad bin Khuzaimah, the book “As-Sunnah” of Abul-Qaasim Al-Laalikaa’ee At-Tabaree, the book “AsSunnah” of Abu Bakr Ibn Abee ‘Aasim, as well as the response that Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah wrote to the people of Hamaa (i.e. ‘Aqeedah Hamawiyyah), which is a tremendous response containing many benefits. In this treatise, he, may Allaah have mercy on him, explains the Creed of Ahlus-Sunnah and quotes many of their statements, as well as religious and intellectual evidences for the authenticity of what Ahlus-Sunnah believes and the falseness of what their opponents believe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same goes for his distinguished treatise “At-Tadmuriyyah”, for in it he goes into depth clarifying the Creed of Ahlus-Sunnah based on their textual and logical proofs, and refuting the opponents with arguments that manifest the truth and invalidate the falsehood for anyone amongst the people of knowledge who examines it with a pure intention and a genuine desire for learning the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone that opposes Ahlus-Sunnah in what they believe regarding the subject of Allaah’s Names and Attributes no doubt will fall into opposing the textual and logical evidences while having clear contradictions in everything that he affirms and negates.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, then they affirm for Allaah what He has affirmed for Himself (from Names and Attributes) in His noble Book or what His Messenger Muhammad has affirmed for Him in his authentic Sunnah without tamtheel (i.e. resembling them to someone else’s names and attributes). And they negate and remove Him from resembling His creation in any way, in such a manner that is free from ta’teel (i.e. denying the Names and Attributes). So they have been saved from contradictions, while acting upon all of the proofs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the way of Allaah with regard to he who accepts the truth that the Messengers were sent with, expends all of his efforts in that, and sincerely asks Allaah to grant him the truth and make the correct view apparent to him, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Nay, We fling the truth against falsehood, so it destroys it, and behold, it is vanished.”</strong> [Surah Al-Anbiyaa: 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And no example or similitude do they bring to you (in order to find fault in you or the Qur’aan), except that We reveal to you the truth (against that similitude) and the best explanation (thereof).&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Furqaan: 33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his famous Tafseer, while speaking about the statement of Allaah: <strong>“Indeed your Lord is Allaah, who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then rose over the Throne”</strong> [Surah Al-A’raaf: 54], Al-Haafidh Ibn Katheer, may Allaah have mercy on him, stated some excellent words on this subject, which we would like to quote here due to their great benefit:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, may Allaah have mercy on him, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“People have many views with regard to this subject and this is not the place to go into that. But rather, with regard to this topic, (I say that) we traverse the way of the pious predecessors: Maalik, Al-Awzaa’ee, Ath-Thawree, Al-Layth bin Sa’ad, Ash-Shaafi’ee, Ahmad, Ishaaq bin Raahawayh, and other Muslim Imaams from the past and present…” – which is to leave them as they have been reported without describing their manner (takyeef), making resemblances to them (tashbeeh), and denying them completely (ta’teel).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the thoughts that present themselves to the minds of those who give Allaah’s Attributes similitudes is negated from Allaah, for indeed nothing can resemble Allaah from His creation. There is nothing like Him in comparison and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer. Rather, the matter is as the Imaams have stated, amongst whom was Na’eem bin Hamaad Al-Khuzaa’ee, the teacher of Al-Bukhaaree, who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Whoever likens Allaah to His creation has committed disbelief. And whoever denies what Allaah has described Himself with has committed disbelief. There is no tashbeeh (likening to the creation’s attributes) in what Allaah and His Messenger have described Him with. So whoever affirms for Allaah what has been stated in the clear verses and authentic reports, in the manner that befits Allaah’s majesty, while negating all deficiencies from Him, has embarked on the path of guidance.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">SECOND: FAITH IN THE ANGELS</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This entails believing in them generally and specifically. Therefore, the Muslim must believe that Allaah has angels, which He created to obey Him. And He described them as being honorable servants who do not precede Him in speech and act on His Command.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“He knows what is before them and what is after them, and they cannot intercede except for him with whom He is pleased. And they stand in awe for fear of Him.”</strong> [Surah Al-Anbiyaa: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are of many types, amongst them are those who are entrusted to hold the Throne, and amongst them are those who guard Paradise and Hell. And amongst them are those who are entrusted to record the deeds of people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Specifically, we must believe in those angels that Allaah and His Messenger have mentioned by name, such as Jibreel, Mikaa’eel, Maalik, the gatekeeper of Hell, and Israafeel, the angel in charge of blowing the Trumpet. He (Israafeel) has been mentioned in several authentic ahaadeeth. It is authentically reported in the Saheeh that ‘Aa’ishah (radyAllaahu ‘anhaa) narrated that the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “<strong>The angels were created from light, and the Jinn were created from a smokeless flame of fire. And Aadam was created from what has already been described to you</strong>.” [1] Reported by Muslim in his Saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">THIRD: FAITH IN THE REVEALED BOOKS</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We must believe generally that Allaah revealed books to His prophets and messengers in order to explain His right and to call to it, as Allaah states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Indeed, We have sent Our messengers with clear proofs, and revealed with them the Book and the Balance in order that mankind may establish justice.”</strong> [Surah Al-Hadeed: 25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Mankind was once one nation (upon polytheism) so Allaah sent prophets bearing good news and warning, and with them He sent down the Book in truth to judge between people in matters wherein they differed.”</strong> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 213]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we must believe, in specific and detailed terms, those books that Allaah has mentioned by name, such as the Torah (Tawraat), the Gospel (Injeel), the Psalms (Zaboor) and the Qur’aan. The noble Qur’aan is the best amongst them and the final revelation. And it is that which supercedes all of them and confirms them. And it is the Book that all of the (Muslim) nation is obligated to follow and to judge by, along with what is authentically reported in the Sunnah from Allaah’s Messenger. This is since Allaah sent His Messenger, Muhammad, as a messenger to everyone from the two species (i.e. Jinn and mankind), and He revealed this Book to him so that he could judge them by it. He also made it a cure for the hearts, a source of explanation for everything, and a guide and a mercy to the believers. This is as Allaah states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And this (Qur’aan) is a blessed Book, which We have revealed, so follow it and be dutiful (to Allaah) so that you can receive (His) mercy.”</strong> [Surah Al-An’aam: 155]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And We revealed to you (O Muhammad) the Book (i.e. the Qur’aan) as an explanation for everything, a guide and a mercy and glad tidings for the Muslims.”</strong> [Surah An-Nahl: 89]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Say (Muhammad): O mankind! Verily, I am the Messenger of Allaah sent to all of you (by) the One to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. No one has the right to be worshipped except Him. It is He who gives life and causes death. So believe in Allaah and His Messenger, the unlettered prophet (i.e. cannot read or write), who believes in Allaah and His revelations, and follow him so that you may be guided.”</strong> [Surah Al-A’raaf: 158]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The verses bearing this meaning are many.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">FOURTH: FAITH IN THE MESSENGERS</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One must believe in the messengers both in general and in detail. This means, he must believe that Allaah sent to His servants messengers from among them, bringing glad tidings (of Paradise) and warning (of the Hellfire) and calling them to the truth. So whoever answered their call, achieved success and whoever opposed them, failed and will regret.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The last and most virtuous of them is our prophet, Muhammad the son of ‘Abdullaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And We have indeed sent a messenger to every nation, (saying to them): ‘Worship Allaah and stay away from the false deities.’”</strong> [Surah An-Nahl: 36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Messengers as bearers of good news and warners – In order that mankind should have no excuse (i.e. proof) against Allaah after the (coming of) Messengers.”</strong> [Surah AnNisaa: 165]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but rather he is the Messenger of Allaah and the Seal (last) of the Prophets.”</strong> [Surah Al-Ahzaab: 40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All the prophets whom Allaah named or for whom it is authentically reported that Allaah’s Messenger mentioned by name, we must believe in him according to the detailed and specific manner, such as Nooh (Noah), Hood, Saalih, Ibraaheem (Abraham) and so on, may Allaah bestow the best and purest of His peace and blessings on them and on our Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>FIFTH: FAITH IN THE LAST DAY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for having faith in the Last Day, then it entails believing in everything that Allaah and His Messenger have informed of concerning what will occur after death, such as the trial of the grave, and the punishment or pleasure that will occur in it. It also includes what will happen on the Day of Judgement such as grief and severities, the placing of the Bridge and the Balance, the accounting (of deeds) and their recompense, and the distribution of the records of deeds to the people. There will be those who will receive their book of deeds on their right hands and those who will receive their book of deeds on their left hands or from behind their backs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also entails believing in the Fountain, which will be given to our Prophet Muhammad (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), and believing in Paradise and Hell, and (believing) that the believers will see their Lord and that He will talk to them, as well as whatever else has been mentioned in the noble Qur’aan and the authentic Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So one is obligated to believe and have faith in all of this, in the manner in which Allaah and His Messenger have explained to us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>SIXTH: FAITH IN THE DIVINE PRE-DECREE</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for having faith in Allaah’s Divine Pre-Decree, then this entails believing in four things: First: That Allaah already knows what has occurred and what will occur. And He knows the conditions of His servants, and He knows their provisions, their life spans, their deeds and other affairs of their lives. Nothing of this remains hidden to Him, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily Allaah is knowledgeable of everything.”</strong> [Surah Al-Mujaadilah: 7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;That you may know that Allaah has power over all things, and that Allaah encompasses everything with His Knowledge.&#8221;</strong> [Surah At-Talaaq: 12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second: That Allaah has recorded everything that He has pre-decreed and ordained to occur, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“We know that which the earth takes of them (i.e. their dead bodies), and with Us is a Book preserved.”</strong> [Surah Qaaf: 4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And all things We have recorded in a Clear Book.&#8221;</strong> [Surah YaaSeen: 12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Know you not that Allaah knows all that is in the heaven and on the earth? Verily, it is all in a Book (Preserved Tablet). Surely that is easy for Allaah.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Hajj: 70]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: Believing that what He wills is put into effect and carried out. So whatever He wills comes to be and whatever He doesn’t will, will not come to pass. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily, Allaah does what He wills.”</strong> [Surah Al-Hajj: 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily His Command is that when He desires something, He says to it: ‘Be&#8217;, and it is.”</strong> [Surah YaaSeen: 82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And you cannot will unless it be that Allaah Wills, Lord of all that exists.”</strong> [Surah AtTakweer: 29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth</strong>: Believing that He created everything that exists, there being no Creator besides Him and no Lord other than Him, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Allaah is the Creator of everything, and He is the Guardian of all affairs.&#8221;</strong> [Surah AzZumar: 62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“O mankind! Remember Allaah’s Favor upon you! Is there a creator besides Allaah that provides for you from the heaven and the earth? There is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Him, so how can you turn away (from Him)?” [Surah Faatir: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So having Faith in the Divine Pre-Decree entails believing in these four things, according to Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, contrary to those amongst the innovators who reject some of the above.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What also falls under Faith in Allaah is: Believing that Faith (Eemaan) is speech and action, which increases with obedience (i.e. good deeds) and decreases with disobedience (i.e. sins), and that it is not permissible to declare anyone among the Muslims a disbeliever due to any sin, besides Shirk and disbelief, whether it be fornication, stealing, dealing in interest, drinking intoxicants, disobeying the parents or any of the other major sins, so long as one does not deem these sins to be permissible. This is based on Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Verily, Allaah does not forgive that partners be ascribed to Him (Shirk), but He forgives what is less than that to whom He wills.” [Surah An-Nisaa: 116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is also based on what has been authentically reported in the numerous ahaadeeth from the Prophet that: “Allaah will extract from the Hellfire whoever has in his heart an atom’s weight of Faith.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Faith in Allaah also entails loving for the sake of Allaah and hating for the sake of Allaah, as well as making allegiance for the sake of Allaah and making enmity for the sake of Allaah. So the believer loves and befriends the believers, and he hates and has enmity towards the disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At the head of the believers of this ummah are: the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam). So Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah love and befriend them and believe that they are the best of people after the prophets, due to the Prophet’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The best of generations is my generation, then those that come after them, then those that come after them.” [Its authenticity is agreed upon]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they hold that the best among the Companions was Abu Bakr As-Siddeeq, then ‘Umar AlFaarooq, then ‘Uthmaan Dhun-Noorain, then ‘Alee Al-Murtadaa, may Allaah be pleased with all of them. And after them (in excellence) comes the remaining ten Companions who were given the glad tidings of Paradise, then the rest of the Companions, may Allaah be pleased with all of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they refrain from whatever disputes occurred between the Companions, believing that they were Mujtahideen in that regard, therefore whoever amongst them was correct got two rewards whereas whoever was wrong got one reward. And they love the members of the household of Allaah’s Messenger who believed in him, thus showing allegiance to them. And they show allegiance to the wives of Allaah’s Messenger, the Mothers of the Believers, and are pleased with all of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they free themselves from the way of the Rawaafid (Raafidees), who hate and revile the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger and who go to extremes with regard to the members of the Prophet’s Household, raising them above the status Allaah gave them. And likewise they free themselves from the way of the Nawaasib (Naasibees) who disparage the members of the Prophet’s Household with words and actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everything that we mentioned in this brief treatise regarding the Correct Belief, that Allaah sent His Messenger Muhammad with, is the Creed of the Saved Sect, Ahlus-Sunnah walJamaa’ah, which the Prophet spoke about when he said: “There will not cease to be a group from my ummah victorious upon the truth. Those who break away from them will not be able to harm them, until the Order of Allaah comes.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “The Jews split into seventy-one sects and the Christians split into seventy-two sects. And this ummah will split into seventy-three sects – all of them will be in the Hellfire except one.” So the Companions said: “Which one is it O Messenger of Allaah?” He (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Those who are upon the likes of that which I and my Companions are upon.” This refers to the Creed that one is obligated to abide by, remain steadfast upon, and be cautious of what opposes it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who deviate from this Creed and those who follow its opposite, then they are of several types: Amongst them are those who worship idols, statues, angels, awliyaa (pious worshippers), Jinn, trees, stones, etc. These people have not answered the call of the messengers. On the contrary they have opposed and rejected them, as Quraish and other Arab tribes did with our prophet Muhammad. They would ask their deities to grant their needs, cure their ill and defeat their enemies, and they would offer sacrifices and make vows to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) forbade them from this and ordered them to sincerely worship Allaah alone, they found this strange and rejected it, saying: “Has he made (all) the gods into one God? This is truly a strange thing!” [Surah Saad: 5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he did not stop from calling them to Allaah and warning them from Shirk, and from explaining to them the reality of what he was calling to, to the point that Allaah guided those among them whom He guided. Afterward, scores of people entered into the Religion of Allaah and so the religion of Allaah become triumphant over all the other religions after an extensive call and long Jihaad from Allaah’s Messenger, his Companions and those who followed them in goodness. Then the conditions changed and ignorance prevailed over a majority of the creation to the point that a large portion of them turned back to the Religion of the Days of Ignorance, by going to extremes with regard to the prophets and pious worshippers, by supplicating to them, seeking assistance from them and performing other forms of Shirk. And they didn’t know the meaning of Laa Ilaaha IlaaAllaah, the way the disbelieving Arabs (during the time of the Prophet) used to understand it, and we seek Allaah’s aid!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Shirk has not stopped spreading amongst the people even to this time of ours due to the overwhelming magnitude of ignorance and the long distance of time that has passed since prophethood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The argument that these contemporary people use as proof is the same argument that those in the past used, which is their saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“These (idols) are our intercessors before Allaah” [Surah Yoonus: 18] and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“We only worship them so that they can bring us closer to Allaah.” [Surah Az-Zumar: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has invalidated this argument and clarified that whoever worships other than Him, whoever it may be, has ascribed partners to Him and disbelieved, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And they worship besides Allaah (false deities) that can neither harm them nor benefit them, and they say: ‘These (idols) are our intercessors before Allaah.’” [Surah Yoonus: 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah refuted them saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Say: &#8216;Are you informing Allaah of something He doesn’t know in the heavens and the earth? Far removed and High above is He from the partners they ascribe to Him!’” [Surah Yoonus: 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah explains in these verses that worshipping others besides Him, such as prophets, pious worshippers or anyone else, is considered major Shirk, even if those who commit it may call it by another name. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Those who take others as supporters besides Allaah say: ‘We only worship them so that they can bring us closer to Allaah.’” [Surah Az-Zumar: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah refuted them by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Verily Allaah will judge between them concerning that which they differed on. Verily, Allaah does not guide he who is a liar, a disbeliever.” [Surah Az-Zumar: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He clarified by this that their worship of others besides Him, be it through supplication, fear, hope and so on is in fact disbelieving in Him. And He denied their statement that their gods would bring them closer to Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the ideologies of disbelief that contradict the authentic Creed and oppose what the messengers came with is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What the atheists of this era believe in, such as the followers of Marx, Lenin and others who call to atheism and disbelief, regardless of whether they call that socialism, communism, ba’athism or any other name, for indeed from the base principles of these atheists is the belief that there is no god and that life is only (based on) matter. And from their principles is to reject the Day of Final Return, Paradise, Hellfire, and to disbelieve in all of the religions. Whoever examines their books and studies what beliefs they were upon will come to know that with full certainty. No doubt this belief is in contradiction to all of the heavenly revealed religions and leads its followers to the worst of fates in this world and the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the beliefs that are in opposition to the truth is that which some of the Baatinees and Sufis believe in that some of those whom they call awliyaa (saints) share with Allaah in His administration, and that they manage the affairs of the world. They call them Aqtaab, Awtaad, Aghwaath and other names that they have devised for their (false) gods. This is from the vilest forms of Shirk committed with regard to Allaah’s Lordship, and it is worse than the Shirk (polytheism) that was performed during the Days of Ignorance of the Arabs. This is since the disbelievers among the (first) Arabs did not commit Shirk with regard to Allaah’s Lordship, but rather they would only ascribe partners to Allaah in His worship. And their Shirk would occur during times of ease only. But as for times of distress and dire need, they would worship</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah sincerely, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And when they embark on a ship, they invoke Allaah, making their Faith pure for Him alone. But when He brings them safely to land, behold, they give a share of their worship to others.” [Surah Al-‘Ankaboot: 65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Allaah’s Lordship, they used to acknowledge that it belonged solely to Allaah alone, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And if you were to ask them who created them, they would surely say &#8216;Allaah.’&#8221; [Surah Az-Zukhruf: 87]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Say: &#8216;Who provides for you from the heaven and from the earth?’ Or ‘Who has power over hearing and sight?’ And ‘Who brings out the living from the dead and the dead from the living?’ And ‘Who administers all of the affairs?&#8217; They would surely say: &#8216;Allaah.&#8217; Say: &#8216;Will you not then fear and be dutiful to Him?’” [Surah Yoonus: 31] The verses bearing this same meaning are many.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the contemporary polytheists, they have surpassed the first polytheists in two things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: Some of them ascribe partners to Allaah in His Lordship</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second: They commit Shirk (polytheism) in times of comfort and in times of distress, as can be understood by the one who mixes with them, examines their conditions and looks at what they do at the gravesites of Al-Husayn, Al-Badawee and others in Egypt, and at the gravesite of Al-‘Eidroos in ‘Aden, Al-Haadee in Yemen, Ibn ‘Arabee in Syria, Shaikh ‘Abdul-Qaadir AlJilaanee in Iraq, and all the other gravesites that the common folk have gone to extremes about and to which they have transferred many of Allaah’s sole rights. How few are those who forbid them from this and explain to them the reality of Tawheed, which Allaah sent our prophet Muhammad and the messengers before him with. So verily to Allaah we belong and verily to Him we will return!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah to return them to what is correct and to place many callers of guidance amongst them and that He grant the Muslim leaders and scholars the ability to wage war against this Shirk (polytheism), verily He is the All-Hearer, the All-Encompassing. And from the beliefs that oppose the Correct Creed with regard to Allaah’s Names and Attributes are the beliefs of the innovators from the Jahmiyyah and the Mu’atazliah, as well as those who follow their way, which is that of negating Allaah’s Attributes, denying His Attributes of perfection, and describing Him with attributes of non-existence and inanimateness. Far removed is Allaah from their views!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What falls under this category are those who negate some of Allaah’s Attributes while affirming others, such as the Ash’arees, for indeed those Attributes that they do affirm necessitates the same thing that they are fleeing from with regard to the Attributes that they negate and whose evidences they misinterpret. So because of this, they have opposed the textual and logical proofs and fallen into clear contradiction. But as for Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, they affirm all the Names and Attributes that Allaah has affirmed for Himself or that His Messenger Muhammad has affirmed for Him, in a perfect manner. And they make Him free from resembling His creation in any way, without resorting to complete denial (of His Attributes). So they act upon all of the textual evidences, not distorting them or rejecting them. Thus they saved themselves from the contradictions that others fell into, as we have explained previously. This is the path of salvation and prosperity in this world and in the Hereafter. And it is the Straight Path, which the predecessors and Imaams of this ummah treaded upon. And (know) that the last part of this (Muslim) nation will not be rectified except with that which rectified its first part, and that is: Following the Qur’aan and the Sunnah and abandoning what opposes them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>THE NULLIFIERS OF ISLAAM</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know O Muslim brother that Allaah has obligated all of His servants to enter the fold of Islaam, to hold tightly onto it and to beware of those things that oppose it. And He sent His Prophet, Muhammad (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), to call the people to that, informing us that whoever follows him is guided, whereas whoever turns away from him is astray. In many ayaat (verses) of the Qur’aan, He has warned us about the things that cause one to apostate as well as all the rest of the types of Shirk (polytheism) and Kufr (disbelief).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars, may Allaah have mercy on them, have mentioned in their chapters on the “Ruling of the Apostate”, that a Muslim may apostate from his Religion through various types of Nullifiers (of Faith), which cause his life and wealth to become permissible (for taking) and which causes him to leave from the fold of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the most dangerous amongst them and those that occur most often are ten nullifiers [2] that we will mention to you in the following lines, in a summarized manner, so that you may beware of them and warn others about them, hoping that Allaah will protect and safeguard us from them. We will also mention a few short clarifications after them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: Shirk (associating partners) in the worship of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Verily, Allaah does not forgive that partners be associated with Him in worship (Shirk), but He forgives what is less than that to whom He wills.” [Surah An-Nisaa: 116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Verily, the one who mixes partners in worship with Allaah (Shirk), then Paradise has been made forbidden for him and his final abode will be the Hellfire. And the wrongdoers will not have any helpers (in Hell).” [Surah Al-Maa’idah: 72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What falls into this is supplicating and invoking the deceased, seeking assistance from them, as well as making oaths to them and offering sacrificial animals to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: Whoever places intermediaries between himself and Allaah, asking them to intercede on his behalf, and relying on them, has committed disbelief according to the unanimous agreement of the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: Whoever does not hold the polytheists to be disbelievers, or has doubts about their disbelief or considers their ways and beliefs to be correct, has committed disbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth</strong>: Whoever believes that some guidance other than that of the Prophet’s (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) is more complete than his guidance and that someone else’s judgement is better than his judgement, such as those who prefer the judgement of the Tawaagheet (pl. of Taaghoot; false deities/religions) over his judgement, then he is a disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifth</strong>: Whoever hates something that the Messenger came with, even though he may act on it, has disbelieved, based on Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“That is because they disliked what Allaah sent down, so He nullified their (good) deeds.” [Surah Muhammad: 9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sixth</strong>: Whoever mocks or ridicules any part of the Messenger’s Religion or its rewards or punishments has committed an act of disbelief. The proof for this is Allaah’s statement: “Say: ‘Was it Allaah and His verses and His Messenger that you were mocking? Make no excuses, you have disbelieved after having had faith.” [Surah At-Tawbah: 65-66]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Seventh</strong>: Sorcery, which includes magic spells that causes a person to hate (sarf)[3] or love (‘atf)[4] someone/something. So whoever performs it or is pleased with it being done, has committed disbelief. The proof for this is Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And neither of these two (angels) would teach anyone until they had first said to them: ‘We are only a trial (for the people), so do not commit disbelief.’” [Surah Al-Baqarah: 102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Eighth</strong>: Supporting and assisting the polytheists against the Muslims. The proof for this is Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And whoever amongst you takes them (i.e. the disbelievers) as allies and protectors then he is indeed from among them. Verily, Allaah does not guide a wrong-doing [5] people.” [Surah Al-Maa’idah: 51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ninth</strong>: Whoever believes that it is permitted for some people to be free of (implementing) the Sharee’ah (revealed laws) of Muhammad (i.e. Islaam), then he is a disbeliever, according to Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And whoever seeks a Religion other than Islaam, it will never be accepted from him and in the Hereafter, he will be from among the losers.” [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 85]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tenth</strong>: Turning away from Allaah’s Religion, not learning it or implementing it (is an act of disbelief). The proof for this is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And who does more wrong6 than he who is reminded7 of the ayaat (signs/verses) of his Lord, then turns away [8] from them. Verily, We shall extract retribution [9] from the criminals.” [Surah As-Sajdah: 22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no difference, with regard to (committing any of) these nullifiers, between the one who jokes, the one who is serious or the one who does so out of fear. However, the one who commits them due to being coerced (is excused). All of these (ten) matters are from the gravest in danger and from those that most often occur. So the Muslim must beware of them and fear from these acts befalling him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What falls into the Fourth Nullifier are those who believe that the man-made laws and constitutions that the people have legislated are better than the Sharee’ah (laws) of Islaam. Or those who believe that it is not correct to implement the Laws of Islaam in the twentieth century.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or that this is a cause for the backwardness of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or that it is limited to only playing a part in the relationship between the servant and his Lord and that it should not interfere in the other affairs of life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What also falls under this fourth category are those who hold that carrying out Allaah laws, such as cutting off the hand of a thief or stoning a guilty adulterer is not befitting for this modern era.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What also falls under this category are those who believe that it is permissible to rule by other than the Laws of Allaah (Sharee’ah) in matters of interactions, penal laws and so on, even if he doesn’t believe that it is better than ruling by the Sharee’ah. This is since by doing this, he will be making lawful that which Allaah has made forbidden, according to the unanimous consensus (Ijmaa’).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone that makes lawful that which Allaah has prohibited from the matters that one is required to know by necessity, such as fornication, alcohol, interest and ruling by other than Allaah’s Laws, then he is a disbeliever according to the Ijmaa’ (unanimous consensus) of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We seek refuge in Allaah from those things that bring about His Anger and painful Punishment. May the peace and blessings be on the best of His creatures, Muhammad (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[1] Translator’s Note: This means: What has been described to us already in the Qur’aan, as Allaah says: “He created man (Aadam) from sounding clay like the clay of pottery.” [Surah Ar-Rahmaan (55): 14]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[2] As mentioned by the Shaikh and Imaam, Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab, and other scholars, may Allaah have mercy on all of them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[3] Sarf: A Magic act done in order to turn a person away from what he desires, such as turning a man away from loving his wife to loving another.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[4] ‘Atf: A Magic act done in order to turn a person towards something that he does not desire, using satanic methods (to achieve it).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[5] Dhaalimoon (wrong-doing people) here means the disbelievers.:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[6] Meaning: “There is no one that does more wrong…”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[7] Tadh-keer (Reminder) means: “Admonishing and drawing one’s attention to something that must be called to mind.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[8] I’raad (turning away) means: “Refraining from and turning one’s back on.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[9] Intiqaam (revenge/seeking retribution) means: “Responding with severity against something that had been done prior.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Imaam Abu Bakr Al-Humaydee (Died 219H)<br />
SOURCE: His treatise &#8220;Usool-us-Sunnah&#8221; [Sahab.Org]<br />
PRODUCED BY:Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Text of the Treatise:</b></p>
<p>Bishr bin Moosaa narrated to us, saying: Al-Humaydee narrated to us, saying:</p>
<p><b>[Faith in the Divine Pre-Decree]</b><br />
1. The Sunnah, in our view, is that: A man believes in <i>Al-Qadar</i> (the Divine Pre-Decree) – the good and the evil, as well as the sweet and the bitter of it. And that a he knows that what befalls him from (Allaah’s) Decree will never miss him, and that what is not decreed for him will never befall him. And he must believe that all of this is an ordainment from Allaah.</p>
<p><b>[Faith is Speech and Action, and it Increases and Decreases]</b><br />
2. Eemaan (Faith) is speech and action. It increases and decreases. And no statement will be of benefit unless it is accompanied by an action, neither will a statement or an action be of benefit without the intention, and neither a statement, action or the intention will be of benefit in the absence of (one abiding by) the Sunnah.</p>
<p><b>[Praise for the Companions]</b><br />
3. Asking Allaah to bestow His mercy on all of the Companions of Muhammad (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>). This is since Allaah said: <b>“And those who came after them (i.e. after the Companions) say: ‘Our Lord, forgive us and our brothers who have preceded us in Faith. And do not put in our hearts any hatred for those who have believed. Our Lord, you are indeed full of Kindness, Most Merciful.”</b> [Surah Al-Hashr: 10]</p>
<p>One can never believe unless he asks Allaah’s forgiveness for them. So whoever reviles them or belittles them or even just one from among them, then he is not upon the Sunnah and he has no right to the (war) booty.[1] We have been informed about this by several sources that Maalik bin Anas (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said: “Allaah has divided the war-booty amongst <b>‘the poor emigrants who were expelled from their homes and their property…’</b> up to where He said: <b>‘…And those who came after them, say: ‘Our Lord, forgive us and our brothers.’</b> [Surah Al-Hashr: 8-10] So whoever does not say this for them, he is not from those whom Allaah has given a portion of the war-booty to.”</p>
<p><b>[The Qur’aan is the Speech of Allaah]</b><br />
4. The Qur’aan is the Speech of Allaah. I heard Sufyaan (bin ‘Uyainah) say: “The Qur’aan is the Speech of Allaah. And whoever says that it is created, is an innovator. We did not hear anyone (from the Salaf) saying this.”</p>
<p><b>[The Statement of Sufyaan regarding Faith]</b><br />
5. And I heard Sufyaan say: “Eemaan (Faith) is speech and action; it increases and decreases.”</p>
<p>So his brother, Ibraaheem bin ‘Uyainah, said to him: “O Abu Muhammad, we don’t hold that it decreases.” So Sufyaan became angry and said: “Be quiet, child.” &#8211; to the point that nothing else came out from him.</p>
<p><b>[The Believers will see their Lord on the Day of Judgement]</b><br />
6. An affirmation that the believers will see Allaah after death.</p>
<p><b>[Confirming Allaah’s Attributes]</b><br />
7. As for what is stated in the Qur’aan and the Hadeeth, such as: “The Jews say: <b>‘Allaah’s Hand is tied up.’ May their hands be tied up”</b> [Surah Al-Maa’idah: 64] and such as: <b>“The heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand”</b> [Surah Az-Zumar: 67] as well as whatever resembles that from the Qur’aan and the Hadeeth, we do not exceed beyond that nor do we interpret it. Rather, we stop at where the Qur’aan and the Sunnah stopped at, and we say: <b>“The Most Merciful (Allaah) rose over His Throne.”</b> [Surah TaHa: 5] Whoever claims something other than this is a Mu’attil (denier of Allaah’s Attributes), a Jahmee. [2]</p>
<p><b>[The Difference between Ahlus-Sunnah and the Khawaarij]</b><br />
8. We do not say as the Khawaarij say: “Whoever commits a major sin has disbelieved.” We do not deem a Muslim to be a disbeliever due to any of the sins. Rather, disbelief (only) lies in the abandonment of the five (pillars of Islaam), about which Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“Islaam is built upon five things: Testifying that there is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah; (2) Establishing the Prayer; (3) Giving the Zakaat; (4) Fasting in Ramadaan; (5) and Making the Pilgrimage (Hajj) to Allaah’s house (Ka’bah).”</b></p>
<p><b>[When does the Proof become established on one who abandons all or some of the Pillars of Islaam?]</b><br />
9. As for three of these pillars, then there is no difference between the one who abandons any of them. They are not saying the testimony of Faith, not praying and not fasting. This is because he is delaying part of these pillars from their proper times. And whoever makes them up after having neglected them <i>intentionally</i> from their proper times will not be rewarded.</p>
<p>And as for Zakaat, when one does not give it, it will be held against him, and count as a sin because of his holding it back.</p>
<p>As for Hajj, then whoever is obligated to go on it and has the means to perform it, then he must go. But it is not obligatory for him to perform it every year in the case that he has already performed it. When he performs the Hajj, he is considered as having performed it and he is not counted as a sinner if he delays it, as is the case with the person who is sinful by delaying the Zakaat. This is because Zakaat is a right of the needy Muslims, whom he has withheld it from. So if he performs the Hajj, then he has fulfilled its obligation. And if he dies, whilst he was present and able to perform the Hajj but didn’t do it, he will be asked to return to the worldly life (so he can perform it). His family members are obligated to perform the Hajj on his behalf, and we hope that if they do this, it will be counted as if he had performed it, in the same manner as if he had a debt, which was repaid after his death.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b class="Marker">Footnotes:</b></p>
<p>[1] <b>Translator’s Note:</b> This refers to the war booty achieved from the battle against the Jews of Banu An-Nadeer. Commencing from the sixth ayah of Surah Al-Hashr, Allaah clarifies who is entitled to this war booty, up until the tenth ayah, which mentions those who come after the Muhaajireen (emigrants) and the Ansaar (Muslim residents of Madeenah), i.e. the Companions. So whoever amongst <b>“those who came after them”</b> does not perform what is indicated in this ayah (10) of asking forgiveness for the Sahaabah, then he has no right to the war-booty.</p>
<p>[2] <b>Translator’s Note:</b> Imaam Ibn Al-‘Uthaimeen said about the Jahmiyyah: “They attribute themselves to Al-Jahm bin Safwaan who was killed by Saalim or Salim bin Ahwaz in the year 121H. Their views on the Attributes of Allaah consist of ta&#8217;teel (denial) and nafee (negation). Regarding Al-Qadar (Divine Pre-Decree), they hold the opinion that mankind is coerced to do deeds (al-jabr). Their view on Eemaan is that of Irjaa, which means that they believe Eemaan is merely the confirmation of the heart, and that statements and actions are not part of Eemaan. So according to them, someone who commits a major sin is a believer with complete Eemaan (i.e. Eemaan does not increase or decrease). So they are the Mu&#8217;atazilah, Jabariyyah and Murji’ah all in one and they are divided into many sects.” [<i>Sharh Lum’at-ul-‘Itiqaad</i>]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Read the Article:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know, may Allaah&#8217;s Mercy be upon you, that Allaah (<em>subhanahu wa ta’ala</em>: Far is He removed from every imperfection, the Most High) made it very clear that mankind must follow Islaam, hold to it and dissociate from whatever contradicts it. The declaration that <em>Laa Ilaaha Illallaah</em> &#8220;There is none worthy of worship except Allaah&#8221; not only negates all false deities and confirms worship only to Allaah, it also requires the complete dissociation from any form of worship to any false deity;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (subhanahu wa ta’ala) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَا إِكْرَاهَ فِي الدِّينِ ۖ قَد تَّبَيَّنَ الرُّشْدُ مِنَ الْغَيِّ ۚ فَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِالطَّاغُوتِ وَيُؤْمِن بِاللَّهِ فَقَدِ اسْتَمْسَكَ بِالْعُرْوَةِ الْوُثْقَىٰ لَا انفِصَامَ لَهَا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;There is no compulsion in religion. Verily, the right path has become distinct from the wrong path. Whoever disbelieves in Taaghut (false deities) and believes in Allaah, then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that will never break.&#8221;</span></em>(Qur&#8217;an 2: 256)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, to declare that Muhammad (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam: may Allaah Exalt his mention and safeguard him and his message) is the Messenger and slave of Allaah requires the belief that Muhammad (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam) is trusted by Allaah (subhanahu wa ta’ala) to deliver the Message of Islaam, and that Muhammad (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam) is to be followed and obeyed because Allaah (subhanahu wa ta’ala) decreed in the Qur’an:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا آتَاكُمُ الرَّسُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَاكُمْ عَنْهُ فَانتَهُوا ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And whatsoever the Messenger gives you, take it. And whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it) and fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is severe in punishment.&#8221;</span></em> (Qur&#8217;an 59: 7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All the ways and methods that are needed by the Muslim to fulfill this declaration of Tawheed [2] are explained in the Qur&#8217;an and by the Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (subhanahu wa ta’ala) and His Messenger (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam) warned that there are ways that lead to Shirk,[3] Kufr [4] and rejection of Faith. The Muslim must be very knowledgeable about Tawheed so that he does not indulge in practices and concepts that contradict the essence of Islaam. The most dangerous and widely existing ways that breach Tawheed are:</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>ONE</strong>: Shirk in the worship of Allah: to associate something and/or anyone in the worship of Allaah:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاءُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily Allaah forgives not setting up rivals in worship with Him, but He forgives whom He pleases other sins than that.&#8221;</span></em> (Qur’an 4: 116)</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّهُ مَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَقَدْ حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ الْجَنَّةَ وَمَأْوَاهُ النَّارُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily, whosoever sets up rivals in worship with Allaah, then Allaah has forbidden Al-Jannah for him, and the Fire will be his abode.&#8221;</span> </em>(Qur’an 5: 72)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>TWO</strong>: Setting up intermediaries between a person and Allaah is Kufr (disbelief): calling upon them and seeking their intercession and depending upon them. Those who do this are taking &#8220;associates&#8221; with Allaah and this is Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (subhanahu wa ta’ala) says (what means):</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">فَلَا تَجْعَلُوا لِلَّهِ أَندَادًا وَأَنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Then set not up rivals unto Allaah (in worship) while you know (that He Alone has the right to be worshiped).</span></em> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam) was asked: <strong>&#8216;Which sin is the Gravest? He said: &#8220;That you set up rivals unto Allaah (despite the fact) that He has created you.”</strong>[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (subhanahu wa ta’ala) says (what means):</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَا تَدْعُ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مَا لَا يَنفَعُكَ وَلَا يَضُرُّكَ ۖ فَإِن فَعَلْتَ فَإِنَّكَ إِذًا مِّنَ الظَّالِمِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And call not on other than Allaah, any that will neither profit you, nor hurt you but if (in case) you did so, you shall certainly be one of Ath-thalimeen (who commit Shirk)&#8221;.</span> </em>(Qur’an 10:106)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THREE</strong>: Believing that the Mushrikeen (those who commit Shirk) are not Kufar or doubting their Kufr or defending and correcting the beliefs of the Kufar, is Kufr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (subhanahu wa ta’ala) says (what means):</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"> وَمَن يَتَوَلَّهُم مِّنكُمْ فَإِنَّهُ مِنْهُمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;And if any amongst you who take them (wholeheartedly) as friends, then surely he is one of them.&#8221;</em></span>(Qur&#8217;an 5: 51)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is one of the greatest contradictions to Tawheed. Here it is important to caution that many Muslims are reluctant (and feel ashamed) to say the word &#8220;Kufr&#8221; to describe a disbeliever or to point out their acts of Shirk. Some even look at the Kufar with great deal of admiration, fear and obedience. Those have an inferiority complex that leads them to become blind followers and defenders of the Kufar and their ways. They are at grave danger since this may “melt” their identity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslim&#8217;s position about these matters must be dissociation from Kufr and Shirk, but Love for Allaah (subhanahu wa ta’ala), His Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam) and the believers:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَّا يَتَّخِذِ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ الْكَافِرِينَ أَوْلِيَاءَ مِن دُونِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ ۖ وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذَٰلِكَ فَلَيْسَ مِنَ اللَّهِ فِي شَيْءٍ إِلَّا أَن تَتَّقُوا مِنْهُمْ تُقَاةً ۗ وَيُحَذِّرُكُمُ اللَّهُ نَفْسَهُ ۗ وَإِلَى اللَّهِ الْمَصِيرُ  </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Let not the believers take the disbelievers as Awliyaa&#8217; (supporters, helpers, etc.) instead of believers, and whoever does that will never be helped by Allaah in any way, except if you indeed fear a danger from them. And Allaah warns you against Himself (His punishment), and to Allaah is the final return.&#8221;</span></em> (Qur’an 3: 28)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>FOUR</strong>: The belief that guidance by someone other than the Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam) is better or that ruling by other than the rule of Muhammad (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam) is better, then this is Kufr. The rule of Muhammad (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam) is the rule of Allaah:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَلَا وَرَبِّكَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ حَتَّىٰ يُحَكِّمُوكَ فِيمَا شَجَرَ بَيْنَهُمْ ثُمَّ لَا يَجِدُوا فِي أَنفُسِهِمْ حَرَجًا مِّمَّا قَضَيْتَ وَيُسَلِّمُوا تَسْلِيمًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;But no, by your Lord, they can have no true Faith (al-waajib: which is dutiful upon them), until they make you judge in all disputes between them, and find in their souls no resistance against your decisions, but accept (them) fully with submission.&#8221;</span></em>(Qur&#8217;an 4: 65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some examples of this are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) The belief that systems and laws made by human beings are better than, or equal to the Sharee&#8217;ah of Islaam; or that Islamic system is not suitable for the contemporary times, and that Islaam is the cause of backwardness of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) The belief that enforcing the punishments prescribed by Allaah (subhanahu wa ta’ala), such as cutting of the hand of the thief or the stoning of an adulterer, is not suitable for this day and age.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>FIVE</strong>: Hating any command or anything of the Prophet&#8217;s (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam) Message despite practicing it is Kufr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (subhanahu wa ta’ala) says (what means):</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَرِهُوا مَا أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ فَأَحْبَطَ أَعْمَالَهُمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;That is because they hate that which Allaah has sent down, so He has made their deeds fruitless.&#8221;</span> </em>(Qur&#8217;an 47: 9)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>SIX</strong>: Mocking any part of Islaam or any of Allaah&#8217;s Names and Attributes is Kufr. Allaah, the Most High, says (what means):</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ إِنَّمَا كُنَّا نَخُوضُ وَنَلْعَبُ ۚ قُلْ أَبِاللَّهِ وَآيَاتِهِ وَرَسُولِهِ كُنتُمْ تَسْتَهْزِئُونَ لَا تَعْتَذِرُوا قَدْ كَفَرْتُم بَعْدَ إِيمَانِكُمْ ۚ إِن نَّعْفُ عَن طَائِفَةٍ مِّنكُمْ نُعَذِّبْ طَائِفَةً بِأَنَّهُمْ كَانُوا مُجْرِمِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Was it at Allaah, and His signs, and His Messenger that you were mocking? Make no excuse, you have disbelieved (became Kufar) after you had believed.&#8221;</span></em>(Qur&#8217;an 9: 65-66)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>SEVEN</strong>: Involvement in Magic: considering it permissible to practice and spread ways that may (i) sway man from the good things he likes (e.g., using magic to sow discord between a man and his wife) or (ii) reduce man to do what he dislikes or is bad for him. These ways of magic are Satanic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (subhanahu wa ta’ala) says (what means):</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا كَفَرَ سُلَيْمَانُ وَلَٰكِنَّ الشَّيَاطِينَ كَفَرُوا يُعَلِّمُونَ النَّاسَ السِّحْرَ وَمَا أُنزِلَ عَلَى الْمَلَكَيْنِ بِبَابِلَ هَارُوتَ وَمَارُوتَ ۚ وَمَا يُعَلِّمَانِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ حَتَّىٰ يَقُولَا إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ فِتْنَةٌ فَلَا تَكْفُرْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Solomon did not disbelieve but the devils disbelieved, teaching men magic and such things that came down at Babylon to the two angels (put coma after the word angels) Harut and Marut, but neither of these two (angels) taught anyone (such things) till they had said: We are only for trial, so disbelieve not (by learning the magic from us).&#8221;</span></em>(Qur&#8217;an 2: 102)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Today, we see many people seek help from the so called fortunetellers. They believe that these tellers know what will happen. This is Kufr. The Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam) warned that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever goes to a priest (soothsayer or a fortuneteller), and believes him in what he says has committed Kufr and denied what was revealed to Muhammad (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam)”</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>EIGHT</strong>: Standing by the Mushrikeen, supporting them and helping them against the Muslims (so that mushrikeen will be the prevalent ones) is Kufr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (subhanahu wa ta’ala) says (what means):</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يَتَوَلَّهُم مِّنكُمْ فَإِنَّهُ مِنْهُمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And he amongst you who take them as friends (WHOLEHEARTEDLY), then surely he is one of them.&#8221;</span> </em>(Qur&#8217;an 5: 51)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NINE</strong>: Believing that some &#8220;special&#8221; people don&#8217;t have to follow the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam) is Kufr because this negates the second part of the declaration of Tawheed &#8216;Muhammad is the slave and Messenger of Allaah,” since this constitutes desiring a &#8220;religion&#8221; other than Islaam. Allaah (subhanahu wa ta’ala) says (what means):</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يَبْتَغِ غَيْرَ الْإِسْلَامِ دِينًا فَلَن يُقْبَلَ مِنْهُ وَهُوَ فِي الْآخِرَةِ مِنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And whoever desires a religion other than Islaam, it will never be accepted from him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.&#8221;</span></em> (Qur’an 3: 85)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>TEN</strong>: Completely turning away from the religion of Allaah, not learning it and practicing it, is Kufr.</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّن ذُكِّرَ بِآيَاتِ رَبِّهِ ثُمَّ أَعْرَضَ عَنْهَا ۚ إِنَّا مِنَ الْمُجْرِمِينَ مُنتَقِمُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And who does wrong than the one to whom are recited the Aayat (proofs, evidences, verses, revelations, etc.) of his Lord, then he turns aside therefrom? Verily, We shall exact retribution from the Mujrimin (criminals, disbelievers, polytheists, sinners etc.)&#8221;</span> </em>(Qur’an 32: 22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and He, the Most High, also says (what means):</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا عَمَّا أُنذِرُوا مُعْرِضُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;But those who disbelieve turn away from that about which they are warned.&#8221;</span></em> (Qur’an 46:3).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An authentic hadeeth reported in Saheeh Al-Jaami&#8217; (a collection of authentic narrations verified by the Scholar of hadeeth Sheikh Muhammad Nassir Ad-Deen al-Albaani) V.2 # 5939. Believing in sorcery and horoscopy is as setting up rivals with Allaah. This is Shirk.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Finally, it must be pointed out that there is no difference (in accountability) between the one who seriously commits any of the above acts or the one who claims to be just &#8220;joking&#8221;, &#8220;playing&#8221; or &#8220;mocking&#8221;!</strong></span> The only exception is when someone commits any of these acts under compulsion; even then his heart must be filled with faith and Tawheed of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another serious matter is that the issue of declaring someone Kufr (rulers or ruled). This is not left for the unlearned of the common Muslims or heads of hizbee-groups or the like. It is to be left to the reliable scholars who follow the Qur’an, authentic Sunnah in the context of the Salaf’s way of understanding the Deen, not to innovators and the politically and emotionally driven ones. We must fear Allah in this matter which had caused and is still causing deviation in the Ummah at large.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We seek refuge in Allaah from such deeds and we ask Him to make the truth clear to us all.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Appendix<br />
<strong><span style="color:#800000;">Definition of Taaghut</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taaghut: Derived from Tughyaan, exceeding the limits. So:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Whatever is worshipped instead of or to the exclusion of Allaah is a Taaghut. So, any human being who is pleased to be set as an object of worship is a Taaghut.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The one who exceeds the limits concerning following and obedience to other than Allaah, and sets others as rivals with Allaah, then himself is a Taaghut.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- Those who make Istihlaal, making the unlawful lawful or vice versa, and are obeyed for that are Taaghut, because they are being set as Lords besides Allah. Here it must be known that obeying them on their Istihlaal is divided into three categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) The person obeys them while pleased and content by their saying, giving precedence to their judgments, and discontent with Allaah’s ruling, then he is a Kufr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) The person obeys them while accepting Allaah’s ruling and knowing that it is the best and the most fitting to man, but due to lowly desire in himself he chooses otherwise. For example, he may be seeking a job, and so forth. In this case it is not Kufr, rather he is a Faasiq (rebellion, disobedient).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(iii) The person obeys them due to ignorance, thinking that their rulings are those of Allaah’s. This is subdivided into two cases:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) The person is able to know the truth by himself, but he is negligent. In this case he is sinful, because Allaah ordered to ask the people of knowledge when matters are not known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) The person is not knowledgeable and unable to learn but he follows them by way of blind following believing that it is the truth. In this case there is nothing upon him, i.e not held blameworthy. [See Al-Qawlul Muffed ‘Alaa Kitaab at-Tawheed, by our Shayekh Muhammad bin Salih Al-‘Uthaimeen, v.2, pp. 157-158, with slight adaptation].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. It covers also all that which opposes Allaah&#8217;s Judgment. And this is of different levels and ranks. Some may lead to exiting the fold of Islam, while others don&#8217;t.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Some examples on Taaghut:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those followed, like soothsayers, magicians, and evil “scholars,” are Taaghut. Those pleased for being worshipped besides Allaah, as well as idols, are Taaghut</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Very Important to Remember</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(i) General Statements of Imputation of Kufr.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is known as Itlaaq-ut-Takfeer: stating in the general sense, such as to say, “whoever does or says such and such,”from what is known to be Kufr then he is a Kafir.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(ii) Applicability on a particular person:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is known at Takfeer-ul-Mu’ayyan It is to impute what is generally stated to be Kufr on a particular person. This can be established only after conditions of Takfeer (imputing Kufr) are met as well as all impediments which may hinder the imputing of Kufr are removed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(iii) Who Are the Ones who advise on these Enormous Matters?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Imputation of Kufr is very serious and it is not left for common Muslims or the student of knowledge to decide. Surely the reliable scholars following the path of the salaf are the ones who can advise concerning these immense issues. So people should refrain and hold themselves so as not to hasten to impute Kufr on a particular person before the evidences are established and impediments are removed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, the Most High, Knows best.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Footnotes:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] <strong>Taaghut</strong>: It may be Satan and/or anyone who is worshipped other than Allah and is pleased and/or calls for it. [See Appendix]. Here I relate a very important benefit explaining the issue of Taaghut which is often misunderstood by enthusiastic young Muslims and it is by Shayekh Sulaimaan Ibn Samhaan (rahimahullaah: may Allaah’s Mercy be upon him). He said: “It should be known that the one who seeks judgments from the Taaghut, or rules by other than Allaah’s rule while believing that (these) judgments are more perfect and better than the Judgment of Allaah and His Messenger, then this is disbelief (Kufr ‘aqadi: pertaining to creed) that takes the person out of the fold of Islam-as it is mentioned in the ten nullifiers of Islam. However, as to the one who does not believe as such but resorted to the Taaghut judgment while believing that it to be false, then this is of the practical type of disbelief (Kufr’amali: lesser type that does not take the person from Islam). [See Irshaadut-Taalib Ilaa Ahamadil-Mataalib, p. 19.] In addition, anyone (ruler or ruled) who equates the judgment of Allaah and His Messengers to that of man, or believes that the rules of man are more fitting to our times than the Islamic laws, commits Kufr [See Shayekh bin Baaz’s (rahimahullaah) details on this matter in Qadiyyatu-t-Takfeer bayna ahlis-sunnah wa ffiraqu-d-Dalaal, by Shayekh Sa’eed Ibn Wahf Al-Qahtaani, pp. 72-73.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is, therefore, concluded that the term Taaghut in itself does not necessarily translate into major disbelief and apostasy, since every Kufr is Taaghut, but not every Taaghut is Kufr. Imaam Ibnul Qayyim (rahimahullaah) considered that figurative interpretations of Allaah’s Names and Attributes through scholastic ways, and giving precedence to the intellect over the legal texts as Taaghuts (in as-Sawaa’iq alMursalah, v.2, 632-633). Certainly, none considers every level of these distortions as a major Kufr!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] <strong>Tawheed</strong>: Belief in Oneness and Uniqueness of Allah. Allah is One in His Lordship, One in His God-ship, and One in His Actions, Names and Attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] <strong>Shirk</strong>: Associating anyone/anything in the worship of Allaah (subhana wa ta’ala) or setting up rivals with Allaah (subhana wa ta’ala).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] <strong>Kufr</strong>: Disbelieving in Allah (subhana wa ta’ala) and His Messengers whether by denial, doubts, suspicion, aversion, jealousy, arrogance or following some whims which deters one from adhering to the Message.</p>

<p><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Before you is a complete translation of a treatise written by Imaam Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab, “<i>Al-Qawaa’id-ul-Arba’ah</i>”, with an explanation by Dr. Muhammad bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Khumayyis. The treatise, along with its explanation, was printed in a larger book: “<i>Jam’-ul-Funoon fee Sharh Jumlati Mutoon Li’’Aqaa’id Ahlis-Sunnah ‘alal-Madhaahib-il-Arba’ah</i>” [A Compilation of Explanations of Treatises on the Creed of Ahlus-Sunnah according to the Four Madh-habs] by Daar Ilaaf Publishers. The treatise was then printed as a separate booklet in order to spread the benefit and facilitate the knowledge for readers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The treatise “<i>Al-Qawaa’id-ul-‘Arba’ah</i>” <b>[The Four Rules regarding Shirk]</b> is well known throughout the Muslim world and needs no introduction. It is a basic discussion that provides fundamental principles regarding Shirk. Although short in size, it is an extremely valuable source of knowledge and a must–read for all students desiring to further their understanding of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The commentator, Muhammad bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Khumayyis, has added summaries and several test questions at the end of each section, in order to facilitate the study of the material for the readers and students.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Al-Fataawaa al-Jaliyyah ‘anil-Manaahij Ad-Da’wiyyah (pg. 56-57) compiled by Hasan Ibn Mahmood Ibn Mansoor ad-Daghreeri<br />
Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Salafee Manhaj</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. We worship Allaah by way of Tawheed. So we do not supplicate to anyone besides Allaah nor do we seek refuge in anyone besides Him in matters of bringing about good or repelling some harm. We perform worship by having hatred and enmity for the polytheists. However, we are obligated to call them to Tawheed first and clarify to them that there is no Islaam without Tawheed and that whoever calls unto other than Allaah has committed disbelief. So whoever persists after that, then at that point we are obligated to distance ourselves from him and hate him for the sake of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The Creed of the Salaf is established upon the principle that <b>&#8220;Allaah is described with what He has described himself with in His Book and upon the tongue of His Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>), without resorting to tahreef, tamtheel, tashbeeh, ta’teel or ta’weel.&#8221;</b> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. We affirm for Allaah the best of Names, which He has affirmed for Himself and which He has praised Himself with, whether they are mentioned in the Qur’aan or the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. We believe that there is no path towards achieving Allaah’s contentment, or a way towards Paradise, except through the Way of Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>). And whoever seeks a way towards gaining Allaah’s contentment through other than the Way of Allaah’s Messenger, then he has gone astray and been blinded from the truth. And he has lost in this world and the next.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. We believe that the Legislation of Allaah is what has been brought down through the two revelations: The Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>). This is what our Lord has indicated in his saying: <b>&#8220;Then we placed you on a Sharee&#8217;ah (Legislated System) based on Our Command, so follow it, and do not follow the desires of those who have no knowledge.&#8221;</b> [Surah Al-Jaathiyah: 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. We believe that the Qur’aan is the Speech of Allaah, which was revealed and not created, and that the Sunnah is what explains and clarifies it. The Qur’aan is interpreted by the Sunnah and by the interpretations of the Sahaabah (Companions) and those who followed them in goodness. So the interpretation of the Qur’aan is by way of the narration, meaning by way of the Sahaabah, the Taabi’een and the Ahaadeeth concerning it. And the books that contain these interpretations are the ones we are obligated to acquire and read, such as the Tafseer of Ibn Jareer, the Tafseer of Ibn Katheer, the Tafseer of Al-Baghawee, the Tafseer<i>&#8220;Ad-Durr Al-Manthoor&#8221;</i> of As-Suyootee and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. We are obligated to take the Sunnah according to the way of the Muhadditheen &#8211; in terms of their authenticity or weakness. So we take what is found to be authentic and leave off what is weak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. We worship Allaah by obeying the rulers, as long as they are Muslims who seek judgement through Allaah’s Legislation and who establish the prescribed punishments, and as long as they establish the prayer. Obeying them is an obligation even if they commit oppression. And whoever says something contrary to this and makes it permissible to revolt against the Muslim leader, even if he may be oppressive, then he is an innovator and a deviant. And it is obligatory on the Muslim scholars to refute this statement of his and to expose his deviance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. We hold that it is not permissible to spread the faults of the leaders, because doing this influences and brings about trials and afflictions (fitan), and causes them to spread.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. We are obligated to worship Allaah through the Sunnah, by following it and by loathing innovations and the innovators. This is based on the Prophet’s saying: <b>&#8220;Whoever does a deed, which is not in accordance to our affair (i.e. the Sunnah) is rejected.&#8221;</b> And in another narration: <b>&#8220;Whoever introduces into our affair (Sunnah) that which isn’t part of it is rejected.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a summary and some brief words on the Creed of the Salaf, which we are obligated to accept and follow if we truly want salvation and the truth. And we must renounce those opinions of men, which cannot be traced back to any source of evidence, since men are known by way of the truth and the truth is not known by way of men. Lastly, we must beg and implore Allaah to show us the truth as true and enable us to follow it, and to show us the falsehood as false and enable us to avoid it. Indeed Allaah is Responsible for that and Able to make it happen. And may the peace and blessings of Allaah be on Muhammad &#8211; the best, most dutiful, most pious and purest of creation &#8211; and on his family and his Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b class="Marker">Footnotes:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="Footnotes">[1] <b>Translator’s Note:</b> These are forbidden acts committed against Allaah’s Names and Attributes. Tahreef means to change or distort the wording of Allaah’s name or attribute. Tamtheel and tashbeeh means to give a like resemblance to a name or an attribute. Ta’teel means total denial of a name or an attribute. Ta’weel means to misinterpret a name or an attribute, thus changing it’s meaning.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">قُل لَّا يَعۡلَمُ مَن فِى ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٲتِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضِ ٱلۡغَيۡبَ إِلَّا ٱللَّهُ‌ۚ وَمَا يَشۡعُرُونَ أَيَّانَ يُبۡعَثُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Say: &#8220;None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghaib (unseen) except Allâh, nor can they perceive when they shall be resurrected.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Naml 27:65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَعِندَهُ ۥ مَفَاتِحُ ٱلۡغَيۡبِ لَا يَعۡلَمُهَآ إِلَّا هُوَ‌ۚ وَيَعۡلَمُ مَا فِى ٱلۡبَرِّ وَٱلۡبَحۡرِ‌ۚ وَمَا تَسۡقُطُ مِن وَرَقَةٍ إِلَّا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;And with Him are the keys of the Ghaib (all that is hidden), none knows them but He. And He knows whatever there is in the land and in the sea; not a leaf falls, but he knows it. There is not a grain in the darkness of the earth nor anything fresh or dry, but is written in a Clear Record.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-An’aam 6:59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عِندَهُ ۥ عِلۡمُ ٱلسَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ ٱلۡغَيۡثَ وَيَعۡلَمُ مَا فِى ٱلۡأَرۡحَامِ‌ۖ وَمَا تَدۡرِى نَفۡسٌ۬ مَّاذَا تَڪۡسِبُ غَدً۬ا‌ۖ وَمَا تَدۡرِى نَفۡسُۢ بِأَىِّ أَرۡضٍ۬ تَمُوتُ‌ۚ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ خَبِيرُۢ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Verily, Allâh! With Him (Alone) is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs. No person knows what he will earn tomorrow, and no person knows in what land he will die. Verily, Allâh is All¬Knower, All¬Aware (of things).&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Luqmaan 31:34].</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">In this book, we present the classical treatise on Creed of Imaam Ibn Qudaamah Al-Maqdisee, rahimahullaah, known as Lum&#8217;at-ul-&#8216;Itiqaad, which is studied all over the Muslim world. Imaam Muhammad bin Saalih Al-&#8216;Uthaimeen, rahimahullaah, has provided an in depth explanation for the points touched on by the author in a clear and simple manner. Furthermore, the narrations mentioned in the book have been verified and lengthy and extensive footnotes have been provided to make this book a valuable source of reference.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Muhammad bin Saalih Al-&#8216;Uthaimeen said in his introduction to this book: &#8216;This is a brief commentary of the book &#8216;Lum’at-ul-‘Itiqaad”, written by Abu Muhammad ‘Abdullaah bin Ahmad Ibn Qudaamah Al-Maqdisee (rahimahullaah), who was born in Sha’baan in 541H in a village from the districts of Nablis (present-day Palestine) and who died on the day of ‘Eed-ul-Fitr in 620H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this book, the author (rahimahullaah) gathered together the main points of the Islaamic Creed (‘Aqeedah). For this reason, the Board of the Educational Institutes assigned this book to be studied and taught during the second semester of the first year of study, so that it may serve as a pillar upon which one can establish his Creed at this stage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because I saw the importance of this book in terms of the topics it touches upon, its methodology and the lack of there being any explanation for it, I became determined, while seeking assistance from Allaah and hoping that He grant me correctness in intention and action, to put forth some words on it, in the attempt to clarify its ambiguous parts, explain its meanings and bring to light its main points.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No doubt this book is of great importance for the Muslim with regard to establishing the correct Creed. This book is deserving of being taught and studied so that it may serve as a foundation for both the students of knowledge and the common Muslims. The topics touched upon by the author relate to the authentic Creed and Methodology, which all Muslims are obligated to have knowledge of. Consequently, we encourage everyone to purchase a copy of this magnificent book.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Noble Shaykh ‘Abdullah an-Najmi (May Allah Preserve Him) from the mashaayikh of Jeezan, SaudiArabia will deliver a LIVE tele-lecture with Muwahhideen Publications on Friday 26th April 2013. The Shaykh is a student of Ash-Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmi (rahimahullah) and Shaykh Zayd al-Madkhalee (hafidhahullah).</p>
<p style="color:#777777;"><strong>Allah</strong> says in His Book,</p>
<p style="color:#777777;text-align:justify;" align="center">“O you who believe! Ward off from yourselves and your families a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones”<br />
<strong>[At-Tahrim: 6]</strong></p>
<p style="color:#777777;">Regarding this verse, the following narrations were reported from the <em style="color:#000000;">Salaf</em> &#8211;</p>
<p style="color:#777777;text-align:justify;"><em style="color:#000000;">‘Ali Ibn Abi Taalib (radhiyAllahu ‘anhu)</em>: “Discipline them, teach them.”</p>
<p style="color:#777777;text-align:justify;"><em style="color:#000000;">Ibn ‘Abbaas (radhiyAllahu ‘anhum)</em>: “Stay obedient to <strong>Allah</strong>, stay away from disobeying <strong>Allah</strong> and command your families to remember <strong>Allah</strong>, and He will save you from the Fire.”</p>
<p style="color:#777777;text-align:justify;"><em style="color:#000000;">Mujaahid (rahimahullah)</em>: “Fear <strong>Allah</strong> and obey him (practice <em style="color:#000000;">taqwa</em>) and tell your families to practice <em style="color:#000000;">taqwa</em>.”</p>
<p style="color:#777777;text-align:justify;"><em style="color:#000000;">Qataadah (rahimahullah)</em>: “A person protects his family by telling them to obey <strong>Allah</strong> and forbidding them from disobeying Him. He upholds <strong>Allah’s</strong> commandments and helps his family to uphold them. So if you see some disobedience of <strong>Allah</strong> you stop them from doing it, and you reprimand them.”<strong> [Al-Tabarî, Al-Tafsîr, Sûrah Al-Tahrîm] [From SayingsoftheSalaf.net]</strong></p>
<p style="color:#777777;text-align:justify;">The Messenger of <strong>Allah</strong> <em style="color:#000000;">(sallAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em> said, “Every one of you (people) is a shepherd. And every one is responsible for whatever falls under his responsibility.  A man is like a shepherd of his own family, and he is responsible for them.”</p>
<p style="color:#777777;text-align:justify;">So parents have a responsibility to teach their children the affairs of this religion; the most important being the matter of <em style="color:#000000;">‘Aqeedah</em> as this is the foundation to all success and rectification.</p>
<p style="color:#777777;text-align:justify;"><em style="color:#000000;">Shaykh ‘Abdullah an-Najmi (hafidhahullah)</em> will admonish us concerning this crucial topic and explain to us the extreme importance of teaching our children the correct <em style="color:#000000;">‘Aqeedah</em>.</p>
<p style="color:#777777;text-align:justify;">We ask <strong>Allah </strong>to guide us to His Straight Path and make us firm upon it and may He, <strong>Al-Haafidh</strong> protect us and our children from all evil.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Put Tawheed First!!!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Taamir Fatooh</strong> (may Allah preserve him upon good) said, from the tricks of shaytawn is to make the people belittle the studying of Tawheed and Aqeedatul-Islaamiyyah.   From the deceptions of shaytawn is to beatify and rises the other sciences in the eyes and hearts of the people, before understanding Tawheed soundly and correct ones Aqeedah.   No doubt all of the sciences of Islaam are important and they have their time and place, but Tawheed and correct Aqeedah must come first and foremost. It is from the tricks of shaytawn to mislead the Muslims from the correct path.  It is from the tricks of shaytawn to belittle understanding Tawheed and correcting ones Aqeedah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#888888;"><em>The Likeness Of Those Who Seek To Unite The Muslims Even Though They Are Upon Divergent Beliefs, Is The Likeness Of One Who Attempts To Bring Together Water And Fire, And A Reptile And Fish</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sheikh Saaleh al Fawzaan </strong>(may Allaah preserve him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As long as the Aqeedah is shaky and blemished, the Muslims cannot be united.  It is not possible to unite the one upon Bidah with the one upon the Sunnah, <b>abadan.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not possible to unite the person of corrupted aqeedah with the person of sound aqeedah, even though they share the same name (i.e. they are both called Muslims).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is inevitable to unite the word of the Muslims upon Tawheed, upon the correct aqeedah, upon the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (Muhammad-sallal-laahu-alayhi-wasallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslims must be together.  They are to be united, and that they follow that which comes from that (bond and unity), as long as this does not depart from obedience to Allaah and His Messenger (sallal-laahu-alayhi-wasallam)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For that reason the Messenger (sallal-laahu alayhi wasallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8221;Allaah is pleased for you with three things:  &#8221;that you worship Him (alone) and not to associate anything with Him; and that you (all) hold unto the Rope of Allaah and not to be divided; and that you give sincere advise to the one placed in charge over your affairs (i.e. the Muslim Ruler)&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who calls to the unity of the Muslims, even though they differ in their aqeedah, this indeed cannot be possible.  The one who wants to unite the Muslims, even though they are upon divergent beliefs, even though they are upon shaky beliefs, this is but inconceivable like the one who attempts to bring together water and fire (This is not  possible);  Or bring together (as it is said) a reptile and a fish.   This is not possible ever, because the reptile lives on land and the fish lives in the sea&#8230;</p>

Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal (d.241H)<br />
Source: Al-Ibaanah Magazine, Issue No.1 &#8211; Dhul-Qa’dah 1415H / April 1995</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillaahir-Rahmaanir-Raheem</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">THE TEXT:</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Aboo ’Abdullaah Yahyaa Ibn Abil-Hasan Ibnul-Bannaa narrated to us saying: My father Aboo ’Alee al-Hasan Ibn ’Umar Ibnul-Bannaa related to us saying: Abul-Husayn ’Alee Ibn Muhammad Ibn ’Abdullaah Ibn Bushraan al-Mu’addil related to us, saying: ’Uthmaan Ibn Ahmad Ibn as-Sammaak reported to us, saying: Aboo Muhammad al-Hasan Ibn ’Abdul-Wahhaab, Abun-Nabr narrated to us, reading it to him from his handwritten copy in the month of Rabee’ul-Awwal, in the year two-hundred and ninety three (293H) who said: Aboo Ja’far Muhammad Ibn Sulaymaan al-Munqaree, in Basrah related to us, saying: ’Abdoos Ibn Maalik al-’Attaar narrated to me, saying: [1] I heard Aboo ’Abdullaah Ahmad Ibn Hanbal [2] – rahimahullaah – say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Fundamental Principles of the Sunnah [3] with us [4] are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Clinging to that which the Companions [5] of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) were upon, taking them as our example to be followed, [6] avoiding innovation; [7] and every innovation is misguidance.” [8]</span></strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">COMMENTARY:</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]: This is the isnaad (chain of narration connected to the text) which &#8211; just as in the case of the hadeeth of the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) &#8211; helps ascertain whether or not the statement and the ascription is authentically related back to the one it is being reported from. As regards the importance of the isnaad, then a few narrations from the Scholars of the early generations will be mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyaan ath-Thawree (d.161H) – rahimahullaah – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The isnaad is the weapon of the Believer. So if he has no weapon, with what will he fight?”[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibnul-Mubaarak (d.181H) – rahimahullaah – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The isnaad with me is from the Religion. If there were no isnaad, then whosoever wanted would relate whatever they wanted. However, when it is said to him: Who narrated to you? He remains silent.” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards the ascription to Imaam Ahmad, then a number of Scholars have agreed to its ascription from ’Abdoos Ibn Maalik al-’Attaar &#8211; one of the close students of the Imaam &#8211; and from these verifying Scholars are: Ibn Abee Ya’laa in Tabaqaatul-Hanaabilah (1/241-246), al-Laalikaa‘ee in Sharh Usoolul-I’tiqaad Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah (1/158-164) and also Ibnul-Jawzee in Manaaqib Ahmad (p. 222-228).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The text of this brief ’aqeedah was first printed by Daarul-Manaar in al-Mujaahid magazine (no. 28-29, Sha’baan &#8211; Ramadaan 1411H); and the original is a manuscript copy, transcribed by the Shaykh and muhaddith, Muhammad Naasirud-Deen al-Albaanee, rahimahullaah, in the month of Sha’baan 1374H, from the manuscript copy (no. 68, Q. 10-15) which is housed at the Dhaahiriyyah library in Damascus, Syria. We ask Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; to grant us the ability to serialize the introduction of this valuable and concise tract, adding to it &#8211; for the benefit of the honourable readers &#8211; a brief commentary and explanation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]: He is Aboo ’Abdullaah Ahmad Ibn Muhammad Ibn Hanbal ash-Shaybaanee &#8211; the Imaam of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah in his time. Born in Baghdaad in Rabee’ul-Awwal, 164H, he attended the circles of al-Qaadee Aboo Yoosuf (the student of Abee Haneefah) &#8211; rahimahullaah – where he studied fiqh. He left this in favour of hadeeth, which he began to study at the age of thirteen &#8211; having already memorized the Qur‘aan at a young age. He traveled extensively acquiring and learning ahaadeeth from over two-hundred and eighty teachers. From them are: Wakee’ Ibnul-Jarraah, Yahyaa Ibn Sa’eed al-Qattaan, ’Abdur-Rahmaan Ibn Mahdee, Sufyaan Ibn ’Uyaynah, ash-Shaafi’ee, Yazeed Ibn Haaroon and others – rahimahullaah. He underwent severe torture and trial due to defending the correct ’aqeedah &#8211; the ’aqeedah of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah (the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam), his Companions and those who followed them in ’aqeedah and manhaj) &#8211; being from those who were foremost in clinging to their way, whilst shunning the innovations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo ’Umayr said: “May Allaah have mercy upon him. There was no one having more patience regarding this world than him, nor anyone more closely resembling those who cam before him, nor anyone more rightfully amongst the righteous. This world was presented to him, but he rejected it, and he expelled innovations.” In his time, he was the Imaam of the people of Hadeeth specifically, and the Muslims in general.” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ash-Shaafi’ee (d.204H) &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I left Baghdaad, and I did not leave behind me a man better, having more knowledge, or greater Fiqh (understanding), nor having greater taqwaa (piety) than Ahmad Ibn Hanbal.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ishaaq Ibn Raahawayh (d.238H) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I used to sit with Ahmad and Ibn Ma’een revising ahaadeeth; and I would say: What is the Fiqh (understanding) of it? What is its explanation? So they would remain silent, except for Ahmad.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Daawood (d.275H) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The lectures of Ahmad were sittings for the Hereafter. He would not mention in them any worldly affairs; and I never saw him mention this world.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">’Alee Ibnul-Madeenee (d.324H) – rahimahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Indeed Allaah aided this Religion through Aboo Bakr as-Siddeeq on the day of apostasy, and through Ahmad Ibn Hanbal on the day of the trial.” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to these qualities, he became a sign for Ahlus-Sunnah – as Qutaybah Ibn Sa’eed (d.240H) said, “If you see a man loving Ahmad, then know that he is a person of the Sunnah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Abul-Hasan al-Ash’aree (d.324H) – rahimahullaah – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Our statement which we hold and take as our Religion is: Clinging to the Book of Allaah, our Lord the Mighty and Majestic, and to the Sunnah of our Prophet, Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam), and what is narrated from the Companions, the Taabi’een and the Imaams of Hadeeth. This is what we cling to, and also that to which Aboo ’Abdullaah Ahmad Ibn Muhammad Ibn Hanbal – may Allaah enlighten his face, rais up his rank and grant him a magnificent reward – used to say, distancing ourselves from those who oppose his statement. Since he was the noble and complete Imaam, by whom Allaah made the truth clear, and removed the misguidance, and made the minhaaj (methodology) clear, and though whom Allaah annihilated the innovation of the innovators, the deviation of the deviant and the doubts of the doubters. So may Allaah have mercy upon him, the foremost Imaam.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taajud-Deen as-Subkee (d.770H) – rahimahullaah – said, “Abul-Hasan al-Ash’aree is the foremost of Ahlus-Sunnah and Ahmad Ibn Hanbal&#8230;” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibraaheem al-Harbee (d.285H) – rahimahullaah – said, “I saw Aboo ’Abdullaah, and it was as if Allaah had gathered for him the knowledge of the earlier people and the later people.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal died in the year 241H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]: The term ‘Sunnah’ here, refers to the principles and foundations of the correct Islaamic ’aqeedah (belief) and manhaj (methodology), since the Salafus-Saalih (pious predecessors) would apply this term to matters of ’aqeedah and manhaj – as can be seen from their books and writings – for example: [i] Kitaabus-Sunnah of Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal (d.241H); [ii] as-Sunnah of al-Athram (d.273H); [iii] Kitaabus-Sunnah of Aboo Daawood (d.275H) – being part of his Sunan. [iv] Kitaabus-Sunnah of Ibn Abee ’Aasim (d.287H); [v] Kitaabus-Sunnah of ’Abdullaah (d.290H), the son of Ahmad Ibn Hanbal; [vi] as-Sunnah of al-Marwazee (d.292H); [vii] Sareehus-Sunnah of Ibn Jareer at-Tabaree (d.310H); [viii] as-Sunnah of al-Khallaal (d.311H); [ix] Sharhus-Sunnah of al-Barbahaaree (d.329H); [x] as-Sunnah of al-’Asaal (d.349H) and [xi] as-Sunnah of at-Tabaraanee (d.360H).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The term ‘Sunnah’ was employed in this context to differentiate those matters of ’aqeedah and manhaj of the Salafus-Saalih were upon, from that which was innovated by the deviant and misguided sects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]: Meaning, with the Scholars of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah and at the head of them in his time was Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal. And in this regard, the way of the Salafus-Saalih was to point out to the people, the true followers and adherents to the Sunnah so that their ’aqeedah and manhaj (methodology) could be learnt and adhered to, as Imaam Ayyoob as-Sakhtiyaanee (d.131H) – rahimahullaah – said, “From the success of a youth, or a non-Arab is that Allaah guides him to a Scholar of the Sunnah.” [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And ’Amr Ibn Qays al-Mulaa‘ee (d.143H) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“If you see a youth when he begins to sprout, keeping company with Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah then have hope for him. If you see him keeping company with the people of Innovation, then fear for him, because the youth is according to his initial upbringing.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]: Companions: Arabic: Sahaabah, or Ashaab; singular: Sahaabee. As regards the Sharee’ah definition of ‘Sahaabee’ or ‘Companion,’ then:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Haafidh Ibn Hajar (d.825H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The most correct of what I have come across is that a Sahaabee (Companion) is one who met the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) whilst believing in him, and died as a Muslim. So that includes one who lived with him for a long or short time, and those who narrated from him and those who did not, and those who saw him but did not sit with him and those who could not see him due to blindness.” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam an-Nawawee (d.676H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The correct position is that whosoever accompanied the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam), even for an hour, then that person is from his Sahaabah.” [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad (d.241H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Every person who accompanied the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam), whether for a year, month, a day, or even for an hour, or even just saw him is from his Companions.”[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Bukhaaree (d.256H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“H who accompanied the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) or saw him – from the Muslims – then he is from his Companions.” [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Haafidh Ibn Hajar said in Fathul-Baaree (7/1),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“That which al-Bukhaaree states is the saying of Ahmad and the great majority of the Scholars of Hadeeth.” Some of the proofs that the Scholars have used for this are: The saying of the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam), “There will come upon the people a time when a group from amongst the people will go off to fight and it will be said to them: Is there any amongst you who has seen the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam)? So they will say: Yes. So victory will be granted to them. So a group will go off to fight and it will be said to them: Is there any amongst you who were the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam)? So they will say: Yes. So victory will be granted to them. Then a group will go off to fight and it will be said to them: Is there any amongst you who have seen the companions of the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam)? So they will say: Yes. So victory will be granted to them.” [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) also said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“You will not cease to be upon good as long as there amongst you those who accompanied me. By Allaah! You will not cease to be upon good as long as there are amongst you those who accompanied those who accompanied and saw me.” [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these narrations contain a clear proof that a Muslim seeing the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) is granted virtue and excellence and is established as being from amongst the Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer (d.774H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The fact that just seeing him (the Prophet) is enough for one to be called a Companion is clearly stated by al-Bukhaaree, Aboo Zur’ah and others who have written books regarding the names of the Companions – such as Ibn ’Abdul-Barr, Ibn Mandah, Aboo Moosaa al-Madanee, Ibnul-Atheer&#8230;” [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards the statement attributed to the taabi’ee and Imaam Sa’eed Ibnul-Musayyib – rahimahullaah – concerning the definition of a Companion, then this cannot be used as a proof at all. This is because al-Haafidh al-’Iraaqee – rahimahullaah – says, “The third saying is what is related from Sa’eed Ibnul-Musayyib, that he had not used to count someone as being a Companion, except one who accompanied the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) for a year or two and fought along with him in one or two battles. Ibnus-Salaah said, “What is meant by this if it is authentic from him – refers back to what the Scholars of Usool say (i.e. what is meant be companionship language wise). However, this definition contains restrictions, which will mean that we do not count as Companions those such as Jareer Ibn ’Abdullaah al-Bajalee – who obviously does not fulfill these conditions that are made – but such are people about whom we know of no difference of opinion with regards to them being Companions.” I say, this is not authentic from Ibnul-Musayyib, since the isnaad (chain of narration) from him contains Muhammad Ibn ’Umar al-Waaqidee – who is da’eef (weak) in hadeeth.” [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]: Here the Imaam – rahimahullaah – explains and lays down the signposts for the correct manhaj followed by Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, and that is the methodology of the best and most excellent of mankind, the Companions, then those who followed them (the taabi’een), then those who followed them (the atbaa’ut-taabi’een).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah cling to what the first three generations of Muslims were upon – the Salafus-Saalih – whose excellence has been testified to by the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) in his statement, “The most excellent of mankind is my generation, then those who follow them, then those who follow them.” [17] And he (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, “The most excellent Ummah is the generation which I have been sent in, then those who followed them, then those who followed them.” [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards to the following generations, then they have not been praised with any specific excellence. Rather, they have, in general, been spoken ill of by the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam). Indeed, in some authentic narrations, after mentioning the excellence of the first three generations, the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, “&#8230;then there will come a people amongst whom fatness will appear and who will testify without having been asked to do so.” [19] And in another narration, “&#8230;then there will come a people in whom you will not find any good.” [20] Also, there occurs in another authentic narration, the wording, “&#8230;then there will come a people who will testify without being asked to do so, who make promises but do not keep them, who are treacherous and not trustworthy and fatness will appear amongst them.” [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is the first three generations – the Salafus-Saalih – whose era has been praised with an excellence, whose path is to be followed and whose understanding of the Religion is to be accepted and affirmed. ’Aa‘ishah – radiyallaahu ’anhaa – said: A man came to the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and said, ‘Who is the most excellent of mankind?’ So the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, “The generation which I am in, then the second, then the third.” [22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is the first of these generations – the Companions – radiyallaahu ’anhum – who were the foremost in excellence from mankind; since they were: [i] those who learnt the Religion directly from the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and, “Being informed is not like seeing.” [23] [ii] those who knew best and understood the Religion – and this is the root of their excellence – as the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, “Whosoever Allaah intends to show excellence to, He gives him the understanding of the Religion.” [24] [iii] They were those who followed it the best, and [iv] They were the ones who were furthest away from and remained free from innovations. About the excellence of the Salafus-Saalih, and the excellence of those who follow them, and the obligation to follow their path, Allaah – the Mighty and Majestic says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Those foremost of those who first migrated and those that helped them and those who follow them in goodness, Allaah is well-pleased with them and they are well-pleased with Him. He has prepared for them gardens underneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme success.” [Sooratut-Tawbah 9:100]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah – the Most Perfect – says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Whosoever contends with the Messenger, even after guidance has been clearly conveyed to him, and follows a path other than that of the Believers; We shall leave him in the Path he has chosen and land him in Hell, what an evil destination.” [Sooratun-Nisaa‘ 4:115]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, “This is a clear definition and a decisive proof upon the worshipper, in making following the path of the Believers obligatory. And who were the Believers at the time this aayah was revealed, except the Companions (radiyallaahu ’anhum). Thus, Allaah has threatened those who leave their way and traverse other than their path, with lowliness and humiliation in this world; and a severe punishment in the Hereafter.” [25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What further adds to the above decisive proofs, and is considered to be the correct explanation of those aayaat, are the ahaadeeth of the Propht (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam), “Indeed my Ummah will split up into seventy-three. All of them are in the Fire except one.” It was said, ‘What is the one?’ He said, “The Jamaa’ah.” And in another narration, he said, “That which I and my Companions are upon.” [26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He – sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam – also said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Those of you who survive after me shall see many differences of opinion. So hold fast to my Sunnah and to the Sunnah of the rightly-guided Caliphs after me. Cling to it tightly and beware of newly-invented matters, for every newly-invented matter is an innovation and every innovation is a going astray.” [27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The stars are the custodians of the sky, when the stars pass away, that which has been decreed for the sky will come upon it. I am the custodian for my Companions, so when I pass away there will come upon my Companions that which is decreed for them. And my Companions are the custodians for my Ummah, so when my Companions pass away, that which has been decreed upon my Ummah will come upon it.” [28] Below is a summary of the aforementioned proofs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[i] That the iftiraaq (splitting-up) of the Ummah into various sects – on the basis of differences in ’aqeedah and manhaj – has been foretold.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ii] All of the various firaq (sects) have been threatened with Hellfire, except those who adhere to the ’aqeedah and the manhaj of the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and his Companions, and that is al-Firqatun-Naajiyah (the Saved-Sect) and the Jamaa’ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[iii] That the authentic hadeeth about iftiraaq (splitting-up) is an explanation of, and in full agreement with the aayah from Sooratun-Nisaa‘ [4:115] in that all those who, “follow a path other than that of the Believers (the Companions),” have been threatened with Hellfire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[iv] The obligation to follow the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and his Companions, and that is the way of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, cannot be fulfilled, except by avoiding and shunning innovation and its people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[v] When differences and innovations arise, it is obligatory to cling to the Sunnah, and also that which the Jamaa’ah have ijmaa’ (consensus and agreement) upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[vi] That the Companions were made examples to be followed and were for this Ummah, after the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam), the custodians of the correct knowledge, manhaj and ’aqeedah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[vii] The root of the Companions excellence is in their understanding of and clinging onto the correct ’aqeedah and manhaj and also in their defending it, preserving it, and in their conveying it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[viii] This is also the root cause for the excellence of those who followed the Companions in the next two generations. So it is binding upon the Muslims to follow the path taken by the Salafus-Saalih, those Muslims who – living in the first three generations – adhered to the ’aqeedah and manhaj, and have been praised with an excellence over and above the rest of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ix] Opposing the way of the Salafus-Saalih is considered iftiraaq (splitting-up) and opposing them in matters related to Islaamic manhaj is also considered iftiraaq. So whoever chooses to oppose their knowledge and understanding of the Revelation, has split from them; and has therefore split from the way of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, and has taken one of the forbidden and innovated paths.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, Ibn Mas’ood (radiyallaahu ’anhu) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Indeed, Allaah looked into the hearts of the servants and found the heart of Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) to be the best of the hearts of the servants. So He chose him for Himself and sent him as a Messenger. Then He looked into the hearts of the servants after Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and found the hearts of the Companions to be the best of the hearts of the servants. So He made them ministers of His Messenger, fighting for His Religion. So whatever the Muslims (i.e. the Companions) hold to be good, then it is good with Allaah, and whatever the Muslims hold to be evil, then it is evil with Allaah.” [29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Barabahaaree (d.329H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The foundations upon which the Jamaa’ah is made clear is the Companions of Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam). They are Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, so whoever does not take from them has gone astray and innovated; and every innovation is misguidance and misguidance and its people are in the Fire.” [30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, “The truth is that which comes from Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. Th Sunnah is that which the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) laid down, and the Jamaa’ah is that which the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) united upon, in the Caliphate of Aboo Bakr, ’Umar and ’Uthmaan. So he who limits himself to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and that which the Companions were upon, is successful and triumphs over all the people of innovation, is saved and his Religion is preserved – if Allaah wills. Since the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, “My Ummah will split up into seventy-three sects,” and he told us that which would be the saved sect, saying, “That which I and my Companions are upon.” So this is the cure, the explanation, the dear affair and the straight and distinct road.” [31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas’ood (radiyallaahu ’anhu) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) drew a line for us and said, “This is the Straight Path of Allaah.” Then he drew lines to its right and its left and said, “These are other paths; upon every one of them is a devil calling towards it.” Then he recited,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Indeed, this is My Straight Path, so follow it. And do not follow other paths, they will separate you from His Path.” [32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">About the statement of Allaah, “And do not follow other paths,” ad-Daarimee relates in his Sunan (1/68) and al-Bayhaqee relates in al-Madkhal ilas-Sunan (no. 200) that Mujaahid (d.204H) said explaining this aayah, “Innovations and doubts.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul-’Aaliyah (d.90H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Learn Islaam. Then when you have learnt Islaam, do not turn away from it to the right, nor the left. Rather, be upon the Straight Path and be upon the Sunnah of your Prophet and that which his Companions were upon&#8230;And beware of these innovations because they cause enmity and hatred amongst you. Rather, stick to the original state of affairs which was there before they divided.” [33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]: Arabic: Bida’ (singular: Bid’ah). Linguistically, bid’ah means: a newly invented matter. The Sharee’ah definition of bid’ah is: “A newly invented way (beliefs or actions) in the Religion, in imitation to the Sharee’ah (prescribed Law), by which nearness of Allaah is sought, not being supported by an authentic proof; neither in its foundations, nor the manner in which it is performed.” [34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ash-Shaatibee (d.777H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Everyone who follows the mutashaabihaat (those aayaat without a clear meaning), or twists the underlying meanings or gives a meaning to the aayaat not given to it by the Salafus-Saalih, or clings on to the very weak and unauthentic ahaadeeth, or takes that which is apparent as a proof – for every action, statement or belief in agreement with his objetives and intentions, not finding a fundamental proof for understanding it in that manner – then this is the method of deduction and derivation which gives rise to innovations and those who innovate.” [35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ’Abdul-Haadee (d.745H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It is not permissible to invent an interpretation about an aayah or a Sunnah which was not there in the time of the Salaf, nor did they have any knowledge of it, nor explain it to the Ummah. Since this would mean that the Salaf were ignorant of the truth in this matter and failed to reach it, whereas the late-coming opponent is somehow guided to the truth!” [36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibnul-Qayyim (d.756H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Inventing an explanation with regards to the Book of Allaah – to which the Salaf and the Scholars ar in opposition – necessitates one of two things; [i] either the explanation in itself a mistake, or [ii] that the sayings of the Salaf which run contrary to it are in error! And no one with an ounce of intellect would doubt that the one whose saying is in opposition to that of the Salaf is the one who is mistaken and in error.” [37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And avoiding bida’ (innovations) is one of the great usool (foundations) of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, and it involves: [i] keeping away from them; [ii] having hatred for them; [iii] warning the people about them; [iv] clarifying them to the people so that they do not fall into them; [v] refuting the innovators.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam as-Saaboonee (d.449H) said about Ahlus-Sunnah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“They follow the Salafus-Saalih – the Imaams and Scholars of the Muslims – and they cling to the firm Religion that they clung to and the firm truth. And they hate Ahlul-Bid’ah (people of innovation) who innovate into the Religion that which is not from it. They do not love them and they do not keep company with them. They do not listen to their sayings, nor sit with them, nor argue with them about the Religion, nor debate with them. Rather, they protect their ears from their futility – things which if they pass through the ears and settle in the hearts – will cause harm and will cause doubts and wicked ideas to appear. And concerning this, Allaah the Mighty and Majestic sent down:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And when you see people engaged in vain discourse, then turn away from them unless they turn to different theme.” [Sooratul-An’aam 6:68].” [38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ash-Shawakaanee (d.1255H) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And this aayah contains a severe reprimand for those who allow people to sit with the innovators, those who twist the Words of Allaah, play around with His Book, and the Sunnah of His Messenger (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam). And refer them back to their own misleading desires and wicked innovations. Since, if he is unable to reprimand them and change them from what they are upon, then at the very least, he should avoid sitting with them – and that is easy for him, not difficult. And the innovators may make use of his presence with them – even though he may be free from their mistakes – through a doubt by which they will beguile the common people, in which case his presence will cause an extra evil, in addition to just listening to their evil.” [39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, “Indeed, Allaah does not accept the repentance of an innovator, until he ceases from the innovation.” [40] And he (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, “Every innovation is misguidance and going astray.” [41] And he also said, “Whosoever innovates, or accommodates an innovator, then upon him is the curse of Allaah, the Angels and the whole of mankind.” [42]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyaan ath-Thawree – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Innovations are more beloved to Iblees than sin. Since a sin may be repented from, but innovation is not repented from.” [43] The following narrations will highlight – if Allaah wills – the manhaj (methodology) adopted by our Salafus-Saalih with regards to the mubtadi’een (innovators). A man said to ’Abdullaah Ibn ’Umar, ‘Najdah (a man from the Khawaarij) says such and such.’ So Ibn ’Umar prevented himself from listening for fear of that some of it should enter into his heart. [44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Hasan al-Basree (d.110H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Do not sit with the people of innovations and desires, nor argue with them, nor listen to them.” [45]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Asmaa‘ Bint ’Ubayd said: Two of the people of vain desires and innovations entered upon Ibn Seereen (d.110H), and said, “O Abaa Bakr, may we speak with you?” So he said, “No!” They said, “May we recite an aayah?” He from the Book of Allaah said, “No, indeed either you must get up and leave me, or I will get up and leave.” So said, “O Abaa Bakr, what harm would they left, so some of the people it have done to you, for them to recite an aayah from the Book of Allaah?” He said, “I feared that they would read an aayah to me and distort it, and that would remain in my heart.” [46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An innovator asked Ayyoob as-Sakhtiyaanee (d.131H), “O Abaa Bakr, may I ask you about a word?’ He turned away and indicated with his hand, “No, not even half of a word.” [47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibraaheem Ibn Maysirah (d.132H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“He who honours an innovator has assisted him in the demolition of Islaam.” [48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Qilaabah (d.140H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Do not sit with the people of innovation, because I do not feel secure that they will not drown you in their misguidance and make part of what you used to know unclear to you.”[49]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ’Awn (d.150H) – rahimahullaah – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Whosoever sits with an innovator is worse than him.” [50]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was said to Imaam al-Awzaa’ee (d.157H) – rahimahullaah, ‘A person says, ‘I sit with Ahlus-Sunnah and I sit with the innovators.’ So al-Awzaa’ee said, ‘This person desires to fluctuate between the truth and falsehood.” [51] Commenting upon this statement, Ibn Battah said, “Indeed, al-Awzaa’ee has spoken the truth. And I say, indeed this person does not know the truth from falsehood, nor faith from disbelief.” [51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyaan ath-Thawree (d.164H) – rahimahullaah – said, “Whosoever listens to an innovator has left the protection of Allaah and is entrusted to the innovation.” [52]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And al-Fudayl Ibn ’Iyaad (d.187H) – rahimahullaah – said, “Do not sit with an innovator, for I fear that curses will descend upon you.” [53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Maalik (d.197H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“How evil are the people of innovation, we do not give them salaam.” [54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ash-Shaafi’ee (d.197H) – rahimahullaah – said, “That a person meets Allaah with every sin except Shirk is better than meeting Him upon any one of the innovated beliefs.”[55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Daawood as-Sijjistaanee (d.275H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to Aboo ’Abdullaah Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, “If I see a man from the people of the Sunnah sitting with a man from the people of innovation, should I speak with him?” He said, “No, you should first inform him that the one whom you saw him with is a person of innovation. Either he will cease speaking to the innovator, so continue speaking with him, or if not, then consider him to be like him. Ibn Mas’ood said that a person is like his friend.” [56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, the people of knowledge throughout the ages continued warning the masses against the innovators and considered this matter important enough to dedicate chapters in their various books about this. For example:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Daawood placed a chapter in his Sunan (4/197), called: “Chapter: Turning away from the innovators and having hatred for them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh al-Mundhiree (d.656H) – rahimahullaah – placed a chapter in at-Targheeb wat-Tarheeb (3/14) called: “Deterrent against loving the people of innovation, since a person will be with those whom he loves.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam an-Nawawee (d.676H) – rahimahullaah – says in al-Adhkaar (p.323), “Chapter: Disassociating from the people of innovation and sin.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Bayhaqee (d.458H) – rahimahullaah – said in al-I’tiqaad (p.236), “Chapter: The prohibition from sitting with the people of innovation.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Laalikaa‘ee (d.418H) said in Sharh Usoolul-I’tiqaad Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah (1/128), “What is related from the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) with respect to the forbiddance of debating with the innovators.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Baghawee (d.516H) &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘‘Indeed the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) informed about the division in this Ummah, and the manifestation of desires and innovations in it. And he designated salvation for those who follow his Sunnah and the Sunnah of his Companions, may Allaah be pleased with them. So it is upon the Muslim, that if he sees a man having something from innovations and desires in belief, or something neglected from the Sunnah, that he makes Hijrah (migration) from him, and he frees himself from him, and abandons him in life and death. So he must not greet him if he meets him, and he must not answer him if he (i.e. the innovator) begins the greeting, until he abandons his innovation and returns to the truth…So verily the hijrah from the people of desires and innovation continues until they repent.’’ [57]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qaadee Aboo Ya’laa (d.333H) – rahimahullaah – said in Hajarul-Mubtadi’ (p. 32), “There is ijmaa’ (consensus) from the Companions and the taabi’een as regards disassociating and cutting-off from the innovators.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also necessary to mention here, the distinction that the Scholars make between a newly-invented matter being bid’ah (innovation) and passing a judgement upon the one who is involved in it that he is a mubtadi’ (innovator).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]: Just as the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said in his sermons, “&#8230;and every innovation is misguidance and all that misguides, misguides to the Fire.” [59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And ’Abdullaah Ibn ’Umar (radiyallaahu ’anhu) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Every innovation is misguidance, even if the people think it is good.” [60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Barbahaaree (d.329H) – rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Beware of small innovations, because they will grow until they become large. This was the case with every innovation introduced into this Ummah. It began as something small, bearing resemblance to the truth, which is why those who entered into it were misled and then were unable to leave it. So it grew and became the religion that they followed, and thus deviated from the Straight Path and left Islaam. And may Allaah have mercy upon you! Examine carefully the speech of everyone you hear from in your time particularly. So do not act in haste, and do not enter into anything from it until you ask and see: Did any of the Companions of the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) speak about it, or any of the Scholars? So if you find a narration from them about it, cling to it, do not go beyond it for anything and do not give precedence to anything over it and thus fall into the Fire.”[61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Hasan al-Basree said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Sunnah is – by Him besides whom none has the right to be worshipped – between those who exceed the limits and those who fall short. So be patient upon it, may Allaah have mercy upon you. For indeed, Ahlus-Sunnah were a minority from those who preceded and shall be a minority from those to come. They did not accompany the people of excessiveness when they exceeded, nor the people of innovation when they innovated. Rather, they persevered upon the Sunnah, until they met their Lord.” [62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In summary, two major principles of manhaj – with regards to the ’aqeedah of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah – have been covered in the first part of this serialization: Firstly, “The source for the ’aqeedah is: the Book of Allaah, the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and the ijmaa’ (consensus) of the Salafus-Saalih.” Secondly, “Every newly invented matter in the Religion is an innovation, and every innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance is in the Fire.” [63]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from his book &#8220;The Pillars of Islam and Iman &#8211; and what every muslim must know about the religion</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There are things which nullify Imân (Faith) i.e. Belief, just as there are things which nullify Wudhû&#8217;. If a person does any single one of them, he loses his state of ritual purity. The same is true with Belief. The nullifiers of Belief can be classified into four categories:<i>First category</i>: Denial of Rabb&#8217;s existence or reviling and speaking ill of Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Second category</i>: Denial of Allâh&#8217;s right to be worshipped or worshipping anything or anyone along with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Third category</i>: Denial of any of Allâh&#8217;s Names or Attributes established in the Qur&#8217;ân and Sunnah or reviling them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Fourth category</i>: Denial of the role of Muhammed (pbuh) as the messenger of Allâh, or reviling His Message.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1. Denial of the existence of Rabb nullifies Imân</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This first category encompasses several types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Pure atheism; such as the belief of communists who deny that the universe has a creator and say: &#8220;There is no god, and life is a purely material phenomenon.&#8221; They attribute the creation and all actions to pure chance, or &#8220;nature&#8221; but forget the One Who created even the &#8220;chance&#8221; and the &#8220;nature&#8221;, as Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allâh is the Creator of all things, and He is the Wakîl (Trustee, Disposer of affaires, Guardian, etc.) over all things.&#8221; (39:62)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This category of disbeliever is more hardened in their apostasy than the polytheist Arabs of post-islamic period, and even Satan himself, as those polytheist Arabs did admit the existence of their creator as the Qur&#8217;ân states about them saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: &#8216;Allâh&#8230;'&#8221; (43:87)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and the Qur&#8217;ân mentions the statement of Satan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;(Iblîs) said: I am better then he, You (Allâh) created me from fire, and You created him from clay.&#8221; (38:76)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is an act of disbelief for a Muslim to say, &#8220;Nature created something or that it came into being by chance.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Or if a person claims to be the Rabb; as Pharaoh claimed saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;I am your lord, most high.&#8221; (79:24)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Or to claim that there are great saints [called &#8220;Qutb&#8221; in Sufi terminology, which literally means axes (of creation)] who have control over what happens in the universe, even if this claim is accompanied with the admissions that Allâh, the Soverign Lord exists. People who have this belief are in a worse condition than the idol worshippers before Islâm, who used to admit that Allâh is the Sole Controller of the affairs of the universe, as is indicated by Allâh&#8217;s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Say: &#8216;Who provides for you from the sky and from the earth? Or who owns hearing and sight? And who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living? And who disposes the affairs? They will say: &#8216;Allâh.&#8217; Say: &#8216;Will you not then be afraid of Allâh&#8217;s punishment (for setting up rivals in worship with Allâh?'&#8221; (10:31)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Or the statements of some Sufis that Allâh pervades in His creation, or became incarnate in it. The Sufi, Ibn Arabi, who is buried in Damascus, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Lord is a slave, and the slave is my Lord. I only wish I knew, which one is the Mukallaf.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Mukallaf is a basic Sharî&#8217;ah terminology, that refers to the essential role of the adult, sane human being: That he or she is charged by Allâh with a series of duties and responsibilities, orders and prohibitions, and he will be questioned on the basis of how well he discharged his responsibilities.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this transgressor of the Sufis has stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And the dog and the pig is nothing other then our deity, nor is Allâh other then a monk in a church.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Hallâj (a Sufi of Baghdad) stated: &#8220;I am He (i.e. the Rabb) and He is I.&#8221; Due to this statement of his, which he would not retract; the scholars agreed that he should be executed as an apostate. High Exalted is Allâh above what such people say. <b>2. Shirk (polytheism) in Worship nullifies Imân</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This second category includes the denail of Allâh as the object of worship or ascribing a partner along with Allâh. It too has various manifestations:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Those who worship the sun, the moon, the stars, the trees, Satan or any other created being, and abandon the worship of Allâh, Who created all these things which have no power to benefit nor to harm. Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And from among His Signs are the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. Prostrate not to the sun nor to the moon, but prostrate to Allâh Who created them, if you (really) worship Him.&#8221; (41:37)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Those who worship Allâh, and worship along with Him some of His creations, such as saints, as embodied in idols, grave-worship, etc. The Arab idol worshippers before Islâm were of this category, as they used to call upon Allâh only in times of hardship and pressing need, and would worship others in times of ease. As the Qur&#8217;ân described them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And when they embark on a ship, they invoke Allâh, making their Faith pure for Him only, but when He brings them safely to land, behold, they give a share of their worships to others.&#8221; (29:65)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are characterized as Al-Mushrikûn, (i.e. those who associate and attribute partners with Allâh), even though they made supplication to Allâh Alone when they were afraid of drowning at sea, because they didn&#8217;t stay like that. Instead they called upon others after He saved them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Since Allâh was displeased with the idol worshipping Arabs before Islam, He branded them as Kâfiroon (i.e. the disbelievers), and ordered His Prophet to fight them, because they called upon others besides Allâh at the time of ease. He didn&#8217;t accept their whole-heartedness when they called upon Him alone in hardship, and He labelled them Mushrikîn. Therefor, what can we say about certain Muslims today, who resort to dead saints at the time of ease as well as at the time of hardship? And they ask of them only Allâh has the power to bestow, like curing the sick, and granting sustance and guidance, etc., and they forget the Creator of those saints, whereas He is the only One Who cures, the Substainer, and the Guide. And those dead people have no power at all and cannot even hear those who are calling upon them, as Allâh stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;And those, whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmîr (the thin membrane over the datestone). If you invoke (or call upon) them, they hear not your call, and if (in case) they were to hear, they could not grant it (your request) to you. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will disown your worshipping them. And none can inform you (O Muhammed pbuh) like Him Who is the All-Knower (of each and every thing).&#8221; (35:13,14)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse is explicit to the effect that the dead cannot hear those who call upon them, and explicit in stating that their supplication is major Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of them might say: &#8220;We don&#8217;t believe that these saints and righteous people have the power to benefit or harm. We only take them as intermediaries who will intercede with Allâh on our behalf, and through them we get closer to Allâh.&#8221; Our reply to them is that the idolaters before Islâm used to hold a similar belief, as is mentioned in the Qur&#8217;ân:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And they worship besides Allâh things that hurt them not, nor profit them, and they say: &#8216;These are our intercessors with Allâh.&#8217; Say: &#8216;Do you inform Allâh of that which He knows not in the heavens and on the earth?&#8217; Glorified and Exalted is He above all that which they associate as partners with Him!&#8221; (10:18)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse is explicit in proving that whoever worships and supplicates other then Allâh, he is a Mushrik even if he believes that those other beings cannot benefit nor harm, but only sees them as intercessors.<br />
Allâh said about the idolaters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;And those who take Awliya&#8217; (protectors and helpers) besides Him (say): &#8216;We worship them only that they may bring us near to Allâh.&#8217; Verily, Allâh will judge between them concerning that wherein they differ. Truly, Allâh guides not him who is a liar, and a disbeliever.&#8221; (39:3)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse is explicit in proving the disbelief of those who call upon other than Allâh with the intention of getting thereby closer to Allâh.<br />
The Prophet (pbuh) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Because supplication is worship&#8221; (Tirmidhi)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Among the nullifiers of Belief is to rule by other than what Allâh has revealed; if it is accompanied by the belief that Allâh&#8217;s Laws are inappropriate or less appropriate, or that man made laws which contradict them are equally appropriate; Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;The command (or the judgement) is for none but Allâh. He has commanded that you worship non but Him (i.e. His Monotheism), that is the (true) straight religion, but most men know not.&#8221; (12:40)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;And whosoever does not judge by what Allâh has revealed, such are the Kâfîrun (i.e. disbelievers &#8211; of a lesser degree as they do not act upon Allâh&#8217;s Laws).&#8221; (5:44)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the ruler is applying a law other than what Allah has revealed, while believing that the revealed Law is the only Legitimate Law, but he is contradicting it on the basis of personal whims and inclinations or because of what he considers to be external pressure beyond his control, then he is injust and tyrannical or corrupt, but he did not cross the line of disbelief. This is according to the statement of Ibn Abbas who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever repudiates what Allâh has revealed, the he surely disbelieved, while one who accepted it (while acting in contradiction to it), he is unjust and corrupt.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the interpretation of the verse chosen by the great exegete Ibn Jarîr At-Tabari, and &#8216;Atâ said with regard to the second state:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;A level of disbelief below the level which takes one out of Islâm.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who suspended the Laws of Allâh and replaced them with man-made laws which oppose them, believing in the validity of their man-made laws, they have disbelieved and gone out of Islâm by the consensus of the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Among the nullifiers of Belief is displeasure with Allâh&#8217;s Legislation, or the opinion that it is too confining and strict or that it imposes undue hardship. Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (Muhammed pbuh) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.&#8221; (4:65)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or to dislike the orded which is revealed, as Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;But those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allâh &#8211; Islamic Monotheism), for them is destruction, and (Allâh) will make their deeds vain. That is because they hate that which Allâh has sent down (this Qur&#8217;ân and Islâmic laws, etc.), so He has made their deeds fruitless.&#8221; (47:8,9)</b> 3. Shirk in Allâh&#8217;s Attributes nullifies Imân</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This third category includes denail of some of all of Allâh&#8217;s Attributes or His Names or speaking ill of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. It nullifies Belief when a believer denies the Names of Allâh or His Attributes which are established by the texts of the Qur&#8217;ân and the authentic Sunnah; for example, to deny that Allâh&#8217;s Knowledge is total, or His Power, or His Life or His Hearing or Sight or Speech or Mercy, or His Establishment over His Throne or His Transcendence above it, or His Descent to the lowest heaven or that He has a Hand or an Eye, or other than that of the Attributes which befit His Splendour and which do not resemble the attributes of anything in creation. Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.&#8221; (42:11)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this verse Allâh denied His Resemblance to His creatures, and attributed to Himself the faculties of hearing and sight; and all His other Attributes must be understood in the same way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. It is an error and misguidance to interpret something some of His affirmed Attributes, and to change the meanings of the words used to describe them from their primary meaning in the Arabic language to obscure meanings, like the interpretation of the word Istawâ which means ascension and establishment above something, to mean Istilâ which means to take power. Imam Al-Bukhâri in his Sahîh transmitted the authentic interpretation of Istawâ from Mujâhid and Abul-&#8216;Âliyah, two of the prominent scholars among the Tabi&#8217;în, the successors of the Sahâbah. The diversionary interpretation of Allâh&#8217;s Attributes leads to their denial. As the interpretation of Istawâ meaning to take power is, in fact, a denial of one of Allâh&#8217;s Attributes, which is Allâh&#8217;s Elevation above His Throne, which is established in numerous places in the Qur&#8217;ân and Sunnah. Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;The Most Beneficent (Allâh) Istawâ (rose over) the (mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty).&#8221; (20:5)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven (Allâh), will not cause the earth to sink with you&#8230;&#8221; (67:16)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (pbuh) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allâh recorded a Book which is with Him above the Throne.&#8221; (Agreed upon)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This type of interpretation of the Divine Attributes is a form of distortion as Shaikh Muhammed Amîn Shinqeeti states in his book &#8220;Manhaj wa Darâsât feel-Asmâ&#8217;i was-Sifât &#8211; Studies in the (Divine) Names and Attributes&#8221; on page 26:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;To sum up the issue, I would like to make two points. First the interpreter should consider Allâh&#8217;s Statement to the Jews:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;say Hittatun&#8230;&#8221; (2:58)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hittatun means repentance, they added a letter &#8220;N&#8221; in it and said &#8220;Hintatun&#8221;, Allâh called this addition a change. Allâh said in Surah Al-Baqarah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;But those who did wrong changed the word from that which had been told to them for another, so We sent upon the wrong-doers Rijzan (a punishment) from the heaven because of their rebelling against Allâh&#8217;s obedience.&#8221; (2:59)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise are those who interpret Allâh&#8217;s Attributes with diversionary interpretation. It was said to them Istawâ so they added an &#8220;L&#8221; and said Istawlâ. Consider the resemblance between the &#8220;L&#8221; they added and the &#8220;N&#8221; the Jews added (this point was originally mentioned by Ibn Al-Qayyim).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. There are certain Attributes which are exclusive to Allâh, like Knowledge of the unseen, which no one in creation possesses. Allâh said in his book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And with Him are the keys of the Ghaib (all that is hidden), non knows them but He&#8230;&#8221; (6:59)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh might reveal certain aspects of the unseen to His Messengers through Revelation when He wants, Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;(He Alone) the All-Knower of the Ghaib (unseen), and He reveals to non His Ghaib (unseen) except to a Messenger (from mankind) whom He has chosen (He informs him of the unseen as much as He likes)&#8230;&#8221; (72:26,27)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among the statements of disbelief and error is the statement of the poet Al-Busairy in Qasîdah Burdah describing the Prophet (pbuh)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily, from your generosity is the world and its rival (that is the Hereafter) and a part of your knowledge is the knowledge of the Tablet and the Pen.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This world and the Hereafter are certainly part of the creation of Allâh and from His Generosity, not from the generosity or creation of the Messenger, as the poet claimed.<br />
Allâh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And truly, unto Us (belong) the last (Hereafter) and the first (this world).&#8221; (92:13)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh&#8217;s Messenger (pbuh) does not know what is in the Preserved Tablet, nor what the Pen wrote, as the poet claimed, since this is part of the absolute unseen, which no one knows exept Allâh. As the Qur&#8217;ân mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Say: None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghaib (unseen) except Allâh.&#8221; (27:65)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the saints, it is only logical that they have less access to knowledge of the absolute unseen as they do not even have access to direct Revelation by which Allâh informed His Prophets and Messengers of certain aspects of the unseen, because Revelation does not descend on saints; it is reserved for Prophets and Messengers, so whoever else claims knowledge of the unseen, and whoever believes their claims, has nullified his belief in Islâm. The Prophet (pbuh) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever goes to a fortuneteller or astrologer and believes what he says, has disbelieved in what was revealed to Muhammad.&#8221; (Ahmad)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Occasionally the predictions of these fortuntellers do turn out true, but part of that is due to chance, because they are guessing and trying to extrapolate on what they already know. If they were really truthful in their claim to knowledge of the unseen, they would be right all the time, and they would have informed us the secrets of the Jews, and they could have uncovered all the buried treasures of the earth, and they would not be dependent on the people for money, taking their wealth from them under false pretenses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Defamation of Prophets nullifies Imân</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This fourth category is the rejection of any of the messengers of Allâh or defaming their characters. These are the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. To deny the Message of Muhammed (pbuh) because the testimony that &#8216;Muhammed is the Messenger of Allâh&#8217; is one of the pillars of Belief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. To disparage the Messenger of Allâh (pbuh) or his truthfulness, or his faithfulness in discharge of what he was entrusted with, or his chasteness or to revile him or make fun of him, or make light of him, or find fault with any of his documented behaviour.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. To attack his authentic Ahâdîth (transmitted sayings) and disbelieve them, or to reject the true news which he has described for us including his documented prophecies. Examples are the appearance of the Dajjâl (the Antichrist) or the descent of Jesus who will rule by the Sharî&#8217;ah of Muhammed (pbuh) and other prophecies documented in the Qur&#8217;ân and Sunnah. It is a nullification of Imân to reject these matters after accepting the attribution of the Ahâdîth to the Prophet (pbuh) as being authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. To deny any of the Messengers sent by Allâh before Muhammed (pbuh) or to deny the stories and sayings in regards to them and their nations, as reported in the Qur&#8217;ân or by the Messenger of Allâh (pbuh) in authentic Ahâdîth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. To claim Prophethood after Muhammed (pbuh) for example Ghulam Ahmed, the Qâdiyâni (i.e. from Qadiyan, India), who claimed Prophethood, while the Qur&#8217;ân says in this verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Muhammed (pbuh) is not the father of any man among you, but he is the Messenger of Allâh, and the Last (end) of the Prophets&#8230;&#8221; (33:40)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Messenger of Allâh (pbuh) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I am the last one, after whom there will be no Prophet.&#8221; (Agreed upon)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And anyone who believes that there is a Prophet after Muhammed (pbuh) whether he is a Qâdiyâni (follower of the deviant heretic, Ghulâm Ahmad) or from any other group, he has disbelieved and nullified his Belief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. To describe the Prophet (pbuh) with attributes which belong to Allâh only, such as unlimited knowledge of the unseen, as some Sufis claim. One of their poets said:<br />
&#8220;Oh (total) knower of the unseen, we resorted to you; Oh curer of the hearts, blessing upon you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. To supplicate to the Prophet (pbuh) for what only Allâh has the power to bestow, such as supplicating for victory and help, cure of illness, etc., as is happening today among the Muslims, especially among the Sufis as their poet, Al-Busairy said:<br />
&#8220;Whoever asks by the Messenger of Allâh gets victory, even if a lion meets him in the forest;<br />
Never did time impose on me a hardship and I sought his protection except that I got his protection and no harm came to me.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This conception of the station of the Prophet (pbuh) is Shirk, contradicting the unequivocal announcement of the Qur&#8217;ân:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;&#8230;And there is no victory except by the help of Allâh&#8230;&#8221; (8:10)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and contradicting the order of the Prophet (pbuh):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When you ask, ask from Allâh, and when you seek help, seek the help from Allâh.&#8221; (Tirmidhi)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what should we think about those who attribute to &#8220;saints&#8221; knowledge of the unseen, or make a Nadhr (a vow to give charity or perform some other optional good deed) for their sake, or dedicate animal sacrifices to them or ask of them what may only be requested of Allâh, such as sustenance or cure of illness, or victory, etc.? No doubt, these are Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. We do not deny the miracles that appeared from the Messengers of Allâh nor those miraculous feets that came from the saints, but what we deny is making them partners with Allâh, supplicating them as we supplicate Allâh, and dedicating sacrifies to them, and undertaking a regime of optional worship for their sake. It has gotten to the point that the graves of some notable &#8220;saints&#8221; are showered with donations which are appropriated by the custodians and servants of these shrines, who then divide them among themselves, consuming people&#8217;s money under false pretenses. At the same time they are surrounded by multitudes of poor people who don&#8217;t get enough to eat for a day.<br />
One poet said: &#8220;Our living don&#8217;t even get a Dhirham (a coin of silver), while thousands and thousands go to the dead.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Not all of these shrines and graves even contain the body of a saint. But swindlers erect some of them as a means of taking the money of the gullible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, one of my fellow teachers related to me that a certain Sufi Shaikh came to his mother&#8217;s house requesting a donation in order to erect a green flag to indicate the presence of a saint on a certain street, so she gave him some money. He bought some green cloth and fixed it to a wall and started telling people, &#8220;There is a Wali (saint) here, one of the friends of Allâh. I saw him in my dream.&#8221; And thus he started collecting money. One day the government decided to widen that street, which would require removing the grave. The man who had started the whole story started telling people that they had tried to remove it, but the equipment used had broken, and some people believed him, and this rumor started circulating, which caused the government to proceed with caution. The Mufti of that country himself told me that the government called him in the middle of the night to the site of that saint&#8217;s grave. He found it surrounded by soldiers. Then the excavator was brought and the grave was dug up. The Mufti looked inside and found nothing there, and knew the whole thing was a lie and fabrication.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example, which I heard from a teacher in the Haram in Makkah: One poor man met another and they complained to each other of their poverty. Then they saw a saint&#8217;s grave which was filled with welth. One said to the other: &#8220;Come on, let&#8217;s dig up a grave and put a saint in it, and the money will start rolling in.&#8221; His friend agreed, so they set out until they came to a braying donkey. They killed it and laid it to rest in a pit, they raised a mausoleum with a dome over it. And then both of them proceeded to roll around in the dust of the grave to get the Barakat (blessing) from it. When people passing by asked them what they were doing they said: &#8220;This is the grave of the saint Hubaish bin Tubaish, who worked miracles which defy description.&#8221; People were taking in by their spell and they began laying donations before the grave as charity and to fulfill vows, until they had gathered great wealth. When they started dividing it, they got into argument and started shouting at each other, which attracted a crowd of spectators. One of the two said: &#8220;I swear to you by this saint I didn&#8217;t take anything from you.&#8221; His friend said: &#8220;You swear to me by this saint while the both of us know there is a donkey in this grave that we buried together?&#8221; The people were astonished and felt foolish due to the donations they had made as vows, and took them back after beating the two men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">from &#8220;The Pillars of Islam and Iman &#8211; and what every muslim must know about the religion&#8221;<br />

<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 1: The Religion of Islam</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam is the religion that Allah sent to Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) and made it the final and most complete religion for His slaves. Allah perfected, in this religion, the bounties that He bestowed on His salves, and accepts only Islam from them. He said, what translated means: <b>“Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) is not the father of any man among you, but he is the Messenger of Allah, and the Last (end) of the Prophets.” </b>[33:40], <b>“This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favor upon you, and have chosen Islam for you as your religion.”</b> [5:3], <b>“Truly, the religion with Allah is Islam.” </b>[3:19] and,<b> “And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers” </b>[3:85]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Allah obligated all mankind to follow Islam:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> “Say (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam): “O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allah, to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. There is none who has the right to be worshipped but He; It is He Who gives life and causes death. So believe in Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam), the Prophet who can neither read nor write, who believes in Allah and His Words (this Qur’aan, the Torah and the Gospel), and follow him so that you may be guided”</b> [7:158]. Abu Hurayrah (radhi allahu anhu) reported that the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) said, what translated means, <b>“By Whom the soul of Muhammad is in His Hand! No member of this nation, no Jew or Christian, hears of me and does not believe in what I was sent with, but he will be of the people of the Fire.”</b> [Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Believing in the Messenger means </b> believing in what was revealed to him, coupled with acceptance and submission; without them the belief is not sufficient. This is why Abu Talib, the Prophet’s (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) uncle, was not a believer in the Messenger, although he believed in what he was sent with and confirmed that Islam was the best religion, (but without acceptance or adherence to Islam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Islam contains all of what brings benefit</b>, which was also contained, in previous religions. Islam, however, is suitable for implementation anytime, anywhere and by any nation. Allah said to His Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam), what translated means, <b>“And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam)) the Book (this Qur’aan) in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it and dominant over it”</b> [5:48]. The meaning of “suitable for implementation at anytime, anywhere and by any nation,” is that Islam brings only benefit to mankind, whenever and wherever it is implemented. Islam is not under the control, and thus is not to be altered by, any nation living at any given time at any given place, as some people would want it to be.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Islam is the religion of truth.</b> It is the religion that Allah guaranteed aid and dominance for whoever firmly adheres by it. He said, what translated means, <b>“It is He who has sent His Messenger (Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) with guidance and the Religion of Truth (Islam), to make it superior over all religions even though the disbelievers hate it.” [9:33] </b>and,<b> “Allah has promised those among you who believe, and do righteous, good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers) in the earth, as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practice their religion, which He has chosen for them (Islam). And He will surely give them in exchange a safe security after their fear (provided) they (the believers) worship Me and do not associate anything (in worship) with Me. But whoever disbelieved after this, they are the rebellious (disobedient to Allah).”</b> [24:55].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Islam contains belief and Law: </b> It is a complete religion, both in its belief and in its Law. It demands from its followers the following:<br />
1 Believing in Taw’hid (Oneness) of Allah and disbelieving in Shirk (polytheism).<br />
2. Being truthful and not lying.<br />
3. Being just, that is to deal comparable things with equality, and abandoning injustice.<br />
4. Being honest and abandoning treachery.<br />
5. Preserving one’s promises and contracts and not breaking them.<br />
6. Being dutifully good to one’s parents and not cutting ties of kinship.<br />
7. Keeping relations with relatives and not cutting them.<br />
8. Being good with neighbors and not harming them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In general, Islam orders Muslims to have the best possible conduct and forbids all bad behavior. It requires Muslims to enjoin every righteous deed and avoid every evil deed. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“Verily, Allah enjoins justice, Al-I&#8217;hsan (excellence in religion), giving (help) to kith and kin, and forbids all evil (deeds), Al-Munkar (all that is prohibited) and injustice. He admonishes you, that you may take head)’</b> [16:90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a name="2"></a></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a>Chapter 2: The Pillars of Islam and Eeman</a></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The Pillars of Islam are the cornerstones on which Islam is built.</b> There are five pillars of Islam. They are mentioned in the Hadeeth of ibn Omar (radiyallaahu anhuma), that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) said, what translated means, ‘Islam is built around five (pillars):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1. </b>The testimony that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) is His slave and Messenger,<br />
<b>2.</b> To establish prayer,<br />
<b>3.</b> To give Zakaat (obligatory charity),<br />
<b>4.</b> To fast in Ramadhan, and,<br />
<b>5.</b> To perform Hajj (pilgrimage).” [Saheeh Muslim and Saheeh al-Bukharee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 1. The Shahadah (the testimony) </b> that there is none worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) is His slave and Messenger, requires solid belief, in the heart, in it. This belief must also be confirmed by the tongue. It is called Shahadah (testimony) to show that when a believer believes in it, his belief is as solid as if he is an eyewitness. This Shahadah is one cornerstone, although it contains many aspects that must be taken as belief. This testimony (comprised of two testimonies as is apparent), is considered one cornerstone, either because it contains testifying that Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) is only a conveyer of the Message from Allah and His slave and Messenger, thus completing the testimony that Allah is One or because these two testimonies together are the reason behind the acceptance of deeds by Allah. Deeds are neither valid nor accepted unless they are done with sincerity for the sake of Allah alone, and this is called “Ikhlas,” and through following the way of the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Realizing the essence of this testimony, that there is no god except Allah, is a result of Ikhlas (sincerity) to Allah. Realizing the essence of testifying that Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) is His slave and Messenger, comes as a result of following the Messenger of Allah. This magnificent testimony leads to many sweet results. It frees the hearts and souls from being enslaved to the creation and from following other than the Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2. Establishing the prayers </b> means to worship Allah by praying to Him. One must preserve the prayers by establishing them on time and in the best manner, as taught by the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam). Rewards for establishing the prayers include tranquility and happiness that are felt in the heart. Prayer also leads one to abandoning evil deeds and behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 3. Paying Zakat </b> is worshipping Allah by paying the amount of charity obligated on the ones who have enough money or possessions that require paying Zakat. Paying the required Zakat leads to cleansing the heart from the evil of misery. It also fulfills the needs of Islam and Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 4. Fasting Ramadhan</b> contains worshipping Allah by fasting during the days of this month, by not eating or drinking from dawn to sunset. Fasting trains the souls to abandon what is preferred and desired, seeking the pleasure of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 5. Performing Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah)</b> is worshipping Allah by visiting the Holy House to perform the rituals of Hajj. Hajj trains the souls to spend time and physical effort, seeking to obey Allah. This is why Hajj is considered a type of Jihad (struggle).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> These fruits of performing the pillars of Islam</b>, along with many others we did not mention, make the Muslim nation pure and clean. They lead the nation to preserving the religion of Truth and dealing with the creation in the best manners of justice and truthfulness. All other acts of the religion depend on how well these pillars are preserved. The Ummah (Muslim nation) can reach success as long as its members preserve the religion. This Ummah will not reach the desired success as long as the religion is not fully respected and preserved.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Whoever wants to be certain of the above-mentioned facts</b>, let him read the following Ayat (verses), “And if the people of the towns had believed and had piety, certainly, We should have opened for them blessings form the heaven and the earth, but they belied (the Messengers). So We took them (with punishment) for what they used to earn (of evil deeds). Did the people of the towns then feel secure against the coming of Our punishment by night while they were asleep? Or, did the people of the towns then feel secure against the coming of Our punishment in the forenoon while they play? Did they then feel secure against the plot of Allah? None feels secure form the plot of Allah except the people who are lost” [7:96-99]. Let him also read the history of previous nations, which gives valuable lessons for whoever is in possession of a mind that comprehends and is rightly guided. This history is a light for those whose hearts are not blocked from the truth. All our dependence is on Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Pillars of Islamic Belief<br />
</b> Islam, as we explained before, is belief and Laws. We mentioned some pillars of the Laws. These pillars are the basis of Islamic Law. As for the Islamic ‘Aqeedah (creed), its pillars are: Believing in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day and the good or bad that Qadar (predestination) brings. These pillars are mentioned in the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said, what translated means, <b>“Righteousness is not that you (only) turn your faces towards the East and (or) the West (in prayers); but righteousness is (the quality) of the one who believes in Allah, the Last Day, the Angels, the Book and the Prophets” </b>[2:177], and with regards to Qadar, <b>“Verily, We have created all things with Qadar. And Our Commandment is but one, as the twinkling of an eye.” </b>[54:49].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Sunnah, the Messenger of Allah said, in answer to Gibreel when he asked him about Iman (belief), <b>“Iman is to believe in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, and to believe in the Qadar and what it brings of good or bad.” </b>[ Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a name="3"></a></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a>Chapter 3: The Belief in Allah</a></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 1 &#8211; Belief In Allah’s Existence Allah’s existence is affirmed through Fitrah </b>(the innate purity that Allah creates in every human being), the Mind, the Shari’ah (Islamic Law) and the senses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> a) As for the Fitrah,</b> we say the following: Allah created the belief in Him in every human being. Mankind needs not to be taught this belief or think about how to possess it. However, the ones who have this Fitrah corrupted will not benefit from it. The Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) said, what translated means, <b>“Every newly born will be born having Fitrah. However, his parents will either convert him to Judaism, Christianity or Majocism (fire worshipping).” </b>[Saheeh al-Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> b) The Human Mind </b> must be used to prove the existence of Allah. All this creation, of old and new, must have a Creator who invented and started it. This creation could not have come to existence on its own or by chance. It could not have created itself, because it did not exist beforehand. Therefore, how can it create? Also, the creation could not have been started by accident or chance. Everything that exists must have a Creator who brought it into existence. Creation is magnificent in organization, coherent and correlated in its existence. There is a reason and originator behind every act. All this nullifies the saying that this entire universe was started by chance. What was started by chance cannot be organized in its form because it did not have any organization before it was formed. What makes what was created by chance to be this organized? If all this creation neither could have created itself nor was it created by chance, then it must have an Originator, Allah, the Lord of the worlds. Allah mentioned this reasoning in the Quran, <b>“Were they created by nothing, or were they themselves the creators?”</b> [52:35].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah means that men were neither created without a Creator nor did they create themselves. Therefore, Allah is the One who created them. This is why when Jubair ibn Mut’im (radiyallaahu anhu) heard the Messenger (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) recite this Surah until he reached, <b>“Were they created by nothing, or were they themselves the creators? Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Nay, but they have no firm belief. Or are with them the Treasures of your Lord? Or are they the tyrants with authority to do as they like?”</b> [52:35-37],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jubair, a disbeliever then, said, <b>“My heart almost flew (from the power of this reasoning mentioned in the Surah). This was the first time that Iman entered my heart.”</b> [Saheeh al-Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> c) &#8211; As for the Shari’ah</b>, all divine religions testify to the fact that Allah created the world. All Laws that were sent with these divine and revealed religions contain what benefits mankind. This is evidence to the existence of a Wise and All-Knowing Lord Who knows what brings benefit to His creation, All divinely-revealed religions describe a universe that is self evident to the existence and ability of Allah, Who Creates what He Will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> d) &#8211; Also, the senses must be used</b> to prove the existence of Allah. We know that Allah accepts the supplication from whoever seek His aid and help, and that He brings them the benefits that they desire. This is clear evidence to the existence of Allah, who said, what translated means, <b>“And (remember) Noah, when he cried (to Us) aforetime We listened to his invocation.” </b>[21:76] and, <b>“(Remember) when you sought help from your Lord and He answered you?”</b> [8:9].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas ibn Malik (radhi allahu anhu) said, “An Arabian (Bedouin) man entered (the Masjid) on Friday while the Prophet was delivering the speech. He said: ‘O Messenger of Allah! (Our) possessions are destroyed, (our) children are hungry. Ask Allah for us.’ He (the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) raised his hands in supplication (to Allah). All of a sudden, mountain-like clouds were formed. He did not descend from his Minbar (the podium) until I saw rain falling through his beard. On the second Friday, this Arabian man, or someone else, stood up and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam), Buildings have collapsed and possessions are flooded. Ask Allah for us.’ He (the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) raised his hands and said: <b>‘O my Lord! Around us and not on us.’</b> Wherever he pointed to an area (of the sky), they (the clouds) dispersed.” [Saheeh al-Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah’s acceptance of supplication has been and still is a known matter until today. It is given to those who are true in their seeking refuge in Allah and perform supplication in the correct manner to ensure its acceptance. Also, there are the signs that Allah gave His Prophets, which are called miracles. People witnessed or heard these miracles. They are clear evidence that the One who sent the Messengers exists, and He is Allah the All Mighty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These miracles are activities that are beyond the capability of mankind. Allah gave them to His Messengers as a way of aiding them and giving them victory. An example of these miracles is the sign given of Moses. Allah ordered him to strike the sea with his stick, and the sea parted into twelve separate pads between mountains of water on each side of these parts, <b>“Then We inspired Moses (saying): “Strike the sea with your stick. And it parted, and each separated part (of that sea water) became like the huge, firm mass of a mountain.” [26:63]. Another example is the miracle of Jesus. He was given the power by Allah to raise the dead from their graves and back into life. Allah said about him, what translated means, “And I bring the dead to life by Allah’s leave.”</b> [3:49] and, <b>“And when you (O Jesus) brought forth the dead by My Permission.”</b> [5:110]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A third example is the miracle Muhammad (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) performed. His tribe, Quraysh, asked him to perform a miracle. He pointed to the moon and it separated into two parts while his people were witnessing the incident. Allah said about this miracle, what translated means, <b>“The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder. And if they see a sign, they turn away, and say: “This is continuous magic.”</b> [54:1-2].[4] All these miracles, that Allah gave to His Messengers as an aid and victory and that were witnessed by their nations, are proof that Allah exists.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2 &#8211; Belief In Allah’s Lordship</b> This means to believe that Allah is the Lord, alone, and that He has no partners or helpers. The Rabb (Lord) is the One who Creates and Commands. There is no creator except Allah and there is no owner of the universe except Him. The Commandment and the Control is His. He said, what translated means, <b>“Surely, His is the Creation and commandment.”</b> [7:54] and, <b>“Such is Allah your Lord; His is the Kingdom. And those whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmir (the membrane over the date-stone).&#8221;</b> [35:13]. Only a few people rejected Allah’s Lordship. These are the arrogant ones who deny what they believe deep in their hearts. This happened from Pharaoh, when he said to his people, as was mentioned in the Qur’aan, <b>“I am your lord, most high.”</b> [79:24] and, <b>“O chiefs! I know not that you have a god other than me!”</b> [28:38].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, what he said was not his true belief. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“And they belied them (Our Signs) wrongfully and arrogantly, though their own selves were convinced thereof” </b>[27:14].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Moses said to Pharaoh, as was mentioned in the Quran, <b>”Verily, you know that these Signs have been sent down by none but the Lord of the heavens and the earth as clear (evidences of His Oneness and Might). And I think you are, indeed, O Pharaoh, doomed to destruction.”</b> [17:102]. The Arab disbelievers of old used to confirm Allah’s Lordship, although they associated others with Him in worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said, what translated means, <b>“Say: “Whose is the earth and whosoever is therein? If you know!” They will say: “It is Allah’s!” Say: “Will you not then remember?” Say: “Who is the Lord of the seven heavens and the Lord of the Great Throne?” They will say: “Allah.” Say: “Will you not then fear Allah?” Say: “In Whose Hands is the sovereignty of everything? And He protects (all), while against Whom there is no protector, if you know?” They will say: “(All this belongs) to Allah.” Say: “How then are you deceived and turn away from the truth?)&#8221;</b> [23:84-89],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed if you ask them: <b>“Who has created the heavens and the earth?” They will surely say: “The All-Mighty, the All-Knower created them.” </b>[43:9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and, <b> “And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: “Allah.” How then are they turned away (from His worship)”</b> [43:87].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Allah’s order comprises of both, His running of the universe and the Commandment.</b> He is the One who controls the creation and the One who does what He will, according to His Wisdom. He is also the One who gives the Commandment organizing aspects of worship and dealings, according to His Wisdom. Whoever takes anyone, besides Allah, to be the one who commands acts of worship or types of dealings, will have committed Shirk (disbelief, association in worship) with Allah. This act negates Iman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 3 &#8211; The Belief That He Is the ILAH: </b> Allah is the Ilah, meaning He is the Worshipped One Who has no partners. This Ilah is worshipped with love and reverence. He said, what translated means, <b>“And your Lord is One Lord, there is none who has the right to be worshipped but He, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.”</b> [2:163]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and, <b> “Allah bears witness that none has the right to be worshipped but He, and the Angels, and those having knowledge (also give this witness); (He is always) maintaining His creation in Justice, none has the right to be worshipped but He, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.” </b>[3:18].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All things that are taken as gods, besides Allah, are false gods, <b>“That is because Allah is the Truth (the Only True God), and what they (the disbelievers) invoke besides Him, it is falsehood. And verily, Allah is the Most High, the Most Great.”</b> [22:62].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To call these things “gods,” does not make them gods. Allah said about some idols, Al-Lat, Al-’Uzzaa and Manat, <b>“They are but names which you have named, you and your fathers, for which Allah has sent down no authority&#8221; </b>[53:23].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yousef (Joseph) said to his two companions in jail, as was mentioned in the Quran, <b> “Are many different lords (gods) better or Allah the One, the Irresistible? You do not worship beside Him but only names, which you have forged, you and your fathers, for which Allah has sent down no authority.”</b> [12:39-40].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Messengers used to say to their nations, <b>“Worship Allah! You have no other God but Him.” </b>[23:23]. However, the disbelievers refused to accept this call. They took others as gods besides Allah. They worshipped them besides Allah, calling them when aid and help were needed. Allah refuted the disbelievers in their taking these idols as gods besides Him, using two logical arguments:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The first argument:</b> These idols, that were taken by the disbelievers as gods, do not have any attributes that qualify them to be gods. These false gods were created and do not create. They can neither bring about benefit for whoever worships them, nor can they fend harm off. They cannot give life or take it away. They neither own nor are they partners in the kingdom of the heavens and earth. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“Yet, they have taken besides Him other gods that created nothing but are themselves created, and possess neither hurt nor benefit for themselves, and possess no power (of causing) death, nor (of giving) life, nor of raising the dead)&#8221;</b> [25:3],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> “Say (O Muhammad): ‘Call upon those whom you asset (to be associate gods) besides Allah, they possess not even the weight of an atom, either in the heavens or on the earth, nor they have any share in either, nor is there for Him any supporter from among them.” </b> [34:22-23] and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> “Do they attribute as partners to Allah those who created nothing but they themselves are created? No help can they give them, nor can they help themselves.”</b> [7:191-192].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this is the case with false gods, then taking them as gods is a true misguidance and the lowest of all acts. The second argument: The Mushrikeen (polytheists) are among those who confirmed that Allah, alone, is the Lord, the Creator, the One Who Has the ownership of everything and the One Who gives protection and no one can give protection to anyone from His Might. This confirmation requires from these disbelievers to worship Allah alone. He said, what translated means, <b>“O Mankind! Worship your Lord (Allah), Who created you and those who were before you so that you may become among the pious. Who has made the earth a resting place for you, and the sky as a canopy, and sent down rain from the sky and brought forth therewith fruits as a provision for you. Then do not set up rivals unto Allah (in worship) while you know (that He Alone has the right to be worshipped).”</b> [2:21-22],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> “And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: “Allah&#8221;.</b> <b>How then are they turned away (from His worship)?” </b>[43:87]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and, <b> “Say (O Muhammad): “Who provides for you from the sky and from the earth? Or who owns hearing and sight? And who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living? And who disposes the affairs?” They will say: ‘Allah.” “Say: “Will you not then be afraid of Allah’s punishment?” Such is Allah, your Lord in truth. So after the Truth, what else can there be, save error? How then are you mined away?</b> [10:31-32].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 4 &#8211; The Belief In Allah’s Names and Attributes. </b> This belief requires accepting whatever Allah described of Himself in His Book or in the Sunnah of His Messenger (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam). The Names and Attributes must be accepted without alteration <b> [1]</b>, rejection <b> [2]</b>, and precise description of their true nature or equating them with attributes of the creation. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allah, so call on Him by them, and leave the company of those who deny His Names. They will be requited for what they used to do.”</b> [7:180],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> “His is the highest description in the heavens and in the earth. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.” </b> [30:27] and, <b>“There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All Seer.”</b> [42:11].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Two groups have fallen into misguidance concerning this matter:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> One of them is Al-Mu’attilah (the refuters). </b> This group rejected the Names and Attributes, or some of them, claiming that to accept them is to equate Allah with His creation. This claim is false for many reasons following are two of them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 1. </b> This claim leads to false conclusions that Allah’s Words are in Opposition to each other. Allah is the One who confirmed these Names and Attributes and denied that there is anything that resembles Him. If confirming these Names and Attributes leads to equating Allah with the creation, then this will lead to the conclusion that Allah’s Words are full of discrepancies and refute each other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2.</b> For two things to have an attribute of some kind, does not mean that they are equal or look-likes. One can witness two persons who are both called “a human who hears, sees and speaks.” However, this description of both does not mean that they are of equal capabilities in their hearing, sight or speech. One can also see that animals have hands, legs and eyes. However, this does not mean that animals are equal in every respect with regards to their hands, legs and eyes. If disparity is this wide between that which creation possess of attributes or names, then the disparity between the Creator and creation is even greater and more evident.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The second misguided group is called “Al- Mushabbihah.”</b> They confirmed the Names and the Attributes. Yet, they equated them with the names and attributes of the creation. They claimed that this is what the Texts mean. They claimed that Allah reveals to His slaves what they can comprehend. This claim is false for many reasons, some of them are: Allah’s resemblance with His creation is false and is refuted with the mind and the Laws of Shari’ah. Texts of the Qur’aan and Sunnah cannot lead to falsehood in their meanings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah revealed what His slaves can understand of the general meaning. However, the true nature of what these meanings are like is a knowledge that only Allah possesses, especially with regards to the true nature of His Names and Attributes. Allah confirmed that He is the All-Hearer. Hearing means to comprehend sounds. However, the true nature of Allah’s Hearing is unknown. Creation vary in their hearing capability. The difference between Allah’s Hearing and the hearing of creation is even greater and more evident. Also, Allah confirmed that He Istawa (Mounted or Settled) on His Throne. To mount and settle on a throne is known in the general meaning of the word “mounted,” or “settled.” The true nature of Allah’s mounting on His Throne is unknown. Mounting on something varies with regards to different creation. To mount on a chair is unlike mounting on a wild camel. If Istiwaa’ is this different between creation, then how can the Istiwaa’ of Allah be compared to the Istiwaa’ of creation? The difference between them is greater and more evident. Benefits of Believing in Allah, in the way described above, leads to many benefits for the believers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 1. </b>To truly realize the Taw’hid of Allah, by depending only on Him and hoping in, fearing and worshipping Him alone.<br />
<b>2.</b> To prefect one’s love and reverence of Allah, and according to His Might as described by His Most-Beautiful Names and Most-High Attributes.<br />
<b>3.</b> To truly give one’s worship to Allah, by adhering to His Commandments and abandoning His Prohibitions.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> FOOTNOTES</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> [1]</b> TAAWEEL &#8211; Introducing change in a statement, leaving out the meaning understood by it, expressing and accepting such a meaning which the words may indicate in a doubtful sense. In the present context (i.e. Attributes of Allaah) it means rejecting the true meaning of Attributes of Allaah, as understood by the companions (radiyallaahu anhum), and giving preferences to one own understanding.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> [2]</b> TA’TEEL (Rejecting,Leaving or Vacating). It means negating the Attributes of Allaah and denying them with His Self. The difference between Taqweel and Ta’teel is that in the latter case the real meaning is denied which is proved by the Qur&#8217;aan and the Hadith. While in Tahreef the explanation of the text is done with such meanings that are false and the word does not prove them. So Ta’teel includes Tahreef. Wherever there is Tahreef, Ta’teel is certainly there, but the reverse is not true. If someone tries to prove the false meaning and denies the real meaning, he is committing both Ta’teel and Tahreef</p>

<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a>Chapter 4: Belief In The Angels</a></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The Angels are a matter of the unseen. </b> They are created by Allah and they worship Him. They have no attributes that qualify them to be gods or lords. Allah created them from light, and He bestowed on them the bounty of obeying Him at all times. He gave them the power to carry and implement His orders, <b>“And those who are near Him (the angels) are not too proud to worship Him, nor are they weary (of His worship). They glorify His praises night and day, (and) they never slacken (to do so).”</b> [21:19-20]. They are so numerous that only Allah can count their numbers. Anas (radiyallaahu anhu) said, while narrating the story of the Prophet’s (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) ascension to heaven, that Al-Bait Al-Ma’amoor (the House in heaven that is always inhabited. It is, for the inhabitants of heaven, like the Kaa’bah for the people of earth) was raised for the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) in heaven so he can see it. Each day, seventy thousand Angels pray in this House, and when they exit from it, they will never get back into it (this shows how numerous the angels are).[Saheeh al-Bukharee and Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Belief In The Angels Has three Parts</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Belief in their existence.<br />
Belief in what we were told of their names, such as Jibreel, and also belief in other angels whom we were not informed of their names.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2. Belief in what we were told of their attributes.</b> The example to this is the description of Jibreel. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) told us that he saw Jibreel in the shape that Allah created him, having six hundred wings and larger than the horizon. The angels may change their shapes, by the order of Allah. They may take the shape of men. Allah sent Jibreel to Maryam (Mary) and he came to her in the shape of a man. He was also sent to Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam), while he was sitting down with his companions, in the shape of a man, wearing very white clothes with very dark hair, a stranger to the companions, yet no evidence of traveling was apparent on him. He sat next to the Prophet and laid his knees next to the Prophet’s knees and put his hands on the Prophet’s thighs. He asked the Prophet about Islam, Iman, Ih’san (excellence in the religion) and the Last Hour and its signs. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) answered him. Then, Jibreel left. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) said to his companions, <b> “This was Jibreel, He came to you to teach you your religion.” </b>[Saheeh Muslim popularly known as the HADEETH of JIBREEL]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Allah sent the angels to Ibrahim (Abraham) and Lut in the shape of men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Belief in the tasks that they perform, by the order of Allah.</b> They praise Allah and worship him at all times without the slightest boredom or fatigue. Some angels may have special tasks to fulfill, a few have been mentioned below;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jibreel is the honorable angel, whom Allah sends down with revelation to the Prophets and Messengers. Mikaeel is the angel who is controlling rain and Vegetation by the order of Allah. Israfeel is the angel who must blow in the Horn when the Hour (Last Day) has started and when it is time to resurrect the dead. An angel is the keeper and supervisor of Hell. The Angel of death captures the souls at death. There are angels who supervise fetuses in the wombs. When a fetus is four months old, Allah sends down an angel and orders him to record the fetus’s sustenance, maximum age, deeds and if miserable (destined to Hell) or happy (destined to Paradise). There are angels who record deeds of mankind. They have a record of everyone’s deeds. There are two angels for each person, one to the right and the other to the left. There are other angels who question the dead when they are in their graves. Two angels come to all dead persons and ask each one of them about the Lord he worshipped, the religion he followed and the Messenger he obeyed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Benefits of Believing In The Angels<br />
1.</b> Knowing Allah’s Might, Strength and Power. All the strength of creation is a sign of the Strength of the Creator.<br />
<b>2.</b> Thanking Allah because He takes care of mankind. He appointed angels to protect them, record their deeds and other beneficial tasks.<br />
<b>3.</b> Loving the angels because they are true worshippers of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Some misguided people reject that the angels exist in a physical form. </b>They claim that the angels are the potential for good that creation possesses. This is a direct rejection to the Book of Allah, the Sunnah of His Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) and the Ijmaa’ (consensus) of Muslims. Allah said, what translated means: <b>“All the praises and thanks be to Allah, the (Only) Originator of the heavens and the earth, Who made the Angels messengers with wings, two or three or four).&#8221; </b>[35:1], <b>“And if you could see when the angels take away the souls of those who disbelieve (at death), they smite their faces and their backs.”</b> [8:50], <b>“And if you could but see when the unjust (disbelievers) are in the agonies of death, while the angels are stretching forth their hands (saying): “Deliver your souls.”</b> [6:93], <b>“Until when fear is banished from their (the angels’) hearts, they (the angels) say: “What is that your Lord has said?” They say: “The Truth. “And He is the Most High, the Most Great” [34:23] and, “And angels shall enter unto them from every gate (saying): ‘Peace be upon you for that you preserved in patience! Excellent indeed is the final Home (</b><b>Paradise).”</b> [13:23-24].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) said, what translated means, <b>“When Allah likes a slave, He calls on Jibreel, saying: ‘Allah loves so and so (person), therefore, love him.’ Then, Gibreal loves him. Afterwards, Jibreel calls on the inhabitants of heaven, saying: ‘Allah loves so and so (person), therefore, love him.’ Then, the people of heaven love him. Afterwards acceptance (among the community of believers) will be granted for him in earth.”[3] and, “When the day of Friday comes, there stand angels at each of the Masjid’s doors. They record the first then the next (one to come to the Masjid). When the Imam sits down (waiting for the call to prayer to end so he can start the speech), they close the books and they come to listen to the Thikr (the remembrance of Allah contained in the Friday speech).”</b> [Saheeh al-Bukharee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above texts are clear in their meaning that the angels have physical forms and are not a state of the mind, as the misguided claim. The true meaning of these texts, which states that the angels exist in a physical form, is accepted by the entire Ummah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a name="5"></a></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a>Chapter 5: Belief In The Books</a></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kutub (books) is plural for Kitab (a book). They are called Kutub because they are written (maktoob). Books, here means the Books that Allah sent down to His Messengers as a mercy and guidance for mankind. These Books are designed to lead mankind to what brings them happiness in this life and in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> There are four aspects of believing in the Books<br />
1.</b> To believe that they are truly sent down by Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>2.</b> To believe in the Books that mankind were informed of, like the Qur’aan, sent down to Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam), the Torah, sent down to Moses, the Injeel (the Gospel), sent down to Jesus and the Zaboor (the Psalms), sent down to David. We also believe in the other Books, sent down by Allah, even though we do not know their names.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>3.</b> To believe in whatever the Books contained, like whatever is contained in the Qur’aan and sections of previous Books that have not been corrupted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>4.</b> To implement the Commandments contained in these Books, unless Allah commanded to the contrary through Naskh (over ruling). We must accept whatever these Books contained of Commandments, even if we do not know the wisdom behind them. All previous Books were over-ruled by the Qur’aan. Allah said, what translated means, “And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad) the Book (this Qur’aan) in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it and dominant over it.” [5:48]. This means that the Qur’aan is dominant over all other Books. Therefore, no Commandment contained in other than the Qur’aan can be implemented unless it is in agreement with the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Benefits Of Believing In The Books<br />
1.</b> Knowing that Allah takes care of His slaves by sending down Books for their guidance.<br />
<b>2.</b> Knowing Allah’s Wisdom in whatever He commands. He commanded each nation with what is suitable for them, <b>“To each among you, We have prescribed a Law and a </b><b> Clear Way.” </b> [5:48].<br />
<b>3.</b> Thanking Allah for His bounties, because He sent down these Books to lead mankind to guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a name="6"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a>Chapter 6: Belief In the Messengers</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The Messengers are sent to deliver a Message. </b> They are the ones to whom Allah has sent down revelation and who conveys His Law to mankind. Allah ordered them to deliver these Messages.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The first Messenger to be sent was Noah and the last one was Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam). </b> Allah said, what translated means, <b>“Verily, We have inspired you (O Muhammad) as We inspired Noah and the Prophets after him.”</b> [4:163]. Anas ibn Malik (radiyallaahu anhu) narrated that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) said, during his Hadeeth about Shafa’ah (the right of intercession on mankind’s behalf that Allah grants to His Messenger on the Last Day), “Mankind come to Adam to intercede on their behalf but he declines, saying: <b>‘Go to Noah, the First Messenger that Allah sent&#8230;” </b>[Saheeh al-Bukharee] Also, Allah said, what translated means, <b>“Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) is not the father of any man among you, but he is the Messenger of Allah, and the Last (end) of Prophets.”</b> [33:40].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Allah sent Messengers to every nation and provided them with Laws that their nations must follow. </b> Some Messengers were sent to revive a Message of a previous Messenger. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“And verily, We have sent among every nation a Messenger (proclaiming): “Worship Allah (alone), and avoid all Taghut (false deities).”</b> [16:36], <b>“And there never was a nation but a warner had passed among them).&#8221;</b> [35:24] and, <b>“Verily, We did send down the Torah (to Moses), therein was guidance and light, by which the Prophets, who submitted themselves to Allah’s will, judged the Jews.”</b> [5:44].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The Messengers are only humans and they do not possess any attributes that qualify them to be gods. </b> Allah described His Messenger, Muhammad (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam), the master of all Messengers and the best of mankind, saying, what translated means, <b>“Say (O Muhammad (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam): “I possess no power of benefit or harm to myself except as Allah will. If I had the knowledge of the Unseen, I should have secured for myself an abundance of wealth, and no evil should have touched me. I am but a warner, and a bringer of glad tidings unto people who believe.”</b> [7:188] and, <b>“Say (O Muhammad):</b> <b>“It is not in my power to cause you harm, or to bring you to the Right Path.” Say: (O Muhammad): “None can protect me from Allah ‘s punishment (if I were to disobey Him), nor should I find refuge except in Him.”</b> [72:21].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messengers are only humans. They get sick and they die, they need to eat and drink and they have other human needs. Abraham described his Lord, saying, as was mentioned in the Qur’aan, <b>“And it is He Who feeds me and gives me to drink And when I am ill, it is He Who cures me; And Who will cause me to die, and then will bring me to life (again).”</b> [26: 79-81]. Also, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) said, what translated means, <b>“I am only human, just like you, I forget as you forget, therefore, when I forget, remind me.”</b> [Saheeh al-Bukharee and Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Allah described the Messengers, while praising them, that they reached the highest attainable degrees in worshipping Him.</b> He said about Noah, what translated means, <b>“Verily, he was a grateful slave.”</b> [17:3], and about Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam), <b>“Blessed be He Who sent down the Criterion (of right and wrong, this Qur’aan) to His slave (Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) that he may be a Warner to the ‘Alamin (Mankind and the Jinn).”</b> [25:1], and about Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, <b>“And remember Our slaves, Abraham Isaac and Jacob, (all) owners of strength (in worshipping Us) and (also) of religious understanding. Verily, We did choose them by granting them the Remembrance of the home (in the Hereafter). And they are in Our Sight, verily, of the </b><b> Chosen and the Best.”</b> [38:45-47], and about Jesus, <b>“He was not more than a slave. We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example to the Children of </b><b> Israel.”</b> [43:59].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Belief In The Messengers Has Four Parts</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1.</b> To believe that the Messages are truly from Allah. Whoever disbelieves in one Messenger, will have disbelieved in all Messengers. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“The people of Noah belied the Messengers.”</b> [26:105]. Allah considered the people of Noah disbelievers in all Messengers, although they only disbelieved in one Messenger. Therefore, the Christians, who disbelieve in Muhammad (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) and do not follow him, are disbelievers in Jesus, the Son of Mary. Jesus gave the glad tidings of the coming of Muhammad (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) to the Christians. This glad tidings will be of no benefit to the Christians if they do not follow Muhammad (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) to guidance and the Straight Path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2.</b> To believe in the Messengers whom we were told about, like Muhammad (sallallaau alaihi wa-sallam), Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Noah (alaihum as-salam). These are the five strongest Messengers. Allah mentioned them in two verses of the Qur’aan, <b>“And (remember) when We took from the Prophets their Covenant, and form you (O Muhammad (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam)), and from Noah, Abraham, Moses and Jesus, son of Mary.”</b> [33:7] and, <b>“He (Allah) has ordained for you the same Religion (Islam) which He ordained for Noah, and that which We have inspired in you (O Muhammad (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam)), and that which We ordained for Abraham, Moses and Jesus, saying you should establish Religion (by implementing the Commandments) and make no divisions in it.”</b> [42:13]. We must also believe in all other Messengers and Prophets whom their names were not mentioned to us, <b>“And, indeed We have sent Messengers before you (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam)), of them some We have related to you their story and some We have not related to you their story.” </b>[40:78].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 3.</b> To believe in all what the Messengers have conveyed to us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 4. </b>To implement the Laws of the Messenger who was sent to us, Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam), the final Messenger. Allah sent Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) to all mankind, <b>“But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam)) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.”</b> [4:65].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Benefits Of Believing In The Messengers</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1.</b> Knowing how Allah takes care of His slaves by sending them Messengers to guide them to His Path. The Messengers teach their nations how to worship Allah, because the human mind cannot know how Allah should be worshipped without guidance from Him.<br />
<b>2.</b> Thanking Allah for this great bounty.<br />
<b>3.</b> Dutifully loving, respecting and praising the Messengers of Allah. They are Allah’s Messengers; they worshipped Him, conveyed His Message and gave the best advice to His slaves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Many rebellious people rejected their Messengers, claiming that Allah’s Messengers cannot be human.</b> Allah mentioned this claim and refuted it, <b>“And nothing prevented men from believing when the Guidance came to them, except that they said: “Has Allah sent a man as (His) Messenger?” Say: “If there were on the earth, angels walking about, in peace and security, We should certainly have sent down for them from the heaven an angel as a Messenger.””</b> [17:94- 95]. Allah refuted this claim, saying that the Messengers must be sent from among humans, because they are sent to the people of earth, who are humans. If the inhabitants of earth were angels, then Allah would have sent Messengers from among the angels to them. Allah mentioned what the disbelievers in the Messengers said, <b>“You are no more than, human beings like us! You wish to turn us away from what our fathers used to worship. Then bring us a clear authority (a clear sign that supports what you say).” Their Messengers said to them: “We are no more than human beings like you, but Allah bestows His grace to whom He will of His salves. it is not ours to bring you an authority (proof) except by the permission of Allah.”</b> [14:10-11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a name="7"></a></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a>Chapter 7: Belief In the Last Day</a></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Last Day is the Day when mankind will be resurrected to be asked about their deeds and receive reward or punishment for them. It is called “the Last Day,” because it is the last day, no day after that. Afterwards, people of Paradise will permanently reside and take their places in it, and people of Hell will permanently reside and take their places in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Belief In The Last Day Has Three Parts</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. To believe in the Resurrection. &#8211; The Resurrection happens when the Horn will be blown for the second time. Afterwards, mankind will be resurrected to face the questioning by the Lord of the worlds. They will neither be wearing shoes nor circumcised, and they will be naked and visible to others on this state, (however, everyone will be absolutely preoccupied with what they are going to face and the hardship of the Day of Resurrection). Allah said, what translated means, <b>“As We began the first creation, We shall repeat it, (it is) a promise binding upon Us. Truly, We shall do it.&#8221; </b>[21:104].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Resurrection is a true event that the Qur’aan, the Sunnah and the consensus of Muslims have confirmed. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“After that, surely you will die. Then (again), surely, you will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection.”</b> [23:15-16]. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) said, what translated means, <b>“On the Day of Resurrection, Mankind wilt be resurrected while they are bear-footed and naked.”</b> [Saheeh al-Bukharee and Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslims are unanimous on confirming the Day of Resurrection. This is the wisdom of Allah, for He decreed that creation will have a day of reckoning for their deeds after He sent them Messengers to inform them of His Commandments. He said, what translated means, <b>“Did you think that We had created you in play (without any purpose), and that you would not be brought back to Us?”</b> [23:115] and, <b>“Verily, He Who has given you (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam)) the Qur’aan will surely bring you back to the Ma’ad (place of return).”</b> [28:85].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2. To believe in the Reckoning</b> &#8211; In the Last Day, the slave will be rewarded or punished for his deeds. This fact was also confirmed by the Qur’aan, the Sunnah and the consensus of Muslims. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“Verily, to Us will be their return. Then verily, for Us will be their Reckoning.” </b>[88:25-26], <b>“Whoever brings a good deed shall have ten times the like thereof to his credit, and whoever brings an evil deed shall have only the recompense of the like thereof and they will not be wronged.” [6:160] and, “And We shall set up balances of justice on the Day of Resurrection, then none will be dealt with unjustly in anything. And if there be the weight of a mustard seed, We will bring it And Sufficient are We as Reckoners.”</b> [21:47].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) said, what translated means, <b>“Allah will bring the believer closer to Him, and will shield him form being exposed (for his evil deeds in front of everyone). He will say: ‘Do you remember such and such (evil) deed? Do you remember such and such (evil) deed?’ He will say: ‘Yes, O my Lord!’ When He gets his confessions for his evil deeds, and he (the salve) thinks that he is close to destruction, he will say: ‘I have preserved you (from being exposed in front of others for these evil deeds) during your lifetime. Today, I forgive them for you.’ Then, he will be given his record of deeds. As for the disbelievers and the hypocrites, they will be called in public: ‘These are the ones who lied on their Lord (did not follow His Guidance sent down with their Prophets). Therefore, Allah’s curse will befall the unjust ones.&#8221; </b>[Saheeh al-Bukharee and Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And,“<b>Whoever intends to perform a good deed, and performs it, Allah will record it for him as ten deeds, to seven hundredfold, to many more folds. Whoever intends to commit and evil deed, and commits it, Allah will record it as one evil deed.” </b>[Saheeh al-Bukharee and Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Muslims are unanimous that the Day of Reckoning will come.</b> This is the Wisdom of Allah. He revealed the Books, sent down the Messengers and commanded that they be accepted, followed and obeyed. He commanded that whoever oppose them (the Books and the Messengers) are to be fought. He permitted shedding their blood, and the seizure of their children, women and possessions. If there will not be a Day of Reckoning, then this Commandment will be time wasted. Allah is immune form such joyful play. <b>“Then surely, We shall question those (people) to who it (the Book) was sent and verily, We shall question the Messengers. Then surely, We shall narrate unto them (their whole story) with knowledge, and indeed We were not absent.’</b> [7:6.7].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 3. To believe in Paradise and Hell. </b> They are the final destination for whoever deserves either one of them, and for eternity. Paradise is the destination of the ultimate happiness and joy that Allah prepared for the believers who feared Him, believed in what He required from them to believe and obeyed Him and His Messenger. They are the ones who were sincere to Allah and followers of His Messenger. Paradise contains, of Allah’s bounties, <b>“What no eye has ever violated, what no ear has ever heard of and what no mind has ever imagined (of joys that Allah hid for the believers).” </b>[4] Allah said, what translated means, <b>“Verily, those who believe (in Allah) and do righteous, good deeds, they are the best of creatures. Their reward with their Lord is Gardens of Eternity, underneath which rivers flow, they will abide therein forever, Allah Well-Pleased with them, and they with Him. That is for him who fears his Lord.” </b>[98:7-8] and, <b>“No person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do.)’</b> [32:17].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Hell, it is the destination of torment and punishment that Allah prepared for the unjust disbelievers. They are the ones who disbelieved in Him and disobeyed His Messengers. Hell contains kinds of punishment and torment that no one could ever imagine. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“And fear the Fire, which is prepared for the disbelievers.”</b> [3: 131] “We have prepared for the wrongdoers, a Fire whose walls will be surrounding them. And if they ask for help (relief, water etc.) they will be granted water like boiling oil that will scald their faces. Terrible the drink, and an evil dwelling.” [18: 29] and,<b> “Verily, Allah has cursed the disbelievers, and has prepared for them a flaming Fire (Hell). Wherein, they will abide forever, and they will find neither a protector nor a helper. On the Day when their faces will be turned and rolled form all sides in the Fire, they will say: “Oh, would that we had obeyed Allah and obeyed the Messenger (Muhammad).”</b> [33:64-66]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Belief in Life After Death</b>: Believing in the Last Day requires Muslims to also believe in life after death and in the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 1. The questioning in the grave. </b> The dead will be asked, in their graves, about the lord, the religion and the Prophet they followed during their lifetime. <b>Allah will lead the believer to say what is necessary, saying, “Allah is my Lord. My religion is Islam. My Prophet is Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam).” As for the unjust, Allah will lead him to misguidance saying, in answer to the above questions “What! What! I do not know.” Also! the hypocrites and the ones who always had doubts about Allah, the religion and the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam), will say, “I do not know. I heard people say something and I followed them.” </b>[Saheeh al-Bukharee and Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2. The torment or joy in the grave.</b> The unjust, the disbelievers and the hypocrites will be tormented in their graves. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“And if you but see when the wrongdoers are in the agonies of death, while the angels are stretching forth their hands (saying): “Deliver your souls; this day you shall be recompensed with the torment of degradation because of what you used to utter against Allah other than the truth. And you used to reject his Ayat (proofs, signs, evidences, etc.) with disrespect”</b> [6: 93] and about Pharaoh’s people, “The Fire; they are exposed to it, morning and afternoon, and on the Day when the Hour will be established (it will be said to the angels):<b> “Cause Pharaoh ‘s people to enter the severest Torment” </b>[40:46].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zaid ibn Thabit (radiyallaahu anhu) narrated that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) said to his companions what translated means, <b>“I would have asked Allah to let you hear what I am hearing from the punishment in the grave, but for the fear that you would not bury each other after that”</b> Then the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) turned his face towards them, saying, <b>“Seek refuge in Allah from the torment of the Fire.”</b> They said, “We seek refuge in Allah from the torment of the Fire.” He said, <b>“Seek refuge in Allah from the torment of the grave.”</b> They said, “We seek refuge in Allah from the torment of the grave.” He said, <b>“Seek refuge in Allah from all calamities, apparent or hidden.”</b> They said, “We seek refuge in Allah from all calamities, apparent or hidden.” He said, <b>“Seek refuge in Allah from the calamity of Al-A‘war Ad-Dajjal (the False Messiah).” They said, “We seek refuge lit Allah from the calamity of Al-A‘war Ad-Da.jjal.”</b> [Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for joys of the grave, they are given to the believers. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“Verily, those who say: “Our Lord is Allah (alone),” and then they stood fast on them (these words that they say), on them the angels will descend (at the time of their death) (saying): “Fear you not, nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of </b><b> Paradise which you have been promised?” </b> [41:30] and, <b>“Then why do you not (intervene) when (the soul of a dying person) reaches the throat? And you at the moment are looking on? But We (our angels who take the soul) are nearer to him than you, but you see not. Then why do you not, if you are exempt from the reckoning and recompense (punishment). Bring back the soul (to its body), if you are truthful? Then if he (the dying person) be of those near ones (close to Allah), (there is for him) rest and provisions, and a </b><b> Garden of Delights (Paradise).&#8221;</b> [56: 83-89].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Baraa’ ibn ‘Azib narrated that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) said about the believer, that <b>after he is asked by the angels (about the lord, the religion and the Messenger he followed) and after he replies (saying that his Lord is Allah, his religion is Islam and his Messenger is Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam), “A caller from heaven will say: ‘My slave has said the truth. Therefore, furnish him (his grave) from </b><b> Paradise, dress him from Paradise and open a door for him to Paradise.” Then he said, “He will receive from its tranquility and perfume. His grave will be enlarged for him the distance that his sight reaches.” </b> [Musnad Ahmad &amp; Aboo Dawood]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Benefits of Believing in the Last Day<br />
1.</b> The desire to do righteous, good deeds, seeking the good results in the Last Day.<br />
<b>2.</b> The fear from committing and approving of evil deeds, fearing the torment of the Day of Reckoning.<br />
<b>3.</b> The believer feels that this belief makes him forget the hardships he faces in this life. He is preoccupied with working righteousness trying to reach the joys and good rewards of the Last Day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Some disbelievers reject the idea of life after death saying</b> that this is not possible. This claim is false. Religion, the senses and the mind are used to refute this claim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Religion, Allah said, what translated means: <b>“The disbelievers pretend that they will never be resurrected (for the account). Say (O Muhammad): “Yes! By my Lord, you will certainly be resurrected, then you will be informed (and recompensed for) what you did, and that is easy for Allah.”</b> [64:7] All Scriptures are unanimous on this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Senses, Allah demonstrated to his slaves how He raised the dead in this life. In Surat Al-Baqarah. Allah mentioned five examples:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 1.</b> The People of Moses said to him, <b>“We will no believe in you unless we see Allah without a barrier.” They were seized by death and then Allah resurrected them. To remind the Children of </b><b> Israel with this story, Allah said, what translated means, “And (remember) when you said: “O Moses: We shall never believe in you till we see Allah Plainly.” But you were seized with a thunder-bolt (lightening) while you were looking. Then We raised you up after your death, so that you might be grateful.” [</b>2:55-56].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2.</b> The story of the murdered man whom the Children of Israel differed as to who killed him. Allah ordered them to sacrifice a cow and strike him with some of its parts. so he can tell them who killed him, <b>“And (remember) when you killed a man and fell into dispute among yourselves as to the crime. But Allah brought forth that which you were hiding. So We said: “Strike him (the dead man) with a piece of it (the cow).” Thus Allah brings the dead to life and shows you His signs so that you may understand.”</b> [2:72-73].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 3.</b> The story of the nation that escaped from its land for fear of death by the hands of their enemies, although their number was in the thousands. Allah made death seize them and then raised them back to life, <b>“Did you (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam)) not think of those who went forth from their homes in thousands, fearing death? Allah said to them: “Die.” And then He restored them to life. Truly, Allah is full of Bounty to mankind, but most men thank not.” </b> [2:243].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 4.</b> The story of the person who passed by a village that all its inhabitants had died. He could not imagine that Allah can resurrect them. Allah made death seize him for a hundred years and then raised him from the dead, Or (think you of) such as he who passed by a town all in utter ruins. He said:<b> “Oh! How will Allah ever bring it to life after it’s death?” So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him up (again). He said: “How long did you remain (dead)?” He (the man) said: “(Perhaps) I remained (dead) a day or a part of a day.” He said: “Nay, you have remained (dead) for a hundred years, look at your food and at your drink, they show no change; and look at your donkey! And thus We have made of you a Sign for the people. Look at the bones, how We bring them together and clothe them with flesh.” When this was clearly shown to him, he said: “I Know (now) that Allah is Able to do all things.”</b> [2:259].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 5.</b> The story of Abraham who asked Allah to show him how He raises the dead. Allah ordered him to kill four birds, cut them in parts and spread the parts over the surrounding mountains. He told him to call the dead birds, and that he did. These parts were collected (by Allah’s Power) and the birds came back to life and they came to Abraham. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“And (remember) when Abraham said: “My Lord! Show me how You give life to the dead. “ He (Allah) said: “Do you not believe?” He (Abraham) said: “Yes (I believe), but to be stronger in faith.” He said: “Take four bird, then cause them to incline towards you (slaughter them, Cut them into pieces), and then put a portion of them on every hill, and call them, they will come to you in haste. And know that Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.”</b> [2:260].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are five examples of incidents that happened. They prove that raising the dead can happen by the will of Allah. We mentioned before that Jesus raised the dead from their graves, by the will of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> As for the Mind, there are two ways to correctly use it to confirm raising the dead:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Allah is the One who started the creation of heavens and earth. The One who is Capable of starting the creation is also Capable of restarting it. Allah said, what translated means, “And He is Who originates the creation, then will repeat it (after it has been perished), and this is easier for Him.” [30:27] and, “As We began the first creation, We shall repeat it, (it is) a promise binding upon Us. Truly, We shall do it.” [21:104] and to the one who denied that Allah will give life to the bones when they have rotted away, “Say (O Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam)): “‘He will give life to them Who created them for the first time! And He is the All-Knower of every creation.” [36:79].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2.</b> It is noticed that the soil can become dry and that trees and plants die. When Allah sends the rain, the soil comes back to life and plants of all kinds grow and become green. The One who brings life back to the dead soil is Capable of raising the dead. Allah said, what translated means, “And among His Signs (in this), that you see the earth barren, but when We send down water (rain) to it, it is stirred to life and growth (of vegetation). Verily, He Who gives it life, surely. (He) is Able to give life to the dead (on the Day of Resurrection). Indeed! He is Able to do all things.” [41: 39] “And We send down blessed water (rain) from the sky then We produce therewith gardens and grain (all harvests that are reaped). And tall date-palms, with ranged clusters; A provisions for (Allah’s) slaves. And We give life therewith to dead land. Thus will be the Resurrection (of the dead).” (50:9-11].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Some misguided people reject punishment or joy in the grave claiming </b> that this cannot happen. They claim that if one exhumes the dead, he will find the grave as it was left and that it did not change in size. This claim is rejected by the Shari’ah, the senses and the mind:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Shari’ah, we mentioned some texts before. These texts confirm the punishment or joy in the grave. Ibn Abbas (radiyallaahu anhuma) said, “The Prophet passed by some walls in Madinah. He heard the screams of two persons who were being punished in their graves.” The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) mentioned the reasons behind this punishment, <b>“One of them did not protect himself (his clothes) form urine. The other one was spreading (sawing) differences (between people).”</b> [Saheeh ab-Bukharee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Senses, we know that, while dreaming, the one who is asleep sees that he is enjoying a huge space or that he is feeling pain because he is squeezed in a small area. Sometimes, one’s sleep is interrupted because of such nightmares, although he is still in his bed. Sleeping is similar to dying. Allah said, what translated means, “<b>It is Allah Who takes away the souls at the time of their death, and those that die not during their sleep. He keep those (souls) for which He had ordained death and sends the rest for a term appointed. Verily, in this are signs for a people who think deeply.”</b> [39:42]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Mind, sometimes one sees dreams that may later happen in real life. Some Muslims may see the Prophet in their dreams. Whoever sees the Prophet, on the shape that he was described in books of Hadith, is saying the truth in that he saw him. This happens while one is still in his bed. If this is the case in this material life, what about matters of the other life?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for their claim that when one exhumes a dead body, that no signs of abnormal change, either in the body or the grave itself, are detected, we say the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 1.</b> The Shari’ah cannot be rejected by depending on these doubts. These doubts can easily be refuted, providing one uses his mind. There is a popular saying: “There are many who refute a truth, while the problem lies with their limited comprehension.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2.</b> Life in the grave is a matter of the unseen. The senses cannot unveil the unseen. If matters of the unseen are unveiled by the senses, then belief in the unseen will not have any useful meaning, in which case believing or disbelieving is irrelevant, since there would be no matters of the unseen to believe in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 3.</b> Only the dead feel the punishment or joy in the grave. Also, the one who is dreaming is the only one who is experiencing the pain of being squeezed in a small space or the joy of being in an open area. Others do not feel the same as the one who is experiencing these dreams, although he is still in his bed. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) used to receive revelation while he was among his companions and the companions did not hear the revelation. Sometimes, the angel came in the shape of an invisible man. The companions did not see the angel while he was delivering revelation to the Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 4.</b> Humans have limited comprehension and understanding of the universe. They only understand what Allah gave them the capability to understand. They do not understand all of the existence. The seven heavens, the earth and all that which is therein praise Allah. Allah, sometimes, gives the power to some of His creation to hear such praise. Humans cannot hear such praise. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein, glorify Him and there is not a thing but glorifies His praise. But you understand not their glorification. Truly, He is Ever Forbearing, Oft-Forgiving.” </b>[17:44]. Also, devils and the Jinn go about in the earth. The Jinn came to the Messenger and listened to his recitation of the Qur’aan. When he finished, they went back to their nation to convey the Message to them. However, this creation is out of the reach of human’s Comprehension, <b>“O Children of Adam! Let not Satan deceive you, as he got your parents (Adam and Eve) out of Paradise, stripping them of their raiment, to show them their private parts. Verily, he and his soldiers see you from where you will not see them. Verily, We made the devils protectors (and helpers) for those who believe not.”</b> [7:27]. Creation can neither reach what is beyond their comprehension nor understand all the existence. Therefore, one cannot dispute ‘flatters of the unseen that he cannot comprehend.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a name="8"></a></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a>Chapter 8: Belief In Al-Qadar</a></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Qadar is Allah’s predestination of measurements and sustenance of everything and everyone, according to His Knowledge and Wisdom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Aspects Of Belief In Al-Qadar</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 1. Knowledge</b> &#8211; The belief that Allah’s Knowledge encompasses everything, every matter, major or minor, and time frames of everything that happens in this universe. Allah’s Knowledge encompasses all of His Actions and actions taken by His slaves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2. Writing &#8211;</b> The belief that Allah recorded everything in a Book that He kept with Him, called “A1-Lawh’ Al-Mah’foodh” (The Preserved Book). He said, what translated means,<b> “Know you not that Allah knows all that is in heaven and on earth? Verily, it is (all) in the Book (Al-Lawh’ Al-Mah’footh). Verily, that is easy for Allah.” </b>[22:70].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullah-ibn-Amr-ibn-al-Aas (radiyallaahu anhuma) said that he heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) say, what translated means, <b>“Allah recorded the measurement of all matters pertaining to Creation fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and earth.”</b> [Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 3. The belief that nothing, whether related to Allah’s Actions or actions taken by His slaves, can happen without His Permission. </b> He said, what translated means, <b>“And your Lord Creates whatsoever He wills and chooses.” </b>[28: 68], <b>“ And Allah does what He will.” [14: 27] and, “He it is Who shapes you in the wombs as He pleases.”</b> [3: 6]. As for actions taken by His creation, Allah said, <b>“Had Allah willed, indeed He would have given them power over you, and they would have fought you.”</b> [4:90] and, <b>“And if Allah had willed, they would not have done so. So leave them alone with their fabrications.”</b> [6:137].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 4. The belief that Allah created all creation, all what they possess of attributes and all their actions</b>, “Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is the Guardian over all things.” [39:62] and, “He has created everything, and has measured it exactly according to its due measurements.” [25: 2]. Also, Abraham said to his people, as was mentioned in the Qur’aan, “While Allah has created you and what you make.” [37:96].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Believing in the Al-Qadar, as described above, does not mean that people have no power over the actions they chose to take. I</b>slamic Shari’ah and Reality confirm that the person has a will of his own:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Shari’ah, Allah said about one’s own will, what translated means, <b>“So, whosoever wills, let him take a Return to his Lord (by obeying His Commandments).” [78:39] and, “So go to your tilt (have sexual relations with your wives) when and how you will (not in the anus).” </b>[2:223]. As for one’s own power over his actions, <b>“So keep your duty to Allah as much as you can; listen and obey.”</b> [64:16] and, <b>“Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope. He gets reward for that (good) which he has earned, and he is punished for that (evil) which he has earned.” </b>[2:286].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Reality of things, every human knows that he has a power and a will of his own. He uses his power and will to indulge in or avoid actions of his choice. Mankind distinguish between what they do by their own power and between what they have no power over, like shivering due to illness or extreme cool. However, the power and will of mankind is under the control of Allah’s Will and Power, <b>“To whomsoever among you who wills to walk straight. And you will not, unless (it be) that Allah wills, the Lord of the worlds.” </b>[8 1:28-29]. The universe is Allah’s property and nothing happens in His Kingdom without His Knowledge and Permission.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Belief in Al-Qadar, as explained above, does not provide an excuse for mankind to sin or abandon what they are obligated to do.</b> This excuse can be rejected using the following arguments:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 1.</b> Allah said, what translated means, “Those who took partners (in worship) with Allah will say: <b>“If Allah had Willed, we would not have taken partners (in worship) with Him, nor would our fathers, and we would not have forbidden anything (against His Will).</b> <b>“Likewise bellied those who were before them, till they tasted of Our Wrath. Say: “Have you any knowledge (proof) that you can produce before us? Verily, you follow nothing but guess and you do nothing but lie” </b>[6:148]. The disbelievers did not have a valid excuse when they said that what they did was according to A1-Qadar. If this excuse was valid, then why will Allah punish them for their sins?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2.</b> Allah said, what translated means, <b>“Messengers as bearers of good news as well as of warning in order that mankind should have no plea against Allah after the Messengers And Allah is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise.”</b> [4:165]. Sending down the Messengers took place according to A1-Qadar, also. This is why the disbelievers cannot use Al-­Qadar as an excuse for not believing, because Al-Qadar provided them with the means to escape Allah’s punishment by following His Messengers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 3. </b> Ali-ibn-Abi Talib (radiyallaahu anhu) said that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) said, what translated means, <b>“One’s final destination, in Hell or Paradise, is already determined for each one of you.” A man said, “Should we depend (on this fact), O Messenger of Allah (meaning to abandon working deeds)?” He said, “No. Perform deeds, because everyone will be helped (to go on the path that he chooses and reach his destiny).” Then he read the Ayah. “As for him who gives (in charity) and keeps his duty to Allah and fears Him&#8230;”</b> [92:5].” <b> [1]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 4.</b> Allah conveyed His Commandments to His slaves and did not require them to do what is beyond their capacity. “So keep your duty to Allah (and fear Him) as much as you can.” [64:16], and “Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope.” [2:286]. If the slave is forced to do whatever deeds he performs, then Allah would have required from him what is beyond his capacity, and this is a false belief. For this reason, Allah forgives sins that take place because of ignorance or forgetfulness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 5. </b> Al-Qadar is a matter of Allah’s Knowledge. No one can uncover his own Qadar but after it happens. One’s intention to perform a deed precedes the action itself. He does not know what Al-Qadar holds for him. Therefore, Al-Qadar is not a valid excuse for sinning and abandoning the Commandments.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 6.</b> One always seeks what is convenient for him. No one of sane mind would abandon what brings material benefit to him, saying that Al-Qadar forced him to take this course of action. Therefore, why would one use Al-Qadar as an excuse for abandoning what brings benefit to him in matters of religion and not do the same for matters of life?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a man has to choose between two countries to move to, one of them is chaotic, full of incidents of murder, looting, rape, insecurity and hunger. Would he choose to go to this country or would he go to another country, which is safe for him and secure, with abundance in material joys, where one’s honor, possessions and human rights are preserved? There is no doubt that this man would choose the second country, where he will be safe and secure. No one of sane mind would choose to go to the first country, claiming that this is his Qadar. Therefore, why would one choose what ends him up in Hell, rather than Paradise, in the Last Life, claiming that this is his Qadar?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When one is sick and is given a medicine to take, he will take the medicine even though he does not like its taste. When one is told to go on a diet, he would not eat the food that he likes, in order to satisfy this diet and to stay fit. No one of sane mind would refuse to take medicines or go on medical diets, claiming that this is his Qadar. Therefore, why would one abandon implementing Allah’s and His Messenger’s Commandments, thus bringing Allah’s Wrath on him, claiming that this is his Qadar?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 7. </b>If one of those, who abandon the Commandments and indulge in sinning, comes under attack on his honor or possessions, would he accept the excuse of the attacker, if he says that he attacked him because it was his Qadar to attack him, and therefore he is not to be blamed? Indeed No! Therefore, why does this person refuse Al-Qadar as an excuse for whoever attacked him, while he depends on Al-Qadar as an excuse for abandoning Allah’s rights on him?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was reported that Omar ibn Al-Khattab (radiyallaahu anhu) was brought a man who was caught stealing. Omar ordered that this man’s hand be cut off. The man said, “Wait, O leader of the believers. I only stole because this was in the Qadar of Allah.” Omar said, “And we are cutting your hand because it is in the Qadar of Allah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Benefits Of Belief In Al-Qadar<br />
1.</b> Depending on Allah alone when one indulges in any action. Taking the necessary precautions is not the cause of one’s success in the intended actions. All matters are under the full control of the Qadar of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>2.</b> When one succeeds in performing an action, he must not be proud of himself. All good deeds are successfully performed because of Allah’s bounty, because He ordained that this matter to be successful. To be proud will make one forget to thank Allah for permitting him to successfully perform this deed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>3.</b> Believing in Al-Qadar leads one to feel satisfied, safe and secure. All incidents that happen to a person are a result of Allah’s Qadar. One should not feel miserable for losing or not gaining what he likes. All this happens according to the Qadar of Allah. Allah is the King and Lord of the heavens and earth and His Qadar will happen exactly as He Will, <b>“No calamity befalls on the earth or in yourselves but is inscribed in the Book of Decrees (Al-Lawh’ Al-Mah’footh), before We bring it into existence. Verily, that is easy for Allah. In order that you may not be sad over matters that you fail to get, nor rejoice because of that which has been given to you. And Allah likes not prideful boasters.”</b> [57:22-23]. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) said, what translated means, <b>“Pleasing is the attitude of the believer. All of his matters are righteous. This is only for the believer. If a joy is brought to him, he thanks (Allah for it). This is better for him. If a calamity befalls him, he is patient. This is also good for him.”</b> [Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> Two groups fell into misguidance with regard to Al­-Qadar:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Al-Jabriyyah &#8211; This group claimed that the person is forced to do whatever he does and that he has no power or will of his own.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>2. Al-Qadariyyah</b> &#8211; They claimed that the person has a will and power independent of Allah’s Will and Power.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The Shari’ah and Real Life are used to refute the first group, Al-Jabriyyah.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Shari’ah, Allah confirmed that humans have a will and power of their own,<b> ‘Among you are some that desire this world and some that desire the Hereafter.</b> [3:152], “And say: “The Truth is from your Lord.<b>” Then whosoever wills, let him believe, and whosoever wills, let him disbelieve. Verily, We have prepared for the unjust, a Fire whose walls will be surrounding them.” </b>[18:29] and. <b>“Whosoever does righteous, good deeds, it is for (the benefit of) his own-self and whosoever does evil, it is against his own-self, and your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) slaves.”</b> [41:46].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Real Life, everyone knows the difference between his actions, like eating, drinking, selling and buying, and between what is beyond his power, like shivering and accidentally falling off a roof, for example. The first type of actions are his. He chooses them on his own will using his own power. The second type of actions are beyond his control.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> The Shari’ah and The Mind are also used to refute the second group, Al-Qadariyyah.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Shari’ah, Allah created everything and nothing happens without His permission. He said that all actions taken by His slave happen by His Will, <b>“Allah had willed, succeeding generations would not have fought against each other, after clear Verses of Allah had come to them, but they differed, some of them believed and others disbelieved, If Allah had willed, they would not have fought against one another, but Allah does what He likes.”</b> [2:253] and, <b>“And if We had willed, surely! We would have given every person his guidance, but the Word from Me took effect (about evil­doers), that I will fill Hell with Jinn and mankind together.”</b> [32:13].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for The Mind, the universe is Allah’s Kingdom and mankind are a part of this Kingdom. Therefore, all mankind are owned by Allah. The slave cannot do anything in this Kingdom unless its Lord, Allah, gives him permission.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> FOOTNOTES</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Saheeh aL-Bukhari &amp; Saheeh Muslim (the wordings are by Al-Bukhari)]. Muslim’s narration of this Hadith reads, “All will be helped to satisfy what they were created for.” The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa-sallam) ordered the companions to perform righteous, good deeds and not to depend on Al-Qadar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a name="9"></a></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><a>Chapter 9 : The Goals Of Islamic Belief –(Aqeedah)</a></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A person’s goals are the destination that he wishes to reach by taking certain actions. The Islamic ‘Aqeedah (belief) has goals and values that are the destination of whoever preserves it:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 1 &#8211; Seeking the Pleasure of Allah and worshipping Him alone. </b> Allah is the Creator who has no partners. Therefore, He alone must be worshipped and His Pleasure must be intended by every action one takes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 2 &#8211; Freeing the mind from the confusion caused by not following this ‘Aqeedah.</b> Whoever does not believe in this ‘Aqeedah is either an atheist who is worshipping material means or is a follower of misguidance and darkness caused by false beliefs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 3 &#8211; Gaining psychological and intellectual satisfaction.</b> The ones who believe in this ‘Aqeedah do not fall victim to psychological complexes or confusion. This ‘Aqeedah builds a direct and strong relationship between the Lord and His salve. The believer accepts Allah as the Lord, the Legislator and The King. He is satisfied with this belief. His heart is pleased with the following of Islam and he would not exchange this pleasure for anything else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 4 &#8211; Purifying one’s intentions and deeds. </b> This ‘Aqeedah protects one from falling into misguidance in acts of Worship or in dealings with others. It requires its followers to follow the path set by the Messengers. This path leads to Safety and Purity in the hearts and actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 5 &#8211; Being serious with regards to all matters.</b> One does not pass the chance to do righteous, good deeds, but he takes any chance to gain Allah’s rewards. One is always on his guard against any path that leads to sin, fearing Allah’s punishment. This ‘Aqeedah requires its followers to believe in the Resurrection and the Day of Reckoning,<b> “(For all there will be degrees (or ranks) according to what they did. And your Lord is not unaware of what they do &#8221; </b>[6:132].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet also encouraged this attitude, <b>“The strong believer is better and more liked by Allah than the weak believer. However, each one of them has (a certain degree of ) goodness. Seek what brings benefit to you and depend on Allah. Do not be weak if any calamity befalls you, do not say: ‘Had I done that, then this would not have happened.’ Only say: ‘Allah has ordained (this matter) and whatever He will He does.’ “Had I,” opens the door wide for the Devil to do his work” </b>[Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 6 &#8211; Establishing a strong nation</b> that strives to preserve its religion and solidify its gains. This nation disregards the losses it concurs while striving to preserve the religion. Allah said, what translated means, <b>“Only those are the believers who have believed in Allah and His Messenger, and afterwards doubt not but strive with their wealth and their lives for the cause of Allah. Those! They are the truthful”</b> [49:15].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> 7 &#8211; Reaching happiness in this life and in the Last Life, </b> by leading individuals and groups to guidance and gaining their Lord’s bounties and good rewards, <b>“Whoever works righteousness, whether male or female, while he (or she) is a true believer (in Allah) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (Paradise in the Hereafter).&#8221;</b> [16:97].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are some of the goals that Islam seeks for its followers to reach. We pray that Allah helps us and the rest of Muslims to reach them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Muhammad Bin Saalih al-Uthaimeen [1] &#8211; from the Book Tuqrîbut-Tadmuriyyah (pp.7.14)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: <strong>Al-Ibaanah Magazine</strong>, Issue No.2 &#8211; Rabi’ul-Awwal 1416H / August 1995</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah explained to the people -completely and clearly-what their Lord had revealed for them; both the detailed matters and the important ones, the apparent matters and the hidden ones, to such an extent that he taught them what they needed to know with respect to matters of eating, drinking, marriage, clothing and housing. So he taught them the ettiquettes of eating, drinking and relieving one&#8217;s self; the ettiquettes of marriage; the ettiquettes of clothing and of entering and leaving the house &#8211; just as he taught them what they needed to know with regard to the worship of Allaah -The Mighty and Majestic-such as purification, Prayer, Zakaah, fasting, Pilgrimage and other than this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He taught them what they needed to know with regard to the social behaviour with the people, such as kindness to parents, keeping ties of kinship, good companionship with friends and neighbours and other than this.He taught them how to conduct themselves in matters of buying and selling, pawning, leaving deposits, leasing, renting, giving and receiving donations, and other such matter, to such an extent that Abu Dharr(radhi Allaahu anhu) said: &#8220;Indeed the Messenger of Allaah passed away and there is not a bird flapping its wings in the sky, except that he mentioned to us some knowledge about it&#8221; (2)</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Foundations of the Deen</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Salmaan al-Farsee (radhi Allaahu anhu) narrated that it was said to him:Your Prophet has taught you everything, even how to relieve yourselves?So he said to them:&#8221;Yes indeed! And he has prohibited us from facing the qiblah (direction of prayer) whilst relieving ourselves&#8230;&#8221;(3) Along with this, he also taught them the foundation of all these acts of worship, manners and social interactions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This foundation being what the worshippers hold as &#8216;aqeedah (belief) concerning Allaah-the deity who is worshipped and who alone deservs to be worshippped -regarding His Dhaat (Essence), His Names, His Attributes and His Actions, and what follows from this regard to His Universal Laws and His prescribed Laws, which is based upon His ultimate Wisdom and utmost mercy.The Companions learnt all this from the Prophet, clearly and without any ambiguity, and all this was built upon the complete &#8220;Tawheed&#8221; of Allaah (to single out Allaah alone for worship), having as its foundations two great pillars: Affirmation and Negation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>As for affirmation:</strong> It is affirming what is due to Allaah-the Most High-from the rights of His Lordship, worship, and His names, attributes and actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>As for negation: </strong> Then it is negating any partners to Allaah-the Most High-in all that is due to Him.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">The People of Sunnah</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who followed in goodness (ie in aqeedah and manhaj) from those who reached the period of the companions , or those who came after them from the Imaams of guidance-who deserved the Pleasure of Allaah &#8211; remained upon this path, as Allaah-the Most High-said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The first to embrace Islaam from the Muhaajireen(those who migrated from Makkah to al-Madeenah) and the Ansaar(those who lived in al-Madeenah and aided them after migration) and those who follow them in goodness(correct aqeedah and manhaj).Allaah is well pleased with them, as they are well pleased with Him.He has prepared for them Gardens beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever.This is the suporeme achievement&#8221;(4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then they were followed by those who came later, being blind to the truth, or pretending to be blind to the truth.So they went astray and led others astray either due to inabilities or shortcomings, or due to enmity and oppression. They innovated in the Deen of Allaah -the Most High &#8211; that which did not belong to it, in matters of aqeedah (beliefs), ibaadah (acts of worship) and sulook (manners).They did this by altering the texts of the Book and the Sunnah; and of it was possible, they rejected them entirely!</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Brief History of the Innovated Sects</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah ( d.728H) said: &#8220;And know that most of the innovations connected to &#8216;uloom(sciences) and acts of worship occured in this Ummah at the end of the period of the Rightly guided Khaleefahs; just asa the Prophet informed, when he said: &#8220;Those of you who live long after me will see a great deal of differences. So Hold fast to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Rightly Guided Khaleefahs after me&#8221;&#8230;So when the period of the Rightly Guided Khaleefahs had passed and the rule of kingship appeared, deficiencies appeared in the leaders, and therefore deficiency spread also to the people of knowledge and Deen.So during the end of the rule of &#8216;Alee (radhi Allaahu anhu) &#8211; the innovation of the Khwaarij (5) and Raafidah (6) appeared; this being connected to the issue of leadership and khilaafah, and what was connected to this from actions and Shareeah rulings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The kingship of Mu&#8217;aawiyah was a kingship of mercy, so when it passed, the rule of Yazeed came and fitnah (trials and discord) took place within it: the killling of al-Husayn in Iraaq, the fitnah of the people of Hurrah in al-Madeenah and the seige of Makkah when &#8216;Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr made his stand. Then Yazeed passed away and the Ummah split-up. Ibn az-Zubayr in the Hijaaz, Banu Hakam in ash-Shaam (Syria, Jordan and Palestine) and the jump to power of Mukhtaar ibn Abee&#8217;Ubayd and others in &#8216;Iraaq. All of this took place at the end of the period of the Companions, when there only remained the likes of &#8216;Abdullah ibn &#8216;Abaas, &#8216;Abdullah ibn Umar, Jaabir ibn &#8216;Abdullah, Abu Saeed al-Khudree and others. The innovations of the Qadarriyah (7) and the Murjiah (8) then occured and it was refused by those Companions who remained, as they had, along with others, refuted the innovations of the Khawaarij and the Raafidah.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">A Brief Summary</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim (d.751H) (rahimahhullaah) said: &#8220;The innovation of the Qadariyyah started at the end of the period of the Companions. So those that remained at the end of the periods of the Companions.So those who remained at that time, such as &#8216;Abdullah ibn Umar, Ibn Abbas, and their like, oppsed and refuted it. Then the innovation of the Murjiah occured, after the period of the Companions, so those of the major &#8216;Tabiyoon who faced it, refuted it.Then came the innovation of the &#8216;Jahyimmah&#8217; (9) after the passing away of the Tabbi&#8217;oon. Its evil reached alarming proportions and the matter had become dire during the age of the Imaams such as Ahmad (d.241H) and those with him.There appeared after this, the innovation of hulool (incarnation), this appeared with, and in the time of al-Hallaaj.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whenever Shaytaan brought about an innovation from these innovations, or from other than them, Allaah established from His party an army, those who refuted it and warned the Muslims against it-all for the sake of sincerity and sincere advice for Allaah, His book, His Messenger and the people of Islaam&#8221;(11)</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Compilation of the Aqeedah</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr (d.852H) (rahimahhullaah) said: &#8220;From that which occured was:compilation of hadeeth, then tafseer, then the compilation of issues of fiqh (jurisprudence) eminating from pure opinion, and then the compilation of matters related to actions of the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the firts matter; it was opposed by &#8216;Umaar, Abu Moosaa and a few others whilst the majority allowed it. As for the second:It was oppsed by a group from the Tabioon such as Imaam ash-Sha&#8217;bee(d.104H) and a small group. Imaam Ahmad&#8217;s opposition of this intensified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from that which occured was the compilation of the sayings about Usool ud-Deen (fundamentals of the Deen). Some embarked to affirm it (ie the attributes of Allaah), whilst others negated it. The former went to the extent of making tashbeeh (resembling Allaah to his creation), whilst the latter went to the extent of making ta&#8217;teel (denying the attributes of Allah). The rejection of this from the Salaf such as Abu Haneefah(d.150H), Abu Yoosuf(d.182H) and ash-Shaafiee(d.204H), and their sayings with regards to censuring the people of Kalaam (philosphical speech and theology) is well known. The reason for such censure was that the people of &#8216;Kalaaam&#8217; spoke about those matters which both the Prophet and his Companions remained quiet about. It is established from Maalik(d.179H) that there did not exist at the time of the Prophet nor that of AbuBakr (radhi Allaahu anhu) or Umar (radhi Allaahu anhu), anything from these desires &#8211; meaning: the innovation of the Khawaarij, the Raafidah and the Qadiriyyah. Indeed, those who came after the first three excellent generations expanded upon matters which the Imaams of the Tabioon and those who followed them, rejected.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of Kalaam did not content themselves, until they filled the Deen with issues and the sayings of the philosphers. They made this philoshopy the basis and the fundamental principle to which everything was refered back to, and all that which opposed it from the narrations (of the Prophet, his Companions and the Salaf who followd them) then ta&#8217;weel (false interpretation ) was made of them, even if they were averse to the result. Nor did they content themselves with just this.They claimed that what they had compiled was the noblest branch of knowledge and the most deserving to be acquired; and that those who did not use what they had laid down, then they were from the laymen and the ignorant ones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So delight is for the one who clings to what the Salaf were upon, and distances himself from the innovations that the khalaf (the latecomers who oppsed the aqeedah and manhaj of the Salaf) introduced.However, if one cannot keep away from it, then let him take only that which he needs and let the way of the Salaf be his intended goal.&#8221;(12)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(4)Soorah at-Tawbah 9:100</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(5)The Khawaarij were the first sect in Islam to split from the way of the Prophet and his Companions.They arose in the khilaafah of &#8216;Alee (radhi Allaahu anhu) making khurooj (rebellion) against him, before the arbitration between him and Muawiyah (radhi Allaahu anhu).From their false aqeedah (beliefs) is:allowing rebellion against the legitimate Muslim ruler-whether pious or wicked , and declaring the Muslim to be kaafir (disbeliever) due to a commission of a major sin. They were discussed by the Prophet as the Dogs of Hellfire. Refer to Maqaalaatul-Islaamiyeen(1/168) of Abul-Hasan ash-Asharee, al-Bidaayah(8/22-44) of Ibn Katheer and Fathul-Baree(12/282-302) of Ibn Hajr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(6) The Raafidah (the rejectors) are an extreme sect of the Sheeah who rejected Zayd ibn Alee ibn &#8216;Alee ibn al-Husayn due to his refusal to condemn Abu Bakr and Umar (radhi Allaahu anhu).They rapidly deteriorated in &#8216;aqeedah&#8217;, morals and Deen-until the present day-where their beliefs are those represented by the Ithna Ashariyyah Shee&#8217;ahs of Iraan. From their false beliefs are: declaring all but three or five of the companions to be disbelievers, the belief that their imaams have knowledge of the Unseen past, present and future, considering the imaamah to be one of the main pillars of eemaan (faith) and the incompleteness of the Quraan. Refer to: Maqalaatul-Islamiyeen (1/65), al-Farq baynal-Firaq (no.21) of Abdul-Qaahir al-Baghdaadee and Talbees Iblees (pp.94-100) of Ibn ul-Jawzee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(7)The Qadariyyah are the follwers of Mabad ibn al-Juhanee, and from their false beliefs are; that Allah has no prior knowledge of anything until it come into existence; that it is people -and not Allah -who are creators of their own actions, denying aqeedah in the Punishment of the Grave, and denying that the authentic hadeeth is an evidence for the aqeedah, unless it is related in mutaawatir form. Refer to al-Milal wan-Nihal(1/72) of ash-Shahrastaanee and Sawnul-Mantaq wal-Kalaam (p.160) of as-Suyotee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(8) The Murjiaah are those who reject that actions are a part of eemaan (faith) and they say that eemaan is affirmation of the heart and atatement of the tingue only.The extreme from amonngst them limit eemaan to belief of the heart only .They also deny that eemaan increases and decreases.Refer to al-Maqaalat (1/214) and al-Farq baynal-Firaq (p.202)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(9) The Jahyimmah are the followers of Jahm ibn Safwaan, who unleashed upon this Ummah the horrific innovation of ta&#8217;teel (denial of Allah&#8217;s attributes) either directly, or by twisting the meaning of Hand of Allah to mean:His power and generosity. They also deny that Allah is above creation, above His Throne, as well as holding the belief that Paradise and Hellfire are not ever-lasting. Refer to ar-Radd &#8216;alal-Jahyimmah by Imaam Ahmad and also ad-Daarimee and al-Ibaanah (p.141) of Abdul-Hasan al-Assharee.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">From the Book :&nbsp;<strong><a title="Permanent Link to Magnificent Points of Advice for those who have turned to the Way of the Salaf – Ahmad&nbsp;Ash-Shihhee" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/10/01/magnificent-points-of-advice-for-those-who-have-turned-to-the-way-of-the-salaf-ahmad-ash-shihhee/" rel="bookmark">Magnificent Points of Advice for those who have turned to the Way of the Salaf </a></strong>– Ahmad&nbsp;Ash-Shihhee</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know, may Allaah grant you the ability to obey Him, that I do not mean by <strong> “Fundamentals”</strong> , the three categories of Tawheed only. Rather I intended that first, and secondly I meant by it, the other fundamentals, which Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah have agreed on and due to which they have separated themselves from the people of innovation and sects, such as the (the principles of):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Showing al-Walaa wal-Baraa (Loyalty and Disavowment), commanding the good and forbidding the evil, the (correct) stance towards the Sahaabah (Companions) – respecting and defending them, the position with respect to the Leaders, the stance with regard to the transgressors and sinners, and the position towards the People of Innovation – speaking against them and dealing with them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This goes as well for all the other fundamentals that Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah have agreed upon and which they have put in their books on Creed, in order to clarify the truth and separate themselves from the people of deviation, calamities, vain desires and division – even though the source for some of these principles may be related to actions and not Creed. [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if you have gotten a firm grasp in understanding these points and fundamentals, then, by the Will of Allaah, you will be fortified against many of the misconceptions that are gushing throughout the Islamic world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But when many of those who have repented become negligent in this matter and do not initiate their repentance by learning the fundamentals and methodology of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, they become confused and lost with just the slightest of misconceptions! We ask Allaah to save and protect us!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever reflects on the condition of these people, will find many instances and examples for this confusion and shakiness, amongst which are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The First Example:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You find the person who has turned to the Way of the Salaf, in the beginning, strict and determined to keep far away from the people of innovation and sects. This lasts for some time, but then he is presented a misconception from one who clothes himself in the garb of Salafiyyah, which in brief is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Staying away from the people of innovation and not sitting or mixing with them is not correct.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This causes many benefits to be missed out on.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There is no one after Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) that is infallible. Even the Sahaabah made mistakes…”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he does not hear these doubt-raising arguments except that you see his heart become diseased. And you see him drinking (from) this misconception faster than he drinks water. And lo and behold, thereafter, he begins to mix and associate with the people of innovation, becoming soft and easy-going with the principles of Salafiyyah, while doing this in the name of Salafiyyah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This confusion only came about due to his failure to engage in learning the Qur’aan and the Sunnah, according to the understanding of the Salaf (Predecessors) of this ummah. And it was due to his failure to study the Fundamentals of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah. This is since if he were to have devoted time to seeking of knowledge, he would have known that this misconception is false and at variance with the position of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah towards the people of desires and innovation, in the past and present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he would have known that the statement of this false-claimer (to Salafiyyah): “There is no one after Allaah’s Messenger that is infallible” and “everyone make mistakes” are words of truth, but by which falsehood is intended. This is because when anyone amongst Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah – from the Sahaabah and those who followed after them in goodness – made an error, their error did not come as a result of following desires, or failing to follow the narrations or distorting the texts or chasing after what is unclear and ambiguous from these texts, as is the case with the people of innovation. Rather, their error would come due to one of them not being aware of the proof for it or his knowing about it yet not considering it to be authentic, or any of the other reasons for which they have an excuse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following saying of Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) was revealed concerning them and concerning those who follow them in goodness: <strong>“When the judge issues a ruling, making Ijtihaad in the matter and is correct, he gets two rewards. And if he gives a ruling, making Ijtihaad in the matter, and is mistaken, he gets (only) one reward.”</strong> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is contrary to the People of Innovation and Sects, since they do not have any concern for the narrations, and they give precedence to their intellects over the texts from the Book and the Sunnah! Rather, they establish principles that are in opposition to the principles of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah! So these kinds of people are not to be sought excuses for, as that false-claimer (to Salafiyyah) had made excuses for them. <strong>And no one includes them in the same row as that of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah except for someone who is ignorant or an arrogant innovator!</strong> Another example is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Second Example:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You find the person who has repented, in the beginning, enthusiastic and eager to criticize the people of innovation, but without any guidelines or knowledge. So he remains in this state for some period of time. Then he hears the misconceptions from those who claim to be upon Salafiyyah, saying that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Criticizing others is not from the way of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that “It hardens the hearts!” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that “So and so person used to criticize the groups (<em>jamaa’aat</em>), but then he reverted (i.e. went back to his old ways) as a result of that!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these doubts are not presented to him except that he turns around in his heels, and begins to reject this grand principle (of criticizing), which the Religion is established upon. Rather, perhaps you may even find him, after that, calling the people to abandon this principle, claiming that it hardens the hearts!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The truth with regard to this matter is that Criticizing is a grand principle, which the pure Religion is established upon. It is a strong aspect in safeguarding the methodology of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah from distortions. And it is a magnificent form of worship and a noble way of seeking nearness to Allaah, which causes the Muslim’s Eemaan to increase. <strong>However, this is only if it is implemented upon its proper conditions,</strong> such as having sincerity (i.e. not doing it except to please Allaah) and other conditions. So its state is the same as the state of any other act of worship, it increases one’s Eemaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> So the discrepancies are not in the principle, but rather they are in the person who implements this principle (of criticizing and refuting) without any (proper) guidelines. So when the misconception is met with acceptance in his heart, he finds fault with the principle (of criticizing) instead of finding fault in himself for his lack of applying the principle in a good manner.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why we see in the Imaams of guidance – from the Sahaabah, the Taabi’een, and those who followed them in goodness –abstinence (<em>zuhd</em>), dutifulness to Allaah (<em>taqwaa</em>), fear of Him (<em>khashya</em>) and a soft heart along with their excessive criticism and talk concerning individuals and groups.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look at ‘Abdullaah Ibn Al-Mubaarak and Ahmad bin Hanbal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And look at Yahyaa bin Ma’een and ‘Alee Ibn Al-Madeenee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And look at Abu Haatim Ar-Raazee and Al-Bukhaaree.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The biographies of all of these scholars are filled with examples of their piety, fear and dutifulness to Allaah. So this confusion and instability is due to this repentant individual’s lack of sincerity and honesty in repenting to Allaah. And it is due to his lack of giving attention to learning the principles of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah from the beginning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of this, my repentant brother, you must beware of this kind of dangerous trap. And you must know that there is no way for you to be saved from these contagious misconceptions and these destructive traps unless Allaah grants you success (in that) and you begin by (first) learning the Fundamentals of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah. So be firm in this aspect, with earnestness and enthusiasm and strong determination, as Allaah says: <strong>“Hold onto that which We have given you with might (i.e. determination).”</strong> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 63]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And you must be truthful and have sincerity: <strong>“As for those who strive hard with regard to Us (i.e. Our Cause), We will surely guide them to Our Paths (i.e. Allaah&#8217;s Religion). Verily, Allaah is with the good doers.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-&#8216;Ankaboot: 69]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And have certainty in the saying of Allaah: <strong>“And if We had ordered them (saying): ‘Kill yourselves (i.e. the innocent ones kill the guilty ones)’ or ‘Leave your homes’, very few of them would have done it. But if they had done what they were told, it would have been better for them, and it would have strengthened their Faith (Eemaan). And indeed We would have then bestowed on them a great reward from Ourselves. And indeed We would have guided them to a Straight Way.”</strong> [Surah An-Nisaa: 66]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And beware of losing heart and being weak and of yielding to that which befalls you in the Way of Allaah (i.e. in your path to repentance). Do not forget Allaah’s saying: <strong>“But they never lost heart for that which befell them in Allaah&#8217;s Way, nor did they weaken or degrade themselves. And Allaah loves the patient ones.”</strong> [Surah Aali Imraan: 146]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Footnotes:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] <strong>Translator’s Note:</strong> An example of this point would be the inclusion of the issue of wiping over the socks for ablution. The source for this issue stems from action, yet many of the scholars of the past, including Ahmad bin Hanbal, put it in their books on Creed, since by it they distinguished themselves from the people of desires and innovation, who rejected this aspect of the Sunnah based on it not conforming to their intellects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] This is one of their outlandish claims! – Since the hardening of one’s heart can only occur due to opposing the Commandments of Allaah and His Messenger, not by following them. How can the heart of a person who forbids the evil, especially innovations and deviant beliefs, become hardened?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Calamities will be presented to the hearts just like a reed mat is woven stick by stick. So any heart that is immersed with them will have a black mark put on it, and any heart that rejects them will have a white mark put on it, to the point that there will become two types of hearts: A white heart that is like a stone, no fitnah (calamity) will be able to cause harm to it, so long as the heavens and the earth exist. And the other is a black heart, which is dust-colored like a vessel that is upturned, not enjoining what is good and not forbidding what is evil, except for that which it is immersed in from vain desires.”</span> [Saheeh&nbsp;Muslim: &nbsp;(Eng.) 1/267]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh was asked which books he advises a student of knowledge to read in the areas of ‘Aqeedah, Tafseer, Hadeeth and its science, and Fiqh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He specifically stated that a student should memorize and understand (in the topic of <b><i>&#8216;Aqeedah</i></b>):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) <b>al-Usool ath-Thalaathah</b>,<br />
(2) <b>Shuroot us-Salaah wa Arkaanihaa wa Wajibaatihaa</b>,<br />
(3) <b>al-Qawaa’id ul-&#8216;Arba’ah</b>,<br />
(4) <b>Shuroot Laa Ilaaha illAllaah</b>,<br />
(5) <b>Nawaaqid ul-Islaam</b>, and<br />
(6) <b>Kitaab ut-Tawheed</b>, all by Shaykh ul-Islaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for (7) <b>Kashf ush-Shubuhaat</b>, then he said that if a person memorizes it, then that is good, but he did not stress it as with the above works.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, he did not stress memorizing (8) <b>al-Waasitiyyah</b>, but instead said that a student can either memorize it or learn it and understand it well.<br />
He also mentioned that a person should study (9) the various treatises contained in <b>Majmoo’ Fataawaa Shaykh ul-Islaam Bin Taymiyyah</b> (presumably <b>al-Fatwa al-Hamawiyyah al-Kubraa, ar-Risaalat ut-Tadmuriyyah, al-&#8216;Eemaan</b>, etc., although he did not name names), and (10) <b>Sharh ut-Tahaawiyyah</b> by Ibn Abee al-‘Izz al-Hanafee (d. 792) if he wants to expand his scope regarding the subject of Asmaa’ was-Sifaat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the other subjects, I do not recall him specifically saying that a student should memorize anything except for the one who desires to learn about the differences between the four madhaahib in <b><i>Fiqh</i></b>. He said that it is befitting for such a person to memorize a matan (lower level Fiqh manual) for each of the four madhaahib.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the area of <b><i>hadeeth</i></b>, he mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) <b>al-Arba’een an-Nawawiyyah</b>,<br />
(2) <b>‘Umdat ul-Ahkaam</b>, and<br />
(3) <b>Buloogh ul-Maraam</b>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Although he did not specifically say that one should memorize them, I have heard other Scholars (such as Shaykh Saalih ibn ‘Abdul-‘Azeez Aal ash-Shaykh) say that one should begin his course in hadeeth with the memorization and study of <b>al-Arba’een</b>. The more famous explanations for it are that of an-Nawawee (d. 676) himself, which is a very brief explanation for beginners, that of Ibn Daqeeq al-‘Eed (d. 702), which is perhaps a middle-level explanation, and that of Ibn Rajab (d. 795), which is more advanced and thorough than the rest.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Scholars have also recommended that the more advanced and dedicated students should memorize and learn the other two: <b>‘Umdat ul-Ahkaam</b> and <b>Buloogh al-Maraam</b> by ‘Abdul-Ghanee al-Maqdisee (d. 600) and Ibn Hajar al-‘Asqalaanee (d. 852) respectively.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <b><i>tafseer</i></b>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said that a person should start with the tafseer of ‘Abdur-Rahmaan as-Sa’dee (d. 1376), titled <b>Tayseer al-Kareem al-Rahmaan fee Tafseer Kalaam il-Manaan</b>, because its author is a well-known Salafee (and hence does not fall into the same ta’weel and mistakes of the other lower-level tafaaseer, such as al-Jalaalayn).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then said that if a person can find a Salafee teacher to guide him, he should study <b>Fath ul-Qadeer</b> of Shawkaanee (d. 1250) – this is because the teacher will help him:<br />
(a) Be alert to some of the mistakes of Shawkaanee regarding as-Sifaat, and<br />
(b) Help him with the more difficult aspects of the &#8216;Arabic language that occur in the book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally, he mentioned <b>Tafseer Ibn Katheer</b>, stating that it is okay if a student studies from one of the various abridgements available nowadays (like that of ar-Rifaa’ee).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Taken From 22 Question About the Salafee Da&#8217;wah.</b><br />
<strong>Shaykh Muhammad Amaan ibn &#8216;Alee al-Jaamee</strong><br />

<p><strong>Questioner</strong>:</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;There are those who come forth and claim that the Sahaabah differed in matters of &#8216;Aqeedah. What is the ruling on this? Please give us a fatwa, may you be rewarded.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Al-&#8216;Allâmah Sâlih al-Luhaydan</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Astaghfirullaah! No one says this, except a misguided innovator. He says that the Sahaabah differed whilst the Sahaabah were people of &#8216;aqeedah. If there was any disagreement between them, then it was merely in some of the affairs of ijtihaad related to deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the affairs of &#8216;aqeedah, that Allah is One and that He is All-Hearing and All-Seeing, and that He does what He wills, that He is the Supreme Creator, and that He is the Creator of everything and that He is aware of everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No! They did not differ (in Aqeedah). And no one brings up this affair, except a caller to fitnah. Except that he disguises himself &#8212; with his claim &#8212; that he is from the people of goodness. He may have known some good and started to speak with the good he knows, to mislead the people and drag them into the falsehood that he is inclined to and is eager in spreading.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he is from those who are deceived, let him seek Allah&#8217;s forgiveness and repent to Him and let him return to the people of knowledge and ask them. And if he is from those who like to conceal their agendas and cover their true objectives let him be exposed so the people can be protected from his evil.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Why do deviants say that the Sahaaba differ in ‘aqeedah? So they can justify their hizbiyyah and their differing. They work night and day to try to find differing of the sahaaba, so they can justify their opposition to the Sunnah – i.e. sahaabah differed so we can differ.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Noble <em>Shaykh, Aba al-Hassan &#8216;Ali ibn Mukhtar ar-Ramly </em>(May Allaah Preserve Him) from amongst the scholars of Jordan, and a very strong student of <em><strong>Shaykh Muqbil ibn Hadi al-Wad&#8217;ee</strong> (rahimahullaah)</em> started a weekly web class with <em>Muwahhideen</em> Publications on the explanation of the book &#8220;The Purification of The <em>Aqeedah</em>&#8221; by <em><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn Ismaeel al-Sana&#8217;nee</strong> (rahimahullaah)</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Class # 01 &#8211; 03.09.2012<a href="http://www.mpubs.org/files/AABU_20100707QA_pledgeofallegianceinthewest_ar_eng.mp3"> </a>70:09 mins. (Arabic &amp; English)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Commencing the class, <em>Shaykh ‘Ali ar-Ramli (hafidhahullaah)</em> spoke about the reason for <strong>Allaah</strong> sending us Prophets and Messengers and touched on the origin of <em>shirk</em> amongst mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then went on to give a brief biography of <em>Imaam As-Sana’anee (rahimahullaah)</em> and the reason why the author took it upon himself to write this book and clarify the misguidance of the people in his time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Other points of benefit included mention of the condition of the disbelievers of <em>Quraysh</em>, an explanation of the title of the book, some discussion about the state of the people in the time of <em>Imaam as-Sana’anee</em> and much more benefit concerning the correct belief of the <em>muslim</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Shaykh</em> completed the introduction of the book in this first sitting and all are encouraged to attend these vital lessons that are packed with immense benefit about the most important matter in the life of a Muslim: the establishment of Tawheed and safeguarding oneself from shirk.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Continuing with our study of the book ‘The Purification of the ‘Aqeedah’, <em>Shaykh ar-Ramli (hafidhahullaah)</em>explained in great detail three of the five fundamentals as articulated by the author.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Imaam as-Sana’anee (rahimahullaah)</em> laid down five fundamentals which he then broke down into chapters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The three fundamentals discussed are as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly:</strong> It has been known from the necessity of belief in the religion of <strong>Allaah</strong> that all of the <em>Quraan</em> is truth and not falsehood, all of it is guidance and not misguidance and all of it is certainty that has no doubt whatsoever. This is a foundation that the belief of anyone cannot be perfected and affirmed without.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly:</strong> All of the prophets and messengers of <strong>Allaah</strong> from the first to the last of them were sent to call all of the creation to worship <strong>Allaah</strong> alone without associating any partners with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly:</strong><em>Tawheed</em> is divided into two categories. The first, <em>Tawheed ar-Ruboobiyyah</em> (<em>Tawheed al-Asmaa was-Sifaat</em> included in this category) and the second, <em>Tawheed al-Uloohiyyaah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Class # 03 &#8211; 17.09.2012<a href="http://www.mpubs.org/files/AABU_20100707QA_pledgeofallegianceinthewest_ar_eng.mp3"> </a>62:59 mins. (Arabic &amp; English)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">In the third class, our <em>Shaykh ‘Ali ar-Ramli (hafidhahullaah)</em> began by doing a recap of the principles we studied thus far. Then, he went on to explain the remaining two principles of the five.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These include:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Fourth Principle:</strong> All of the polytheists affirm and confirm that <strong>Allaah</strong> is the Lord (The Creator, The Sustainer and the Disposer of all Affairs) so<strong>Allaah</strong> sent the Messengers and Prophets to call the people to the Monotheism of Worship <em>(Tawheed al-‘Uloohiyyah)</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Fifth Principle:</strong> <em>‘Ibaadah</em> (worship) is the utmost of humiliation and humbling oneself to <strong>Allaah</strong> and worship is not meant but to humiliate oneself to <strong>Allaah</strong>. And this humiliation is only for <strong>Him</strong> and can never be for other than <strong>Him</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Shaykh</em> explained both principles in great detail, quoting the many evidences concerning both matters. He then went on to enlighten us with some benefits regarding the statement of <em>Tawheed:‘Laa ilaaha il Allaah’</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This concluded the five principles as mentioned by the author <em>(Imaam as-Sana’anee)</em> and is the foundation upon which the rest of the book is built upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">In this session, <em>Shaykh ‘Ali ar-Ramli (hafidhahullaah)</em> went in to great detail concerning the Monotheism of Worship<em> (Tawheed al-‘Ibaadah)</em> and what it necessitates.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He explained that it is the belief of <em>Ahlus Sunnah</em> that <em>kufr</em> (disbelief) is divided into different categories which he mentioned and gave examples, as opposed to the deviant sect, the <em>Murji’ah</em> who say <em>kufr</em> is only of one kind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Shaykh Ramli</em> went on to discuss and explain the speech of the author concerning the reality that even if a person affirms the <em>Ruboobiyyah</em>(Lordship) of <strong>Allaah</strong> and worships <strong>Him</strong> but does not single <strong>Him</strong> out in this  worship then this is of no benefit to him and he is a <em>mushrik</em> (polytheist),<em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A noteworthy point, as mentioned by the <em>Shaykh,</em> is that it is from the condition of <em>sidq</em> (truthfulness) in <em>eemaan</em> that an individual does not depend on other than <strong>Allaah</strong> and it is a must that we single <strong>Him</strong> out alone in our dependence just as we single <strong>Him</strong> out in other acts of <em>‘ibaadah</em>. <strong>Allaah</strong>commanded His slaves to say ‘You alone we worship’ so no one truthfully believes in this statement until he singles out <strong>Allaah</strong> in all acts of worship, otherwise he is a liar and is forbidden from saying this statement because it means to specify all acts of worship for <strong>Allaah</strong> alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This class was extremely beneficial in highlighting the crucial matter of actualizing<em> Tawheed al-‘Ibaadah</em> with the <em>Shaykh</em> bringing forth the necessary evidences from the Qur’aan and Sunnah with much clarity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Class # 05 &#8211; 15.10.2012<a href="http://www.mpubs.org/files/AABU_20100707QA_pledgeofallegianceinthewest_ar_eng.mp3"> </a>52:54 mins. (Arabic &amp; English)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">In this sitting, the <em>Shaykh (hafidhahullaah)</em> started a new chapter in which a number of matters were discussed. From them are:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>The affirmation of the polytheists with regard to <em>Tawheed ar-Ruboobiyyah</em> is of no benefit to them due to them associating partners with Allaah in worship. Their actions negate their belief in His Lordship and they are counted from the <em>mushrikoon.</em></li>
<li>It is only logical that the one who admits to the oneness of <strong>Allaah’s</strong> Lordship also dedicate all acts of worship to <strong>Him</strong> alone because what is the purpose of worshipping other than <strong>Allaah</strong> if everything is under His control and command (He is the Sole Creator, Sustainer etc). The one who does not dedicate all acts of worship to <strong>Allaah</strong> alone does not truly believe in His Lordship although he would attest to this.</li>
<li><em>Riyaa</em> (showing off) is not only referred to as an act of <em>shirk</em> but it is also deemed worship since this refers to the slave doing an action seeking status/position in the hearts of the people while simultaneously seeking <strong>Allaah</strong> in that act of worship.</li>
<li>Whoever believes that a created being can benefit or harm, bring one closer to <strong>Allaah</strong>, intercede with <strong>Allaah</strong> on his behalf or fulfill his needs does not uphold <em>Tawheed ar-Ruboobiyyah</em> because he has ascribed attributes that belong to <strong>Allaah</strong> alone to other than <strong>Him</strong>.</li>
<li>The matter of <em>an-nadr</em> (vowing) which is to dedicate something to the object of worship seeking reward and fulfillment of a need as a result of this dedication. And this is only to be performed for <strong>Allaah</strong> alone as <em>an-nadr</em> is an act of <em>‘ibaadah</em> so to perform it for other than Him constitutes <em>shirk</em>in worship.</li>
<li>This is still present today with the <em>qubooriyoon</em> (grave-worshippers) who use different names for their actions. Regardless of the names, the meaning is the same.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Continuing with our study of the book ‘The Purification of the <em>‘Aqeedah</em>’ by <em>Imaam as-Sana’anee (rahimahullaah)</em>, <em>Shaykh ‘Ali ar-Ramli (hafiidhahullaah)</em> went on to explain some matters concerning the grave worshippers and that which constitutes shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> From the points discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Whoever believes that a rock, tree, grave, the living or dead can bring about harm or benefit or grant that which is only in the Hands of <strong>Allaah</strong> or can bring you closer to <strong>Allaah</strong> has committed shirk.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Those who worship the graves treat the graves of those they claim to be <em>awliyaa</em> the same way the <em>mushrikeen</em> (idol worshippers) treated their idols. They call upon them as the <em>Muslimeen</em> call upon <strong>Allaah</strong>.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">By worshipping the graves and calling upon the deceased they have gone back to the exact same concept that was found in the worship of <em>Wad, Suwa, Yaguth, Ya’uq</em> and <em>Nasr</em> by the people of <em>Nuh</em>.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Some have the belief that men from amongst the living who are <em>fussaaq</em> (apparent, public sinners) have powers and can be called upon while these men are themselves immersed and completely drowning in sin, transgression, lusts and every kind of despicable thing <strong>Allaah</strong> has made haraam (forbidden).</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Along with all of this, this person will be found to make a claim of <em>‘ilm ul ghayb</em> (knowledge of the unseen)nand this is in direct contradiction to the<em>Qur’aan</em> thus rendering him a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever). However <em>Iblees</em> will bring to him people who will believe in his lies, accompany him and glorify and magnify him until they raise him to the level of<em> Rabb-ul-‘Aalameen</em> (The Lord of all creation).</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Those who believe in the <em>“awliyaa”</em> and the open sinners have become <em>mushrikeen</em> (polytheists), just as the idol worshippers. There is similarity in their description and actions. According to the author, the ruling regarding them (the grave worshippers and idol worshippers) is exactly the same because they have directed worship which should be to <strong>Allaah</strong> alone to other than <strong>Him</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Tremendous Advice from Shaikh Rabee&#8217; On The Importance of Reviewing Correct &#8216;Aqeedah &amp; Tawheed, Renewing one&#8217;s Eeman, and fearing Shirk and Hypocrisy! </strong></p>
<p>Shaikh Rabee&#8217; bin Haadee al-Madkhalee (hafidhahullaah Ta&#8217;aala) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Look at the Muslim world today; go to Egypt, or go to Sudan, or go to Pakistan, and you will see incredibly dangerous false practices. In this land of Sa&#8217;udia Arabia, we have eradicated these elevated and venerated graves connected with false worship &#8211; all praise is due to Allaah. However, today many callers make it easy for the people to go to these locations or places of disobedience of Allaah in other countries, while at the same time it is likely that they denounce the emphasis given by others to calling to the worship of Allaah alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oh brother, the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) would from time to time repeatedly call his companions to reaffirm their oath of allegiance to him that they would not associate anything with Allaah in their worship. He had Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar, Ibn Mas&#8217;ood, &#8216;Ubaidah Ibn as-Saamit (radiallaahu &#8216;anhum) and others again make the oath of allegiance to him that they would not associate or join anything else along with the worship of Allaah, as well as that they would establish the prayer, and so forth<span style="color:#888888;"><a href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-1yO" target="_blank"><span style="color:#888888;">.</span></a></span></p>
<p>Why would he reaffirm this oath of allegiance with the likes of Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar?</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Because our correct belief always requires being refreshed, rekindled, and renewed. As this correct belief, it is necessary that we plant it firmly within us as individuals, and among us collectively, and that we be reminded of its place and importance.&#8221; &#8230; </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Rabee&#8217; also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And if there is a caller today who correctly warns the people from this false practice of associating others with Allaah (in worship), the people will say, &#8216;Do you think we are idol worshippers?&#8217; But <span style="color:#993300;">why would the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) himself reaffirm this oath of allegiance with the likes of Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar, that they not associate anything with Allaah in their worship, yet you &#8216;callers&#8217; do not warn from this practice of joining others with Allaah in worship?!</span></p>
<p>Ibraheem (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said [in his du&#8217;aa to Allaah]:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">وَاجْنُبْنِي وَبَنِيَّ أَنْ نَعْبُدَ الأَصْنَامَ<br />
<em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;&#8230;and keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols.&#8221;</span></em> (Ibraaheem, ayah 35)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yes, Ibraaheem &#8211; the father of the Prophets &#8211; and Khaleel-ur-Rahmaan said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">وَاجْنُبْنِي وَبَنِيَّ أَنْ نَعْبُدَ الأَصْنَامَ رَبِّ إِنَّهُنَّ أَضْلَلْنَ كَثِيرا ً مِنَ النَّاسِ فَمَنْ تَبِعَنِي فَإِنَّه ُُ مِنِّي وَمَنْ عَصَانِي فَإِنَّكَ غَفُور ٌ رَحِيم</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;&#8230;and keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols. Oh my Lord! They have indeed led astray many among mankind. But whoso follows me, he verily is of me. And whoso disobeys me &#8211; still You are indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221;</span></em> (Ibraaheem, ayat 35-36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was aware that from among his descendants there would be many Prophets, yet despite this he still feared for them. So how can we consider ourselves safe and secure from this danger?!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><strong>Ya Muqqallib al-Qulloob Thabit Qulubuna &#8216;ala Deenik</strong><br />
</em>(Oh Turner of the hearts, make our hearts steadfast upon Your Religion).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) often made this supplication and taught his companions to say this supplication. Yet many of us today, we possess undeserved confidence that we will not fall into associating others with Allaah, nor fall into hypocrisy.</p>
<p>But the companions feared for themselves hypocrisy. Ibn Abee Malaikah (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;I encountered 30 of the companions of the Prophet Muhammad (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam), and all of them feared for themselves being hypocrites.&#8221;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Rabee&#8217; also said:</div>
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;As such, it is necessary that each of us fears falling into hypocrisy, and fears falling into matters of associating others with Allaah in worship, and fears for our hearts swerving away from the truth. </strong></div>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">رَبَّنَا لاَ تُزِغْ قُلُوبَنَا بَعْدَ إِذْ هَدَيْتَنَا وَهَبْ لَنَا مِنْ لَدُنْكَ رَحْمَة ً إِنَّكَ أَنْتَ الْوَهَّابُ<br />
<em><span style="color:#008000;">(They say): &#8220;Our Lord! Let not our hearts deviate (from the truth) after You have guided us, and grant us mercy from You. Truly, You are the Bestower.&#8221;</span></em> (Aali Imran, ayah 8) and the verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">فَلاَ يَأْمَنُ مَكْرَ اللَّهِ إِلاَّ الْقَوْمُ الْخَاسِرُونَ<br />
<em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;None feels secure from the Plan of Allaah except the people who are the losers.</span></em> (Al-A&#8217;raf, ayah 99)</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>So we have fear for that which might affect the steadfastness and the strength of our Eeman within ourselves.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must make every effort in bringing about the causes for steadfastness, from actions which are obedience to Allaah, from submission and compliance to Allaah, Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;aala, from seeking forgiveness of Allaah, Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;aala, during the day and night by always humbly seeking from Him and beseeching Him to make us firm upon Islaam, and that Allaah guide at our hands those who want the guidance of Allaah, Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;aala.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Rabee&#8217; also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;As for the danger of lying and hypocrisy, we will offer you some thoughts regarding that. Indeed many of the leading personalities of falsehood and misguidance wore the &#8216;garments&#8217; of Islaam, and made an outward show of worship and of striving to rectify affairs, as it is not possible for them to attempt to deceive the people except through adorning themselves in these &#8216;garments&#8217; of Islaam in which they present themselves giving the appearance of righteous Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in any case, if he reveals the characteristic of lying &#8211; even if he stands the night in prayer and fasts during the day &#8211; then that lying is a sign from the signs of hypocrisy. Moreover if he possesses &#8211; in addition to this &#8211; the characteristics of going against his word and excessiveness in his disputes, then clearly he stands as a pure hypocrite, and from this we seek refuge in Allaah.</p>
<p>Just as the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Signs of the hypocrites are three, when he speaks, he lies, when he promises, he breaks his word &#8211; or it is said when he gives a trust he is disloyal to it &#8211; and when he disputes, he goes to extremes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these four characteristics, if he possesses these four, then he is a pure hypocrite. And I say that the first three characteristics are those which are mentioned in the narration of Abu Hurrairah. However, the narration of &#8216;Abdullaah ibn &#8216;Umar mentions four characteristics. In any case, if he possesses all of these mentioned characteristics, then he is a pure hypocrite upon pure hypocrisy. And it may be that in regard to specific individuals, it would be restricted to the hypocrisy of deeds or actions, or it may be the full reality of hypocrisy in one&#8217;s inward belief which then takes him outside of the boundaries of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Previously it has been explained to you that some of the people today consider that the matter of hypocrisy as a reality has &#8216;ended.&#8217; They suppose that hypocrisy was &#8216;only&#8217; in the time of the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), but as for the latter ages, then they are &#8216;free&#8217; from hypocrisy occurring within them. This is clearly from their obvious ignorance and foolishness, and we seek refuge in Allaah from that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As indeed, the most knowledgeable of people regarding the hypocrites was the companion Hudhaifa ibn al-Yamaan (radiallaahu &#8216;anhu), and this companion who was the most knowledgeable of the hypocrites said: The hypocrisy today is worse and more evil than the hypocrisy in the time of the Messenger. They said, &#8216;Why is that?&#8217; He said: Because at that time, the hypocrites strove to conceal their hypocrisy, but as for the people today, they manifest it openly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these individuals openly showed their hypocrisy, and spoke about their shameful affair, in their opposition to the Muslims. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Specifically in the matter of calling to Allaah, the Blessed and the Most High, the one who fights against the call to the truth, engages in deceptions and fabricates things, then it is not something to be considered unlikely that many from among them are true complete hypocrites. And we ask Allaah for health and well being.&#8221;</strong></span></p>

<p><strong>Text below: [<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/al-haaiyyah-arabic-text.pdf" target="_blank">Arabic Text Download Here</a>]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) Hold tightly to the rope of Allaah and the guidance,<br />
And do not be an innovator, so that you might be successful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) And practice your religion based on the Book of Allaah and the Sunan which<br />
have come from the Messenger of Allaah so you will be saved and earn reward.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) And say: Not a created thing is the Speech of our great King,<br />
Such was the religious position of the pious ones (before us) which they clearly expressed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(4) And do not be a person who takes no position on the Quran,<br />
As did the followers of Jahm, and they had been too lax (to take the right position).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(5) And do not say that the Quran is created, meaning: its recitation,<br />
Since the Speech of Allaah, through its recitation, is made clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(6) And say: Allaah will make himself visible to the creation, openly,<br />
Just as the full moon is not hard to see, and your Lord (will be seen) more clearly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(7) And He was not born, nor has He fathered anyone,<br />
Nor is there anything similar to Him, exalted be the Glorified One.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(8) A Jahmee rejects this, however, we have<br />
As a testimony to the truth of what we say – a hadeeth that clarifies it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(9) Jareer narrated it, from the words of Muhammad,<br />
So say what he said about that, and you will be successful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(10) And certainly a Jahmee will deny His Right Hand as well,<br />
While both of His Hands are giving out all kinds of bounties.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(11) And say: The Ever-Compelling descends each night,<br />
Without asking how, magnificent is the One God and most worthy of praise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(12) Down to the lowest heaven, granting bounties from His Grace,<br />
As the gates of the heavens are opened and spread widely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(13) He says: Is there anyone seeking forgiveness who would like to meet a Forgiver?<br />
Or anyone seeking bounties of goodness and provisions, so he could be given (what he requests)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(14) A group have reported this whose reports are not to be rejected,<br />
But sadly some have went wrong and did not believe them, marring themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(15) And say: Indeed the best of the people after Muhammad<br />
Were his two deputies of old, and then ‘Uthmaan, according to the most correct position.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(16) And the fourth of them was the best of creation after them,<br />
‘Alee, the companion of goodness, through goodness he was successful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(17) Those are the people, those who we have no doubt about,<br />
Upon the great camels of Firdows, shining brightly and roaming about.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(18) Sa’eed, Sa’d, Ibn ‘Awf, Talhah,<br />
Aamir of Fihr, and Zubayr the praiseworthy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(19) And speak with the best terms about the Companions, all of them,<br />
And do not be one who speaks ill of them, pointing out their faults and criticizing,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(20) Since the clear Revelation has spoke of their excellence,<br />
And in (Soorah) al-Fath are verses about the Companions, praising them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(21) And regarding the pre-ordained Qadr, be convinced, since it is<br />
The pillar that combines many affairs of the Religion, and the Religion encompasses much.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(22) And do not reject, out of ignorance, (belief in) Nakeer and Munkar,<br />
Or the Pool or the Scales, surely you are being advised sincerely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(23) And say: Allaah, the Great, will remove, from of His Grace,<br />
Out of the Fire, people, burned severely, who will then be tossed</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(24) Into the river in Firdows, wherein they will regain life by its water,<br />
Like a seed taken by a flood that comes and wipes things away with its abundant water.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(25) And surely, the Messenger of Allaah will intercede for the creation.<br />
And speak about the punishment of the grave, that it is the truth, made clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(26) And do not make takfeer of those who pray, even if they commit sins,<br />
Since all of them commits sins, while the Owner of the Throne forgives graciously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(27) And do not hold a belief like that of the Khawaarij, for it is<br />
A position held by only those who desire it, and it is destructive and disgraceful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(28) And do not be a Murji’, one who plays games with his religion,<br />
Surely, the Murji’ is joking about the religion (ie. not taking it seriously).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(29) And say: Eemaan (faith) consists of statements, intentions (i.e. belief of the heart)<br />
And Actions, according to the explicit statement of the Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(30) And it decreases sometimes, due to disobedience, and sometimes<br />
Because of obedience it grows, and on the Scale it will outweigh (other things).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(31) And keep yourself from the opinions of people and their stances,<br />
Since the stance of the Messenger of Allaah is more befitting and comforting to the chest.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(32) And do not be from those who play games with their religion,<br />
Attacking the people of hadeeth and reviling them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(33) If you keep the belief contained within this poem all your life, O my companion,<br />
You will be upon goodness, day and night.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Explanation of a Summary of al-‘Aqeedatul-Hamawiyyah</strong></p>
<p><strong>Author</strong>:  Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Saalih al-&#8216;Uthaymeen<br />
<strong>Paperback</strong>: 208 Pages<br />
<strong>Published</strong>: January, 2005,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the works on this subject is his (Ibn Taymiyyah&#8217;s) “<strong><span style="color:#666699;">al-Fatwaa al-Hamawiyyah</span></strong>” which he wrote as an answer to a question presented to him in the Hijrah year of 698 from Hamaah, a place in ash-Shaam. In it, he was asked what the scholars and Imaams of the religion say concerning the Aayaat and the Ahaadeeth of the Sifaat, or the attributes and characteristics of Allaah. So he answered in about 83 pages and due to which, he suffered trials and afflictions. May Allaah reward him on behalf of Islaam and the Muslims with the best of rewards.</p>
<p><strong>From the Back of the Book</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has sent Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa Sallam) with guidance and the true religion. He sent him as a mercy to the world, as an example for the workers, and as a proof against all the servants. He (Muhammad) fulfilled the trust, conveyed the message, advised the Ummah, and he clarified for the people all of what they need regarding the foundations of their religion as well as its detailed matters. He left no good except that he clarified it and encouraged it, and he left no evil but that he warned the Ummah from it so much so that he left his Ummah upon a clear, white path – its night as clear as its day. His companions traversed this path, shining and radiant.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Afterwards, the best generations took it from them in the same state until oppression frowned upon them with the darkness of various innovations by which the innovators conspired against Islaam and its people. The people then wandered in confusion purposelessly, and they began building their ‘Aqeedah beliefs upon a spider’s web.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the Lord upholds His religion with His close helpers upon whom He bestows Eemaan, knowledge, and wisdom by which they prevent these enemies. They repel their plot back against their own throats. So no one ever comes out with his innovation except that Allaah – and for this deserves praise and thanks – destines to send someone from Ahlus-Sunnah who refutes and disproves his innovation and extinguishes it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He has many works on the clarification and explanation of the Sunnah, the reinforcement of its pillars, and the destruction of innovations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the works on this subject is his “al-Fatwaa al-Hamawiyyah” which he wrote as an answer to a question presented to him in the Hijrah year of 698 from Hamaah, a place in ash-Shaam. In it, he was asked what the scholars and Imaams of the religion say concerning the Aayaat and the Ahaadeeth of the Sifaat, or the attributes and characteristics of Allaah. So he answered in about 83 pages and due to which, he suffered trials and afflictions. May Allaah reward him on behalf of Islaam and the Muslims with the best of rewards.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to the difficulty in understanding and comprehending this answer from many readers, I wanted to summarize the most important points from it along with some other needed additions. I have named it “<strong><span style="color:#666699;">Fathu Rabb-il-Bariyyah bi-Talkhees al-Hamawiyyah</span></strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I first published it in the Hijrah year 1380. I am now publishing it a second time and perhaps changing what I see beneficial of additions or deletions.</p>
<p>I ask Allaah to make our effort sincerely for His Face and as a benefit to His servants, for indeed He is Generous and Kind.</p>
<p>-The Author (<strong>Muhammad ibn Saalih al-’Uthaymeen</strong>)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">All praise is due to Allah Alone. Peace and blessings be upon the Last Prophet, his family, Companions and those who follow his guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Muslim should know that Allah (may He be Praised) enjoins all the creation to embrace Islam, hold it firmly and avoid what contradicts it. Allah sent His Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) to call for that, informing them that whoever follows him will be guided and whoever turns away from him will be misguided. In many Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses), Allah warned people against causes of apostasy and all forms of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and Kufr (disbelief). Under the topic of the rulings of the apostate, scholars (may Allah be merciful with them) mentioned that a Muslim may abandon Islam by committing one of the nullifiers that make his blood and money violable and turn him out of the fold of Islam. <span style="color:#003300;">The most dangerous and common ten nullifiers are mentioned by Shaykh and Imam Muhammad ibn `Abdul-Wahhab and other scholars (may Allah be merciful with them)</span>. Here we will list them in brief so that a Muslim can keep away from them and warn people against them in hope for safety and wellbeing. We will briefly elaborate on them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: Shirk in the worship of Allah. Allah (Exalted be He) says: Verily, Allâh forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills He (Exalted be He) also says: Verily, whosoever sets up partners (in worship) with Allâh, then Allâh has forbidden Paradise to him, and the Fire will be his abode. And for the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers) there are no helpers. This includes invoking the dead and seeking relief, vowing or offering sacrifice for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: Whoever takes intermediaries between him and Allah, invokes, and asks them for intercession with Allah and puts his trust in them has committed Kufr (disbelief) according to the Ijma` (consensus) of scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: Whoever does not hold the polytheists to be disbelievers, has doubts about their disbelief or considers their ways and beliefs to be correct has committed disbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth</strong>: Whoever believes that some guidance other than that of the Prophet (peace be upon him) is more complete than his guidance or that someone else’s judgment is better than his judgment, such as those who prefer the judgment of the Taghut (false gods) over his judgment, then he is a disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifth</strong>: Whoever hates something that the Messenger (peace be upon him) came with, even though he may act on it, has disbelieved. Allah (Exalted be He) says: That is because they hate that which Allâh has sent down (this Qur’ân and Islâmic laws, etc.); so He has made their deeds fruitless.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sixth</strong>: Whoever mocks or ridicules any part of the Messenger’s religion, its rewards or punishments has committed an act of disbelief. Allah (Exalted be He) says: Say: &#8220;Was it at Allâh (عز وجل), and His Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations) and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) that you were mocking?&#8221; Make no excuse; you disbelieved after you had believed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Seventh</strong>: Sorcery, which includes magic spells that cause a person to hate or love someone/something. Whoever practices it or is pleased with it commits disbelief. The proof for this is the saying of Allah (Exalted be He): but neither of these two (angels) taught anyone (such things) till they had said, “We are only for trial, so disbelieve not (by learning this magic from us).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Eighth</strong>: Supporting and assisting the polytheists against the Muslims. The proof for this is the saying of Allah (Exalted be He): And if any amongst you takes them as Auliyâ’, then surely he is one of them. Verily, Allâh guides not those people who are the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers and unjust).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ninth</strong>: Whoever believes that it is permitted for some people to be free of (implementing) the Shari`ah (Islamic law) brought with Muhammad (peace be upon him), then he is a disbeliever. Allah (Exalted be He) says: And whoever seeks a religion other than Islâm, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tenth</strong>: Turning away from Allah’s religion, not learning it or implementing it (is an act of disbelief). The proof for this statement is the saying of Allah: And who does more wrong than he who is reminded of the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of his Lord, then turns aside therefrom? Verily, We shall exact retribution from the Mujrimûn (criminals, disbelievers, polytheists, sinners).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no difference in committing these nullifiers between the utters them in humor, seriously, or even out of fear except for a person who says them under coercion. All of these (ten) matters are the gravest nullifiers that most often occur. A Muslim must beware of and keep away from these acts. We seek refuge with Allah from the things that entail His anger and severe punishment. May Allah&#8217;s Peace be upon the best of His Creation Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">The Fourth Nullifier includes those who believe that man-made laws and constitutions are better than the Shari`ah of Islam, equal to it, or that it is permissible to resort to them for judgment even if he believes that the judgment of Shari`ah is better. Likewise, whoever believes that it is not correct to implement the Laws of Islam in the twentieth century, that this is a cause for the fall of Muslims, or that it is limited to relationship between the servant and his Lord and should not interfere in the other affairs of life. The fourth category also includes those who hold that carrying out Allah&#8217;s laws, such as cutting off the hand of a thief or stoning a guilty adulterer is not befitting for this modern era. This category includes those who believe that it is permissible to rule by something other than the Laws of Allah (Shari’ah) in matters of transactions, Hudud (prescribed penalties) and so on, even if he does not believe that it is better than ruling by the Shari`ah. This is because, by doing that, he makes lawful that which Allah forbade, according to the consensus of scholars. Similarly, whoever makes lawful that which Allah has prohibited and this prohibition is indisputably established, such as adultery, Khamr (intoxicant), Riba (usury/interest) and ruling by anything other than the Shari`ah, then he is a disbeliever according to the consensus of Muslim scholars.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah guide all of us to what pleases Him. May Allah guide us and all Muslims to His straight path! He is All-Hearer, Ever Near. May peace and blessings of Allah be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Shaykh Naasir ud-Deen al-Albaanee</strong> (rahimahullaah) was asked:</p>
<div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the youth differentiate between the aqidah of the Salaf and the manhaj of the Salaf so you see some of them upon the aqidah of the Salaf yet they allow themselves to work with some of the methodologies that exist today, even though there maybe what opposes the manhaj of the Salaf within them in terms of practice. So is there a binding link between the aqidah and manhaj of the Salaf in the practical implementation of the Salafi manhaj.</p>
<p><strong>He replied:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That which I believe and worship Allaah with is that there are both generalities (in similarity) and specific (aspects) between the Salafi manhaj and aqidah. Aqidah is more specific than manhaj as all of you know. Aqidah has a link with what is called &#8211; in the view of many of the Jurists &#8211; the &#8220;<em>knowledge of tawhid</em>&#8220;, and this is the chief and fundamental aspect of Islaam. However, manhaj is more vast than aqidah or tawhid. As for those who claim that the differentiation that has come in this question (between aqidah and manhaj), then they desire by this to make it permissible for themselves to adopt ways and means in their daw&#8217;ah to Islaam which the Salaf us-Salih were not upon. To say this in a different way, they consider that they have the liberty to adopt whatever ways and means they think will help them to convey (and actualise) Islaam, and you are aware of the examples of this type or these types of means.For example, open demonstrations and rallies in order to force the rulers to turn their attention to what the society complains about and similar matters. So we say that what has come in the Book and the Sunnah and what the Salaf us-Salih were upon with respect to objectives, goals and ways and means are sufficient for the Ummah. However, the reason which leads some of the people to permit themselves to adopt these ways and means, in fact it is correct for me to say that they permit themselves to blindly-follow the disbelievers in the ways that they have adopted in order to actualise what they call either democracy or social justice and other such words which have no reality to them. So they &#8211; I mean these Muslims &#8211; permit themselves to blindly follow the disbelievers in these ways and means.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We say, our Lord, the Mighty and Majestic has made removed us from having any need, by our Shari&#8217;ah, of this separation which has been explained (i.e. between aqidah and manhaj) and that we should be needy of the disbelievers and that we should take from their ways and means, which might be good for them, (but) only because they have no Shari&#8217;ah by which they guide themselves. It is for this reason that we say that manhaj is more vast than aqidah and tawhid, hence it is necessary to adhere to what the Salaf us-Salih were upon with respect to both these affairs; the one that is vast (manhaj) first and foremost and the one that is more narrow (tawhid), meaning aqidah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan ibn al-Fawzaan [1]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Source: <strong>Al-Istiqaamah Magazine</strong> Issue No.8 &#8211; Shawwal 1418H / February 1998</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[Q]: There are some people here, who keep away from [attending] lessons on &#8216;aqeedah (creed/beliefs), and they say: &#8216;We are Muslims, we are not unbelievers or idol-worshippers such that we have to learn &#8216;aqeedah or attend lectures about it&#8217; So, O noble Shaykh, what is your view regarding this!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: Teaching the Muslims [the correct] &#8216;aqeedah does not mean that we have judged them to be unbelievers. Rather, we teach the Muslims about &#8216;aqeedah in order for them to know about it thoroughly, and know what matters nullify it and what matters are contrary to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamaan, one of the distinguished Companions &#8211; radiallaahu &#8216;anhu &#8211; said:<em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;People used to ask the Messenger about the good, but I used to ask him about the evil, for fear of falling into it.&#8221;</span></em>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise &#8216;Umar ibn al-Khattaab radiallaahu &#8216;anhu said: <span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;Soon the bonds of Islaam will be loosened bit by bit, because people will enter into Islaam but will be unaware of Jaahiliyyah (ignorant practices that Islaam opposes).&#8221;</em></span>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, when we teach &#8216;aqeedoh, this does not imply that we have judged those whom we are teaching to be non-Muslims. Rather, what it means is that we desire that they should be thoroughly aware of the correct Islaamic &#8216;aqeedah; so as to cling to it, and to be aware of what opposes it; so as to keep far away from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said, whilst addressing His Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam: <span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;So have knowledge about Laa ilaaha illallaah (i.e, have knowledge that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah), and seek forgiveness for your sins, and for the believing men and women.&#8221;</em></span> [Soorah Muhammad 47:19].</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">So it is essential that a person learns and that he does not content himself with merely saying: &#8216;I am a Muslim.&#8217; Yes indeed, you are a Muslim &#8211; and all praise is for Allaah! However, if one of you were asked as to what Islaam means, or you were asked to explain what Islaam is, then many of you would not be able to correctly explain this. If one of you were to be asked to explain what are those factors which nullify Islaam, then many of you would not be able to explain this. Thus, if a person is ignorant [of such fundamentals], it is possible that he may fall into falsehood without realising it. If one of you were asked to explain the pillars of Islaam or eemaan (faith) that the Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam explained and taught, we would find that most people would be unable to do so. So how is it that a person [suffices with] saying: &#8216;l am a Muslim,&#8217; yet does not know these [basic] matters!</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unfortunately, many of the daa&#8217;ees (callers to Islaam) are themselves unaware of [basic matters such as] what are the conditions for Prayer, or unaware of the rules and regulations concerning wudhoo (ablution) and those matters which invalidate wudhoo. Some of them do not even know what matters form the arkaan (pillars) of the Prayer, or form its waajibaat (obligations), or those matters which invalidate the Prayer. So what Islaam are they calling to! Islaam is not merely a call, rather it is a reality to be learnt and practiced. So it is essential to acquire sound knowledge and understanding of the Religion. This is because a person who does not have sound knowledge, may fall into dangers without even realising it; just like a person who walks down a path, but is ignorant of the fact that along this path there is a ditch, or a hole, or even an ambush. Yet [due to his ignorance] he ends up falling into the hole, or the ambush, without even realising it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus it is essential to learn about tawheed, since it is tawheed that is the basic foundation [of both the Religion and the correct Islaamic &#8216;aqeedah]. Indeed, no one abstains from learning about tawheed [and those matters it necessitates, as well as its limits, conditions, fundamentals, clear proofs, fruits and consequences, and those matters which increase and strengthen it, and those that decrease and weaken it, etc.] except one of two people: [i] an ignorant person &#8211; and the ignorant person&#8217;s [view] is not to be given any weight; or [ii] a bigoted deviant &#8211; one who desires to avert people from the &#8216;aqeedah of pure tawheed, and who wishes to conceal from the people his own false beliefs, and those other deviant beliefs that are [falsely] ascribed to Islaam. And this is possibly the Ease of many of those who abstain from learning about tawheed. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: &#8220;And it is not proper for all the Believers to go out together and fight. From every troop of them only a party of them should go forth, so that those who remain behind may gain understanding of the Religion so that they may [instruct and] warn their people when they return to them, in order that they may beware.&#8221; [Soorah at-Tawbaa 9:122]. Also, the Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said: &#8220;Whoever Allaah desires to show goodness to, He gives him the understanding of the Religion.&#8221; [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of this hadeeth is that whenever Allaah does not want to show goodness to a person, He does not give him the understanding of the Religion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">So the one who says: &#8216;l do not need to learn &#8216;aqeedah.&#8217; It is as if he is saying: &#8216;l do not need to gain understanding of the Religion!&#8217; And this is said by either an ignorant person, or one who is misguided!</span></p>
