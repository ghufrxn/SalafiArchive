<p>1 . He should perform Ghusl in his house and remain in his normal clothing, or if he wishes, he may don the garments of Ihram.</p>
<p>2. Once the airplane is close to passing over the starting point, he should don the garments of Ihram, if he has not done so already.</p>
<p>3. When the airplane passes over the starting point, he should make the intention for commencing the rites and say the Talbiyyah according to his intention either Hajj or &#8216;Umrah.</p>
<p>4. If he assumes Ihram before passing over the starting point as a precaution, being fearful of remissness or forgetfulness, then there is no objection.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant you good. The questioner from Yemen, Hasan Saalih asks, &#8216;Regarding the day of &#8216;Eid, Eid al Fitr or &#8216;Eid al Adha, if it coincides with the day of al Jumu&#8217;ah, what are the legislative rulings concerning this?</p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Muhammad bin Saalih Al-‘Uthaymeen:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the &#8216;Eid coincides with al-Jumu&#8217;ah, whether it be &#8216;Eid al Fitr or Eid al Adha, then it is obligatory that the &#8216;Eid prayer is prayed and that Jumu&#8217;ah is prayed. Then it is said to whoever prayed &#8216;Eid prayer and was not the imam, if he wishes he may pray Jumu&#8217;ah or if he wishes he may pray Dhuhr in his home instead. This is the summary of the issue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah Issue Issue No.4 &#8211; Jumâdal-Awwal 1417H / November 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>CONCERNING MEN WEARING GOLD RINGS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q]: What is the ruling concerning a man wearing a gold ring, or what is known as a wedding-ring?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: Shaykh Ibn Baaz &#8211; <i>hafidhahullaah</i> &#8211; answered:<br />
&#8220;It is not permissible for a man to wear gold rings. neither before or after marriage. This is due to the fact that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> prohibited gold, as occurs in the authentic narrations. So once when the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam </i>saw a man wearing a gold ring, he took it from him, threw it down and said: <i>&#8220;Does a person pick up a burning piece of coal and hold it in his hand.&#8221;</i> This was related by Muslim in his <i>Saheeh</i> (6/149). So in this is a proof that it is absolutely <i>haraam</i> (prohibited) for men to wear gold rings, even if it is a wedding ring.&#8221;2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE RULING CONCERNING WISHING FOR DEATH DUE TO ENCOUNTERING MANY HARDSHIPS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q]: I have faced so many hardships in my life that it has made me hate this life. Every time I turned to Allaah and pleaded to Him to take my life at the earliest possible moment. This continues to be my wish up until now, as I do not see any solutions to my problems except death; it is the only thing that can save me from this torment. Is this behaviour <i>haraam</i> (forbidden) for me?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: Shaykh Ibn al-&#8216;Uthaymeen &#8211; <i>hafidhahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;When a person wishes for death due to the hardships and afflictions that have befallen him, then he is doing something that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> prohibited, when he said: <i>&#8220;None of you should wish for death due to some harm that has come to him, rather, if he has such a wish then let him say: O Allaah! Give me life if You know that life is better for me. And give me death if You know that death is better for me.&#8221;</i>3 Therefore, it is not allowed for anyone to wish for death on account of some harm, hardship or difficulty that has come to him. In fact, he should have <i>sabr</i> (patience) and expect a reward from Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; due to his being patient, and he should wait for relief to come to him; just as the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;And know that victory comes with patience, relief with distress, and ease with hardship.&#8221;</i>4 So the one who is afflicted with any affliction should know that those afflictions are an expiation for some of the sins he has committed. Indeed, no Believer is afflicted with any kind of grief, pain or suffering except that Allaah expiates &#8211; due to that &#8211; some of his sins; even if it be the harm caused by a mere pricking of a thorn. So when a person has patience and hopes in a reward from Allaah, he reaches the level of being amongst the <i>saabiroon</i> (those who truly have patience), and this is a very lofty level. Allaah &#8211; the Most High said about its people:<b> &#8220;And give glad tidings to the apatient ones; those who, when afflicted by a calamity, say: Indeed we belong to Allaah, and to Him shall we truly return.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:155-156].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The woman in the question feels that there is no solution for her problems except death. I believe that this is a mistaken view.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Death does not solve any problems. In fact, sometimes it only increases the difficulties. How many people die whilst being afflicted with calamities, difficulties and suffering, but they had been wronging themselves by sinning, and did not give up their sins or repent to Allaah. So death, in this case, is just a quicker coming of punishment. Perhaps if such a person had remained alive, then Allaah would have guided him him to the doors of repentance, seeking forgiveness, patience, facing up to the problems and expecting relief. All of this would have been good for him. Therefore, it is upon you &#8211; the questioner &#8211; to be patient and expect relief from Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; just as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said in His Book:<b> &#8220;So indeed with hardship here is relief. Indeed with hardship there is relief.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Inshiraah 94:5-6]. And the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said in the authentic narration: <i>&#8220;Victory comes with patience; relief with affliction, and ease with hardship.&#8221;</i>5&#8243;6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>FORCING A YOUNG LADY TO MARRY A MAN THAT SHE DOES NOT WANT TO MARRY</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q]: Is it allowed for a father to force his daughter to marry a particular man that she does not want to marry?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: Shaykh Ibn Baaz &#8211; <i>hafidhahullaah</i> &#8211; responded by saying:<br />
&#8220;Neither the father, or anyone other than the father, may force a woman who is under his guardianship to marry a man that she does not wish to marry. In fact her permission must be sought first. Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;A previously married women (without a husband) must not be married until she is consulted, and a virgin is not married until her permission is sought.&#8221;</i> They said: O Messenger of Allaah, how is her permission sought? So he said: <i>&#8220;By her being silent.&#8221;</i>7 Another narration states: <i>&#8220;Her silence is her permission.&#8221;</i>8 Yet a third narration states: <i>&#8220;A virgin&#8217;s father seeks her permission, and her permission is her remaining silent.&#8221;</i>9 So the father must seek her permission if she is nine years of age or above. Likewise, her other guardians may not marry her off except by her permission. This is obligatory upon them all. If a lady is married without her permission, then the marriage will not be correct. This is because one of the conditions of a marriage contract is that both partners accept the marriage freely. So if she is married without her permission, by threat or coercion, then the marriage is null and void&#8230; If the (apparent) husband knows that she does not want him, then he should not approach the woman, even if the father approves of it. He must fear Allaah and not approach any wife that does not want him, even if the father claims that he did not coerce her. The man must avoid what Allaah has forbidden him. This is because Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> ordered that her permission be sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also advise the woman to fear Allaah and to accept the man if her father finds that he suitable to marry her, as long as the prospective groom is good in his Religion and in his character. This is also the case if the one who is the guardian is not the girl&#8217;s father. We give this advice because there is a lot of good and a lot of benefit in marriage. Likewise, there are a lot of hazards in living as a maiden. So I advise all young ladies to accept those men who come to them for marriage, if they conform to the compatibility factors of marriage (i.e. good in Religion and character), they should not use studying, teaching, or anything else, as an excuse to get married.&#8221;10</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>A RELIGIOUS YOUNG MAN PROPOSED TO ME BUT MY MOTHER REFUSED</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q]: I am seeking a solution to my problem. I am twenty-four years old. A young man proposed to me. He has finished college and is from a religious family. After my father agreed to him, he asked me to come and see him. I saw him and was pleased with him. [we saw each other] because our pure and noble Religion states that I should see him and that he should see me. However, when my mother came to realise that he was from a Religious family, she became harsh against him and my father. She swore that she would not allow such a marriage to take place. My father desperately tried to persuade her, but to no avail. Do I have the right to seek the [Islaamic] Law to intervene in this matter?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: Shaykh Ibn Baaz &#8211; <i>hafidhahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;If the matter is as you have stated in your question, then your mother has no right to object, to this matter Indeed it is actually <i>haraam</i> (forbidden) for her to object in this case. You are not obliged to obey your mother in this particular issue, since the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Indeed obedience is only in ma&#8217;roof (when it is good and right).&#8221;</i>11 And it is not from <i>ma&#8217;roof</i> to reject a suitable marriage proposal. In fact, it has been narrated from the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> that he said: <i>&#8220;lf there comes to you a person whose Religion and character are pleasing to you, then marry him (i.e. give the girl in marriage to him). If you do not do this, there will be Fitnah (trial and discord) and great fasad (corruption) upon the earth.&#8221;12 If you have need to take your case to an [Islaamic] court of law, then you would not be wrong in doing so.&#8221;</i>13</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah Issue No.7 &#8211; Rabî&#8217; ul-Awwal 1418H / July 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>IS CLINGING TO THE RELIGION A CAUSE OF AFFLICTION?</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: There was a person in our city who was very firm in practicing the Religion, and was later afflicted with an illness. Some of the people started saying to him that the cause of him being afflicted with this illness is because of his adhering to the Religion. Being affected with this type of talk, the person then shaved off his beard and he neglected his Prayers. So is it permissible to say that the cause of his affliction was due to him clinging to the commandments of the Religion? And the one who says such a thing, is he considered a <i>kaafir</i> (disbeliever) because of such a saying?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: &#8221;Clinging on to the Religion is not a cause for his illness. Rather, it is a cause for every good, both in this life and in the Hereafter. And it is not permissible for any Muslim, that when some foolish and ignorant people utter words such as this, to give them any weight. Nor is it permissible to shave one&#8217;s beard or shorten it, or to neglect guarding the five obligatory Prayers in congregation. Rather, it is obligatory for such a person to remain steadfast upon the truth, and to keep away from all that Allaah has prohibited, and to beware of all that which angers Allaah and incurs His punishment &#8211; by obeying Allaah and His Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects said: <b>&#8220;Whosoever obeys Allaah and His Messenger will be admitted into Gardens of Paradise, beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever. That will be the greatest achievement. But whosoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger and oversteps His limits, Allaah will cast him in the Fire, to abide therein; and he shall have a humiliating punishment.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:13-14]. And Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Whosoever has taqwaa (piety, fear and obedience) of Allaah, He will make a way out for him. And He will provide for him from places he could never imagine.&#8221;</b> [Soorah at-Talaaq 65:2-3]. And He &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Whosoever has taqwaa of Allaah, He will make his affair easy for him,&#8221; </b>[Soorah at-Talaaq 65:4]. And the verses with this meaning are plentiful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the person who says that the cause for such affliction is due to being firm and steadfast upon the Religion &#8211; then such a person is ignorant. It is obligatory to censure such a person and to know that clinging to the Religion does not bring about anything except good. As for what occurs to a Muslim by way of a calamity that he dislikes, then this is a form of expiating his evil actions and a forgiveness for his sins. As regards to the issue of <i>takfeer</i> (declaring a Muslim to be a <i>kaafir</i>, a disbeliever) upon this person, then this requires detail, and is known from the chapters concerning the judgement upon a <i>murtad</i> (apostate) &#8211; which can be found in the books of Islaamic jurisprudence and understanding. And with Allaah is the power and ability.&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>CRYING DUE TO ILLNESS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: I am ill and I sometimes cry because of what happens to me after my illness. Is this considered an action which opposes Allaah and of not being pleased with what He has decreed? I do not do this action willfully. Likewise, does that ruling also include talking to my relatives about my illness?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: &#8220;There is no harm in crying, if it is simply tears coming from the eyes, without wailing. This is based upon the statement of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, when his son Ibraaheem passed away: <i>&#8220;The eye sheds tears and the heart grieves, yet we do not say anything except what is pleasing to our Lord. By your death &#8211; O Ibraaheem &#8211; we are indeed in grief.&#8221;</i>2 The <i>ahaadeeth</i> with this meaning are numerous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also no harm in you speaking about your illness to your relatives and friends, providing that you praise and thank Allaah, glorify Him and ask Him for sound health, following the permissible means. We advise you to patiently persevere and to hope in a reward from Allaah. I give you the glad tidings, as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; has said: <b>&#8220;Only those who are patient shall recieve their reward in full, without reckoning.&#8221;</b> [Soorah az-Zumar 39:10]. The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> also said: <i>&#8220;A Muslim is not afflicted with fatigue, sorrow, disease or pain &#8211; even if it be the pricking of a thorn &#8211; except that due to it, Allaah will expiate some of his sins.&#8221;</i>3 Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> also said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever Allaah intends good for, He afflicts him with some calamity.&#8221;</i>4 So we ask Allaah to grant you a cure and sound health, as well as goodness of the heart and actions. Indeed He is the One who hears and the One who responds.&#8221;5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>SAFEGUARDING THE PRAYERS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: A leaflet was sent to us and with it was a copy of a page which has been distributed amongst the people, and which included a hadeeth attributed to the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> which said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever misses the Prayer due to laziness, then Allaah will punish him with fifteen punishments &#8230;&#8221;</i> So what is the authenticity of this particular hadeeth?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: &#8220;This hadeeth is a lie upon the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and there is no basis at all for it being authentic &#8211; as has been explained by al-Haafidh adh-Dhahabee, <i>rahimahullaah</i>, in <i>al-Meezaan</i> and al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr in <i>Lisaanul-Meezaan</i>. So it is a must that whosoever comes across such a leaflet that he burns it and that he admonishes the one who produced it, in order to defend the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and to protect his Sunnah from the lies of the liars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what has been Recorded in the great Qur&#8217;aan and the authentic Sunnah of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> -with regards to the importance of the Prayer and warning against being lazy in performing it and a threat for whosoever does this &#8211; is more than sufficient against the lies of the liars. So Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Guard strictly your five daily Prayers and in particular the middle Prayer (i.e. the &#8216;Asr Prayer), and stand before Allaah with obedience.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:238]. And Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: &#8220;And then there came after them a people who gave up their Prayer and followed their lusts. So they will be thrown into the Hellfire.&#8221; [Soorah Maryam 19:59]. And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;So woe be upon those who pray; those who delay their Prayer from the fixed stated times.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;oon 107:3-4]. And the verses with this meaning are plentiful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;The covenant between us and them is the Salaah (Prayer), so whosoever abandons it has committed an act of disbelief.&#8221;</i> Recorded by Imaam Ahmad and the compilers of the four Sunan with a Saheeh (authentic) <i>isnaad</i> (chain of narration).6 And also his <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s</i> saying: <i>&#8220;Between a person and between al-Kufr (disbelief) and ash-Shirk (associating partners with Allaah in the worship of Allaah) is abandoning the Salaah (Prayer).&#8221; </i>Recorded by Muslim in his Saheeh (1/62). Also the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> mentions the Salaah (Prayer) to his Companions one day, saying: <i>&#8220;Whosoever safeguards them, then that will be a light, a proof and a means of salvation for him on the Day of Resurrection. But whosoever does not safeguard them, then he has no light, nor proof nor salvation and on the Day of Resurrection he will be gathered along with Fir&#8217;awn, Haamaan, Qaaroon and &#8216;Ubayy ibn Khalf.&#8221;</i> Recorded by Imaam Ahmad with a <i>Hasan isnaad</i>.7</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the Scholars have said, in explanation to the above hadeeth, that whosoever leaves the Prayer, the he will be raised up, on the Day of Judgement, along with those <i>kaafirs</i> (disbelievers). Thus, if the reason for his leaving the Prayer was due to leadership, then he has resembled Fir&#8217;awn in this, and would be raised along with him and sent to the Fire of the Day of Resurrection. If the reason for leaving the Prayer was due to his ministerial post or a similar occupation, then he has resembled Haamaan, the minister to Fir&#8217;awn, and he will be raised along with him on the Day of Resurrection and sent to the Fire. If the reason for leaving the Prayer was due to wealth and false desires, then he has resembled Qaaroon &#8211; upon whom Allaah bestowed great wealth, yet he became arrogant against the truth and followed his false desires, due to this wealth &#8211; and would be raised up along with him on the Day of Resurrection and sent to the Fire. If the reason for leaving the Prayer was business, or other such social transactions and work, then he has resembled &#8216;Ubayy ibn Khalf, the famous trader from the disbelievers of Makkah &#8211; so he will be raised up along with him on the Day of Resurrection and sent to the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah for forgiveness and protection from their condition and the likes of their condition.&#8221;8</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>PRAYING DURING THE FRIDAY SERMON</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: There was a discussion that took place between some brothers and myself regarding praying two rak&#8217;ahs upon entering the mosque and the Imaam is delivering the Friday <i>khutbah</i> (sermon). I ask you &#8211; O noble Shaykh &#8211; to give us a ruling concerning this. Is it allowed or not? The brothers who generally come and pray in the mosque are upon the <i>madhhab</i> of Imaam Maalik.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: &#8220;The Sunnah upon entering the masjid (mosque) is to pray two <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> of <i>tahyatul masjid </i>(a Prayer far greeting the mosque), even if the Imaam is delivering the Friday khutbah, due to the sayings of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>: <i>&#8220;When anyone of you enters the masjid, then let him not sit until he prays two rak&#8217;ahs.&#8221;</i> Recorded by al-Bukhaaree (1/293) and Muslim (2/155). Likewise Muslim relates in his Saheeh (3/1415), from Jaabir <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i>, that the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;When any of you comes on the day of Jumu&#8217;ah (Friday), and the Imaam is delivering the khutbah, then let him pray two rak&#8217;ahs and let him make them short.&#8221;</i> So this is a clear and authentic text concerning this issue. It is not permissible for anyone to oppose it. So perhaps this particular narration did not reach Imaam Maalik <i>rahimahullaah</i>, if it is established from him that he prohibited the praying of these two rak&#8217;ahs at the time of the khutbah. However, when the authentic Sunnah becomes clear, then it is not permissible to oppose it with the saying of anyone else &#8211; whosoever he may be.9 About this Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;O you who Believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger and those in authority amongst you. And if you differ in anything amongst yourselves then refer it to Allaah and His Messenger if you do believe in Allaah and the Last Day. That is better and most suitable for final determination.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:59]. And He &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And in whatever you differ, then the judgement belongs to Allaah,&#8221;</b> [Soorah ash-Shooraa 42:10]. And it is known that the judgement of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> is from the judgement of Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; as Allaah said: <b>&#8220;Whosoever obeys the Messenger, has indeed obeyed Allaah.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:80]. And with Allaah rests the power and ability.&#8221;10</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>BEING TOO SHY TO CENSURE EVIL</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: I am a young woman who hates <i>gheebah</i> (backbiting) and <i>nameemah</i> (tale carrying). Sometimes I am amongst a group of people who speak about others and the begin to backbite and spread tales. In my soul, I hate and despise what they are doing, but I am too shy and therefore do not have the ability to make them stop. Also, I have no other place to go to get away from them. Allaah knows that I wish they would start talking about something else. So am I sinful in sitting with them, and what is the obligation upon me in this case? May Allaah grant you what is best for Islaam and the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: &#8220;In this case you are sinful, unless you repel the evil. If they accept that from you, then all praises are due to Allaah. If they do not accept that from you, then you must leave them and not sit with them. This is because Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; stated: <b>&#8220;When you see those engaged in false conversation about Our Verses, by mocking at them, then keep away from them until they turn to another topic.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:68]. Likewise, the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever sees an evil then let him change it by his hand. if he is unable to do this, then let him change it with his tongue. If he is unable to do this, then let him change it with his heart &#8211; and that is the weakest of eemaan (faith).&#8221;</i> This was Recorded by Muslim in his Saheeh (no.49). And the verses and narrations with this meaning are plentiful.&#8221;11</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>RUNNING AWAY FROM THE QUR&#8217;AAN</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q]: What is your advice &#8211; O Shaykh &#8211; for those who go without reading the Qur&#8217;aan for a month, or even many months, and who have no excuse for such behaviors? However, you will find some of them reading those magazines that contain no benefit for them, and following them up closely!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: &#8220;It is recommended for every Believing man and woman to recite the Book of Allaah often, with due contemplation and understanding. This may be done by using a copy of the Qur&#8217;aan or from one&#8217;s memory. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;This is a Book which We have sent down to you, full of blessings, that you may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may remember.&#8221; </b>[Soorah Saad 38:29].And:<b> &#8220;Indeed those who recite the Book of Allaah and offer the Prayer perfectly and spend in charity out of what We have provided for them &#8211; secretly and openly &#8211; hope for a sure trade-gain that will never perish. That He may pay them their wages in full and give them even more out of His Grace. Indeed, He is Oft-Forgiving, ready to appreciate good deeds.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Faatir 35:29-30].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The aforementioned recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan includes both reciting and acting upon it. The recitation is to be done with contemplation and understanding of it. Sincerity to Allaah is a means of complying with and acting upon the Qur&#8217;aan, and its recitation contains a great reward &#8211; as the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Recite the Qur&#8217;aan. For on the Day of Resurrection, it shall come as an intercessor for its companion.&#8221;</i> This was recorded by Muslim in his Saheeh (no.804). The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> also said: &#8220;The best of you is he who learns the Qur&#8217;aan and teaches it.&#8221; This was Recorded by al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh (3/66). Another narration states: <i>&#8220;Whosoever reads one harf (letter) of the Qur&#8217;aan shall receive a good deed and ten good deeds similar to it. I do not say that Alif Laam Meem is a harf but Alif is a harf and Laam is a harf and Meem is a harf.&#8221;</i>12 The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said to &#8216;Abdullaah ibn &#8220;Amr ibn al-&#8216;Aas: <i>&#8220;Complete the recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan once a month.&#8221;</i> He said: I am able to do more than that. So he said: <i>&#8220;Then complete its recital once in seven days.&#8221;</i>13 The Companions used to complete the entire Qur&#8217;aan once every seven days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I advise all the readers of the Qur&#8217;aan to increase in their reading of it, with contemplation and understanding it, along with sincerity to Allaah in this &#8211; with the purpose of learning and benefiting from the Qur&#8217;aan. They should read the entire Qur&#8217;aan once a month. If, however, they are able to do more than this without any difficulty, then they should complete it in less than this time. However, it is best not to complete it in less than three days, since this is the least amount of time that the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> mentioned to &#8216;Abdullaah ibn &#8216;Amr ibn al-&#8216;Aas. This is because if it is read in less than three days, the person becomes hasty and lacks thought and concentration &#8230;&#8221;14</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Shaikh Saalih Al-Fawzaan<br />
SOURCE: The end of his treatise &#8220;Tadabbur al-Qur&#8217;aan&#8221;<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are some questions and answers related the subject of this lecture, which we wanted to include here in order to complete the benefit:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>[1] Question:</b> It has been mentioned in a hadeeth that the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“The sins of my ummah were displayed before me, and so I didn’t see anything worse than that (sin) of a man who memorized a verse (from the Qur’aan) then forgot it.”</b> What does this hadeeth mean?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[1] Answer:</b>I am not aware of this hadeeth nor did I come across it in my research. However, I will note that forgetfulness is of two types: The first type is when forgetfulness occurs due to someone becoming confused and distracted or due to some sickness that has stricken him. In this case, he will not be held accountable for his forgetfulness. The second type is if the forgetfulness occurs due to him turning away from reciting the Book of Allaah. In this case, the person will be held accountable for his action, since he forgot it due to negligence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>[2] Question: </b>Noble Shaikh, I try to read the Noble Qur’aan and I love the Book of Allaah greatly. However, the matter becomes difficult for me and I am not able to complete my recitation. What is the solution to this problem?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[2] Answer: </b>The solution can be found in that which Allaah has instructed when He said: <b>“So when you recite the Qur’aan, seek refuge in Allaah from the outcast Devil. Verily, he has no power over those who believe and put their trust in their Lord (Allaah). His power is only over those who obey and follow him and those who associate partners in worship with Him (i.e. Allaah).”</b> [Surah An-Nahl: 98-100]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has instructed us to seek refuge in Him from the outcast Devil before reciting the Qur’aan. This is so that Allaah can remove and distance this enemy from us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And you must also always reflect on the Qur’aan, since reflecting on it is one of the things that will cause you to be conscious about it and incite you towards the noble Qur’aan. All of your longing should not be geared towards just completing a surah or finishing up a juz and so on. Rather, your objective in reciting the Qur’aan should be to reflect and ponder upon the meaning of what you recite from the verses of Allaah. The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) would prolong his recitation during the Night Prayer, and he would not pass upon a verse related to Allaah’s Mercy except that he would stop and ask Allaah (for Mercy), nor would he pass upon a verse in which (Allaah’s) punishment was mentioned except that he would stop and seek refuge in Allaah (from that). All of this shows that he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) would recite the Qur’aan whilst reflecting on it and having a conscious and attentive heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>[3] Question: </b>What is your advice to the youth concerning the simplest way to memorize the Book of Allaah?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[3] Answer: </b>The Qur’aan is simple and easy to memorize. Allaah says: <b>“And We have indeed made the Qur’aan easy to understand and remember, so is there anyone who will remember it?”</b> [Surah Al-Qamar: 17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The problem lies in a person’s determination and the truthfulness of his intention. So if a person has true determination and a strong interest in the Qur’aan, Allaah will facilitate and make easy his memorization of it. There are also some other things one could do to help in memorizing the Qur’aan such as allotting a specific suitable time every day for attending classes with one who teaches the Qur’aan in the masjid. All praise be to Allaah, the teachers today are many. You will not find a neighborhood except that amongst them there lives one who teaches the Qur’aan. This is a great opportunity that didn’t exist in previous times. So a person should choose anyone of the many gatherings or anyone of the many teachers present today and constantly attend these gatherings/sittings with a teacher daily until he completes the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should also constantly repeat over and over again what you recite, until it becomes firmly established in your heart and mind. You must also act upon (what you learn from) the Book of Allaah, for that is the greatest means of learning the Qur’aan. Allaah says: <b>“So be dutiful to Allaah and Allaah will teach you. And Allaah is the All-Knower of everything.” </b>[Surah Al-Baqarah: 282]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>[4] Question:</b> Noble Shaikh, there are many books of tafseer, so which tafseer do you advise (us) to read. May Allaah reward you well.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[4] Answer: </b>The books of Tafseer are many, all praise be to Allaah. This is from the blessings of Allaah. However, these books of Tafseer vary – amongst them are those that are long and in depth and those that are short and abridged, as well as those that are free from errors and those that contain errors, particularly in matters of Creed. What I advise my brothers from amongst the youth to read is the Tafseer of Ibn Katheer for it is the greatest of tafseers and the one that uses the best way and method (for interpreting the Qur’aan) in spite of it being abridged. This is since he (i.e. Ibn Katheer) has interpreted the Qur’aan using the Qur’aan first, then by using the Prophetic Sunnah, then with the statements of the Salaf, and finally by using the requisites of Arabic, the language in which it was revealed. So it is a precise and reliable tafseer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also the tafseer of Al-Baghawee and the tafseer of Ibn Jareer At-Tabaree, which is a comprehensive and all-inclusive tafseer. These tafseer books are trustworthy. There is also the tafseer of Shaikh ‘Abdur-Rahmaan As-Sa’adee, which is an excellent tafseer using simple expressions which contain tremendous knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the remaining tafseer books, they are good in some aspects, however they have errors in them, especially in matters of Creed. It is not proper for anyone to read these types of tafseer books except for the person that is proficient in knowledge to the point that he is able to take the good from it and avoid its errors. But as for the beginner, he is not able to do this, so he must take from the tafseer books that do not contain dangers and errors, such as the Tafseer of Ibn Katheer, the Tafseer of Al-Baghawee and the Tafseer of Al-Haafidh Ibn Jareer. All of these books of tafseer are valuable and excellent, all praise be to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>[5] Question: </b>What are the most important lessons that a student of knowledge should begin with, and what advice do you give him? Also, what do you say concerning someone that makes excuses for himself from studying when we desire to take him to attend lessons and lectures?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[5] Answer: </b>The student of knowledge (in Riyadh) must enroll himself in one of the educational institutes under the Imaam Muhammad bin Su’ood Islamic University for they have excellent curriculums that are arranged according to the levels of the students – step by step – the first year, then the second year, then the third and the fourth. There is a curriculum for each year, which differs from the curriculum of the previous year and they progress in levels after each year. These are curriculums that have been chosen by our scholars and teachers who did well in establishing these institutes and selecting syllabuses for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I advise the student of knowledge to enroll in one of these institutes, however he is able to do that. Thereafter, he should register with one of the collegiate faculties of the University, such as the faculty of Sharee’ah, the faculty of Usool-ud-Deen, the faculty of Hadeeth and its Sciences, the faculty of the Arabic Language and so on. If the student of knowledge is not able to enroll in one of these institutes and collegiate faculties, he should try to make time to sit in the classes of the scholars who teach in the masaajid. And they, all praise be to Allaah, are many and the classes they give cover a wide range of Islamic sciences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I advise the student of knowledge to firmly adhere to these classes, whether those given in the University or those held in the masaajid. So it is not enough for him that he attend classes one week then is absent from them for several weeks afterward or that he attend one month, then is absent for several months. This person will not benefit at all. This is since if he misses out on receiving some of the knowledge, there will remain a void in his mind and comprehension and he will miss out on much good. So the student of knowledge must have diligence, a strong interest and eagerness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>[6] Question: </b>Noble Shaikh, what is your opinion concerning what some people do today in that when the Imaam passes by a verse related to (Allaah&#8217;s) punishment during prayer, they seek refuge in Allaah (out loud) even though they are praying, and when he passes by a verse related to (Allaah&#8217;s) Mercy, they supplicate to Allaah. What is the ruling on this? May Allaah reward you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[6] Answer: </b>there is no doubt that this is something prescribed in the supererogatory prayers since the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) would do it in the recommended prayers. As for the obligatory prayers, then I hold that is not legislated to do this since the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) would not do this in the obligatory prayers. Rather, he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) would only do this in the recommended prayers. So the one following in prayer should remain silent for the Qur&#8217;aan during prayer and not say anything at all. Allaah says: <b>“And when the Qur&#8217;aan is recited, then listen to it and be silent in order that you may gain mercy.”</b> [Surah Al-A&#8217;raaf: 204]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad, may Allaah be pleased with him, said: “This ayah was revealed concerning the prayer” &#8211; meaning: The reason it was revealed was with regard to the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the one following in prayer should listen to the recitation of his Imaam during the obligatory prayer and not supplicate (to Allaah) upon hearing a verse related to Mercy or seek refuge in Allaah (by saying &#8216;Audhu billaah) upon hearing a verse related to punishment. This only applies to the recommended prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>[7] Question: </b>Noble Shaikh, there is an Imaam in one of the masaajid in Riyadh that has a beautiful and pleasant voice when reciting the Qur’aan. This is such that people have begun to go pray with him in large amounts from remote areas, leaving off the masaajid in their vicinities. They do this during the prayers in which the Qur’aan is recited out loud and especially during the nights of Ramadaan for Taraaweeh. Is this permissible? Please benefit us, may Allaah reward you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[7] Answer: </b>Yes, this is a phenomenon that exists today, and it is that many people gather together in one of the masaajid, coming from distant areas, just for this masjid. This is something that is not encouraged, and I don’t consider it to be a good practice, since it is better to pray in and frequent the masjid that is in the vicinity of your home. The reason for this is because there is less of a burden in doing this and also because it is less likely that one will do this for showing off or to be seen by the people. Furthermore, there may occur personal differences and division between the Imaam of the abandoned masjid and his former congregation who no longer pray with him. If the people abandon their masaajid and instead go to pray in specified masaajid, the other masaajid will become inactive and close down. So I don’t approve of this. It is better for the residents of an area to pray in the masjid of that area.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Secondly, if too many people accumulate in one masjid, this may lead to people praying in the streets. And praying in the streets is not permissible except in cases of emergency, such as during the ‘Eid prayer or the Jumu’ah prayer, for in these occasions, the masjid becomes constricted and it is permissible to pray in the streets in these situations – when the masjid is overcrowded, since this is not done in other than these occasions. So if the result of too many people gathering in one of the masaajid is that the people will end up praying in the streets, on occasions other than the Jumu’ah prayer, then this is not permissible because praying in the streets is only allowed in cases of emergency.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>[8] Question: </b>Noble Shaikh, what is the ruling on one who recites the Qur’aan whilst not having wudoo, regardless of whether he recites from memory or from the <i>mus-haf?</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[8] Answer: </b>It is permissible for a person to recite the Qur’aan without having wudoo if he recites from his memory. This is since nothing prevented the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) from reciting the Qur’aan except for <i>Janaabah</i> (sexual impurity). He (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) would recite the Qur’aan whilst in a state of wudoo and without it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <i>mus-haf</i>, it is not permissible for someone who has broken his wudoo to touch it, regardless of whether it is the minor form of impurity or the major form. Allaah says: <b>“No one touches it except for the pure.”</b> [Surah Al-Waaqi’ah: 79] This means: “Those who are pure and free from impurities, uncleanness and Shirk.” Also in the hadeeth, the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) wrote a letter to his vice-regent ‘Amr bin Hazm in which he instructed him: <b>“No one should touch the mus-haf except for the purified.” </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is also the view that has been unanimously agreed upon by the four Imaams – that it is not permissible for one in the state of impurity – whether major or minor state – to touch the <i>mus-haf</i>except from behind a covering, such as when the <i>mus-haf</i> is in a box or a bag or if one touches it using one’s garment or sleeve as a barrier.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>[9] Question: </b>What is your opinion concerning someone who preoccupies himself with the significant affairs of the Muslims, such as Calling to Allaah and raising the youth upon the noble Qur’aan and the purified Sunnah, but does not find time to memorize the Qur’aan? What is your advice to these kinds of people?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[9] Answer: </b>It is obligatory upon the Caller to first become qualified before he sets out on Da’wah (Calling), by way of studying the noble Qur’aan, its meanings and interpretation, and by way of studying the prophetic Sunnah, as much as he is able to, reading its explanation and learning the religious laws. So it is obligatory upon the Caller to Allaah to be qualified. No one is fit for Da’wah (Calling) except for he who has knowledge. Allaah says: <b>“Say: This is my path, I call to it upon clear insight – I and those who follow me.”</b> [Surah Yoosuf: 108]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“Clear insight”</b> here refers to knowledge and wisdom. Allaah says: <b>“Call to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good admonition.”</b> [Surah An-Nahl: 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, an ignorant person is not fit to carry out the Da’wah since perhaps he might mess up the Da’wah by making lawful the forbidden or making unlawful the permitted. Or he may be severe on a matter that does not require that harshness be applied and so on. So there must be conditions for the Caller, amongst which the most fundamental of these conditions is that he acquires knowledge by which he can call the people to the Religion of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, perhaps doubt-raising arguments may be presented to the Caller for which he will need to provide answers. So if he is ignorant, how can he respond to these doubts?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can he reply to the objections of his opponents? How can he confront the deviants, sinners and confused individuals? If he doesn’t have knowledge, he will indeed face defeat in front of them. So the Caller must have knowledge of the Qur’aan, the prophetic Sunnah, the Hadeeth, Fiqh (Jurisprudence), ‘Aqeedah (Creed) and all of the other Islamic sciences.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Answered by the Noble Scholar and Muftee<br />
Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez bin &#8216;Abdullaah bin Baaz [1]<br />
Al-Istiqaamah Issue Issue No.2 &#8211; Safar 1417H / July 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>INCREASING EEMAAN (FAITH)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[Q]</i></b>: <span style="color:#ff0000;"><i>Firstly</i></span>: I begin my question by seeking your advice that I may benefit from you with regards to how I may increase my <i> eemaan</i> (faith)?<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000;"><i>Secondly</i></span>: I wish to learn about the religion, however Islaamic books are very rare in my country (Algeria), except some books which are with some brothers &#8211; may Allaah reward them with goodness.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000;"><i>Thirdly</i></span>: I work as a builder and the people that I work with do not really have sound faith and their speech is nothing more than gossip and obscenities.<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000;"><i>Fourthly</i></span>: I keep company with a brother whose beliefs are corrupt and who constantly speaks ill of the righteous and believing brothers and I feel very distraught about this. So I hope that you will direct me to a cure for this disease.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[A]</i></b>: <span style="color:#993300;"><strong><i>Firstly</i></strong></span>: We advise you to recite the Qur&#8217;aan frequently and that you increase in your hearing of it and in your recitation of it. Reflect and consider its meaning to the best of your ability and what you do not understand of it, then ask the people of knowledge of your country about it, or write to those outside of your country from the Scholars of Sunnah (Prophetic guidance).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also advise you to increase in the <i> dhikr</i> (remembrance) of Allaah with such remembrances and supplications that are authentically related, such as saying <i>laa ilahaa ilallaah</i> (that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah), or saying <i>subhaanallaah</i> <i>wal-hamdulillaah wa laa ilaha ilallaahu wallaahu akbar</i> (declaring Allaah free from all imperfections, praising Him and declaring that none has the right to be worshipped except Him and that He is greater), and their like. For this purpose, we urge you to refer to books such as al <i>Kalimut-Tayyib</i> of Ibn Taymiyyah, al <i>Waabilus-Sayyib</i> of Ibn al-Qayyim, <i>Riyaadhus-Saaliheen</i> and <i> al-Adhkaar</i> both by Imaam an-Nawawee, and their like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because the remembrance of Allaah increases <i> eemaan</i> (faith) and causes hearts to attain tranquility, as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;Indeed in the remembrance of Allaah do hearts find tranquility.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ar-Ra&#8217;dd 13:28].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also preserve your five daily Prayers, your Fasting and the rest of your obligations &#8211; along with hoping in Allaah&#8217;s mercy and forgiveness and relying upon Him in all your affairs. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;The Believers ate only those who, when Allaah is mentioned, feel a fear in the hearts, and when His Verses are recited to them, it increases their <i>eemaan</i> (faith), and they put their trust and rely upon Allaah alone. They are those who perform the Prayer and spend out of that which We have given them, they are Believers in truth. For them ate grades of dignity and nobility with their Lord, and also forgiveness and generous provisions.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Anfaal 8:2-4].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><i>Secondly</i></strong></span>: Islaamic books are easily found in every Muslim country, especially in public libraries and bookshops. So the one who seeks after them will find them. We advise you to refer to the people of knowledge of the <i> Sharee&#8217;ah</i> (Prescribed Law of Allaah) so that they may direct you to suitable books for you to read, borrow or buy. If there are any problems regarding this, then it is not fitting for us to stop answering your questions from the Pure Revelation &#8211; and We ask Allaah that He makes us firm in that, and only His help is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;"><i>Thirdly</i>, <i>Fourthly</i>:</span> </strong>It is upon you to keep good company and to sit in righteous gatherings in order to benefit from them and their manners and their knowledge and that they may assist you in cultivating obedience to Allaah. So be careful and beware of bad companionship, and evil gathering. Beware, so that they may not influence you, adversely affecting your morals and manners, such that you fall into ill-repute, or that they weaken your resolve and determination in fulfilling your religious obligations and the obligations to your family. Indeed, the Prophet <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> advised the Ummah to sit in good gatherings, and he warned them from the evil and foul gatherings, and he gave a noble example about this, when he said: <i>&#8220;The example of a good companion and a bad companion is like that of a seller of musk, and the one who blows the blacksmith&#8217;s bellows. As for the seller of musk then either he will grant you some, or you buy some from him, or at the very least you enjoy a pleasant smell from him. As for the one who blows the blacksmith&#8217;s bellows, then either he will burn your clothes, or you will get an offensive smell from him.&#8221;</i> This was related by al-Bukhaaree (4/323), from Abu Moosaa al-Ash&#8217;aree <i> radiallaahu &#8216;anhu.</i> 1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>CONCERNING A WOMAN&#8217;S <i>MAHR</i> (DOWRY)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[Q]</i></b>: I and many others have observed that many people are very excessive when it comes to the matter of the <i> mahr</i> (wedding dowry that is paid to the bride), and that they seek great amounts of <i> mahr</i> when it comes to the marriage of their daughters, and they stipulate as a condition the giving of other gifts to them, along with the <i> mahr</i>. This wealth that people demand in such cases, is it <i> halaal</i> (lawful) or <i> haraam</i> (unlawful)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: What is prescribed in the <i> Sharee&#8217;ah</i> is that the <i> mahr</i> should be a small amount and that people should not compete with each other in this regard, acting in accordance with the many <i> ahaadeeth</i> which are related about this. They should also help facilitate marriages and be keen in preserving the modesty and decency of the young Muslim men and women. And it is not permissible for the <i>awliyaa</i> (guardians of the brides-to-be) to demand and stipulate gifts for themselves, since they have no right at all in this matter. Rather the right belongs to the woman, and in some particular cases to the father. He may stipulate a condition as long as it does not harm the daughter, nor lead to the delaying of the marriage. However, if the father forgoes such a right then this is better and more preferable. Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects &#8211; says:<b> &#8220;And marry those amongst you who are single and also marry the pious of your male and female slaves. If they be poor, Allaah will enrich them out of His Bounty.&#8221; </b>[Soorah an-Noor 24:32].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the <i> hadeeth</i> of &#8216;Uqbah ibn &#8216;Aamir <i> radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i>, the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> &#8220;The best dowry is that which is easy.&#8221;</i> This was narrated by Abu Daawood and al-Haakim who authenticated it. And once a woman offered herself to the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> for marriage. However, one of his Companions desired to marry her, so the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said [regarding the <i>mahr</i>]: <i>&#8220;Bring something, even if it be an iron ring.&#8221;</i> So when he could not find even this, the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> married them for the dowry that the man would teach whatever of the Qur&#8217;aan he knew to her. 2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the dowry of the Prophet <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s</i> wives was five-hundred dirhams, which is equivalent to one-hundred and thirty riyaals today. And his daughters were married for the <i> mahr</i> of four-hundred dinaars, which is equivalent to one-hundred riyaals today. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a most beautiful example to follow.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:21].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whenever the difficulties relating to marriage are lightened, then preserving the modesty and decency of young men and women becomes easier, shameful and evil deeds decrease, and the Ummah &#8211; as a result &#8211; will increase in number. However if this matter is made difficult, and people continue competing with each other with regards to the <i> mahr</i> (dowry), then the number of marriages will decrease, fornication will become more widespread and more young men and women will remain unmarried &#8211; except those whom Allaah saves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So my sincere advice to all the Muslims, wherever they may be, is to facilitate the marriage process and to cooperate in this and make it easy. They should turn away from demanding excessive <i> mahr</i> and avoid unnecessary hardships and difficulties in the <i>waleemah</i> (wedding-feast). Rather, they should content themselves with a <i> waleemah</i> that is according to the <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i>, in which the burdens and difficulties for the husband and wife are minimal. May Allaah improve and rectify all the affairs of the Muslims and may He give them the guidance and ability to cling to the <i> Sunnah</i> (Prophetic guidance) in all matters. 3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>IMPURITIES UPON ONE&#8217;S CLOTHING WHILST PRAYING</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[Q]</i></b>: If a person finds some impurity upon his clothes after he has finished praying in it, does the Prayer have to be prayed again?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[A]</i></b>: Whosoever prays, and is unaware that there are impurities upon his body or his clothes during the Prayer, but only realises after he has completed it, then his Prayer will be deemed as correct, according to the most correct position of the Scholars. Similarly, if he was aware of such impurities before the Prayer, but then forgot about this at the time of praying and did not remember except after the Prayer, then his Prayer likewise will be correct. Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic said: <b> &#8220;Our Lord! Do not take us to task if we forget or fall into error.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:286]. It has been authentically related about Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, that one day he <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> led the people in Prayer, wearing his shoes. Then the angel Jibreel came to him during the Prayer and informed him that there was some dirt on his shoes. So the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> removed them and continued with his Prayer and he did not repeat the Prayer.4 This is part of the ease which Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects &#8211; has given to His servants out of His Mercy for them. However, if a person forgets that he had passed wind, then prays in that state, he must &#8211; by <i> ijmaa&#8217;</i> (consensus) of the Scholars &#8211; repeat his prayer again, when he remembers. This is due to the saying of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>: <i> &#8220;The Prayer will not be accepted without purification nor will charity be accepted from wealth that is unlawful.&#8221;</i> This has been related by Muslim in his <i> Saheeh</i> (1/140) and the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s</i> saying: <i> &#8220;The Prayer of any one of you who has released wind will not be accepted, until he makes wudhoo (ablution).&#8221;</i> Related by al-Bukhaaree and Muslim. 5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>SLAUGHTERING FOR OTHER THAN ALLAAH</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[Q]</i></b>: The slaughtering of sheep and other such animals at the graves of the pious people, for their sake and in order to please and draw closer to them, is a custom amongst my family. I have tried to prevent them from doing so, but it has only made them more resolute in doing so. I have said to them that this is shirk (associating partners in the worship) of Allaah. But they respond by saying: We only worship Allaah the way He deserves to be worshipped. However, we visit the graves of the <i>awliyaa</i> (the pious friends of Allaah) and supplicate to Allaah, through the right of the pious people, so that harm and difficulties may be averted from us. I have said to them that this is not from the religion, but they just tell me to leave them alone upon what they are doing. So what do you suggest should be the cure for such people, and what do you suggest I do to counter act this <i> bid&#8217;ah</i> (innovation)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i></i></b><b><i>[A]</i></b>: It is known from the evidences related in the Qur&#8217;aan and the <i> Sunnah</i> that sacrificing for other than Allaah, in order to draw close to other than Allaah &#8211; whether sacrificing for the <i>jinns</i>, <i>awliyaa</i>, idols or other than that from the creation &#8211; is an act of shirk and is an act of <i>jaahiliyyah</i> (pre-Islaamic ignorance) that was practiced by the <i>mushriks</i> (those who worshipped the pious men, <i>jinns</i>, angels, stones, statues, etc, along with worshipping Allaah). Allaah- the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;Say: Indeed my Prayer, my sacrifce, my living and my dying are all for Allaah Lord of the worlds. No partner do I setup with Him in this, and this is what I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:162]. So Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; clearly explains in this verse that sacrificing to other than Allaah is like praying to other than Him. And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;Indeed We have granted to the Prophet sallallaabu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam the Kawthar (a river in Paradise whose banks are lined with tents made from hollow pearls). Therefore turn in Prayer to your Lord and sacrifice to Him alone.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Kawthar 108:1-2]. So Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects &#8211; commanded His Prophet in these noble verses that he should pray only to His Lord and that he should sacrifice to only Him, which was opposite of what the <i>mushriks</i> did, in that they used to prostrate to other than Allaah and to sacrifice to other than Him. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And your Lord has commanded that you worship none but Him.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Israa 17:23]. And He &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;And they have not been commanded except to worship Allaah alone making the religion purely and sincerely for Him.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Bayyinah 98:5]. And there are many other verses with the same meaning. So, since sacrificing is one of the acts of <i> &#8216;ibaadah</i> (worship), then it is obligatory to make this action purely and sincerely for Allaah alone, without directing it to other than Him. Also &#8216;Alee ibn Abee Taalib <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> said that the Prophet <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said:<i> &#8220;May Allaah curse the one who sacrifices to other than Allaah.&#8221;</i> This has been related by Muslim in his Saheeh (no.765).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for supplicating to Allaah and asking Him by the right of the <i> awliyaa</i> or by the right of His Messenger, or by the status of His Messenger &#8211; then this does not constitute shirk, but rather it is a <i> bid&#8217;ah</i> (innovation) which leads to shirk, in the opinion of the majority of Scholars. This is because <i>du&#8217;aa</i> (supplication) is an act of worship, and how it is to be done can only be known from the Revelation. And there is nothing authentically established from our Prophet <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> to show the permissibility or validity of this type of <i> tawassul</i> (seeking the means of nearness to Allaah by invoking an intermediary) in which Allaah is asked through the right of His Prophet or the right of the <i> awliyaa</i> or any of His creation. So it is not permissible for any Muslim to innovate new forms of <i> tawassul</i> which has not been prescribed by Allaah, as He &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:<b> &#8220;Or do they have partners with Allaah who prescribe for them a religion which Allaah has not prescribed.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ash-Shooraa 42:21]. And the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> &#8220;Whosoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it, will be rejected&#8221;</i>, and in another authentic narration: <i> &#8220;Whosoever does an action that I have not commanded, it will be rejected.&#8221;</i> 7 And the meaning of this is that such innovated actions will be rejected and not accepted from its doer. Thus it is obligatory for the Muslims to restrict themselves to only what Allaah has prescribed and to beware of what people have innovated into the religion. As regards the prescribed forms of <i>tawassul</i> then they are: <i>tawassul</i> (seeking the means of nearness to Allaah) through His Names and His Attributes and by righteous actions, and by one&#8217;s <i>eemaan</i> (faith) in Allaah and His Messenger, and other righteous and prescribed actions similar to this. 9</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah Issue No.5 &#8211; Ramadân 1417H / January 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>DETERMINING THE BEGINNING OF RAMADHAN</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>[Q]</b>: Is it permissible to rely upon astronomical calculations in determining the start of Ramadhan?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: &#8220;The Prophet <i>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> ordered the Muslims saying: <i>&#8220;Do not fast until you see the new moon, and do not stop fasting until you see it, and if it is concealed by clouds then count out (the thirty days of Sha&#8217;ban) for it.&#8221;</i>1 And he &#8216;alayhis-salatu was-salam said: <i>&#8220;We are an illiterate nation that neither writes nor calculates (i.e. using astronomical calculations). The month is either like this, or this (Meaning: Sometimes it is of twenty-nine days, and sometimes it is of thirty.) &#8220;</i>2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is established in the Sahih (no.1903) of al-Bukhari from Abu Hurayrah <i>radiallahu &#8216;anhu</i> that the Prophet <i>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Fast when it (the moon) is seen, and cease fasting when it is seen, so if it is concealed by clouds then complete thirty days of Sha&#8217;ban.&#8221;</i> And he <i>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> also said: <i>&#8220;Do not fast until you have seen the moon, and if it is concealed by clouds then complete thirty days.&#8221;</i>3 There are plenty of <i>ahadith</i> in this connection, and all of them point towards the obligation of actually sighting the moon, or if unable, then to complete the number of days in the absence of observing it. These narrations also point towards the impermissibility of using astronomical calculations in this regard. And Shaykhul-Islam Ibn TaymiWah has actually stated an ijma&#8217; (consensus) from the People of Knowledge about the impermissibility of relying upon astronomical calculations in this regard &#8211; and this is the truth about which there is no doubt.&#8221; And with Allah alone is the ability.&#8221;5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>BRUSHING ONE&#8217;S TEETH WHILST FASTING</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>[Q]</b>: Is it permissible to use a <i>miswak</i> to brush one&#8217;s teeth, whilst fasting. And it it permissible to use toothpaste as well? What if some blood appear whilst I brush my teeth, doe this invalidate my fast?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: &#8220;There is no problem in cleaning one&#8217;s teeth either using water, <i>miswak</i> or toothbrush, whilst fasting. Some have held it to be <i>makruh</i> (detested) to use a <i>miswak</i> whilst fasting, since it changes the smell of a person&#8217;s breath. However, what is correct is that it is recommended to use a <i>miswak</i> in the beginning and the end of the day, since doing so does not change the odour, rather it just cleanses the mouth from impurities and small pieces of food that become lodged in one&#8217;s teeth. As regards to the use of toothpaste, then it is <i>makruh</i> (detested), since it contains a distinctive taste and flavour which may then get mixed with one&#8217;s saliva and then be swallowed. Thus, whosoever needs to use it should do so after <i>suhur</i> (the pre-dawn meal), before the time of Fajr and fasting begins. However, if one can safeguard allowing the toothpaste and salvia to be mixed then swallowed, then there is no harm in using such toothpaste. If &#8211; whilst cleaning&#8217;s one teeth with water, <i>miswak</i> or a toothbrush &#8211; a small amount of blood flows out, then this does not break the fast, and Allah knows best.&#8221;6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>CONCERNING THE <em>TARAWIH</em> PRAYER</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>[Q]</b>: Some people insist that there is an<i> ijma&#8217; </i>(consensus) from the four well known Imams &#8211; Abu Hanifah, Malik, ash-Shafi&#8217;i and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, <i>rahimahumallah</i> &#8211; on praying <b>only</b> twenty <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> for <i>tarawih</i>. Is this correct?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: &#8220;This is an erroneous claim. This is what has been stated in the <i>Hanafi</i> books of fiqh (jurisprudence), for we do not find any book that can be authentically ascribed to Abu Hanifah (d.150H) <i>rahimahullah</i>. Rather, what is apparent from looking into <i>al-Muwatta</i> of Imam Muhammad (one of the main students of Abu Hanifah) is that Abu Hanifah&#8217;s <i>madhhab</i> (school of thought) was to pray eleven <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Muhammad includes a chapter in <i>al-Muwatta</i> (p.110), stating: &#8220;Chapter: Establishing the Night Prayer in the month of Ramadhan, and the virtues contained in it.&#8221; Under this chapter he relates four ahadith. The first, third and fourth narrations do not make mention of any specified number of <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> for the <em>tarawih</em> prayer, rather they just mention the excellence of establishing Prayer in congregation and the excellence of the night prayer in Ramadhan. However, in the second narration eleven <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> is mentioned. Then Imam Muhammad said (p.111): &#8220;And we take all of this.&#8221; &#8230; Thus, he has shown that his <i>madhhab</i> is eleven <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i>, and this can only be the <i>madhhab</i> of Imam Abu Hanifah &#8211; <i>rahmatullah &#8216;alayhi</i> &#8211; as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ash-Shafi&#8217;i (d.204H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullah</i> &#8211; said: &#8220;There is no limit to its maximum, since it is an optional prayer. Thus, if the standing is lengthened, whilst the number of prostrations is shortened (i.e. the number of <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> is fewer), then that is good and that is what is most beloved to me. However, if the number of prostrations and bowings are increased (i.e. the number of <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> are increased), then this is also good.&#8221;7 So it is affirmed that Imam ash-Shafi&#8217;i &#8211; <i>rahimahullah</i> &#8211; does not advocate restricting the number of <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> to twenty. Rather, he gives preference for there to be fewer <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> and an increase in the length of standing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (d.241H) has approved of eleven <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> as well as twenty &#8211; as Shaykhul-Islam ibn Taymiyyah says in <i>al-Ikhtiyaratul-&#8216;Ilmiyyah</i> (p.38) and Shah Waliullah says in <i>al-Misriyyah</i> (1/174) and <i>al-Musaffa</i> (1/177).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Malik (d.179H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullah</i> &#8211; also supports eleven <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i>, as Shaykhul-Islam ibn Taymiyyah mentioned in <i>al-Ikhtiyarat</i> (p.38) and as Jalalud-Din as-Suyuti mentions in <i>al-Hawi lil-Fatawa</i> (p.350), where he said: al-Juri, one of our companions said, from Malik who said: &#8220;That which &#8216;Umar ibn al-Khattab gathered the people upon is more beloved to us. and that was eleven rak&#8217;ahs, and that was the prayer of Allah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>.&#8221; It was said to him: Eleven <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> with the Witr? So he said: Yes, and thirteen is close.&#8221; Then he said: <b>&#8220;I do not know from where they have introduced these numerous <i>ruku&#8217;s</i> (bowings).&#8221;</b>8</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praying eleven <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> is based upon a number of authentic narrations, from them:-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] What al-Bukhari relates in his Sahih (no.2013) from Abu Salamah ibn &#8216;Abdur-Rahman who relates that he asked &#8216;aishah <i>radiallahu &#8216;anha</i>: How was the Prayer of the Prophet <i>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> in Ramadhan? So she said: &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Messenger, <i>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> did not used to pray more than eleven <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> during Ramadhan or in other than Ramadhan. He would pray four <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i>, and do not ask about their beauty and length. Then he would pray another four, and do not ask about their beauty and length. Then he would pray three (<i>witr</i>).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Jabir <i>radiallahu &#8216;anhu</i> said: &#8221;Allah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> led us in the month of Ramadhan with eight <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> and <i>witr</i>. Then on the following night we gathered in the mosque and hoped that he would come out, and we continued in that state until morning. Then we entered our houses, so we said: O Messenger of Allah we gathered in the mosque last night hoping that you would pray with us. So he said: &#8220;I feared that it would become prescribed (i.e. obligatory) for you.&#8221;9</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Imam Malik relates in his <i>al-Muwatta</i> (no.248): From Muhammad ibn Yusuf, from as-Sa&#8217;ib ibn Yazid who said: &#8220;&#8216;Umar ibn al-Khattab ordered &#8216;Ubayy ibn Ka&#8217;b and Tamim ud-Dari to lead the people in Prayer with eleven <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i>. And the reciter would recite some hundreds of Verses until one of us would lean upon a stick because of the length of standing, and we had not used to finish until the appearance of Fajr.&#8221;10</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] &#8216;Ubayy ibn Ka&#8217;b came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam </i>and said: O Messenger of Allah, something happened with me last night &#8211; meaning in Ramadhan. So he said: <i>&#8220;And what was that &#8216;Ubayy?&#8221;</i> He said: Some women in my house said, we do not recite the Qur&#8217;an, so can you lead us in Prayer? So I lead them in eight <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> and prayed the <i>witr</i>. And this was a Sunnah of his approval, since he remained quiet and he did not say anything.11</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So all this goes to show that insisting that there is a consensus on praying only twenty <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> for <i>tarawih</i> &#8211; claiming this to be the only view of all the four well-known Imams &#8211; is not only incorrect, but is against the established evidence. As regards a detailed discussion regarding the whole issue, then this is not possible here, nor is it the place to discuss the correctness, or merits, of praying twenty <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> over eight, or vice-versa. Rather, one can find such discussions in the relevant chapters in the books of fiqh, whilst remembering that: &#8220;Difference in opinion must not be a source of obstinacy nor anger.&#8221;12</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>WHAT SHOULD I DO IN RAMADHAN?</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>[Q]</b>: What should a fasting person do, and what is obligatory upon him?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: &#8220;The fasting person must increase in obedience to Allah and to keep away from all the prohibited meters. It is obligatory upon the fasting person to safeguard the obligatory duties and to distance himself from all the prohibitions. So he should pray the five daily Prayers in their correct times and in congregation, and abandon lying, backbiting, cheating, dealing in usury, and all other prohibited matters. The Prophet <i>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever does not abandon falsehood in speech and action, then Allah the Mighty and Majestic has no need that he should leave his food and drink.&#8221;</i>13&#8243;14</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>EYE DROPS AND VOMITING</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[Q] Is it permissible to use eye or ear-drops whilst fasting, or does it invalidate the fast? And does vomiting also break the fast?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: &#8220;Whosoever uses eye or ear drops for medicinal purposes, then this does not invalidate their fast, and this is the correct opinion. This is because such drops are not termed as being food or drink &#8211; neither are they called so by convention, nor by Islamic terminology &#8211; and this is because such drops are administered through those places which food and drink are not administered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if taking such drops could be delayed until the night, then this would avoid entering into any difference of opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, whosoever vomits whilst fasting, then this does not invalidate their fast. This is because Allah does not burden a soul with more than it can bear, and also that the <em>Shari&#8217;ah</em> (Divinely Prescribed Islamic Law) is built upon facilitating ease and removing hardships, as Allah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And We have not made for you any hardships in the Religion.&#8221;</b> [Surah al-Baqarah 2:222].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, the Prophet <i>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever has an attack of vomiting, then no atonement is required of him, but whoever intentionally vomits, then let him atone for it.&#8221;</i>15&#8243;16</p>
