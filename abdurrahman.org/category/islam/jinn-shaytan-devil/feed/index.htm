<p>If Satan whispers to you, burn him with these ten protections — he will never come near you again | [Video | En subtitles] &#8211; <a href="https://youtu.be/gAA4Pj9Joys?si" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">https://youtu.be/gAA4Pj9Joys?si</a> [3:26 min]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">One of the most important things a Muslim should pay attention to in this context is taking care of the protective measures against Satan — and the most important and greatest of these are ten protections.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">[1] <strong>Seeking refuge in Allah from him.</strong> Seeking refuge means taking shelter with Allah and turning to Him, Exalted be He. The greatest evil from which one seeks refuge in Allah is the evil of Satan. Allah the Almighty said: &#8216;And if there comes to you from Satan an evil suggestion, then seek refuge in Allah. Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Knowing.&#8217;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">[2] <strong>Reciting the Mu&#8217;awwidhatayn. </strong>These are the two chapters of refuge: &#8220;Say, I seek refuge in the Lord of daybreak&#8221; (<strong>Surah Al-Falaq</strong>) and &#8220;Say, I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind&#8221; (<strong>Surah An-Nas</strong>). It is authentically reported from our Prophet that he said: &#8216;No one seeks refuge with anything better than them.&#8217; He used to seek refuge with them every night when he went to bed. It is also authentically reported that whoever recites them along with Surah Al-Ikhlas three times in the morning and three times in the evening <strong>will be protected from all evil.</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">[3] <strong>Reciting Ayat al-Kursi when one goes to bed to sleep.</strong> It holds great significance in protecting against Satan, driving him away, and keeping him out of the place. It is authentically reported in Sahih sources from our Prophet that whoever recites it when going to bed will have a guardian from Allah over him, and no devil will come near him until morning.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">[4] <strong>Reciting Surah Al-Baqarah in its entirety</strong>. It has an incredibly powerful and amazing effect in expelling devils from homes. In Sahih Muslim, it is reported from our Prophet that he said: &#8216;Do not turn your houses into graves. Indeed, Satan flees from a house in which Surah Al-Baqarah is recited.&#8217;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">[5] <strong>Reciting the Last Two Verses of Surah Al-Baqarah</strong>. It is authentically reported that the Prophet said: <em>&#8216;Whoever recites the last two verses of Surah Al-Baqarah at night, they will suffice him&#8217;</em> — meaning, they will protect him from all harm and evil, and from the evil and traps of Satan.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>[6] Saying &#8220;لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ، وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ، وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ&#8221;</strong> (There is no god worthy of worship but Allah, alone without partner. His is the dominion and His is the praise, and He is over all things capable.&#8217;) This great phrase — the statement of Tawheed — is among the most powerful means of protection from Satan and safeguarding against his evil. In Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim, the Prophet said: &#8216;Whoever says: &#8220;There is no god worthy of worship but Allah, alone without partner. His is the dominion and His is the praise, and He is over all things capable&#8221; — one hundred times in a day — it will be equivalent to freeing ten slaves, one hundred good deeds will be written for him, one hundred sins erased from him, and it will serve as a protection from Satan for that day until evening.&#8217;</p>



<p>[7] <strong>When Satan overpowers a person in their sleep (nightmares), they should say: </strong><br /><br /><strong>&#8220;أَعُوذُ بِكَلِمَاتِ اللهِ التَّامَّاتِ مِنْ غَضَبِهِ وَعِقَابِهِ وَشَرِّ عِبَادِهِ، وَمِنْ هَمَزَاتِ الشَّيَاطِينِ وَأَنْ يَحْضُرُونِ&#8221;</strong> <br />(I<em> seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah from His anger and His punishment, from the evil of His servants, and from the incitements of the devils and from their presence</em>)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>[8] Saying &#8216;Bismillah&#8217;</strong> — In the name of Allah when entering one&#8217;s home, when eating, and in various other situations throughout daily life.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">[9] <strong>A person should beware of excess</strong> — excessive looking, excessive eating, excessive talking, and excessive socializing — for these four are major gateways through which Satan enters upon a person.</p>



<p>[10] <strong>Frequent remembrance of Allah, the Exalted, at all times.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Shaytaan</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is held to be a strong external reason, which causes eemaan to decrease. Shaytaan is a vehement enemy to the believers. He awaits calamities to afflict them. He has no desire or goal other than to jolt the eemaan in the hearts of the believers and to weaken and corrupt it. Whoever submits to the whisperings of Shaytaan, complies with his notions and does not retreat to Allaah for refuge from him, his eemaan weakens and decreases. Indeed, it may disappear in its entirety depending on the Muslim’s response to such whisperings and notions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is for this reason that Allaah has warned us of Shaytaan in the sternest sense and He has clarified his dangers, the detrimental consequences of following him as well as the fact that he is an enemy to the believers. Allaah ordered the believers to take him as an enemy and therefore deliver themselves from him and his whisperings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8230;يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تَتَّبِعُوا خُطُوَاتِ الشَّيْطَانِ ۚ وَمَن يَتَّبِعْ خُطُوَاتِ الشَّيْطَانِ فَإِنَّهُ يَأْمُرُ بِالْفَحْشَاءِ وَالْمُنكَرِ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“O you who believe! Do not follow the footsteps of Shaytaan, and whosoever follows the footsteps of Shaytaan, then, verily he</b> (i.e., Shaytaan)<b> commands Fahshaa’ </b>(i.e., to commit indecency and lewdness, etc.)<b> and al-Munkar</b> (i.e., disbelief, shirk, to do evil and wicked deeds, to speak or to do what is forbidden in Islaam, etc.)<b>…”</b></span> [Soorah an-Noor (24):21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِنَّ الشَّيْطَانَ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ فَاتَّخِذُوهُ عَدُوًّا ۚ إِنَّمَا يَدْعُو حِزْبَهُ لِيَكُونُوا مِنْ أَصْحَابِ السَّعِيرِ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“Surely, Shaytaan is an enemy to you, so treat him as an enemy. He only invites his hizb </b>(followers)<b> that they may become the dwellers of the blazing Fire.”</b></span> [Soorah Faatir (35):6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِنَّ الشَّيْطَانَ لِلْإِنسَانِ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌ&#8230;</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#008000;">“Verily! Shaytaan is to man an open enemy!”</span> </b>[Soorah Yoosuf (12):5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>اسْتَحْوَذَ عَلَيْهِمُ الشَّيْطَانُ فَأَنسَاهُمْ ذِكْرَ اللَّهِ ۚ أُولَٰئِكَ حِزْبُ الشَّيْطَانِ ۚ أَلَا إِنَّ حِزْبَ الشَّيْطَانِ هُمُ الْخَاسِرُونَ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“Shaytaan has taken hold of them. So he has made them forget the remembrance of Allaah. They are the party of Shaytaan. Verily, it is the party of Shaytaan that will be the losers!”</b></span> [Soorah al-Mujaadilah (58): 19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Jawzee says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Hence it is an obligation upon the sane person to be on his guard against this enemy, who has manifested his enmity since the time of Aadam. He has sacrificed his life and self in corrupting the circumstances of the children of Aadam and Allaah has ordered one to be cautious of him…” He then mentioned a number of such texts and then said: “The like of this in the Qur’aan is abundant.” [Talbees Iblees, pg. 23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Muhammad al-Maqdasee says in the introduction of his book Dhamm al-Waswaas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“To proceed, Allaah has indeed made Shaytaan an enemy to man. He sits in wait against him along the straight path and comes to him from every direction and way, as Allaah has related from him that he said:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>قَالَ فَبِمَا أَغْوَيْتَنِي لَأَقْعُدَنَّ لَهُمْ صِرَاطَكَ الْمُسْتَقِيمَ ثُمَّ لَآتِيَنَّهُم مِّن بَيْنِ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمِنْ خَلْفِهِمْ وَعَنْ أَيْمَانِهِمْ وَعَن شَمَائِلِهِمْ ۖ وَلَا تَجِدُ أَكْثَرَهُمْ شَاكِرِينَ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“Surely I will sit in wait against them on Your Straight Path. Then I will come to them from before them and behind them, from their right and from their left, and You will not find most of them as being grateful ones (i.e., they will not be dutiful to You).”</b></span> [Soorah al-A’raaf (7):16-17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further, Allaah has warned us against following him and commanded us to possess animosity towards him and to oppose him, He said:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِنَّ الشَّيْطَانَ لِلْإِنسَانِ عَدُوٌّ مُّبِينٌ&#8230;</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“Verily! Shaytaan is to man an open enemy!”</b></span> [Soorah Yoosuf (12):5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8230;يَا بَنِي آدَمَ لَا يَفْتِنَنَّكُمُ الشَّيْطَانُ كَمَا أَخْرَجَ أَبَوَيْكُم مِّنَ الْجَنَّةِ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“O Children of Aadam! Do not let Shaytaan deceive you, as when he brought your parents </b>(i.e., Aadam and Hawwaa’)<b> out of Paradise…”</b></span> [Soorah al-A’raaf (7):27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah informed us of what he did with our parents as a way of cautioning us from obeying him and also to cut short any excuse for having followed him and Allaah commanded us to follow the straight path …” [Dhamm al-Waswaas, pg.46. Also refer to Ibn al-Qayyim’s introduction of his own book Ighaathah al-Lahfaan, 1/10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, Shaytaan is an enemy to man. His desire is to corrupt the beliefs and to wreak havoc on one’s eemaan. Whoever does not fortify himself from him through remembrance of Allaah, resorting back to Allaah and seeking refuge with Him, will become a breeding ground for Shaytaan, who will lure him to actions of disobedience, entice him to perpetrate prohibited matters and push him to embark upon lewd sins. What a perish of his religion and what a corruption of his eemaan will it be if man submits to him!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy upon him, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Beware of enabling Shaytaan to establish himself in the very home of your thoughts and intentions, as he will corrupt them in such a manner that will make difficult its correction thereafter. He will cast all sort of whisperings and harmful thoughts at you and he will prevent you from thinking about what may benefit you and it is you who have aided him against yourself by empowering him over your heart and thoughts and he then placed you in the possession of such thoughts.”</strong></span> [Al-Fawaa’id, pg. 309]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, may Allaah have mercy upon him, put forward an excellent similitude in this regard, which lies in total agreement. He says in another excerpt from his book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“If you would like a consistent example for this, then his parable is that of a dog that is extremely famished; between you and the dog is a piece of meat or bread. He looks attentively at you and sees you not opposing him and he is so close to you. You drive him away and yell out at him and yet the dog refuses but to hover round you in circles and to try to deceive you with regard to what you possess in your hand.”</span></strong> [At-Tibyaan fee Aqsaam al-Qur’aan, pg. 419]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His intention, may Allaah have mercy upon him, behind this parable is to demonstrate the scope of Shaytaan’s danger to man if he does not seek refuge with Allaah from him and fails to retreat back to Allaah for refuge from his evil, through beneficial words of supplication and blessed forms of remembrance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, whoever turns away and is instead averse to that, Shaytaan will cling to him in this way in which he will tempt and dictate to him until he eradicates his eemaan. Allaah says:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يَعْشُ عَن ذِكْرِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ نُقَيِّضْ لَهُ شَيْطَانًا فَهُوَ لَهُ قَرِينٌ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَيَصُدُّونَهُمْ عَنِ السَّبِيلِ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُم مُّهْتَدُونَ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا جَاءَنَا قَالَ يَا لَيْتَ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَكَ بُعْدَ الْمَشْرِقَيْنِ فَبِئْسَ الْقَرِينُ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#008000;">“And whosoever turns away </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(blinds himself)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;"> from the remembrance of the Most Beneficent </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(i.e., this Qur’aan and worship of Allaah)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;">, We appoint for him a shaytaan to be a Qareen </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(i.e., an intimate companion)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;"> to him. And verily, they </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(i.e., shaytaans)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;"> hinder them from the Path </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(of Allaah)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;">, whilst they think that they are guided aright! Till, when </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(such a)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;"> one comes to Us, he says </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(to his qareen)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;">, ‘Would that between me and you were the distance of the two Easts </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(or the East and West)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;">, a worst </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(type of)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;"> companion </span></b><span style="color:#008000;">(you are indeed)</span><b><span style="color:#008000;">!”</span></b>[Soorah az-Zukhruf (43):36-38]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Al-Isti‘aadhah</em></strong><strong> (Seeking Refuge) and its Proof</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof for <em>Al-Isti‘aadhah</em> (seeking refuge) is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ الْفَلَقِ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of the Dawn </strong></span>[113:1]<strong> <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>22</sup></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">22</span></strong>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>Al-Isti‘aadhah</em>:</strong></span> means seeking refuge with someone who can defend you against something disagreeable which you fear in order that he should repel from you this thing. This is<em> al-Isti‘aadhah.</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em>al-Isti‘aadhah</em> is a type from the types of worship. It is not permissible for you to seek refuge in other than Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. So whoever seeks refuge with a grave or with an idol, or with anything besides Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, then he will be a <em>mushrik</em>, who has committed major <em>shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنَّهُ كَانَ رِجَالٌ مِّنَ الْإِنسِ يَعُوذُونَ بِرِجَالٍ مِّنَ الْجِنِّ فَزَادُوهُمْ رَهَقًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And there used to be men from mankind who would seek refuge in men from the <em>jinn</em>, and they only increased them in transgression</span>. </strong>[72:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabs in the days of ignorance, when they stopped off at a place on the earth, one of them used to say, “I seek refuge in the chief of this valley”: meaning the chief one from the <em>jinn</em>; he would seek refuge from the evil of the foolish ones of his people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>said refuting that and making clear what is legislated in place of it:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Whoever stops off at a place and he says, “<span style="color:#808000;">I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allaah from the evil of whatever He has created</span>”, then nothing will harm him until he travels on from that stopping place of his.”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the correct replacement, seeking refuge in the perfect words of Allaah instead of seeking refuge in the <em>jinn</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ الْفَلَقِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say, &#8220;I seek refuge in the Lord of the Dawn&#8221; </strong></span>[113:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<em>Al-Falaq</em>”, is the dawn, and the Lord of the dawn, He is Allaah the Perfect and Most High, just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَالِقُ الْإِصْبَاحِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah is the One Who causes the dawns to break </strong></span>[6:96]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: the One Who brings out the light of the day into the darkness of the night. Who is able to do that except Allaah the Perfect and Most High?</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ الْفَلَقِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>I seek refuge in the Lord of the Daybreak </strong></span>[113:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning the Lord of dawn when it breaks, the Sovereign Owner, the One who controls it, the One having full ability over it.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مِن شَرِّ مَا خَلَقَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>From the evil of that which He created </strong></span>[113:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This covers the evil of all of the created beings, he seeks refuge in Allaah from the evil of all of the created beings. This will suffice you for every seeking refuge and every seeking protection which the people do.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِن شَرِّ غَاسِقٍ إِذَا وَقَبَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And from the evil of the <em>Ghaasiq </em></strong>(darkening night)<strong> as it comes with its darkness </strong>(or the moon as it sets or goes away)</span> [113:3]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>Al-Ghaasiq</em></strong></span>”, is the darkness of the night; since in the darkness wild animals and wild beasts come out so then you are in danger, so you seek refuge in Allaah from the evil of this darkness and whatever is beneath it from these harmful things.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِن شَرِّ النَّفَّاثَاتِ فِي الْعُقَدِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And from the evil of those who blow upon knots </strong></span>[113:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they are the sorcerers, you seek refuge in Allaah from sorcery / magic and its people, because sorcery / magic is tremendous evil.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِن شَرِّ حَاسِدٍ إِذَا حَسَدَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And from the evil of the envier when he envies </strong></span>[113:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>Al-<u>H</u>aasid</em>”</strong></span>, the envier, he is the one who hopes and wishes for favours to pass away from other people; when he sees someone having a favour then he becomes furious, and he wishes for this blessing to pass away out of envy and out of transgression and Allaah’s refuge is sought. And it is one of the worst of blameworthy qualities, because it involves raising objections against Allaah, and it involves evil towards the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And entering into it is the person who gives the<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> evil eye</strong></span>, the one who causes harm with his look, because striking with the evil eye is a type of envy, so you should seek refuge in Allaah from these evils.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this indicates that <em>al-Isti‘aadhah</em> (seeking refuge) is worship, it is not permissible to be directed to other than Allaah, so you do not seek refuge in a created being, and whoever seeks refuge in a created being then he has committed shirk with Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam</em> said to ‘Abdullaah ibn ‘Abbaas <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Allaahu ‘anhumaa</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And if you seek aid then seek the aid of Allaah”<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"></a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ النَّاسِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of Mankind</span>. </strong>[114:1]<strong> <span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>23</sup></span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>23</strong></span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ النَّاسِ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">مَلِكِ النَّاسِ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">إِلَٰهِ النَّاسِ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">مِن شَرِّ الْوَسْوَاسِ الْخَنَّاسِ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِي يُوَسْوِسُ فِي صُدُورِ النَّاسِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: I seek refuge in the Lord of Mankind. The King of mankind. The One Who is rightfully worshipped by mankind. From the evil of the whisperer, who whispers and then withdraws. The one who whispers into the hearts of mankind. From <em>jinn</em> and from men. </strong></span>[114:1-6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah the Mighty and Majestic commands seeking refuge in the Lord of mankind, the King of mankind, the One Who is rightfully worshipped by mankind – these are all Names and Attributes of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and it contains the three types of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>: <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed-ur-Ruboobiyyah</em> (<em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of Lordship), <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed-ul-Uloohiyyah</em> (<em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of worship) and <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed-ul-Asmaa wa<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>ifaat</em> (<em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em> of Allaah’s Names and Attributes).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Seek refuge in Allaah and in these Names and Attributes, seek refuge in Allaah from the evil of <em>al-Waswaas</em> (the whisperer) – and he is Satan. As for <em>Wiswaas</em> (a whispering) then that is a verbal noun from the verb <em>waswasa yuwaswisu</em>. As for <em>al-Waswaas</em> then it is a name from the names of Satan, because he whispers to mankind and gives him false ideas, and he pre-occupies him in order to cast terror into his heart and uncertainty and confusion in his affairs, particularly with regard to the affair of worship, because Satan whispers to man in acts of worship until he confuses him regarding his prayer or his act of worship, and then finally the person comes out from his prayer believing that it was null and void. Or he prays and then he believes that he was not upon <em>wudhoo’</em>, or that he did not stand up for such and such, or that he did not perform such and such, the person comes to suffer from whispers and he is not calm in his worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah the Majestic and Most High has given us the remedy for this dangerous matter, and that is that you seek refuge in Allaah from the evil of this whisperer who is <em>al-Khannaas.</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"><em>al-Khannaas</em></span>:</strong> meaning the one who departs and moves away, so he whispers when you are negligent of the remembrance of Allaah, and he withdraws – meaning he falls back when you remember Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. So he whispers when the person is inattentive, and he is one who withdraws and moves away when one remembers Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مِن شَرِّ الْوَسْوَاسِ الْخَنَّاسِ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِي يُوَسْوِسُ فِي صُدُورِ النَّاسِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The one who whispers into the hearts of mankind. From <em>jinn</em> and from mankind </strong></span>[114:5-6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is as if the meaning – and Allaah knows best – that there are those who whisper from the <em>jinn</em> and from mankind as well – those who whisper things to the people; they come to the people and they cause them to have doubts, so just as there are devils from the <em>jinn</em> who whisper evil, then likewise there are devils from mankind who whisper also, so you should seek refuge in Allaah from the evil of the two tribes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“No-one seeking refuge has sought refuge by means of the like of these two” </strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: these two soorahs (Soorat-ul-Falaq and Soorat-un-Naas). So it is befitting for the Muslim that he should read these two after the prayers and that he should repeat them again and again, and that he should recite these two when he goes to sleep along with Aayat-ul-Kursee and Soorat-ul-Ikhlaa<u>s</u>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He should recite <em>Aayat-ul-Kursee</em> and <em>Soorat-ul-Ikhlaa<u>s</u></em> and the two <em>soorahs</em> for seeking refuge, he should recite them after every prayer, and repeat them three times after maghrib and after fajr, and likewise recite these two when you go to sleep in order that Satan should move away from him and not disturb his sleep for him and not trouble him with nightmares.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The witness from these two <em>soorahs</em> is that Allaah has commanded seeking refuge in Him alone, so this proves that seeking refuge in other than him, whether it be jinn or mankind or any created thing, that that is not permissible because it is a type from the types of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;"><a style="color:#999999;" href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Muslim (2708) from a hadeeth of Khawlah bint Hakeem as-Sulamiyyah <em>ra<u>d</u>iy Aallaahu ‘anhaa</em></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Explanation of the Creed of the Salaf</strong>,  by Imaam Abee Uthmaan Ismaa’eel bin Abdir-Rahmaan As-Saaboonee,<em>rahimahullaah</em>, as explained by our noble sheikh al-Allaamah Rabee’ bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee, <em>hafidhahullaah</em>.</p>
<p>Audio Lecture by: <strong>Abu Muhammad al Maghribee</strong> (<em>hafidhahullaah)</em></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Chapter 28: The Whisperings of the Devils (Shayaateen)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>[The below is the text from the Book]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[134] The People of Hadeeth believe that Allah, The One free from all deficiencies, Created the devils with the characteristic of whispering to mankind and they intend their downfall, so they lie in wait for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَإِنَّ الشَّيَاطِينَ لَيُوحُونَ إِلَىٰ أَوْلِيَائِهِمْ لِيُجَادِلُوكُمْ ۖ وَإِنْ أَطَعْتُمُوهُمْ إِنَّكُمْ لَمُشْرِكُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Indeed the devils do inspire their friends to dispute with you and if you obey them, then indeed you will become an polytheist.&#8221;</span> (Sooratul-An&#8217;aam 6:121)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[135] Allaah empowers them (the devils ) over whomsoever He wishes and He protects whomsoever He wishes from their plots and deceptions. Allaah The Most Mighty and Majestic says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَاسْتَفْزِزْ مَنِ اسْتَطَعْتَ مِنْهُم بِصَوْتِكَ وَأَجْلِبْ عَلَيْهِم بِخَيْلِكَ وَرَجِلِكَ وَشَارِكْهُمْ فِي الْأَمْوَالِ وَالْأَوْلَادِ وَعِدْهُمْ ۚ وَمَا يَعِدُهُمُ الشَّيْطَانُ إِلَّا غُرُورًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إِنَّ عِبَادِي لَيْسَ لَكَ عَلَيْهِمْ سُلْطَانٌ ۚ وَكَفَىٰ بِرَبِّكَ وَكِيلًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And Istafziz [literally means: befool them gradually] those whom you can among them with your voice (i.e. songs, music, and any other call for Allah&#8217;s disobedience), make assaults on them with your cavalry and your infantry, mutually share with them wealth and children (by tempting them to earn money by illegal ways usury, etc., or by committing illegal sexual intercourse, etc.), and make promises to them.&#8221; But Satan promises them nothing but deceit.Verily! My slaves (i.e the true believers of Islamic Monotheism), you have no authority over them. And All-Sufficient is your Lord as a Guardian.</span>(Sooratul-Israa 17:64-65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إِنَّهُ لَيْسَ لَهُ سُلْطَانٌ عَلَى الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ<br />
إِنَّمَا سُلْطَانُهُ عَلَى الَّذِينَ يَتَوَلَّوْنَهُ وَالَّذِينَ هُم بِهِ مُشْرِكُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Verily! He has no power over those who believe and put their trust only in their Lord (Allah).His power is only over those who obey and follow him (Satan), and those who join partners with Him (Allah)</span>  (Sooratul-Nahl 16:99-100)</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Note: at 5:14 it should say &#8220;..and then Allaah cured him through this way.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Translated by Yasin Abu Ibrahim.<br />
Translation checked by Raha ibn Donald Batts</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">A man has been afflicted by Waswaas Qahree (compulsive whisperings). So what is your advice? May Allaah preserve you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Sulaymaan bin Saleemullaah ar-Ruhaylee:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a way from the ways of Iblees (Shaytaan). And the principle regarding Waswaas is that it is a proof for the righteousness of the servant and the soundness of the heart. For verily, when Shaytaan sees that the servant is righteous and that he (Shaytaan) is not able to defeat him by way of actions, he starts whispering to him. This is why when this (affair of Waswaas) was mentioned to the Prophet -sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam– he said: “All praise is due to Allaah Who has reduced the plot of Shaytaan to al-Waswasah (whispering).” He (Shaytaan) wasn&#8217;t able to overcome us, so he came to us with Waswaas. And he (the Prophet) said: “That is a clear sign of faith.” This is the essence of Waswaas. Meaning: if Waswaas takes place, then that is a proof for this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But this doesn&#8217;t mean that we praise those who are afflicted by Waswaas. For verily, answering to Waswaas is evil. It is obligatory to avoid and stay away from it. And those who are afflicted by Waswaas are of two categories.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The first category:</strong></span> that the Waswaas does not overpower him. Rather it comes to him and goes away. This is cured through making a lot of isti&#8217;aadhah (seeking refuge with Allaah). He seeks refuge with Allaah from it and he spits to his left side. And he recites the Qur&#8217;aan and the Ahaadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">The second category:</span></strong> that the Waswaas is so much that it overpowers him. And this cannot be cured by any action, because the more actions he does, the more his Waswaas increases. Even if he recites Qur&#8217;aan, his Waswaas increases! So how is it cured? The Fuqahaa&#8217; say that it is cured by completely turning away from it. What does this mean? It means that you do not perform anything because of it or leave off anything because of it. Even if it comes to you, consider it a crazy person speaking from behind you, while you are certain that he does not harm you. And do not perform anything because of it or leave off anything because of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people, when Waswaas comes to them, they open the Qur&#8217;aan to recite it. Then Iblees becomes (even more) eager in (overpowering) him, so he starts whispering to him with regards to the Qur&#8217;aan. He gets up and prays, so he (Shaytaan) whispers to him in his prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And do not leave off anything because of it! If you are reading the Qur&#8217;aan and Shaytaan comes to you whispering, then do NOT leave off reciting the Qur&#8217;aan, rather continue! Leave it whenever YOU want to leave it. As for leaving it because of the Waswaas, then don&#8217;t. If you do this and you are patient&#8230; KNOW that this issue requires patience, because Iblees comes to the person who is afflicted with Waswaas in the form of an advisor, someone who has pity. In the prayer (Shaytaan says): “This is the prayer! And the prayer is the connection between the servant and his Lord! And if your prayer is nullified, then what remains for you? Beware! Leave (the prayer) and go perform Wudoo!” (He does this) in order to corrupt his prayer. And he is not an advisor, rather he is Iblees! So this requires patience. Be patient!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If Waswaas comes to you in Wudoo, then perform your Wudoo and leave. If Iblees then comes to you and says: “There remains something!” Then say: “There remains nothing.” Do not pay attention to him! And go pray! By Allaah, it will not harm you! By Allaah, it will not harm you. You are reciting the Qur&#8217;aan and Iblees comes to you whispering? Continue! And leave him (Iblees)! Continue reciting! By Allaah, it will not harm you! In fact, you will be rewarded! Because you are performing Jihaad against Iblees. Then Iblees will becomes hopeless of you and leave this door (of Waswaas), and he will start looking for another door.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, O brothers, the likes of this brother about whom it is said that he has Waswaas Qahree, meaning: the Waswaas overpowers him, the ONLY cure for him is completely turning away. And the meaning of completely turning away, is that he has CERTAINTY that it does not harm him, and that Allaah is Ever-Merciful, and that it is not possible that Allaah punishes his servants because of this, and that this isn&#8217;t from the religion! Allaah says: <strong>“And He has not laid upon you in religion any hardship&#8230;”</strong> (22:78) How can it be from the religion that a person has to perform Wudoo seventy times?! [unclear] So you should know this and be certain of it, and that’s it! You do what the people do, and you turn away. And you continue in your act and you don&#8217;t leave it because of Waswaas. And do not perform anything because of Waswaas. By Allaah, with the permission of Allaah he will be cured. And we know this by experience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By Allaah, O brothers. A man came to me and Shaytaan used to always whisper to him with regards to his wife, that he is divorcing her. And if he goes with her to her family, and he says to her: “Go to your family,” then Iblees comes to him and says: “You just divorced her.” Sometimes he used to call me at two o&#8217;clock at night and three o&#8217;clock at night and say: “O Shaykh, right now she is next to me in bed, is she my wife or have I divorced her?” In the beginning we said to him: “Keep yourself busy with the remembrance of Allaah, until you leave this affair.” So he started keeping himself busy with the remembrance of Allaah, and then Iblees started coming to him; whenever he said “Subhaanallaah”, then Iblees said: “No! You are indirectly saying you have divorced her.” And whenever he said “Allaahu akbar”, then Iblees said: “You are indirectly saying you have divorced her! And this is a matter of honor!” When we saw that the affair became severe, we advised him to turn away (from this Waswaas). Then he used to turn away for a while and then return (to his state of Waswaas). He sometimes came to my house, and I used to throw him out of my house. Because as long as he knows that there is someone who can give him comfort, then he will continue with his Waswaas. But we gave him the principle. After a while, and to Allaah belongs all praise and blessing, his life became stable and this Waswaas was completely gone from him, because he was firm upon this principle. And I know many people, one of them had Waswaas for more than twenty years! And he came to us, so we advised him and we were patient with him for a while, and then Allaah cured through this way. So my advice to the brother is that he acts upon what I have mentioned, and Allaah knows best.</p>

<p><strong>Posted from</strong> : <a title="Book of Ar-Riqaaq – Softening of the Heart – Al-Bukhaari – Dr. Saleh as Saleh" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2014/11/08/book-of-ar-riqaaq-softening-of-the-heart-al-bukhaari-dr-saleh-as-saleh/">Al-Bukhari Book of Ar-Riqaaq</a> – Based upon the explanation of Shaykh Ibn Al-‘Uthaymeen</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The below is from Tafseer Ibn Kathir, darussalam publication</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>O mankind! Verily, the promise of Allah is true. So, let not this present life deceive you, and let not the chief deceiver deceive you about Allah. Surely, Shaytan is an enemy to you, so take (treat) him as an enemy. He only invites his followers that they may become the dwellers of the blazing Fire.</strong> [Surah Fatir ver 5-6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(O mankind! Verily, the promise of Allah is true.)</strong> meaning the Resurrection will undoubtedy come to pass.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(So, let not this present life deceive you,)</strong> means, `this life is as nothing in compare to the great good that Allah has promised to His close friends and the followers of His Messengers, so do not let these transient attractions distract you from that which is lasting.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(and let not the chief deceiver deceive you about Allah.)</strong> This refers to Shaytan, as stated by Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him. Meaning, do not let the Shaytan tempt you and divert you away from following the Messengers of Allah and believing what they say, for he is the chief deceiver and arch-liar. This Ayah is like the Ayah that appears at the end of Surah Luqman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(let not then this (worldly) present life deceive you, nor let the chief deceiver deceive you about Allah) (31:33). Then Allah tells us of the enmity of Iblis towards the sons of Adam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Surely, Shaytan is an enemy to you, so take (treat) him as an enemy.)</strong> meaning, `he has declared his enmity towards you, so be even more hostile towards him, oppose him and do not believe the things with which he tries to tempt you.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(He only invites his followers that they may become the dwellers of the blazing Fire.)</strong> means, `he only wants to misguide you so that you will enter the blazing Fire with him.&#8217; This is a manifest enemy, and we ask Allah, the All-Powerful and Almighty to make us enemies of Shaytan and to make us followers of the Book of Allah and of the way of His Messengers. For He is able to do whatever He wills and He will respond to all supplication. This is like the Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And (remember) when We said to the angels: &#8220;Prostrate yourselves unto Adam.&#8221; So they prostrated themselves except Iblis. He was one of the Jinn; he disobeyed the command of his Lord. Will you then take him (Iblis) and his offspring as protectors and helpers rather than Me while they are enemies to you What an evil is the exchange for the wrongdoers.) (18:50)</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Chapter 13 : Warning Against Having Extremism in the Deen</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the great lessons of benefit for the pilgrim during his Hajj to the House of Allaah is the important lesson of taking the <strong>middle course and being just in all matters</strong>, keeping away from extremism, negligence, falling into excess or heedlessness. Allaah Ta’ala has said regarding this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Thus We have made you a just and the best nation, that you be witnesses over mankind and the Messenger be a witness over you.</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah: 143]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of His saying &lt;&lt; <strong>just and the best nation</strong> &gt;&gt; is: trustworthy witnesses, who do not shy away from the truth, so that they exaggerate, nor that they become unmindful but are are balanced and are just.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hajj is full of great experiences and magnificent lessons which show the great importance of the straight path and of being balanced. From the most important circumstances in this great issue is looking to the guidance of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and his Sunnah regarding <strong>stoning the Jamaar</strong> and considering it in light of what has been mentioned by the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam. After that, look at the state of the people in comparison to the Prophet’s Sunnah and you will see that the condition of these people is either that of exaggeration and excess or shortcoming and negligence, except for those whom Allaah has given the understanding of the religion and has honoured with adherence to the Prophetic Sunnah and imitation of his guidance and example.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated by Imaam Ahmad, Nis’aee and Ibn Majah on the authority of Abdullah bin ‘Abbas –RadhiAllaahu anhuma- who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘The Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said to me on the morning of ‘Aqaba while he was on his she-camel: ‘Collect small stones for me.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So I collected seven small stones for him from the little stones and began to shake off their dust from his palm while he was saying: ‘Throw stones the likes of these (type and size stones).’ </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Then he said: ‘O you people beware of exaggerating in the Deen because what destroyed those before you was indeed exaggeration in the Deen.’</strong></span> [1]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This chain of narration is authentic according to the conditions of Muslim as Shaykh-ul-Islam -Rahimullaah- and others have mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- saying in the hadeeth: ‘Throw stones the likes of these (type and size stones).’ i.e. the stones that were gathered for him had a specified size as is mentioned in the hadeeth. The stones were the size of those used for stoning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word al-Hassa (stone) does not carry the meaning of small sized stones, such as pebbles, nor does it carry the meaning of a large sized stone, such as a rock but rather, what has been legislated is in between.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though this issue has been clearly discussed with detailed explanation, if you were to compare this to the actions of some Muslims ignorant of the Prophet’s -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- Sunnah you would find their actions relating to stoning the Jamaarat to be very strange. You will find them fluctuating between exaggeration and deficiency, increase and falling short or between excess and negligence. The truth, however, is found somewhere inbetween them. The Muslim does not have shortcomings regarding the Sunnah of the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- unlike those who are negligent and incompetent or those who are excessive and exaggerate. The Muslim is just and balanced.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards the saying of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -: ‘<strong>Beware of extremism</strong>.’ then this statement is general and it applies to all types of extremism in all aspects of belief and actions because the ruling derived is taken from the general wording of this hadeeth and not the specific reason for which the statement was revealed. The Muslim is prohibited from extremism in all circumstances and in all his affairs. He is ordered to follow the way of the Noble Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and adhere to his Sunnah in all circumstances.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the Shaytan strives absolutely to turn the believers, the slaves of Allaah, away from the right path and keep them far away from Allaah&#8217;s straight path either through extremism or negligence. The Shaytan uses every which way he can to be victorious.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as some of the Salaf said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Allaah did not command anything except that Shaytan incites evil with two commands; either negligence and shortcoming or exceeding the limits and extremism and he does not mind with which of the two he is victorious.’</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaytan is seated in the path of the Muslim. He does not become lax, nor does he become bored of his relentless plotting or his wait to ambush the Muslim. He strives absolutely to increase the Muslim in misguidance and to divert him from the straight path and clear guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn al-Qayyim -Rahimullaah</strong>&#8211; said in his great book ‘<strong>Ighatha allhaffan min Masayid ash-Shaytaan</strong>’ :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘From his (Shaytan&#8217;s) plots (may Allaah have protect us and you from him) is that he scrutinizes the soul until he knows which of the two strengths can be overcome, the strength of boldness and courage or the strength of abstention, humility and shame. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If Shaytan sees that the soul leans towards humility and abstention, he begins to hinder him and weaken the Muslim’s endeavour and resolve in what he has been ordered and charged with. So Shaytan makes it easy for him to leave that off until he regularly leaves off (what he has been ordered with) or lessens his (following) and neglects Allaah’s orders.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If Shaytan sees that the soul leans towards the strength of boldness, zeal and lofty aspirations, he causes him to undervalue the commands of Allaah and makes him imagine that what he has is insufficient such that he needs to exaggerate and do extra along with that. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Therefore, the Shaytan causes the first to reduce in what Allaah has commanded and causes the second to exceed. Most people, except very few, fall either reduction or excess &#8211; these two valleys &#8211; the valley of shortcoming and the valley of extremism. Only a very small number are steadfast on the path the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- and what his Companions were upon.’</strong> </span>[2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Ibn al-Qayyim -Rahimullaah- cites many examples of this, from different angles of the Deen, dividing the people into three groups: the extremists, the negligent and the people of the middle and straight path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed being upright in all matters, taking the middle course and being far away from extremism and negligence is the correct methodology and the straight path which the believers are required to follow, just as Allaah commanded in His Book and His Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- ordered. So truly being in the middle and being upright is holding onto the restrictions Allaah has laid down for His slaves, such that whatever is not from the religion is not added to it nor is anything from the religion excluded. This is what Allaah entrusts the believers with and what He commands them with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta&#8217;ala said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And those, who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor niggardly, but hold a medium (way) between those (extremes)</strong> </span>&gt;&gt; [al-Furqan :67]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta&#8217;ala said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your neck, nor stretch it forth to its utmost reach (like a spendthrift), so that you become blameworthy and in severe poverty</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [al-Isra: 29]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah Ta&#8217;ala said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And give to the kindred his due and to the poor and to the wayfarer. But spend not wastefully (your wealth) in the manner of a spendthrift</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [al-Isra:26]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah Ta&#8217;ala said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>and eat and drink but waste not by extravagance</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [‘Aaraaf:31]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta&#8217;ala said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And be moderate (or show no insolence) in your walking, and lower your voice</strong></span>&gt;&gt; [Luqmaan:19]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, it is authentically reported in the hadeeth of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘The middle course, the middle course will make you reach paradise.</strong></span>’[3]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means: it is binding on you to take the middle course in all matters of speech and action. Moderation is being in the middle, between two extremes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also authentically reported in Musnad and others that the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Take the middle course of guidance, indeed the one who is severe in the Deen, then it will overcome him</strong></span>.’[4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas’ood –RadhiAllaahu anhu- used to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Being restrained within the Sunnah is better than striving in Bida</strong></span>’.’[5]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Deen of Allaah is in the middle, between the one who goes to extremes and the one who is negligent. The best of people are those in the middle who have raised themselves above the shortcoming of the neglectful, but do not join the exaggeration of those who go beyond the limits. Rather the best of people stick to the guidance of the leader of the Messengers, the one chosen by The Lord of the Worlds who is an example for all people, Muhammad bin Abdullah, may Allaah&#8217;s Peace and Prayers be upon him, his Family and all his Companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">How to Overpower One’s Own Soul to Do Good &#8211; Shaykh ʿAlī al-Ḥaddādī حفظه الله<br />
Translated by Mikail ibn Mahboob Ariff حفظه الله<br />
Video Courtesy: Brother Bilal Nahim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ʿAlī ibn Yaḥyá al-Ḥaddādī said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong>The question] says:</strong> “How can I fight my [own] soul in [making myself] love acts of obedience, seeking knowledge, learning knowledge, and praying in congregation?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How do you fight against your soul…. This means you compel it. Compel your soul. Your soul says, “No, don’t attend the lesson.” Tell it: “Rather, I will attend the lesson.” Start your car and head off to the lesson.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>This is the solution.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You hear the call [to the prayer] while your soul is feeling sluggish, loving sleep. Tell it: “No, there’s no [more] sleep; there’s prayer.” Get up, perform ablution, and walk to the mosque.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once, twice, three times, it’s over. [Your soul] will become compliant. Your soul will become compliant and give in to you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if you pamper it—every time it tells you, “Don’t do it,” you say, “Hearing and obeying”—it will overpower you. You will not be able to direct it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So then the issue, after Allāh gives one true success and [one] puts [his] trust in Allāh, is one of your overpowering your soul and compelling it, and it will become compliant for you after one, two or three times, if Allāh wills.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Do the Jinn (creatures created from fire) appear to some humans and hold friendships with them? Is jinni a devil?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Jinn do appear to some people. The Jinn are individual beings, not part of the human. It is well-known among scholars that the Jinn are the children of the Satan, in the same way that the humans are the children of Adam, so the Satan is the Jinni who refused to prostrate to Adam. He is the father of all Jinn. Some of them are kind, and others are wicked Kafirs (disbelievers) similar to the Kafirs among human beings. Among them are the Fasiqs (someone openly and flagrantly violating Islamic law), Kafirs, righteous Mu&#8217;mins (believers), and disobedient ones. They are groups and sects as humans, some people are in contact with them, they speak to them and are spoken to by them, some people can see them, but in most cases they are not seen. This is as Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:<em><span style="color:#008000;"> </span></em><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily, he and Qabîluhu (his soldiers from the jinn or his tribe) see you from where you cannot see them&#8221;</span></strong><em><span style="color:#008000;"> (</span></em>Surah Al-A`raf, 7: 27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It means that they see us from where we cannot see them. This does not mean that we cannot see them at all; we can see them, but not from where they see us. However, they appear to some people in the desert and in houses, and they converse. We have been informed by a group of scholars of many incidents where the Jinn attend informative lectures and ask questions about different topics although they were not seen, some people have seen the Jinn in the desert and in other places.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is not permissible to worship them instead of Allah (Exalted be He), or seek their support. It is not permissible also to ask them for help in harming Muslims, nor is it permitted to ask about the Ghayb (the Unseen).</strong></span> In fact a person should take precautions against these things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for calling them to Allah if possible, teaching them what will benefit them, advising them, preaching to them and reminding them of Allah, these are all permissible things. However, seeking their help and support, making vows for them, or getting closer to them by slaughtering in fear of their evil is Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">‘And verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter with the males among the jinn, but they (jinn) increased them (mankind) in sin and transgression</span>.</strong> (Surah Al-Jinn, 72: 6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that they increased their sins and transgression. This Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse) has two Tafsirs (explanation of the meanings of the Qur&#8217;an): the <strong>first meaning</strong> is that the Jinn increased the humans in fear of them, and the <strong>second meaning</strong> is that the humans increased the Jinn in their evil and transgression and kufr (disbelief) because when the Jinn saw that humans were scared of them they became arrogant and increased their harm of humans.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Either way <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>it is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> permissible to ask them for help, or assistance, or is it permissible to make vow to them, ask them to help with something, invoke them to cure the sick, and so on</strong></span>. However, if one is able to speak to them, he can advise, remind, and call them to Allah. He should also teach them what will bring them benefit. There is nothing wrong with doing that with Jinn in the same way it is done with humans.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I never heard &#8216;Umar saying about something that he thought it would be so-and-so, but he was quite right.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once, while &#8216;Umar was sitting, a handsome man passed by him, &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;If I am not wrong, this person is still on his religion of the pre-lslamic period of ignorance or he was their foreteller. Call the man to me.&#8221; When the man was called to him, he told him of his thought. The man said, &#8220;I have never seen such a day on which a Muslim is faced with such an accusation.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I am determined that you should tell me the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>I was a foreteller in the pre-lslamic period of ignorance</strong>.</span>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Tell me the most astonishing thing your female Jinn has told you of</strong></span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;One-day while I was in the market, she came to me scared and said, &#8216;Haven&#8217;t you seen the Jinns and their despair and they were overthrown after their defeat (and prevented from listening to the news of the heaven) so that they (stopped going to the sky and) kept following camel-riders (i.e. &#8216;Arabs)?&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umar said, &#8220;He is right.&#8221; and added,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;One day while I was near their idols, there came a man with a calf and slaughtered it as a sacrifice (for the idols). An (unseen) creature shouted at him, and I have never heard harsher than his voice. He was crying, &#8216;O you bold evil-doer! A matter of success! An eloquent man is saying: None has the right to be worshipped except you (O Allah).&#8217; On that the people fled, but I said, &#8216;I shall not go away till I know what is behind this.&#8217; Then the cry came again: &#8216;O you bold evil-doer! A matter of success! An eloquent man is saying: None has the right to be worshipped except Allah.&#8217;</strong> <strong>I then went away and a few days later it was said, &#8220;A prophet has appeared.&#8221;</strong></span></p>

<div dir="ltr">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808080;">The following benefit posted by <strong>Abu Yusuf, Sagheer  </strong>on West London Dawah groups</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>As sallamualaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here are a couple of excerpts from the salafee scholars about issues pertaining to ruqyah which are very revealing about the state of the people in this day and age.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sheikh Saaleh bin Fawzaan al-Fawzaan (<i>hafidhahullah</i>) was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“What is your opinion on opening up clinics specialising in reciting (over people for ruqyah purposes)? &#8220;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the Sheikh replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“<span style="text-decoration:underline;">This is not permissible to be done</span> because it opens up the door of fitnah (tribulation) and it opens up the door of fraud for the fraudsters. And this was not from the action of the salaf that they opened up houses or opened up places for reciting (over people for ruqyah purposes).</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>And increasing in this (opening up clinics) brings about evil and corruption enters into it. And there enters into it (this activity) the one who does not do good because the people rush after greed and they want to attract the people to themselves, even if it is by doing things which are prohibited. And it is not to be said:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>‘This is a righteous man (doing the ruqyah in this clinic)’</i></b><b>, </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>because a person is put to trial (through this) and refuge with Allah is sought. And even if he was righteous and he opened up this door (of opening up a clinic for ruqyah), it is (still) not permissible. “</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<i>Al-Jinn Was-Sar’ Wa ‘Ilaajuhu</i> [Fataawa from Sheikh Saaleh al-Fawzaan from the radio programme <i>Noorun ‘Alaa-ad-darb</i> &#8211; Collected and prepared by ‘Aadil bin ‘Alee al-Furaydaan] , Pp 18-19, Ad-Daar-ul-Athareeyah ‘, Cairo, 1<sup>st</sup> Edition, 1421/2010).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sheikh Saaleh as-Suhaymee (<i>hafidhahullah</i>) was asked by a woman from Algeria about a man who proposed to her. This man is someone who preoccupies himself with performing ruqyah and does some strange things during the ruqyah. In his reply the Sheikh said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“And I warn you against many from amongst those who do ruqyah, for indeed many from amongst them are not upon the guidance of Al-Mustapha (the chosen one) – <i>sallalahu ‘alahi wa sallam</i>. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">And indeed, the one who adopts doing ruqyah as a profession, then he is an innovator. (This is a) word by which I seek to get closer to Allah, because this (taking ruqyah as a profession) is not established from the salaf</span>.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>And as for the one who is requested by his brother to do ruqyah upon him, then:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“Whosoever is able to benefit his brother, then let him benefit him”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>as the truthful and the one who is believed <i>sallalahu ‘alahi wa sallam</i> said. “</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(sahab.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=148336  &#8211; posted on 6<sup>th</sup> November 2014 CE).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Coupled with some of the other emails I’ve sent out from the likes of Sheikh Muqbil (<i>rahimahullah</i>) and Sheikh Rabee (<i>hafidhahullah</i>) on this subject, there’s not much room left – inshallah – for all those <strong>‘Jinn busters’</strong> out there who have become superstars in the Muslim communities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sticking to the Sunnah is the only way out from all our problems.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah save us from following our desires and from the deceptions of Iblees and his army of men and Jinn. Aameen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Abu Yusuf, Sagheer</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q 4: <span style="color:#993300;">Is it permissible for people who suffer from jinn possession to seek the help of soothsayers in order to kill or exorcise the jinn possessing them?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is not permissible for them to do so because <strong>sorcery</strong> and <strong>soothsaying</strong> can only be performed with the aid of <strong>devils</strong> whose help is attained when the performer attributes them as partners to Allah in worship. A soothsayer is known to have contact with the jinn who inform him of what is going on at certain places. For example, so-and-so died in the Levant (the region covering Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Palestine) and the like matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Devils pass information about future events to each other until it finally reaches the soothsayer. When he passes this information to an ignorant person, the latter comes to believe that the soothsayer or fortuneteller possesses knowledge of <em>Ghayb</em> (Unseen) where in fact the source of this information is Devil. A soothsayer may also seek the help of powerful devils to exorcise another devil possessing the person. This can only be done if the possessed person fulfills their desire that they be worshipped beside Allah or that the possessed person makes vows for their sake or slaughters animals for the sake of drawing near to them. Once their desire is fulfilled, the Shayateen start to threaten the possessing devil with death or imprisonment unless he surrenders to their commands. At that point, the possessing devil will have no choice but to obey his master devils and then leave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>It is not a valid excuse to seek the help of soothsayers on the basis that some people benefit from their help</strong>. Those who worship jinn seek to get benefit from them even though the jinn themselves may cause them greater harm by possessing them or robbing their property. Thus, it is not a valid excuse to join jinn in the worship of Allah on the pretext of seeking their benefit to cure the illnesses of humans. During the pre-Islamic era, people used to speak to the idols. The Shayatin would incarnate the idols and would speak with people whom they tempted into worshipping them beside Allah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Devil&#8217;s Deception of People by giving them High Hopes (of living long)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many Jews and Christians contemplated joining Islam, but Iblis convinced them to procrastinate saying: &#8220;Do not rush, look more into the issue.&#8221; Until they die as non-Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also causes the sinner to procrastinate seeking repentance. A poet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Do not rush into committing a sin,</strong><br />
<strong>and then procrastinate repenting.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Iblis makes those seeking righteousness feel lazy, and he causes those who are serious to procrastinate. He convinces a jurist to rest instead of going over his lesson again. And convinces a worshipper who had woken up to pray at night that he still has a lot of time. <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Iblis tries to make people lazy procrastinators, and to make them have hope (of a long life)</strong></span>. A disciplined person must take advantage of time, and never procrastinate. That which is feared can never be trusted, and that which passes can never be brought back again. The main reason for doing less good and more evil is relying on the hope of a long life, this is because a person continues to pro­crastinate performing good deeds and refraining from evil deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He who hopes to wake up in the morning will not do much at night, and he who hopes to travel during the day will travel much at night. However, he who sees death to be near works hard during his life. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: &#8220;<strong>Perform prayer as if you were departing</strong>.&#8221; [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the Salaf said: &#8220;<strong>Beware of procrastination, for it is one of devil&#8217;s strongest weapons</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A disciplined person prepares for his journey, while a procrastinator doesn&#8217;t. So when it comes time to travel the disciplined person feels happy while the procrastinator feels that he is in trouble. This is how people are. Some are alert, so when the Angel of Death comes they do not feel guilty. Others are not disciplined, so they feel the agony when it comes time to travel.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If procrastination is part of your nature then repelling it becomes difficult. But when one knows that he has a persistant enemy he will always be on guard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah to give us safety from the enemy&#8217;s cunning, the devil&#8217;s fttnah&#8217;s and the evils of ourselves and the dunyd. Indeed He is near and responsive.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taken from Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah of Shaykh Al-Albaani<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albani refutes this doubt by researching the following Ahadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of ‘Aa’ishah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anha</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘If the Shaytan comes to one of you and says: ‘Who created you?’ say ‘Allaah.’ Then he will say: who created Allaah? So if one of you finds this situation then say: ‘I have believed in Allaah and His Messengers.’ This doubt will then leave you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Ahmad graded Hasan by Albani [saheehah 116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration also in Saheehah (Hadeeth No.117), the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said: ‘The Shaytan comes to one of you and says: ‘Who created this? Who created that? Who created this?Until he says who created your lord? So if this reaches you then seek refuge in Allaah and it will end.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhari, Muslim and Ibn Sunni.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the wording narrated by Abu Hurairah, the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The people will question one another so much that one of them will say: So Allaah created the creation, then who created Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em>? So if they say this, then say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَد ٌ ,اللَّهُ الصَّمَد ُ, لَمْ يَلِدْ وَلَمْ يُولَد ْ, وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُ كُفُوًاأَحَدٌالإخلاص: ١ – ٤</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Say: He is Allaah, The One. <em>Allaahus-Samad</em>, He does not beget nor was he begotten, and there is none like unto Him. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he should spittle to his left three times and seek refuge from the Shaytan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Abu Dawood &amp; Ibn Sunni and graded Hasan by Albani.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Shaykh Albani comments by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fiqh al-Hadeeth:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These authentic Ahadeeth indicate that it is obligatory for the one Shaytan whispers to, by saying ‘who created Allaah?’, that he turns away from debating with him and responds with what wasmentioned in the previous Ahadeeth, the summary of which is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have believed in Allaah and His Messengers. ‘He isAllaah, The One, <em>Allaahus-Samad</em>, He does not beget nor was He begotten, and there is none like unto Him.’ Then he should spittle to his left three times and seek refuge from the Shaytan. This (then) stops him from being carried away by the whisperings of Shaytan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I truly believe that whoever does this sincerely, out of obedience to Allaah and His Messenger, these whisperings will definitely leave him and his Shaytan will be defeated due to the saying of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>: ‘Then this doubt will leave you.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This noble prophetic teaching is more beneficial and more definitive against whisperings than intellectual debate in this issue, since it is very rare that such a debate will be beneficial. What is sad is that the majority of people are neglectful of this noble prophetic teaching! So take heed O Muslims, learn the Sunnah of your Prophet and implement it, in it is cure and honour for you.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Book of Medicine of his Sahih, <strong>Al-Bukhari</strong> recorded that `A&#8217;ishah said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah was bewitched until he thought that he had relations with his wives, but he had not had relations with them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyan said, &#8220;This is the worst form of magic when it reaches this stage.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O `A&#8217;ishah! Do you know that Allah has answered me concerning that which I asked Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Two men came to me and one of them sat by my head while the other sat by my feet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who was sitting by my head said to the other one, `What is wrong with this man&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other replied, `He is bewitched.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first one said, `Who bewitched him&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other replied, `Labid bin A`sam. He is a man from the tribe of Banu Zurayq who is an ally of the Jews, and a hypocrite.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first one asked, `With what (did he bewitch him)&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other replied, `With a comb and hair from the comb.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first one asked, `Where (is the comb)&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other answered, `In the dried bark of a male date palm under a rock in a well called Dharwan.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`A&#8217;ishah said, &#8220;So he went to the well to remove it (the comb with the hair).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the well that I saw. It was as if its water had henna soaked in it and its palm trees were like the heads of devils.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he removed it (of the well). Then I (`A&#8217;ishah) said, `Will you not make this public&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied, (Allah has cured me and I hate to spread (the news of) wickedness to any of the people.)&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>
<p><strong>How come that the Messenger of Allah was bewitched? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q 6: <span style="color:#993300;">How come that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) was bewitched when Allah addresses him saying: <span style="color:#008000;">Allâh will protect you from mankind</span>. How could he suffer the influence of magic at the time when he was responsible for conveying the Divine Revelation to the Muslims? Kindly explain the statement of the Mushriks (one who associates others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) in the Qur&#8217;an: <span style="color:#008000;">You follow none but a bewitched man</span>. Please, clarify and answer the misconceptions! </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A 6: According to an authentic Hadith, this incident of bewitching took place in Al-Madinah. When the Prophet (peace be upon him) started to receive Divine Revelation regularly, proofs of the truthfulness of his prophethood were established and Allah&#8217;s victory was granted to him over the disbelievers who felt disgraced. At that time, a man from the Jews called Labid ibn Al-A`sam bewitched him by sticking one of the Prophet&#8217;s hairs to a comb. The Prophet (peace be upon him) started imagining that he had done a thing, which in fact he had not done. Despite being affected by magic, the Prophet (peace be upon him) was conscious of every single word he spoke to people. He would speak the words inspired to him by Allah (Exalted be He). However, the spell that was cast on him affected his intimate relation with his wives. `Aishah (may Allah be please with her) said: <span style="color:#008000;">Once the Prophet was bewitched so that he began to imagine that he had done a thing which in fact he had not done</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was only when Jibril (Gabriel) (peace be upon him) told him about what had happened to him that the Prophet (peace be upon him) sent someone to bring the spell out from a well belonging to one of the Al-Ansar (the Helpers, inhabitants of Madinah who supported the Prophet). When he was rid of it, the spell was broken by Allah&#8217;s grace. <strong>It was then that Allah (Exalted be He) revealed the two Surahs, which came to be known as Al-Mu`awwidhatayn (Surahs Al-Falaq and Al-Nas)</strong>. When the Prophet (peace be upon him) recited them, he was cured. Praising these two Surahs, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:<strong> <span style="color:#008000;">No one can use anything that is equal to these two Surahs in seeking refuge in Allah</span></strong>. The fact that the Prophet (peace be upon him) was bewitched did not affect his conveying of the Islamic Message nor were the people around him affected by that. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) protected him from failing to convey the Message of Islam to people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Like all other prophets, Muhammad (peace be upon him) suffered several types of physical pain. For example, in the battle of Uhud, his face was wounded by the rings of his helmet that pierced his temples, his lower lip bled, and one of his teeth was broken. He also fell into a pit. The disbelievers also tightened a net around him in Makkah. He suffered pain like all the prophets who preceded him. Allah (Exalted be He) raised him to greater ranks and doubled his reward for his patient endurance of suffering and oppression at the hands of the disbelievers. Regarding the Ayah which reads: (<strong>Allâh will protect you from mankind&#8230;</strong>), it means that Allah (Exalted be He) will protect the Prophet (peace be upon him) from the disbelievers&#8217; conspiracy to kill him and from their attempt to prevent him from conveying the Message of Islam.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">While on the Ark, [Prophet] Nooh (&#8216;alayhis-salam) noticed an old man whom he did not recognise. Nooh inquired: &#8216;What brought you here?&#8217; He replied: &#8216;I came to strike the hearts of your followers, so their hearts become with me, while their bodies with you.&#8217; Nooh responded: &#8216;Leave O enemy of Allah.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Iblis said: &#8216;There are five things that cause people to become destroyed (deviated). I will inform you of three and not of the other two&#8217;. It was revealed to Nooh that he needed not know the three, but that he should enquire about the two.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Iblis said: &#8216;The two that are certain to work are: <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>envy</strong></span>: I was cursed because of my envy, and became a stoned devil. And the second is <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">eagerness (to have more)</span></strong> : The entire paradise was made permissible to Adam (&#8216;alayhis-salam) . I got what I wanted from him because of his eagerness.&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">When death befalls someone, he should know that it is an hour of serious suffering because it is a moment of severe pain, when he is leaving all objects of love, his loved ones, and to all that the horror of the throes of death and fear of where his wealth go. Then Shaytan comes and attempts to have the slave [of Allah] become discontent with his Lord, he tells him &#8216;Look at you! What made you die? Is it painful? You are leaving your wife, your children and you will be laid under the ground? So he might cause him to become discontent with his Lord, hating Allaah&#8217;s decree, making him say things that include any kind of objection , or he might make him unjust in his will, giving some of the inheritors preference over others, to on and so forth. In this case, we need to cure the whispers of Shaytaan and cure the self .</p>
<p>Abu Dawood reported from Abu al-Yusr (radiy Allaahu anhu) that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) used to say,</p>
<h1 style="text-align:center;"> أعوذ بك أن يتخبطني الشيطان عند الموت</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Aoodhubika an ya takhabaTani ash-Shaytaan ‘indal Mawt</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8220;I seek refuge in You that Shaytaan flounders me at death: [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In that minute Shaytaan tells his assistants,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;If you miss him now [i.e. you do not succeed to lead him astray before he dies], you will never catch him again [i.e. you will never be able to deviate him at any other time].&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the cure for these trials we should first mention that whoever is mindful of Allah while in good health, Allah will protect him when he is ill, and whoever observes Allah in his thoughts, Allah will protect him when he moves his bodily parts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;">Al-Khattaab said,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;His seeking refuge in the &#8216;<strong>floundering of Shaytaan at death</strong>&#8216;, that is if Shaytaan seizes him when he leaves this world, preventing him from repenting or hinders him from mending his affairs, leaving an injustice or he makes him despair from the mercy of Allaah or makes him hate death or be sorry for this life, so he becomes discontented with Allah&#8217;s decree in dissolution, going to the hereafter, so one has a bad end and he meets his Lord while he is discontented with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was narrated that the Shaytaan is never tougher on a man as in death and he tells his assistants: &#8216;<strong>Take this person! if you miss him today you will never catch him again</strong>.&#8217; We seek refuge in Allah from his evil, we ask him to bless our death and to have a good end.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[1] Reported by Abu Dawood 1552-1553, al-Nasa&#8217;i[8:283] through the chain of Afla&#8217; Mawla (emancipated slave) of Abu Ayyub from Abu al-Yusr that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) used to pray, <strong>&#8220;O Allah! I seek refuge in you from dying under abolishment, not being deliberate, I seek refuge in you from drowning, from burning and from senility, I seek refuge in you that Shaytaan flounders me at death, I seek refuge in you that I die while escaping from fighting for Your sake and I seek refuge in you from dying because of a sting.&#8221;</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> A speech by His Eminence published in the local and Islamic newspapers in 1395 A.H</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah, his family, his Companions, and those who follow his guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The so-called science of summoning spirits is widespread among many people including writers and others. They claim that they summon the souls of the dead through a method invented by those who practice such jugglery. They further claim that they ask such souls about the dead, whether they are in bliss or torture, as well as other such affairs as they may think the dead know about.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have investigated the issue thoroughly to find that it is a false science and a satanic jugglery that aims at corrupting beliefs and morals, confusing Muslims, and <strong>claiming to know the Ghayb (the Unseen)</strong> in many respects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, I considered it proper to write a brief note to clarify the truth, advise the Ummah, and ward off confusion. Undoubtedly, this issue, as any other issue, should be referred to the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah so that we might verify what they or one of them verify and reject what they or one of them rejects. In this regard, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Nisa', 4: 59" target="_blank" name="Oyouwhobelieve!ObeyAll%C3%A2hand"></a><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Obey Allâh and obey the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority. (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allâh and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم), if you believe in Allâh and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination</span>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regards to<a name="Soul-relatedissues,theyhave"></a> soul-related issues, they have to do with matters relating to the Ghayb, the truth about which is exclusively known by Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He). It is impermissible to discuss them unless substantiated by a Shar`y (Islamic legal) evidence.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Scholars differed regarding what is intended by the <strong>Ruh (the Spirit)</strong> in the Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse) in Surah Al-Isra&#8217; that reads: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Isra', 17: 85" target="_blank" name="Andtheyaskyou(OMuhammad%D8%B5%D9%84%D9%89"></a><span style="color:#008000;">And they ask you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) concerning the Rûh (the spirit); Say: &#8220;The Rûh (the spirit) is one of the things, the knowledge of which is only with my Lord. And of knowledge, you (mankind) have been given only a little.&#8221;</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Some scholars view that it refers to the soul that is in the bodies. Accordingly, the Ayah indicates that the soul is a divine secret unknown to humankind and no one can know about it except what Allah tells. Thus, it is something that is known exclusively to Allah who concealed it from creatures. The Qur&#8217;an and authentically reported Hadiths indicate that the souls of the dead survive after the death of bodies. The following Ayah indicates the same fact: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Zumar, 39: 42" target="_blank" name="ItisAll%C3%A2hWhotakesawaythe"></a><span style="color:#008000;">It is Allâh Who takes away the souls at the time of their death, and those that die not during their sleep. He keeps those (souls) for which He has ordained death and sends the rest for a term appointed.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></span> It is also authentically reported <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a name="ThatontheDayofBadr,theProphet"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="24552" class="tip"></span>that on the Day of Badr, the Prophet (peace be upon him) ordered that the corpses of twenty-four leaders of Quraysh should be thrown into one of the dirty dry wells of Badr. (It is a habit of the Prophet, peace be upon him, that whenever he conquered some people, he used to stay at the battlefield for three nights). So, on the third day of the Battle of Badr, he ordered that his she-camel be saddled, then he set out, and his Companions followed him saying among themselves, &#8216;Definitely, he (peace be upon him) is proceeding for some great purpose.&#8217; When he (peace be upon him) halted at the edge of the well, he addressed the corpses of the Quraishi infidels by their names and their fathers&#8217; names, &#8216;O so-and-so, son of so-and-so, and O so-and-so, son of so-and-so!Would it have pleased you if you had obeyed Allah and His Messenger? We have found true what your Lord promised us. Have you too found true what your Lord promised you?&#8217; `Umar said, &#8216;O Messenger of Allah! You are speaking to bodies that have no souls!&#8217; The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, &#8216;By Him in Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad, you do not hear what I say better than they do, but they cannot answer.&#8217;</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> The Prophet (peace be upon him) is authentically reported to have said: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a name="Thedeceasedpersonhearsthefootsteps"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="15489" class="tip"></span>The deceased person hears the footsteps of those who escort him to his final destination after they leave him.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great scholar<strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Ibn Al-Qayyim </span></strong>(may Allah be merciful to him) said: <span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;The Salaf (righteous predecessors) are unanimously in agreement with that, and they believed, according to many transmitted reports, that a dead person recognizes the visit of a living person and becomes cheerful about it.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore,<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Ibn Al-Qayyim </span>recorded that<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Ibn `Abbas </span>(may Allah be pleased with him and his father) gave an interpretation of the Ayah that reads: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Zumar, 39: 42" target="_blank" name="ItisAll%C3%A2hWhotakesawaythe"></a><span style="color:#993300;">It is Allâh Who takes away the souls at the time of their death, and those that die not during their sleep. He keeps those (souls) for which He has ordained death and sends the rest for a term appointed.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8220;<span style="color:#993300;">I was told that the souls of both the living and the dead meet while sleeping and ask each other questions. However, Allah maintains the souls of the dead and sends the souls of the living back to their bodies</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Ibn Al-Qayyim </span>(may Allah be merciful to him) commented, saying: <span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;The meeting between the souls of the living and the dead is proven by the fact that a living person might see in his dream a dead person and ask him about things not known by the former for which the latter gives an answer that might correspond with the real fact.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the view held by the Salaf that the souls of the dead survive until a time known only to Allah. However, it is not authentically reported that they communicate with the living people at any time other than that of sleeping.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Claims of jugglers that they have the ability to summon the soul of any dead person they like, talk to, and ask it questions are all false. Actually, such are false claims that have no textual or rational grounds. Rather, Allah Alone is the One Who knows about and disposes of souls. He Alone is the One capable of returning them to bodies whenever He so wills. In fact, He Alone is the One who disposes of His Kingdom and no one can interfere with His Plan. However, those who claim otherwise are those who claim to know things they are totally ignorant about and deliberately lie to people regarding the news they report about souls,which they spread either in order to earn money, to prove themselves able to do things they actually cannot do or to confuse people and thus corrupt their religion and `Aqidah (creed).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, souls summoned by such jugglers are souls of devils they make use of after worshipping and obeying the commands of such devils. The latter do what the former asks and thus deceive people and impersonate the claimed dead people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says in this regard: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-An&#096;am, 6: 112" target="_blank" name="AndsoWehaveappointedforevery"></a><span style="color:#008000;">And so We have appointed for every Prophet enemies &#8211; Shayâtîn (devils) among mankind and jinn, inspiring one another with adorned speech as a delusion (or by way of deception). If your Lord had so willed, they would not have done it; so leave them alone with their fabrications. (Tafsîr Qurtubi)</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-An&#096;am, 6: 113" target="_blank" name="Andthisisinorder)thatthe"></a>(<span style="color:#008000;">And this is in order) that the hearts of those who disbelieve in the Hereafter may incline to such (deceit), and that they may remain pleased with it, and that they may commit what they are committing (all kinds of sins and evil deeds)</span>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Exalted be He) also says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-An&#096;am, 6: 128" target="_blank" name="AndontheDaywhenHewillgather"></a><span style="color:#008000;">And on the Day when He will gather them (all) together (and say): &#8220;O you assembly of jinn! Many did you mislead of men,&#8221; and their Auliyâ’ (friends and helpers) amongst men will say: &#8220;Our Lord! We benefited one from the other, but now we have reached our appointed term which You did appoint for us.&#8221; He will say: &#8220;The Fire be your dwelling-place, you will dwell therein forever, except as Allâh may will. Certainly your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing.&#8221;</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Scholars of Tafsir (exegesis of the meanings of the Qur&#8217;an) say that Jinn benefit from humans in the sense that the latter worship them through sacrificing, vowing for and supplicating to them. On the other hand, humans benefit from Jinn in the sense that the latter fulfill the requests which the former ask of them. In return, they tell them about things that only the Jinn may get to know from remote places, or about things they overhear, or merely about lies, which happens in most cases. Supposing that such people do not offer acts of worship for the souls they summon, even then such a practice may not be considered permissible. This is because merely asking devils, soothsayers, jugglers, and diviners is impermissible. Believing what they say is more unlawful and sinful and even falls under disbelief. In this regard, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a name="Anyonewhovisitsadivinerand"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="11016" class="tip"></span>Anyone who visits a diviner and asks him about anything, his Salahs (Prayers) extending to forty nights will not be accepted.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> It is also reported in Musnad<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Ahmad </span>and the Sunan (Hadith compilations classified by jurisprudential themes) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a name="Anyonewhoresortstoadiviner"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="13365" class="tip"></span>Anyone who resorts to a diviner and believes in what he says has disbelieved in what was revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him).</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>****</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So many Hadiths and traditions were related in this regard. Undoubtedly, the so-called summoned souls are included under those things prohibited by the Prophet (peace be upon him), as <strong>they are of the same kind of souls of devils</strong> used by diviners and jugglers and thus have the same ruling. They may not be summoned or believed. In fact, such are all prohibited, abhorred, and false practices based on the above-quoted Hadiths and traditions to this effect. This is also because the statements they report from such souls are included under knowledge of the Ghayb. Allah (Glorified be He) says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Naml, 27: 65" target="_blank" name="Say:Noneintheheavensandthe"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Say: “None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghaib (Unseen) except Allâh”</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Such souls might also belong to the devils who used to accompany the dead people</strong>, while they were alive, whose souls are summoned. Thus, they may tell some events that had passed to the dead person while alive. Therefore, they may neither be summoned, asked, nor believed as substantiated by the above-quoted evidence. Actually, those people summon no more than devils and Jinn and make use of them in return for acts of worship, which should not be offered to anyone except Allah. Thus, such people commit major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship that takes the Muslim out of Islam). We seek refuge with Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta&#8217; in the<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Saudi </span>House of Fatwa issued a Fatwa on <strong>Hypnotism included under summoning spirits</strong>, which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Hypnotism is a kind of fortune-telling or magic whereby the hypnotist uses the Jinn to overpower the subject and then speak through his tongue and give him strength to do things by means of controlling his faculties. This is true if the Jinni is sincere to the hypnotist and obeys him in return for the things by means of which the hypnotist draws close to him. So, the Jinni makes the subject obey the commands of the hypnotist and helps him do things he is asked by the hypnotist to do. Thus, it is impermissible to use hypnotism in finding out stolen objects or lost thingsor in treating diseases or doing anything. Rather, it is an act of Shirk, for the reasons stated above and because it implies relying on other than Allah in things beyond ordinary means which Allah has made accessible for His creatures and permitted them to use.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of quote.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a title="Click here">Among scholars who disclosed the truth about such false claims is <strong>Dr.<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Muhammad Muhammad Husayn </span></strong>in his book <strong>&#8220;Modern Spirituality, Truth and Objectives.&#8221;</strong> He was one of those deceived by such jugglery for a while but Allah guided him to truth to uncover the falsehood of such claims after he had gone deeply into them and found them no more than superstitions and jugglery. He stated that those who practice summoning spirits make use of a variety of methods. Beginners use a <strong>small cup</strong> to receive them therein. Others make use of the <strong>basket method on whose edge a pen</strong> is fastened to write answers to the questions of questioners. However, others depend on an <strong>intermediary</strong> such as in the case of Hypnotism.</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He added that he has doubts about those who claim to summon spirits and that they are supported by certain sponsors in view of the <strong>huge propaganda</strong> made for them. Therefore, <strong>many newspapers and magazines</strong> that have never been active in any spiritual or hereafter-related fields hurried to be updated with them and publish their claims. Such magazines have never called to religion or belief in Allah. He also added that they concern themselves with reviving the Pharaonic and other pre-Islamic ideologies. Moreover, he added that those who promote these ideas are people who lost a dear person, and thus try to console themselves through fancies. In this regard, the most famous person who promoted such an idea is Mr.<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Oliver Lodge </span>who lost his son in World War I. The same applies to the founder of Spiritualism movement in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Egypt </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Ahmad FahmyAbul-Khayr </span>whose long awaited son died in 1937.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dr.<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Muhammad Muhammad Husayn </span>stated that he practiced such a false practice starting with the method of cup and table, which he found them unpersuasive. He ended up using the method of an intermediary and tried to watch the so-called embodiment of souls or hear their direct voice that they deem the evidence of the truthfulness of their claims. Neither he nor others were successful because this cannot be materialized in the actual fact. Rather, they are no more than exact deceptions based on secret skillful tricks that aim at destroying religions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Universal destructive Zionism is not far away this. When the man came to realize the truth about such false ideas and to lose confidence in them, he forsook them and decided to make clear the truth to people. He began to say that those deviated people work hard to extract deep-rooted faith and `Aqidah out of people&#8217;s hearts and plunge them into a confusing mix of doubts and illusions. Those who claim to summon spirits describe the Messengers of Allah (peace be upon them) as no more than spiritual intermediaries as claimed by their leader<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Arthur Findlay </span>in his book &#8220;On the Edge of the Ether.&#8221; Speaking about prophets, the author describes them as high class intermediaries, and their miracles as no more than spiritual phenomena as those that happen in the room where spirits are summoned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dr.<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Husayn </span>further said: &#8220;If they fail to summon a spirit, they will say that the intermediary is unsuccessful or tired, that attendants are incompatible or that among attendants are dubious or challenging people.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among their false claims is their claim that Jibril (Gabriel, peace be upon him) attends and blesses their sessions (may Allah damn them). This was a brief outline of the ideas of Dr.<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Muhammad Muhammad Husayn </span>on the subject.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to what we mentioned above as well as the opinion of the Committee and Dr.<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Muhammad Muhammad Husayn </span>on Hypnotism, it becomes clear how false are the claims of those who allege that they talk to souls, including summoning the souls of the dead and asking them what they would like to know. It also becomes clear that all these are satanic acts and jugglery falling under acts warned against by the Prophet (peace be upon him), such as consulting diviners, soothsayers, augurs and the like. It is thus obligatory on officials in Muslim states to ban and eliminate such falsehood and prescribe deterrent penalties against those indulgent in them. It is also obligatory on editors-in-chief of Muslim newspapers not to publish such falsehood which might defame their newspapers. Rather, they have to criticize and refute it and warn people against the traps, deceptions and illusions of devils from among both human and Jinn. Indeed, Allah says the truth and guides to the straight path. We ask Him to reform the states of Muslims, grant them clear understanding of the religion, and protect them against the deception of criminals and the illusions of the friends of devils. Indeed, He is the Patron, Capable of all things. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Thabit Al-Bunani said: &#8216;It was reported to us that once Iblis manifested himself before Prophet Yahya (&#8216;alaihis-salaam).&#8217; Observing that he had numerous ropes on him, Yahya inquired:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> &#8220;O Iblis! What are these ropes that I see on you?&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;These ropes are the various lusts with which I strike on the children of Adam.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahya asked: &#8216;Does there exist a rope for me too?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Satan said: &#8216;Yes.&#8217; When you satiate yourself with food, you experience weightiness and it is for this reason you become disinclined to perform prayers, remembrance and supplications.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hearing this, Yahya vowed: By Allah! Never shall I eat to my fill, ever again.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Iblis responded by pledging: And by Allah, never shall I give advice to a Muslim, ever again.&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Through what avenues does the Shaytaan find a way to make suggestions to man?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">There are many avenues;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">He might try to incite someone to <strong>fornicate</strong>, for example. He first incites his victim to be alone with women, then to look at them, then to talk to them, then perhaps to listen to them sing, and so on until he achieves his end: when his victim fornicates.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Shaytaan may attack a person through his </span>stomach<span style="color:#000000;">, by tempting him into eating what is unlawful, into drinking <strong>alcohol</strong>, or even into taking <strong>drugs</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Shaytaan may find that a person has an inordinate love for owning things, so he biguiles him into gaining wealth through unlawful means:<strong> stealing, swindling, practicing usury, usurping, cheating.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">He may find that a person has a great deal of <strong>pride</strong>, so he will encourage him to belittle others, to be haughty with those inferior to him in society,</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">and the list of Shaytaan&#8217;s tricks is endless.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">May Allaah send peace and blessings on Muhammad, his family, and his Companions.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Paperback 592 Pages<br />
ISBN : 9780904336051<br />
Publisher : Dar as-Sunnah</p>
<p><strong>About The Book</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is from enmity and hopelessness of the devil that his endeavour to misguide mankind from the Path of Allah will persist. This misguidance takes many shades and forms; be it from planting seeds of doubt, or giving rise to deviant ideas antithetical to the sacred teachings of Islam, and essentially becoming entangled within regressive intellectual and rhetorical discourses. The Ummah has suffered varying levels of deviation, some of which remain prevalent today, while more continue to be uncovered &#8211; and such is the impact of delusive plottings of the devil and his allies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This book is the sixth instalment from Dar as-Sunnah of the illustrious Imam, Abu&#8217;l-Faraj Ibn Jawzi. Being a complete translation of his well-known and prized work, Ibn Jawzi enumerates within it, many of the mechanisms and modus operandi used by the devil in deceiving and leading mankind away from the Straight Path. It is of particular value and importance because only by unearthing and accentuating some of the traps of the devil, can mankind avoid them as well as navigate others away from falling prey to his harm.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Speaking about the devil and his plotting, the author wrote that, &#8220;he was only able to do so while creeping during the night of ignorance. Had the dawn of knowledge shone on him, he would have been exposed. Thus I decided to warn from his plots for identifying evil is a form of warning from it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This translation of Tablees Iblees will provide important analysis in developing self-awareness and critical thinking to ward off many deceptions of the devil, which have plagued mankind from the time of Adam. For such reasons alone, this work is a valuable addition to the scholarly discourse it presents to the English speaking world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>About the Author:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abu&#8217;l-Faraj Jamal al-Din Abdul Rahman ibn Ali Ibn Muhammad ibn Ali Ibn Ubayd Allah Ibn al-Jawzi al-Qurashi al Tamimi al Bakri al-Baghdadi al-Hanbali (509/510-597) was the Imam of the Hanbalis and foremost orator of kings and commoners in his time, whose gatherings reportedly reached one hundred thousand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A hadith master, philologist, commentator of Qur&#8217;an, expert jurist, physician, and historian of superb character and exquisite manners.<br />
Ibn al-Jawzi was a prolific author of over seven hundred books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was the author of a vast number of works of which several have been printed in recent times. He was famous as a preacher and the traveller Ibn Jubair gives an enthusiastic account of two of his sermons heard in Baghdad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was born in 509/510 AH in the city of Baghdad and grew up studying under the leading scholars of the time, He also was noted for his scholarship in the fields of history, linguistics, tafseer and fiqh. In fact, he became the leading scholar of the Hanbali Madhab of his time and played an important role in reviving and spreading it, especially after the become a favorite of the Abassid Caliph, al Mustadi</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Jawzi was severely tried towards the end of his life when his criticism of Shaykh `Abd al-Qadir al-Gilani &#8211; his senior of forty years &#8211; led to accusations made against him to the Sultan al-Nasir by the Shaykh&#8217;s children and supporters. He was taken from Baghdad to the city of Wasit where he remained imprisoned for five years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Jawzi passed away in 597 AH, two years after his release from Imprisonment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">From the excellent book (published by al-ibaanah) <strong><em>The Rules and Etiquettes of Ruqya</em></strong>, by Shaikh Saalih Aalush-Shaikh p.37-39 </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">“When Shaikh Abdullah Al-Qar’aawee<a style="color:#b85b5a;" href="http://us.mg4.mail.yahoo.com/dc/blank.html?bn=397.8&amp;.intl=us&amp;.lang=en-US#sdfootnote1sym" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" name="sdfootnote1anc"></a><sup>1</sup> came to our region, many people were suffering from illnesses; they were bed-ridden and couldn’t get up. And what was this due to? It was due to the Jinn and so on and so forth. They would go out and come across the Jinn at night in trees and upon the roads and so on, and the devils would take over them. This is because they were ignorant. They didn’t have any understanding of Tawheed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">So when he (i.e. Shaikh Al-Qar’aawee) came and spread Tawheed<strong>, </strong>not ruqyah or anything else, may Allah bless you, all of these things came to an end. All of these (possessions and illnesses) came to an end once Tawheed and knowledge spread. When Tawheed and knowledge spread, these things go away and come to an end. And when ignorance becomes widespread, sorcerers, soothsayers, devils and so on increase and cooperate with one another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I advised him to do as the good doers in the past did, which was to call to Tawheed and wage war against shirk and false superstitions such that the devils left them and they had no need for people to perform ruqyah on them from devils, sorcerers or anyone else….”</p>
<div id="sdfootnote1">
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]<strong>Translator’s Note:</strong>Shaikh Abdullah Al-Qar’aawee was born in 1315H in Saudi Arabia where he played a great role in reviving the call to Islaam, particularly in its southern regions, making Saamitah the center of his efforts. He studied under such Scholars as Shaikh Muhammad bin Ibtaheem, the former muftee of Saudi Arabia, and produced students of his own such as Shaikh Haafidh Al-Hakamee. He passed away in 1389H, may Allah have mercy on him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Origins of Shirk [1]<br />
Al-Ibaanah Magazine , Issue No.3 &#8211; Dhul-Qa’dah 1416H / April 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From that which has been established in the Sharee&#8217;ah (prescribed law) is that mankind was &#8211; in the beginning &#8211; a single nation upn true Tawheed, then Shirk (directing any part or form of worship, or anything else that is solely the right of Allaah, to other than Allaah) gradually overcame them. The basis for this is the saying of Allaah &#8211; the Most Blessed, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;Mankind was one Ummah, then Allaah sent prophets bringing good news and warnings.&#8221;</strong> (Soorah Baqarah 2:213)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbaas &#8211; radiallaahu &#8216;anhu &#8211; said: &#8220;Between Nooh (Noah) and Adam were ten generations, all of them were upon Sharee&#8217;ah (law) of the truth, then they differed. So Allaah sent prophets as bringers of good news and as warners.&#8221; [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Urwah al-Hanbalee (d.837 H) said: &#8220;This saying refutes those historians from the People of the Book who claim that Qaabil (Cain) and his sons were fire-worshippers.&#8221; [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: In it is also a refutation of some of the philosophers and atheists who claim that the (natural) basis of man is Shirk, and that Tawheed evolved in man! The preceeding aayah (verse) falsifies this claim, as do the two following authentic hadith:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Firstly: His (the prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) saying that he related from his Lord (Allaah) : <em> &#8220;I created all my servants upon the true Religion (upon Tawheed, free from Shirk). Then the devils came to them and led them astray from their true Religion. They made unlawful to people that which I had made lawful for them, and they commanded them to associate in worship with Me, that which I had sent down no authority.&#8221;</em> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Secondly: His (the prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) saying: <em> &#8220;Every child is born upon the Fitrah [5] but his parents make him a jew or a christian or a magian. It is like the way an animal gives birth to a natural offspring. have you noticed any born mutilated, before you mutilate them.&#8221; </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah said: Recite if you wish: <strong> &#8220;Allaah&#8217;s fitrah with which He created mankind. There is to be no change to the creation (Religion) of Allaah.&#8221;</strong> (Soorah ar-Rum 30:30) [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After this clear explanation, it is of the upmost importance for the Muslim to know how Shirk spread amongst the believers, after they were muwahhideen (people upon Tawheed). Concerning the saying of Allaah &#8211; the most perfect &#8211; about the people of Nooh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;And they have said : You shall not forsake your gods, nor shall you forsake Wadd, nor Suwaa&#8217;, nor Yaghooth, nor Ya&#8217;ooq, nor Nasr.&#8221;</strong> (Soorah Nooh 71:23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been related by a group from the Salaf (Pious Predecessors), in many narrations, that these five deities were righteous worshippers. However, when they died, Shaytaan (Satan) whispered into their people to retreat and sit at their graves. Then Shaytaan whispered to those who came after them that they should take them as idols, beautifying to them the idea that you will be reminded of them and thereby follow them in righteous conduct. Then Shaytaan suggested to the third generation that they should worship these idols besides Allaah &#8211; the most high &#8211; and he whispered to them that this is what their forefathers used to do!!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah sent to them Nooh alayhis-salaam, commanding them to worship Allaah alone. However none responded to hiscall except a few. Allaah &#8211; the mighty and majestic &#8211; related this whole incident in Soorah Nooh Ibn &#8216;Abbas relates: &#8220;Indeed these five names of righteous men from the people of Nooh. When they died Shataan whispered to their people to make statues of them and to place these statues in their places of gathering as a reminder of them, so they did this. However, none from amongst them worshipped these statues, until when they died and the purpose of the statues was forgotten. Then (the next generation) began to worship them.&#8221;[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The likes of this has also been related by Ibn Jareer at-Tabaree and others, from a number of the salaf (Pious Predecessors) &#8211; radiallaahu &#8216;anhum. In ad-Durral-Manthoor (6/269): &#8216;Abdullaah ibn Humaid relates from Abu Muttahar, who said: Yazeed ibn al-Muhallab was mentioned to Abu Ja&#8217;far al-Baaqir (d.11H), so he said: He was killed at the place where another besides Allaah was first worshipped. Then he mentioned Wadd and said: &#8220;Wadd was a Muslim man who was loved by his people. When he died, the people began to gather around his grave in the land of Baabil ( Babel ), lamenting and mourning. So when Iblees (Satan) saw them mourning and lamenting over him, he took the form of a man and came to them, saying : I see that you are mourning and lamenting over him. So why don&#8217;t you make a picture of him (i.e. a statue) and place it in your places of gatherings so that you maybe reminded of him. So they said: Yes, and they made a picture of him and put in their place of gathering; which reminded them of him. When Iblees saw how they were (excessively) remembering him, he said : &#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t every man amongst you make a similar picture to keep in your own houses, so that you can be (constantly) reminded of him.&#8221; So they all said &#8220;yes&#8221;. So each household made a picture of him, which they adored and venerated and which constantly reminded them of him. Abu Ja&#8217;far said: &#8220;Those from the later generation saw what the (pevious generation) had done and considered that&#8230;&#8230;..to the extent that they took him as an ilah (diety) to be worshipped besides Allaah. He then said :&#8221; This was the first idol worshipped other than Allaah, and they called this idol Wadd&#8221;[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus the wisdom of Allaah &#8211; the Blessed, the Most High &#8211; was fufilled, when he sent Muhammed sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam as the final prophet and made his Sharee&#8217;ah the completion of all divinely Prescribed Laws, in that He prohibited all means and avenues by which people may fall into Shirk &#8211; which is the greatest of sins. For this reason, building shrines over graves and intending to specifically travel to them, taking them as places of festivity and gathering and swearing an oath by the inmate of a grave; have all been prohibited. All of these lead to excessiveness and lead to the worship of other than Allaah &#8211; the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This being the case even more so in an age in which knowledge is diminishing, ignorance is increasing, thre are few sincere advisors ( to the truth) and shaytaan is co-operating with men and jinn to misguide mankind and to take them away from the worship of Allaah alone &#8211; the Blessed, the Most High.</p>

However, those who deviate from this do so due to following human weaknesses and blind following of others&#8230;..&#8221; Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajar said in Al-Fath (3/248): &#8220;The people differ concerning what is meant by al-Fitrah and the most famous saying is that it means Islaam. Ibn &#8216;abdul-Barr said: That is what was well known with most of the salaf (pious predecessors), and the scholars of tafseer are agreed that what is meant by the saying of Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; &#8220;Allaah&#8217;s fitrah wiht which He created mankind.&#8221; is Islaam</p>

However, no biography could be found for him, neither in ad-Dawlaabee&#8217;s al-Kunaa wal-Asmaa, nor Muslim&#8217;s al-Kunaa, nor any one elses. And the hidden defect here is that he is from the Shee&#8217;ah, but his biography is not included in at-Toosee&#8217;s al-Kunaa &#8212; from the index of Shee&#8217;ah narrators.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From Fatawah Islamiyyah Vol. 1 and 2<br />
Published by Darussalaam</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong style="line-height:1.5em;">The Remedy for Whispering (of Shaytan) in the Prayer</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I begin to pray, I am afflicted by a kind of whispering and thoughts, and sometimes I do not know what I have recited, not how many Raka&#8217;ahs I have prayed. Please advice me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is prescribed for the worshiper, man or woman, to approach the prayer with humility towards Allah and to call to mind that he stands before his Lord, so that Shaytan will stay away from him and the whispering will be reduced, in implementation of Allah&#8217;s Words: &#8220;Successful indeed are the believers. Those who offers their prayers with all solemnity and full submission.&#8221; [Soorah Muminoon (23): 1-2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the whispering become frequent, it is prescribed to seek refuge with Allah, from Shaytan, as the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) ordered Uthman Ibn Abi al-As when he informed him (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) that Shaytan had confused his prayers. And when the worshiper becomes confused as to the number of Raka&#8217;ahs he has prayed, he should assume the minimum, base his estimation upon what he is sure of, and then complete his prayer. Afterwards, he performs two prostration of forgetfulness before making the Tasleem, based upon the narration of Abu Said (radhi allahu anhu) from the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam) in which he said: &#8220;If any of you is in doubt regarding his prayer, and he does not know how much he has prayed, three or four (Raka&#8217;ahs) then let him cast aside doubt and base his estimation upon what he is sure of. Then prostrate twice before making the Tasleem; if he has prayed five, his prayer will be an intercessor for him, and if he has completed the prayer correctly, it will be a humiliation for Shaytan.&#8221; [Saheeh Muslim (571)], And Allah is the Grantor of success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Ibn Baz (rahimahullah)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Tafseer Ibn Kathir &#8211; Surah Fatihah</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[1]</strong><strong> Why the Devil is called Shaytan ?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Arabic language, Shaytan is derived from Shatana, which means the far thing. Hence, the Shaytan has a different nature than mankind, and his sinful ways are far away from every type of righteousness. It was also said that Shaytan is derived from Shata, (literally `burned&#8217;), because it was created from fire. Some scholars said that both meanings are correct, although they state that the first meaning is more plausible. Further, Siybawayh (the renowned Arab linguistic) said, &#8220;The Arabs say, `So-and-so has Tashaytan,&#8217; when he commits the act of the devils. If Shaytan was derived from Shata, they would have said, Tashayyata (rather than Tashaytan).&#8221; Hence, Shaytan is derived from the word that means, far away. This is why they call those who are rebellious (or mischievous) from among the Jinns and mankind a `Shaytan&#8217;. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And so We have appointed for every Prophet enemies ـ Shayatin (devils) among mankind and Jinn, inspiring one another with adorned speech as a delusion (or by way of deception)) (6:112).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, the Musnad by Imam Ahmad records that Abu Dharr said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Abu Dharr! Seek refuge with Allah from the devils of mankind and the Jinns.) Abu Dharr said, &#8220;I asked him , `Are there human devils&#8217; He said, (Yes.)&#8221; Furthermore, it is recorded in Sahih Muslim that Abu Dharr said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The woman, the donkey and the black dog interrupt the prayer (if they pass in front of those who do not pray behind a Sutrah, i.e. a barrier).) Abu Dharr said, &#8220;I said, `What is the difference between the black dog and the red or yellow dog&#8217; He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The black dog is a devil.).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Ibn Jarir At-Tabari recorded that `Umar bin Al-Khattab once rode a Berthawn (huge camel) which started to proceed arrogantly. `Umar kept striking the animal, but the animal kept walking in an arrogant manner. `Umar dismounted the animal and said, &#8220;By Allah! You have carried me on a Shaytan. I did not come down from it until after I had felt something strange in my heart.&#8221; This Hadith has an authentic chain of narrators.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[2] What does Isti`adhah mean</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Isti`adhah means, &#8220;I seek refuge with Allah from the cursed Satan so that he is prevented from affecting my religious or worldly affairs, or hindering me from adhering to what I was commanded, or luring me into what I was prohibited from.&#8221; Indeed, only Allah is able to prevent the evil of Satan from touching the son of Adam. This is why Allah allowed us to be lenient and kind with the human devil, so that his soft nature might cause him to refrain from the evil he is indulging in. However, Allah required us to seek refuge with Him from the evil of Satan, because he neither accepts bribes nor does kindness affect him, for he is pure evil. Thus, only He Who created Satan is able to stop his evil. This meaning is reiterated in only three Ayat in the Qur&#8217;an. Allah said in Surat Al-A`raf,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the foolish (i.e. don&#8217;t punish them).) (7:199)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is about dealing with human beings. He then said in the same Surah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And if an evil whisper comes to you from Shaytan, then seek refuge with Allah. Verily, He is Hearing, Knowing (7: 200).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah also said in Surat Al-Mu&#8217;minun,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Repel evil with that which is better. We are Best-Acquainted with the things they utter. And say: &#8220;My Lord! I seek refuge with You from the whisperings (suggestions) of the Shayatin (devils). And I seek refuge with You, My Lord! lest they should come near me.&#8221; (23:96-98).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further, Allah said in Surat As-Sajdah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal. Repel (the evil) with one which is better, then verily he, between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend. But none is granted it (the above quality) except those who are patient ـ and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion (of happiness in the Hereafter, i.e. Paradise and of a high moral character) in this world. And if an evil whisper from Shaytan tries to turn you away (from doing good), then seek refuge in Allah. Verily, He is the Hearing, the Knowing) (41:34-36).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[3] The Tafsir of Isti`adhah (seeking Refuge)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and stay away from the foolish (i.e. don&#8217;t punish them). And if an evil whisper comes to you from Shaytan (Satan), then seek refuge with Allah. Verily, He is Hearing, Knowing) (7:199-200),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Repel evil with that which is better. We are Best-Acquainted with things they utter. And say: &#8220;My Lord! I seek refuge with You from the whisperings (suggestions) of the Shayatin (devils). And I seek refuge with You, My Lord! lest they should come near me.&#8221;) (23:96-98) and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Repel (an evil) with one which is better, then verily he with whom there was enmity between you, (will become) as though he was a close friend. But none is granted it except those who are patient ـ and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion (of happiness in the Hereafter, i.e. Paradise and of a high moral character) in this world. And if an evil whisper from Shaytan tries to turn you away (O Muhammad ) (from doing good), then seek refuge in Allah. Verily, He is the Hearing, the Knowing.) (41:34-36) These are the only three Ayat that carry this meaning. Allah commanded that we be lenient human enemy, so that his soft nature might make him an ally and a supporter. He also commanded that we seek refuge from the satanic enemy, because the devil does not relent in his enmity if we treat him with kindness and leniency. The devil only seeks the destruction of the Son of Adam due to the vicious enmity and hatred he has always had towards man&#8217;s father, Adam. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Children of Adam! Let not Shaytan deceive you, as he got your parents ﴿Adam and Hawwa&#8217; (Eve)﴾ out of Paradise) (7:27),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surely, Shaytan is an enemy to you, so take (treat) him as an enemy. He only invites his Hizb (followers) that they may become the dwellers of the blazing Fire) (35:6) and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Will you then take him (Iblis) and his offspring as protectors and helpers rather than Me while they are enemies to you What an evil is the exchange for the Zalimun (polytheists, and wrongdoers, etc)) (18:50).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The devil assured Adam that he wanted to advise him, but he was lying. Hence, how would he treat us after he had vowed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;By Your might, then I will surely, mislead them all. Except Your chosen servants among them (i.e. faithful, obedient, true believers of Islamic Monotheism).&#8221;) (38:82-83)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So when you ﴿want to﴾ recite the Qur&#8217;an, seek refuge with Allah from Shaytan, the outcast (the cursed one). Verily, he has no power over those who believe and put their trust only in their Lord (Allah). His power is only over those who obey and follow him (Satan), and those who join partners with Him.) (16:98-100).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[4] The Meaning of Ar-Rajim</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ar-Rajim means, being expelled from all types of righteousness. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And indeed We have adorned the nearest heaven with lamps, and We have made such lamps Rujuman (as missiles) to drive away the Shayatin (devils)) (67:5).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah also said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, We have adorned the near heaven with the stars (for beauty). And to guard against every rebellious devil. They cannot listen to the higher group (angels) for they are pelted from every side. Outcast, and theirs is a constant (or painful) torment. Except such as snatch away something by stealing, and they are pursued by a flaming fire of piercing brightness) (37:6-10).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And indeed, We have put the big stars in the heaven and We beautified it for the beholders. And We have guarded it (near heaven) from every Shaytan Rajim (outcast Shaytan). Except him (devil) who steals the hearing then he is pursued by a clear flaming fire.) (15:16-18).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are several similar Ayat. It was also said that Rajim means, the person who throws or bombards things, because the devil throws doubts and evil thoughts in people&#8217;s hearts. The first meaning is more popular and accurate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[5] Virtues of the Isti`adhah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Isti`adhah cleanses the mouth from the foul speech that it has indulged in. It also purifies the mouth and prepares it to recite the speech of Allah. Further, the Isti`adhah entails seeking Allah&#8217;s help and acknowledging His ability to do everything. The Isti`adhah also affirms the servant&#8217;s meekness, weakness and inability to face the enemy of his inner evil, whom Allah alone, Who created this enemy, is able to repel and defeat. This enemy does not accept kindness, unlike the human enemy. There are three Ayat in the Qur&#8217;an that affirm this fact. Also, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, My servants (i.e. the true believers of Islamic Monotheism) ـ you have no authority over them. And sufficient is your Lord as a Guardian.) (17:65).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We should state here that the believers, whom the human enemies kill, become martyrs, while those who fall victim to the inner enemy &#8211; Satan &#8211; become bandits. Further, the believers who are defeated by the apparent enemy &#8211; disbelievers &#8211; gain a reward, while those defeated by the inner enemy earn a sin and become misguided. Since Satan sees man where man cannot see him, it is befitting that the believers seek refuge from Satan with Whom Satan cannot see. The Isti`adhah is a form of drawing closer to Allah and seeking refuge with Him from the evil of every evil creature.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[6] Is the Isti`adhah (seeking Refuge) required</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The majority of the scholars state that reciting the Isti`adhah (in the prayer and when reciting the Qur&#8217;an) is recommended and not required, and therefore, not reciting it does not constitute a sin. However, Ar-Razi recorded that `Ata&#8217; bin Abi Rabah said that the Isti`adhah is required in the prayer and when one reads the Qur&#8217;an. In support of `Ata&#8217;s statement, Ar-Razi relied upon the apparent meaning of the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then seek refuge.) He said that the Ayah contains a command that requires implementation. Also, the Prophet always said the Isti`adhah. In addition, the Isti`adhah wards off the evil of Satan, which is neccessary, the rule is that the means needed to implement a requirement of the religion is itself also required. And when one says, &#8220;I seek refuge with Allah from the cursed devil.&#8221; Then this will suffice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[7] Seeking Refuge before reciting the Qur&#8217;an</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So when you ﴿want to﴾ recite the Qur&#8217;an, seek refuge with Allah from Shaytan, the outcast (the cursed one).) meaning, before you recite the Qur&#8217;an. Similarly, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When you intend to offer As-Salah (the prayer), wash your faces and your hands (forearms)) (5:6) meaning, before you stand in prayer, as evident by the Hadiths that we mentioned. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, &#8220;When the Messenger of Allah would stand up in prayer at night, he would start his prayer with the Takbir (saying &#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8221;; Allah is Greater) and would then supplicate,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(All praise is due to You, O Allah, and also the thanks. Blessed be Your Name, Exalted be Your sovereignty, and there is no deity worthy of worship except You.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would then say thrice,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah,).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would then say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(I seek refuge with Allah, the Hearing, the Knowing, from the cursed Satan, from his coercion, lures to arrogance and poems.).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The four collectors of the Sunan recorded this Hadith, which At-Tirmidhi considered the most famous Hadith on this subject.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah recorded that Jubayr bin Mut`im said that his father said, &#8220;When the Messenger of Allah started the prayer, he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah is the Greater, truly the Greatest (thrice); all praise is due to Allah always (thrice); and all praise is due to Allah day and night (thrice). O Allah! I seek refuge with You from the cursed Satan, from his Hamz, Nafkh and Nafth.).&#8221; `Amr said, &#8220;The Hamz means asphyxiation, the Nafkh means arrogance, and the Nafth means poetry.&#8221; Also, Ibn Majah recorded that `Ali bin Al-Mundhir said that Ibn Fudayl narrated that `Ata&#8217; bin As-Sa&#8217;ib said that Abu `Abdur-Rahman As-Sulami said that Ibn Mas`ud said that the Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Allah! I seek refuge with You from the cursed devil, from his Hamz, Nafkh and Nafth.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8220;The Hamz means death, the Nafkh means arrogance, and the Nafth means poetry.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] Seeking Refuge with Allah when One is Angry</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his Musnad, Al-Hafiz Abu Ya`la Ahmad bin `Ali bin Al-Muthanna Al-Mawsili reported that Ubayy bin Ka`b said, &#8220;Two men disputed with each other in the presence of the Messenger of Allah and the nose of one of them became swollen because of extreme anger. The Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(I know of some words that if he said them, what he feels will go away, &#8216;I seek refuge with Allah from the cursed Satan.&#8217;)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nasa&#8217;i also recorded this Hadith in his book, Al-Yawm wal-Laylah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari recorded that Sulayman bin Surad said, &#8220;Two men disputed in the presence of the Prophet while we were sitting with him. One of them was cursing the other fellow and his face turned red due to anger. The Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(I know of a statement which if he said it, will make what he feels disappear, `I seek refuge with Allah from the cursed Satan.&#8217;) They said to the man, `Do you not hear what the Messenger of Allah is saying&#8217; He said, `I am not insane.&#8221;&#8217; Also, Muslim, Abu Dawud and An-Nasa&#8217;i recorded this Hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many other Hadiths about seeking refuge with Allah. One can find this subject in the books on supplication and the virtues of righteous, good deeds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Fatawa Arkanul Islam<br />
</span>Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Uthaymeen (Rahimallah) Pgs. 55-60</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a man who suffers from the whisperings of Shaytan. He whispers things to him that are great sins, concerning Allah, the Almighty, the All-Powerful and he is very much afraid of this; what is the advice of your eminence?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding what has been mentioned concerning the problem of the questioner, which is that he fears the result of it, I say to him: Rejoice at the good news that there will be no result from it except a good result. This is the whispering by which Shaytan assails the believers in order to upset the sound belief in their hearts and to cause them sprirtual and mental agitation and disturb the serenity of their faith, indeed the serenity of their lives, if they are believers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is not the 1st among the people of faith to be confronted by this situation, nor is he the last, for it will continue as long as there is a believer in the world; and this same situation confronted the Sahabahs (radiallahu anhum), for it was reported o­n the authority of Abu Hurayrah (radiallahu anhu) that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Some people from among the Companions of the Messenger of Allah came to the Rasool (alayhi salatul wasalam) and said to him, &#8216;Verily we perceive in our minds that which every o­ne of us considers too grave to express&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (alayhi salatul wasalam) said: &#8220;Do you really perceive it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;They said: &#8220;Yes&#8221;. Upon this he (alayhi salatul wasalam) remarked:&#8221;That is true faith.&#8221; *</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* [(It was reported by Muslim in the Book of Faith, in the Chapter of Explanation of the (evil) whispering regarding Faith (132)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Two Sahihs , it is also narrated from Abu Hurayrah (radiallahu anhu) that the Rasool (alayhi salatul wasalam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Satan may come to anyone of you and say: &#8216;Who created such and such? Who created such and such?&#8217; until he says, &#8216;Who created your Lord?&#8217; So, when he inspires such a question, o­ne should seek refuge w/Allah and give up such thoughts.&#8221; *</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* (Reported by Bukhari in the Book of Beginning of Creation, in the Chapter: The description of Iblis and his Legions (3276) and it was reported by Muslim in the Book of Faith, in the Chapter o­n the Description of the (evil) Whispering regarding Faith (134).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported o­n the authority of Ibn Abbas (radiallahu anhu) that a man came to the Rasool (alayhi salatul wasalam) and said: &#8220;Oh, Messenger of Allah! o­ne of us has thoughts of such a nature that he would rather be reduced to charcoal than speak about them.&#8221; The Rasool (alayhi salatul wasalam) said:&#8221;All praise and thanks be to Allah who has reduced his matter (shaytan&#8217;s guile) to (evil) whispering.&#8221; *</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">*(It was reported by Abu Dawud in the Book of Good Manners, in the Chapter: Regarding the response to (evil) Whispering (5112) and by Imam Ahmed in Al-Musnad (1:340)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul Islam Ibn Taymiyah (rahimallah) said in the Book of Faith:<br />
&#8220;The believer is put to trial by the whispering of Satan, the whispering of kufr which causes him distress, as the Companions (radiallahu anhum) said: &#8220;Oh Messenger of Allah! o­ne of us has thoughts within himself of such a nature that he would rather fall down from the heaven than speak of them.&#8221; The Rasool (alayhi salatul wasalam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;That is true faith&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration: &#8220;he considers it too grave to express.&#8221; He (alayhi salatul wasalam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;All praise and thanks are Allah&#8217;s who has reduced his (shaytan) intrigue to (evil) whispering)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is, the occurence of his whispering along with this great hatred for it and repelling it from the heart is a part of true faith, like the warrior in Allah&#8217;s Cause who met the enemy and fought him until he overcame him, for that is a great Jihad up to his words.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This why the seekers of knowledge and worship are assailed by whispering and uncertainty which do not afflict another, b/c he (the other) does not follow the Law of Allah and His way; rather, he follows his own desires, heedless of the rememberance of his Lord and this is the goal of Shaytan, as opposed to those who turn towards their Lord with knowledge and (acts of ) worship, for he is their enemy and he seeks to prevent them from (worshipping) Allah, the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, I say to this questioner: o­nce it is clear to you that this whispering is from Shaytan, then you must struggle and stand against it, know that it will never harm you as long as you undertake the necessary struggle, reject it and cease thinking about it. The Rasool (alayhi salatul wasalam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allah has forgiven what is whispered in the hearts of my followers, unless they put it into action or utter it.&#8221; *</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">*(Reported by Bukhari in the Book of Manumission, in the Chapter: Error and Forgetfulness in Manumission and Divorce (2528) and by Muslim in the Book of Faith, in the Chapter: Allah has forgiven what is whispered in heart (127)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if it is said to you:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do you believe what is whispered to you? And do you think it is the truth? And is it possible to describe Allah, the Most Glorified by it? You would say: It is not for us to speak of this; Glorified are You (Oh Allah), this is a great lie! You would reject it with your heart and by your words; and of the people, you would flee further than any of them from it. Then it is, o­nly whispering and perils displayed to your heart, and a window to polythesim from Shaytan, who courses throughout the human body as blood courses through it, in order to destroy and obscure your deen for you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why you find that Shaytan does not place doubt or rejection about trivial things in your heart, so you hear for example, of the existence of large and important cities filled w/residents and buildings in the east and west and yet doubt their existence never o­nce crossed your mind, nor regarding their faults, such as that their buildings are destroyed or are unfit for habitation or that there are no occupants in them and so o­n. There is no goal for Shaytan in making man kind doubt such things. But Shaytan&#8217;s important great goal is destroying the faith of the believer, so he strives by his horse, and o­n o­n foot, to extinguish the light of knowledge and guidance in o­ne&#8217;s heart and to cause him to fall into the darkness of doubt and uncertainty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Rasool (alayhi salatul wasalam) explained the beneficial medicine which contains a cure for this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Then let him seek refuge with Allah and cease doing it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a person ceases doing that and continues to worship Allah, seeking &amp; desiring that which is with Allah, it will stop troubling him, by Allah&#8217;s Power. So, avoid all suppositions which pass through your heart o­n this subject and worship Allah, supplicate to Him and glorfiy Him, and if you heard anyone describing Him with what was whispered to him, you would kill him if you could. Therefore, what is whispered is not a fact; rather it is simply thoughts and whisperings which have no basis. Like in the case of someone wearing a clean garment which he has just washed and then he is assailed by thoughts that maybe it is impure, and maybe it is not permissble to pray in it, but he should pay no heed to this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And my advice may be summarized as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Seek protection with Allah and completely stop these suppositions as the Rasool (alayhi salatul wasalam) ordered us to do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Mention Allah, the Most High and restrain yourself from this whisperings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Wholehearted dedication to worship and acting in accordance with the Command of Allah and seeking His Pleasure, for when you give worship your undivided attention with earnestness and striving, you will forget about occupying yourself with this whispering, Inshallah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Seeking refuge with Allah much and asking Him to protect you from this thing.And I ask Allah, the Most High for protection for you and safety from every evil and every destable thing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">

</strong>#85 -Owais Al-Hashimi (hafidhahullaah)<br />
<cite>Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawzīyah, Al-Fawā`id 1:277</cite></p>
<div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>Every intelligent person knows that Shaytān has no way to [attack] him except from three angles:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>1. Extravagance</strong>. [A person] takes more than he needs, so it becomes superfluous; and [surplus] is the share of Shaytān and his point of entry to the heart. The way to avoid this is to avoid giving the self all it wants of food, sleep, pleasure and comfort. When you close this door, you will be safe from the enemy entering through it.</span></p></blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>2. Heedlessness</strong>. One who remembers [Allāh] is in an impenetrable fortress. If he becomes forgetful and heedless, he opens the gates of the fortress, and the enemy enters, after which it is difficult to expel him.</span></div>
</blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>3. Affectation</strong> of what does not concern oneself, or what one is not qualified to involve oneself in.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>بسم الله و الحمد لله، والصلاة والســلام على رسول الله و على آله وصحبه أجمعين. أما بعد</p>



<p>Allaah the Most High said:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">{ يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا ادْخُلُوا فِي السِّلْمِ كَافَّةً وَلَا تَتَّبِعُوا خُطُوَاتِ الشَّيْطَانِ إِنَّهُ لَكُمْ عَدُوٌّ مُبِينٌ }</h3>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>&#8220;O you who believe! Enter perfectly in Islaam and do not follow the footsteps of shaytaan.&nbsp;Verily! He is to you a plain enemy.&#8221;</strong> [<i>Al-Baqarah</i> (2):208]</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">{ إِنَّ الشَّيْطَانَ لِلْإِنْسَانِ عَدُوٌّ مُبِينٌ }</h3>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><strong>&#8220;Verily! shay<span style="text-decoration:underline;">t</span>aan&nbsp; is to man an open enemy!&#8221; </strong>[<i>Yoosuf </i>(12):5]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And Allaah (تبارك و تعالى) consistently warns us from our enemy throughout His Book, and likewise His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) in the authentic Sunnah, warning us from the plots and deception of shay<span style="text-decoration:underline;">t</span>aan and his followers &#8211; from both the jinn and mankind&nbsp; &#8211; like the people of <i>shirk</i>, <i>kufr</i>, and&nbsp; <i>bid&#8217;ah</i>.</p>



<p>And the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><b>«</b>إِنَّ الشَّيْطَانَ يَجْرِي مِنَ الإِنْسَانِ مَجْرَى الدَّمِ <b>»</b></h3>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><strong>“Verily shaytaan runs through the human being like the running of blood.”</strong><em>&nbsp;</em> [1]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And <i>Al-<span style="text-decoration:underline;">H</span>aafi<span style="text-decoration:underline;">th</span></i> Ibn <span style="text-decoration:underline;">H</span>ajr (رحمه الله) said regarding this <i><span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>adeeth</i>:&nbsp; “And his saying&nbsp; ((<b><i>he penetrates</i></b>)) or ((<b><i>he runs</i></b>)), it is said that it is on its apparent meaning, and that Allaah the Most High gave him the ability to do that, and it is said that it is figurative, referring to the abundance and tremendous amount of his misguidance, enticements, and his whisperings.” [<i>al-Fat<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span></i> (4/1982)]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">So there is no doubt that shay<span style="text-decoration:underline;">t</span>aan is an enemy who does not cease to attack the believer with doubts, confusion, and whisperings, constantly prodding him towards that which will misguide him and lead to his destruction.&nbsp; But the remedy for these attacks have been prescribed for us by Allaah and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم).&nbsp; Allaah says:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">{ وَإِمَّا يَنْزَغَنَّكَ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ نَزْغٌ فَاسْتَعِذْ بِاللَّهِ إِنَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ * إِنَّ الَّذِينَ اتَّقَوْا إِذَا مَسَّهُمْ طَائِفٌ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ تَذَكَّرُوا فَإِذَا هُمْ مُبْصِرُونَ }</h3>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>&#8220;And if an evil whisper comes to you from shaytaan, then seek refuge with Allaah.

<p class="has-text-align-justify">So with the permission of Allaah, we would like to present a series of posts reminding Ahlus-Sunnah of some of those <i>a<span style="text-decoration:underline;">dh</span>kaar</i> and <i>ad&#8217;iyyah</i> found in the authentic Sunnah of our Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم that the <i>sunnee, </i>the <i>atharee</i> can use to protect himself from the plots and whisperings of shay<span style="text-decoration:underline;">t</span>aan and other types of harm.</p>

<p>The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">« وَإِيَّاكُمْ وَالْغُلُوَّ فِي الدِّينِ، فَإِنَّمَا أَهْلَكَ مَنْ كَانَ قَبْلَكُمُ الْغُلُوُّ فِي الدِّينِ »</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>“Beware of ghuloo in the Deen, for indeed those who came before you were only destroyed by ghuloo in the Deen.” </em>[1]</p>



<p>Shaykhul-Islaam Ibnu Taymiyyah (رحمه الله) said regarding this hadeeth: “ –</p>



<p><span style="color:#993300;">(This) is general in regards to every type and category of Ghuloo, in I’tiqaad (the matters of ‘Aqeedah) and in actions. And Ghuloo (is): going beyond and exceeding the limits by increasing something in its praise, or dispraise, beyond what it rightfully deserves, and the like of that.”</span> [2]</p>



<p>Al-Imaam Ibnul-Qayyim (رحمه الله) said:</p>



<p><span style="color:#993300;">“Allaah did not order with a command except that shaytaan has an avenue to incite evil in it, either towards negligence and wastefulness, or towards excessiveness and extremism (ghuloo). And the Deen of Allaah is in the middle between abandonment and neglect, and excessiveness and extremism, like the valley between two mountains. And al-Hudaa (guidance) is between two ways of misguidance, and the middle ground between two sides that are dispraised. So just like abandoning the command is squandering it and throwing it away, so then excessiveness and extremism in it is to corrupt and ruin it. This one is by falling short of the limits, and this one is by going beyond the limits.”</span> [3]</p>



<p>And Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah said:</p>



<p><span style="color:#993300;">“And whoever seeks to get close to Allaah by what is not from the hasanaat that have been commanded, (not) by a command of obligation nor (a command) of recommendation, then he is astray, following the shaytaan, and his path is from the paths of shaytaan…”</span> [4]</p>



<p>And this is what leads to bid&#8217;ah and deviation.</p>



<p>Allaah said in His Book:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="font-family:Traditional Arabic;font-size:x-large;">وَأَنَّ هَـذَا صِرَاطِي مُسْتَقِيمًا فَاتَّبِعُوهُ وَلاَ تَتَّبِعُواْ السُّبُلَ فَتَفَرَّقَ بِكُمْ عَن سَبِيلِهِ ذَلِكُمْ وَصَّاكُم بِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ</span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>&#8220;And verily, this is my Straight Path, so follow it, and do not follow (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His Path. This He has ordained for you so that you may have Taqwaa.&#8221; </em>[5]</p>



<p>‘Abdullaah bin Mas’ood said [6]: The Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) drew a line for us (on the ground), then he said:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">« هَذَا سَبِيلُ اللَّهِ »</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">“This is the Path of Allaah.”</p>



<p>Then he drew lines on it’s right and on it’s left, then he said:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">« هَذِهِ سُبُلٌ مُتَفَرِّقَةٌ &#8211; عَلَى كُلِّ سَبِيلٍ مِنْهَا شَيْطَانٌ يَدْعُو إِلَيْهِ »</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">“These are the other paths – on every one of them is a shaytaan calling to it.”</p>



<p>Then he recited this aayah.</p>



<p>And Allaah said in His Book:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="font-family:Traditional Arabic;font-size:x-large;">قُلْ يَا أَهْلَ الْكِتَابِ لاَ تَغْلُواْ فِي دِينِكُمْ غَيْرَ الْحَقِّ وَلاَ تَتَّبِعُواْ أَهْوَاء قَوْمٍ قَدْ ضَلُّواْ مِن قَبْلُ وَأَضَلُّواْ كَثِيراً وَضَلُّواْ عَن سَوَاء السَّبِيلِ</span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>“Say (O Muhammad): ‘O Ahlul-Kitaab! Do not go to extremes and exceed the limits in your deen (by believing in something) other than the Haqq, and do not follow the vain desires of people who went astray in times gone by, and who misled many, and strayed (themselves) from the Right Path.’&#8221;</em> [7]</p>



<p>Ibnul-Mundhir, Ibn Abee Haatim, and Aboosh-Shaykh reported from Qataadah regarding the meaning of Allaah’s statement ﭓ ﭔ ﭕ ﭖ “Do not go to extremes and exceed the limits in your deen”: Qataadah said that it means: “do not innovate.”</p>



<p>So this aayah, even though it is addressed to Ahlul-Kitaab specifically, the Salaf have explained that it is general for all those who go to ghuloo from this Ummah, from the people of Bid’ah, and those who go beyond the boundaries of the Sharee’ah in their worship of Allaah.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">When a person makes ablution after having answered the call of nature, he feels a drop leave his private-part. What should he do?</span></p>
<p><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those are obsessive thoughts. After having answered the call of nature, he washes or dries and washes himself. He thereafter makes ablution and prays without paying attention to the obsessive thoughts and whether a drop has come out or not. Those are obsessive thoughts one should not care about.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Explaining the truth of the possibility of Jinn entering the human body and refuting the claims of those denying this [1]</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Source</strong> :  Fatwas of Ibn Baaz rahimahullaah &#8211; <a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/fatawaDetails.aspx?languagename=en&amp;BookID=14&amp;View=Page&amp;PageNo=1&amp;PageID=208" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">alifta.net</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh of Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful to him) also said in (vol.24, pp. 276-277) the following: The existence of Jinn is affirmed in the Book of Allah, the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace be upon him), and according to the consensus of the Salaf (Righteous Predecessors) of this Ummah and its leading scholars. Similarly the fact that the Jinn can enter human bodies is confirmed by the consensus of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah. Allah (the Exalted states) says: <img alt="" align="middle" border="0" />&#8220;<strong>Those who eat Ribâ (usury) will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaitân (Satan) leading him to insanity.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said in the Sahih (authentic) Hadith related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim on the authority of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Safiyyah </span>(may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="24546" class="tip"></span><strong>Satan circulates in the human body as blood does.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p>`Abdullah the son of Al-Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;I told my father that some people claim that Jinn can never enter the body of a person. He said, &#8216;O my son, they tell lies. Satan can even speak on the tongue of those whom he possesses.'&#8221; </strong></p>
<p>The Shaykh of Islam<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Ibn Taymiyyah</span> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;What he [Imam Ahmad] said is self-evident. The Jinn may possess someone and cause them to speak a language he does not even know. A possessed person may be violently beaten, in a way that even a camel may not endure, yet he neither feels the beating nor is aware of the words he says.&#8221; Furthermore, the possessed person may drag a non-possessed person and or the mat he is sitting on, moves things from a place to another, and other practices that confirmed to those who witnessed such behavior that the one who spoke or moved was not a human being.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said: &#8220;None of the leading Muslim scholars denied the ability of Jinn to enter the body of a human being. Whoever denies this fact and assumes that Shari`ah denies it has fabricated lies against Shari`ah, as there is no Shari`ah-based evidence that denies this fact.&#8221;</p>
<p>(End of quote)</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imam Ibn Al-Qayyim</strong></span> (may Allah be merciful to him) mentioned the following in his book, Zad Al-Ma`ad fi Hadiy Khayr Al-`Ibad, vol. 4, pp. 66-69:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There are two types of Jinn&#8217;s possession of human beings:</p>
<p>&#8211; Possession caused by earthly malicious spirits; and<br />
&#8211; the other caused by filthy mixtures.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the second type, it is the domain of physicians to find what causes it and how to treat it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the possession by spirits, the knowledgeable persons among them acknowledge its existence and do not deny it. They also admit that its treatment should be by confronting the celestial, benevolent and honorable spirits with that wicked and malicious ones to ward off the evil they cause and forestall their acts. This is even stated by Hippocrates in some of his books, as he mentioned some cures for possession. However, he said that his cure is only beneficial in case of possession caused by mixture of filthy blends, but not for that caused by evil spirits.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whereas, ignorant, worthless and disreputable physicians deny the possession by spirits and do not admit that they affect the body of the possessed person relying on no evidence to support their claims. They are only ignorant, as there is no medical proof to prove the impermissibility of this matter. The Jinn&#8217;s possession of human beings is an established fact and reality attests to it. However, the physicians&#8217; denial of possession and ascribing this to the occurrence of some filthy blends is partially, not completely true.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ignorant and atheist doctors started to attribute the possession of human beings as caused only by filthy blends, but anyone with the least knowledge of such spirits and how they affect the body of the possessed will be astonished at the ignorance of such people and the weakness of their perception of such matters.</p>
<p><strong>In the same article Shaykh Ibn Baaz refutes the one who denies Jinn Possession  as below</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah, his family, his Companions, and those who follow his guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some short and long articles were published in local newspapers and others in the month of Sha`ban of this year (1407 A.H.) regarding the declaration of some Jinn (creatures created from fire) who possessed Muslim women in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Riyadh. </span>They declared that they had become Muslims before me after they had declared this before brother<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Abdullah ibn Mushrif Al-`Umary </span>who lives in <span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Riyadh. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-`Umary recited some Adhkar (invocations) on the Jinn-possessed lady and talked to the Jinni, reminding him of Allah (Exalted be He) and His Omnipotence as well as frightening him with the grievous sin of injustice. After the Jinni said that he is a Buddhist disbeliever, the shaykh called him to Islam and to come out of the woman whom he was possessing. Accordingly, the Jinn complied and declared his conversion to Islam before Shaykh<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-`Umary. </span>Then, Shaykh Al-`Umary<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> </span>and the guardians of the woman wanted to come to me with the woman to hear the Jinni&#8217;s conversion to Islam. When they were all present, I asked the Jinni about the reason for embracing Islam. He spoke on the tongue of the woman but in a manly voice. All this happened in the presence of the woman who was sitting in the chair next to me beside her brother, sister,<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> and </span>Shaykh Al-`Umary as well as some shaykhs who witnessed and heard the speech of the Jinni while openly declaring his conversion to Islam. He said he was a Buddhist from India. On my part, I advised him to observe Taqwa (fear or wariness of offending Allah) and to leave the body of this woman as he is making her suffer. The Jinni submitted to my order and said that he embraced Islam willingly. Therefore, I advised himto call his people to Islam after Allah (Exalted be He) had guided him to the right path. He came out of the woman&#8217;s body and his last word was &#8220;As-salamu `alaykum&#8221; (peace be upon you). Then the woman spoke with her normal voice and felt comfortable and relaxed from the pain he was causing to her. After the lapse of a month or more, she visited me again with her brothers, maternal uncle, and sister and told me that she was very well, her condition was stable and the Jinni had never returned to her. When I asked her about how she felt when she was possessed by this Jinni, she said that she always had deviant ideas contradicting the Shari`ah (Islamic law), in addition to an inclination to the Buddhist religion, and a desire to read its books. However, after this Jinni was cast out of her, she no longer had such ideas, as she returned to her normal state away from such abominable ideas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was told that Shaykh<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Aly Al-Tantawy </span>denied the occurrence of such matters, claiming that this is a kind of charlatanism and mere lies. He said that the speech that was mentioned on the tongue of the woman might have been recorded, not real. I asked for the tape in which the Jinni had declared that, and was confirmed that such opinions are really his. However, I could not imagine how he could think that what the woman said was recorded even though I, myself, asked the Jinni some questions and he replied. Then how could a person having the least degree of wisdom imagine that a recorded tape can be asked and give answers. This is one of the ugliest abominations and a way of permitting falsehood.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">(<strong>Continuation on Wiswas</strong>, obsessive thoughts, whispers of satan)</p>
</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Salamu &#8216;alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh. I decided to continue on the issue of <strong>Wiswas</strong> and I hope you have benefited as I have benefited. Barak Allahu fikum, if you know someone who&#8217;s affected by this, then please forward it to him/her, let the present convey to the absent. I decided to pick out benefits that are very interesting from a book that was written by Ibn-ul-Qayyim (rahimahullâh) so enjoy, benefit and forward to others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Benefit 1: <em>They rejected the Sunnah of the prophet</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn Qayyim:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;They rejected the Sunnah of the prophet (salla Allahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), to the extent that someone thought that if he performed ablution in the manner of the prophet (salla Allahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and washed like him, he would still not be able to cleanse himself properly. The prophet (salla Allahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) used to perform Wudhu&#8217; (ablution) with a quarter of Syrian Ratl (I.e. Syrian measure equal to 3.202kh [3.202 litres of water]), and washed his body with one ratl and a quarter. A person who is under the influence of the devil&#8217;s inspiration would see that measure as not even enough to wash his hands.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Waswasah: The whispering of the Shaitan, english, p. 18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Benefit 2: &#8220;This is not enough for two people to wash properly!&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn Qayyim:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It was also reported that the prophet (salla Allahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) used to perform Ghusl (the major ritual ablution of the whole body) with &#8216;Aishah (radhiya Allahu &#8216;anha) using just one large bowl, in which some traces of dough remained. If the person, under the influence of Satan, heard of someone doing likewise, he would object to him, saying &#8220;This is not enough for two people to wash properly!&#8221;.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Ibid, p. 19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Benefit 3: A knowledgeable person</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imâm Ahmad (may Allah bless him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;A knowledgeable person should only use a small quantity of water.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Ibid, p. 20)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Benefit 4: The person under the influence of Satan&#8217;s whisperings would not agree</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn Qayyim:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When the prophet (salla Allahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) performed ablution or washed all his body, he used to put his hand inside the container to get water; he would rinse his mouth and wash his nose. The person under the influence of Satan&#8217;s whisperings would not agree; he would most likely consider that water as impure, and would never share one container with his wife! He would feel disgust at the thought of it, the way the disbeliever feels when Allah&#8217;s Name is mentioned.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Ibid, p. 20)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Benefit 5: Excessiveness in religion (Beware!)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbas (radhiya Allahu anh) said &#8220;In the morning of al-Aqabah, the prophet (salla Allahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said to me, while he (salla Allahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) was mounting his camel: &#8216;Pick up some stones for me&#8217;. So I collected seven stones for him. He then started shaking them in his hand and said: &#8216;Such people (who exceed the boundaries of Allah), you should aim at.&#8217; Then he (salla Allahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8216;O people, beware of excessiveness in religion; for people before you were destroyed by their excesses in religion.&#8221; (Recorded by Ahmad and an-Nassai.) (Ibid, p. 26)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Did you break wind or was it Shaytân pulling a hair?<br />
Also, how to prevent any waswasah in regards to urine-drops</span></strong></span></p>
</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Gasses during prayer or Shaytan pulling a hair from your back?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sa&#8217;id al-Khudri (radhiya Allahu &#8216;anh) reported that the prophet (salla Allahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8220;The devil may approach one of you during Salah, and pull a hair from your back. <strong>If the man were to imagine that his ablution had been broken</strong>, <span style="color:#ff6600;"><strong>he should not leave his prayer</strong></span>, unless he should hear a sound or perceive a smell.&#8221; (Recorded by Abu Dawud)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Waswasah: The whispering of the Shaitan, p. 44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>What to do in order to prevent any Waswasah in regards to urine drops after answering the call of nature?:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Abu Muhammad bin Qudamah al-Maqdisi said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It is recommended to sprinkle one&#8217;s private part and trousers with water after urinating (in the toilet), in order to prevent any waswasah. And so, if one finds any wetness in his clothing, he would say: &#8220;This is the water that I sprinkled there.&#8221; al-Hakam bin Sufyan at-Thaqafi (radhiya Allahu &#8216;anh) reported that when the prophet (salla Allahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) urinated, he performed ablution and sprinkled water on his private parts.&#8221; (Recorded by Abu Dawud)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Ibid, p. 44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These two gems are great reliefs for those who are affected by the whispers of Shaytân. You will see them remaking Wudhu&#8217; and prayers for several hours and in the end they even imagine that they have the disease of a 60 year old man, while just a month or two ago before they started to pray, they were totally healthy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh-ul-Islâm Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullâh, d. 728) wrote in “Kitâb-ul-Îmân”:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The believer is put to trial by the whisperings of the Devil and disbelieving thoughts that makes him feel bad/distress. The companions used to say: &#8220;Oh Messenger of Allâh! o­ne of us feels something of such a nature that he would rather fall down from the heaven than to utter it.&#8221; He (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam): &#8220;That is true faith&#8221; (Ahmad 2/397 and Muslim 1/83)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that these whispers and thoughts one feels, while one hates them and repels them from the heart, is part of true faith. This can be likened to the warrior who fights his enemy until he overpowers him. <strong>This is the greatest type of Jihâd and a faith that is as pure as pure milk</strong>. And the reason as to why it is pure, is that one hates and fights the devilish thoughts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All creatures are subjected to these thoughts and whisperings. There are those humans that answer them and they then become disbelievers or hypocrites. And there are those whom have fallen so deeply into sins and desires, that they are first affected by these thoughts when they start to seek the religion. So the person either becomes a believer or a hypocrite. Thus, the humans often tend to get these whispers when they perform the prayer. The Devil will most often come when the servant wants to turn to his Lord and come closer to Him and have contact with Him. That is why the praying ones get thoughts that the non-praying ones do not.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Deception of the Shaytaan of the Soofeeyah</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Hamid al-Faqee <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>comments on the statement of <em>Imaam</em> Ibn al-Qayyim <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> when he spoke about the deception of the Shaytaan of the <em>Soofeeyah</em>, when he <em>Imaam</em> Ibn al-Qayyim <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">‘The Shaytaan caused them to buzz around (dance) and to beat/strike the ground whizzing around on their feet, then sometimes he makes them like donkeys going around a pivot, and sometimes like insects dancing  in the middle of the house…’</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Hamid al-Faqee said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘The Shaykh (Ibn al-Qayyim <em>-Rahimullaah</em>) intends the <em>Mutasawwafa</em> (<em>Soofeeyah</em>) who form into circles, then stand up in those circles and dance and swing from side to side to the tune of singing and musical instruments.  They shout, scream and dance together with what they call <em>Dhikr</em> (remembrance of Allaah), rather it is sinfulness, disobedience and the remembrance of Shaytaan, may Allaah guide them and free them and free Islaam from those evils and crimes.’</strong></span></p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>How the Shaytaan Deceived the People that <span style="color:#993300;">Whistling and Clapping</span> is Prayer</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> speaks about the <em>Ayaah<br />
</em> &lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;">Their prayer at the House (of Allaah) was nothing but whistling and clapping of hands</span>. &gt;&gt; [Anfal: 35] and how the Shaytaan deceived the people that whistling and clapping is prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim quotes: ‘Ibn Arafah and Ibn al-Ambaari who said: ‘that whistling and clapping is not prayer. . .’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Muhammad Hamid al-Faqee</strong> commented on this by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘In reality this is not prayer, Allaah called it prayer because they used to whistle and clap in their thundering movements to the tunes of whistling and clapping, since they intended by it a means of coming closer to Allaah, so Allaah reprimanded them and criticized them, and Allaah clarified that He does not love that, He does not reward them for it except with a painful punishment.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And that whistling and clapping (of the polytheists) is like what takes place in the gatherings of the <em>Soofeeyah</em> of our time, like for like; dancing movements to the tune of whistling and clapping. Their deep-rooted desires beautified this, likewise their ignorance and the Shayateen from the men and Jinn, beautified this to make them think that it is <em>Dhikr</em> (remembrance of Allaah) and worship!!</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allaah is far from this.’</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">Here are some Fawa&#8217;id about the obsessive thoughts that some brothers/sisters might get when trying to perform acts of worship. I hope they make things easier for you in Shâ&#8217; Allâh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>1.</strong><strong>The intention:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn-ul-Qayyim:</strong> The one who sits down in order to make ablution, has intended the ablution (!!!). The one who arises in order to pray, has intended the prayer. The sensible one hardly performs an act of worship but that he has already intended it. The fact is that if Allah had obliged us an act without intention, then it would have been impossible. (al-Islah, p. 67)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn-ul-Qayyim</strong>: To doubt the intention of one’s action is a type of madness. (Ibid, p.67)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>2. The verbal intention.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn-ul-Qayyim:</strong> The devil has made the verbal intention into a battlefield for those with whispters (wiswas). He imprisons them by it and punishes them with it. You see how they strive in order to utter it correctly – and it has nothing to do with the prayer. (Ibid, p.67)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>3. Where do they come from?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn-ul-Qayyim:</strong> al-Ghazali said that whispers (waswasah) either spring from ignorance about the religion or also from a madness and both belong to the greatest deficiencies (Ibid, p.69)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>4. Free time and work:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen:</strong> Free time is deadly. The one who is not busied by knowledge or work gets these obsessive thoughts. (al-Liqa ash-Shahri 45)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>5. Perhaps a drop of urine exited?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen:</strong> There are those who, after having urinated, feel something down there and (they) drop the pants in order to look. Do not do that. Ignore it. (al-Liqa ash-Shahri 46)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Shaykh al-Fawzân also said in one of his tapes that this (these obsessive thoughts regarding drops etc) should be ignored)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen:</strong> After urinating and that the last drop has went out, one should just wash the glans and nothing more. (al-Liqa ash-Shahri 46)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>6. Shaking it and pressing from&#8230;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen:</strong> There are people who, after having urinated, press their penises from the anal to the glans and some shake them. This is an <strong>INNOVATION.</strong> (al-Liqa ash-Shahri 46)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>7. Two doubt their Wudhu</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen:</strong> Two kinds of persons always doubt their ablution: the one with obsessive thouhts and the one with constant gases. The person with the obsessive thoughts should wean himself from it and ignore them and the person with the gases goes with that which is convincing until he hears or feels something. (al-Liqa ash-Shahri 61)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>8. Jumping into a river for Ghusl and then doubting it?!</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen:</strong> Obsessive thoughts (Wiswas) are dangerous. A man came to a Shaykh<strong>1</strong> and said: I bath in the flood Tigris after orgasm. I then pray and persuade myself to [think that] I am not clean. The Shaykh then said: Do not pray. The prophet said that the mad one is not responsible for his deeds until he becomes normal and you are mad. (al-Liqa ash-Shahri 23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1.</strong> (The shaykh mentions in his FHM tape 5 that the shaykh was Ibn &#8216;aqil al-Hanbali)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>9. To BREAK the wudhu in order to be sure of one&#8217;s next wudhu?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen:</strong> An example of these obsessive thoughts is to doubt whether one is clean or not and in order to be sure, one BREAKS THE ABLUTION. (al-Liqa ash-Shahri 23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Please note:</strong> Some people who know that they are clean, but to be “<em>sure</em>”, they break the wudhu by touching the penis or farting etc, look at this stupidness, they BREAK THE WUDHU to be sure? And then they remake the wudhu not realising that they were already convinced of the former wudhu, they would otherwise not BREAK IT, you can&#8217;t break something that is not there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>10. What do they lead to?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen:</strong> Obsessive thoughts lead to madness. (FHM 5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>11. The preseminal fluid issue</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn ‘Uthaymeen:</strong> There are people who imagine that they they got preseminal fluid as soon as they think. These are the whispers of the devil and should be ignored. (Sharh-ul-Bulugh 1/421)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>12. Why do jews not get whispers when they pray?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn-ul-Qayyim:</strong> Ibn ‘Abbas was asked why the jews not get whispers when they pray. He said: What should the devil do with a ruined heart? (al-Wabil, p.52)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just a quick note: I will in Shâ&#8217; Allâh gather some Fawâ&#8217;id in regards to other kinds of Wiswas (such as &#8216;Aqîdah, belief etc). These were more leaning towards Taharah and the intention. Bârak Allâhu fîkum.</p>

And verily, they hinder them from the path, but they think that they are guided aright!. Till, when (such a one) comes to Us, he says, &#8220;Would that between me and you were the distance of the two easts (or the east and west) a worst companion (indeed)!&#8221;</strong></span> (Surah Zukhruf 43:36-38)</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(And whosoever Ya`shu (turns away blindly))</strong></span> means, whoever willfully ignores and turns away</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(from the remembrance of the Most Gracious,)</strong></span> Al-`Asha (the root of Ya`sh) refers to weakness of vision; what is meant here is weakness of insight.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">(We appoint for him Shaytan to be a Qarin (a companion) to him.)</span></strong> This is like the Ayat:</p>

<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#339966;">(And We have assigned for them intimate companions, who have made fair seeming to them, what was before them and what was behind them)</span> (41:25). Allah says here:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#000000;">(And verily, they hinder them from the path, but they think that they are guided aright! Until, when he comes to Us,)</span></strong> meaning, for this person who willfully neglects true guidance, We send to him a Shaytan to lead him astray and show him the path to Hell. When he comes before Allah on the Day of Resurrection, he will complain about the Shaytan who was appointed to accompany him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Shaytan disowns His Followers on the Day of Resurrection</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(And Shaytan will say when the matter has been decided: &#8220;Verily, Allah promised you a promise of truth. And I too promised you, but I betrayed you. I had no authority over you except that I called you, and you responded to me. So blame me not, but blame yourselves. I cannot help you, nor can you help me. I deny your former act in associating me (Shaytan) as a partner with Allah (by obeying me in the life of the world). Verily, there is a painful torment for the wrongdoers.&#8221;)</span> (Ibrahim 14:22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah narrates to us what Iblis will say to his followers after Allah finishes with the judgement between His servants, sending the believers to the gardens of Paradise and the disbelievers to the lows (of the Fire). Iblis, may Allah curse him, will stand and address the latter, in order to add depression to their depression, sorrow to their sorrow and grief to their grief. He will declare,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Verily, Allah promised you a promise of truth.)</strong> by the words of His Messengers that if you follow them, you will gain safety and deliverance. Truly, Allah&#8217;s promise was true and correct news, while I promised you then betrayed you.&#8217; Allah said in another Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(He (Shaytan) makes promises to them, and arouses in them false desires; and Shaytan&#8217;s promises are nothing but deceptions.)</strong> (4:120)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(I had no authority over you)</strong> Shaytan will say, `I had no proof for what I called you to, nor evidence for what I promised you,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(except that I called you, and you responded to me.)</strong> even though the Messengers establish the proof and unequivocal evidences against you and affirmed the truth of what they were sent to you with. But you disobeyed the Messengers and ended up earning this fate,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(So blame me not,)</strong> today,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(but blame yourselves.)</strong>, because it is your fault for defying the proofs and following me in the falsehood that I called you to.&#8217; Shaytan will say next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(I cannot help you)</strong>, I cannot benefit, save, or deliver you from what you are suffering,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(nor can you help me.)</strong>, nor can you save me and deliver me from the torment and punishment I am suffering,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(I deny your former act of associating me (Shaytan) as a partner with Allah.)</strong> or because you associated me with Allah before,&#8217; according to Qatadah. Ibn Jarir commented; &#8220;I deny being a partner with Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored.&#8221; This opinion is the most plausible, for Allah said in other Ayat,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And who is more astray than one who calls on others besides Allah, such as will not answer him till the Day of Resurrection, and who are (even) unaware of their calls to them And when mankind are gathered, they will become their enemies and will deny their worshipping.)</strong> (46:5-6) and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Nay, but they (the so-called gods) will deny their worship of them, and become opponents to them.)</strong>(19:82) Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>(Verily, the wrongdoers)</strong></span>, who deviate from truth and follow falsehood, will earn a painful torment. It appears that this part of the Ayah narrates the speech that Shaytan will deliver to the people of the Fire after they enter it, as we stated. `Amir Ash-Sha`bi said, &#8220;On the Day of Resurrection, two speakers will address the people. Allah the Exalted will say to `Isa, son of Maryam,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>(Did you say unto men: &#8220;Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allah&#8221;)</strong></span> (5:116) until,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>(Allah will say: &#8220;This is a Day on which the truthful will profit from their truth.&#8221;)</strong></span>(5:119) Shaytan, may Allah curse him, will stand and address the people,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#333333;"><strong>I had no authority over you except that I called you, and you responded to me</strong></span>.) Allah next mentioned the final destination of the miserable ones, who earned the disgrace and torment and having to listen to Shaytan address them, then He mentioned the final destination of the happy ones.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">2) And in another narration: He prohibited that one sit between the sunlight and the shade, and he said:  “It is the sitting of shaytaan.” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3) Qays bin Abee Haazim narrated from his father that he said: The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم saw me and I was sitting in the sun, so he said:  “Move to the shade.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the wording of Aboo Daawood (#4822), Qays reported that his father narrated that he came and the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم was giving a khutbah, so he stood in the sun, so he ordered him to move to the shade. [4]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">145- Ruling on hanging supplications on the body</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: Is it permissible to hang some of the Du`a&#8217;s (supplications) which are mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet) on the chest of a man or woman as protection for them from the Jinn (creatures created from fire) and devils? [1]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This is not permissible whether it be from the Qur&#8217;an, Sunnah or anything else. This is called <strong>&#8220;Tama&#8217;im (amulets)&#8221;</strong>, &#8220;<strong>Jami`at</strong>&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>Hujub</strong>&#8221; and it is not permitted to wear or hang them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said about this matter: <span style="color:#000000;">&lt;&lt;</span><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Anyone who ties an amulet, may Allah not fulfill his aim; and anyone who ties a seashell, may Allah not give him peace</span></strong><span style="color:#000000;">&gt;&gt;<b> </b>[2]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (peace be upon him) also said:<span style="color:#000000;"> &lt;&lt;<strong>Ruqyahs (recitations for healing or protection), amulets and love-charms are Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship)</strong>&gt;&gt; [3].</span> Ruqyah here is referring to any words recited that are unknown or involve Shirk or Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect), they are absolutely prohibited! All amulets are prohibited, that is, what is written on a paper or parchment and placed in a piece of cloth or a bag and tied to a child or a sick person, these are all forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This prohibition applies even if the amulets are made of Words of the Qur&#8217;an or lawful Du`a&#8217;s, they are still forbidden, because the correct scholarly opinion is that all amulets are absolutely prohibited. However, there is greater prohibition regarding the amulets which are not made using Words of the Qur&#8217;an. The prohibition of the amulets made using the Qur&#8217;an is to close any of the doors which may lead to sin or Shirk, as a Muslim is obliged to stay away from these acts, so that they do not fall into what Allah (Exalted be He) has made Haram (prohibited). Allah has made lawful for His Servants the things which lead to happiness, well-being and protection. He did not make lawful that which will harm them; rather, He made lawful that which will bring well-being and happiness in this life and the Hereafter. Humans are not permitted to introduce a Bid`ah (innovation in religion); hanging these things constitutes a Bid`ah, even if they contain Qur&#8217;an or Hadiths. The Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade the use of amulets and warned those who wear or hang them that Allah will not fulfill their aim; anyone who ties an amulet or a seashell, Allah will not fulfill their aim of wearing them. It is obligatory on every believing man and woman to protect themselves by reciting the Islamic supplications not by hanging them; supplications for recovery and well-being should be made for the sick and the children. Du`a&#8217; for protection should also be made on their behalf before sleeping by saying: <span style="color:#000000;">&lt;&lt;<strong>I seek refuge for you in the Perfect Words of Allah from the evil of what He has created</strong>&gt;&gt; [4]</span>. This is following the example of the Prophet (peace be upon him) because it is reported that: <span style="color:#000000;">&lt;&lt;<strong>The Prophet (peace be upon him) used to seek refuge with Allah for Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn, by saying, &#8216;I seek refuge for you both in the Perfect Words of Allah, from every devil and every poisonous vermin, and from every evil (envious) eye.&#8217;</strong>&gt;&gt; [5]</span> Muslims must accustom themselves to reciting Adhkar (invocations and Remembrances said at certain times on a regular basis) and supplications for refuge and protection, and should seek refuge with Allah, as long as they are a sane adult, before sleeping, when entering and leaving their house etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point is that there is no need to wear amulets. Some scholars have permitted wearing amulets which contain Qur&#8217;an or lawful invocations, and they said: It is a form of Ruqyah (recitation for healing or protection), and since Ruqyah is lawful if it is using the Qur&#8217;an and lawful supplications, an amulet made using the Qur&#8217;an and supplications is also lawful. The answer is that there is a difference between the two; we have evidence that the prophet (peace be upon him) performed Ruqyah and Ruqyah was performed for him. He (peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#000000;">&lt;&lt;<strong>There is nothing wrong with Ruqyah as long as it does not involve any Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship)</strong>.&gt;&gt; [6]</span> This is evidence of the exception of Islamically lawful Ruqyah (i.e., reciting Qur&#8217;an and saying supplications over the sick seeking healing), which is excluded from his saying: <span style="color:#000000;">&lt;&lt;<strong>Ruqyahs (recitations for healing or protection), amulets and love-charms are Shirk</strong>.&gt;&gt;[7]</span> This is based on the fact that the Prophet (peace be upon him) performed Ruqyah and Ruqyah was performed for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No exceptions were made for amulets and there is no evidence that the Prophet (peace be upon him) hung an amulet on anyone; therefore, it is not permissible to regard amulets the same as Ruqyahs; rather, all amulets are absolutely prohibited. Wearing amulets of the Qur&#8217;an and lawful supplications could lead to wearing all other amulets, while being unaware of which is right and which is wrong, and thus opens the door to Shirk and wearing charms. The Shari`ah (Islamic law) has closed all of the doors which may lead to Shirk, and the Hadiths stated regarding amulets are general and the prohibition applies to all. Closing the doors which may lead to Shirk is an obligation, consequently, this entails prohibiting all amulets, even if they contain Qur&#8217;an or lawful invocations. This is to block the means leading to Shirk and act upon the general meaning of the Hadiths, so that the believer grows accustomed to putting their trust in Allah, relying on Him, supplicating to Him, and asking Him to protect them from all evil and relieve them from any distress, and not to rely on an object which they wear around their neck or anywhere else.</p>
<p>The teachings of the Shari`ah sufficiently contain all goodness and well-being, for the young and old, sick and healthy. May Allah grant everyone success and guidance!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q 1: What are the ways used by Satan to seduce man?</span></strong></p>
<p>A: Satan tempts man in many ways:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He can seduce him through his <strong>sexual lust</strong> to commit <strong>Zina</strong> (adultery) and have <strong>Khulwah</strong> (privacy with a member of the opposite sex) with non-Mahram women in addition to <strong>looking lustfully</strong> at them and listening to their <strong>songs</strong> and the like of other forbidden acts. Satan keeps tempting man until he commits this heinous sin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Gluttony</strong> is another way to sin. Satan may seduce man to eat<strong> from unlawful earnings</strong> or to drink <strong>Khamr</strong> (intoxicant) and become addicted to <strong>drugs</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The innate instinct of possession and man&#8217;s inclination to richness and wealth are ways used by Satan who tempts man to be heedless of the ways he gathers <strong>money</strong> from, whether Halal or Haram, thus he begins to take people&#8217;s money unjustly by means of <strong>Riba</strong> (Usury), <strong>theft</strong>, <strong>usurpation</strong>, <strong>cheating</strong> and the like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Needless to mention the <strong>instinct of controlling others</strong>, <strong>boastfulness</strong>, and <strong>arrogance</strong> whereby man despises others and mocks them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are only some ways through which Satan could seduce man away from the path of righteousness.For further clarification, you could refer to the book entitled &#8220;<strong>Talbis Iblis</strong>&#8221; by <strong>Abu Al-Faraj Ibn Al-Jawzy</strong>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">What is the interpretation of seeing a deceased every time in dreams?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Response:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one sees a deceased in a good state in a dream, this lends hope that he is in a good state. If one sees him in another type of state, this could simply be devils taking on the form of people. Devils take on the shapes of people in a disliked situation in order to grieve the living. This is because devils are very avaricious to do anything that brings grief, worry and sadness to the believers. Allah has said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Secret counsels are only from Satan, in order that he may cause grief to the believers. But he cannot harm them in the least, except as Allah permits&#8221;</span></strong> (al-Mujadalah 10).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a person sees something evil for a deceased in a dream, he must seek refuge in Allah from the evil of Satan and the evil of what he saw. He should not communicate that dream to anyone concerning that deceased. In that way, the deceased will not harm whatsoever. In fact, any time a person sees something disturbing in a dream, he should then seek refuge in Allah from the evil of Satan and the evil of what he saw. Then he should spit three times on his left side. He should then change his side upon which he was sleeping to the other side. If he makes ablution and prays, that is better and superior. He should not communicate that dream to anyone and, in that case, he will not be harmed by it at all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Purity and Ostentation</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Many times a person thinks about doing a good deed and then Satan comes to him and whispers to him, saying, &#8220;You are doing that ostentatiously, to be seen of men and for a good reputation.&#8221; Therefore, he makes us go away from the good deed. How can one remain free of such occurrences?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Response: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One can remain free of such occurrences by seeking refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan, as well as by continually performing good deeds. He should not pay attention to such whisperings that make him stop doing good deeds. If he turns away from such whisperings and seeks refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan, such whisperings will stop by the permission of Allah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#003300;">One of the biggest manipulations of the Jinn is through <strong>visions</strong>. Through these visions the Jinns are more likely to lead people away from the worship of Allah then any other way. When a person sees a vision in front of his eyes it is something which is very hard to explain away. Only by having knowledge of the world of the Jinn and conviction in Allah, can a person fight such a trial. The countless numbers of visions of Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary over the centuries has been a popular choice for the devils. It almost seems as if leading Christians astray is the most easiest trick for the Jinns! Not only are Christians fooled by these visions, but often the Jinns possess and begin to talk from their voices. To the Christians this is known as the tongues of the Angels and thus a proof for their faith. However, the amount of unintelligible nonsense and rubbish which is heard is a clear proof that this is in fact the tongues of the devils! For other people, visions of their parents or relatives are commonplace. By taking on the form of peoples parents, the Jinns can convince people that the souls of dead people still mix with the people of the earth. This is why so many people believe in ghosts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#003300;">The onslaught of satanic visions has also hit the Muslims. Many Muslims claim to have seen visions of the Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) and even Allah! By doing this, Shaytan is able to lead astray the weak Muslims. Through such visions, Muslims are often told that the commands of Islam are not applicable to them. The Jinns tell them that Prayer, Fasting, Hajj etc. are not obligatory for them. It is a great deception and unfortunately one which has been very effective. The extent of satanic visions still continues to this day. The recent death of Diana Princess of Wales sparked off great love and adoration for this woman. In fact the grief of the British people was such, that it was as if Diana was something divine. No sooner had the mourning of Diana reached its peak, that visions of her were already being seen at Hampton Court Palace! If these visions did occur, the desire of Iblis and his army of Jinn to capitalize on this event, was evident. Such visions are clear attempts by Iblis to lead mankind away from the path of Allah [16].</span></p>

Q: There is a frightening nightmare haunting me frequently. While sleeping I dream that there is something within my mouth resembling dough. It makes it difficult for me to breathe and speak. Many times I try to remove or take out of it with my hand but it comes again, which breaks my sleep. I am frightened of this nightmare that disturbed my life and obsessed my thinking. I do not know the reason behind this, knowing that I observe performing Prayer and Fast and performed Pilgrimage. I often ask for Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness and repent to Him. Yet it haunts me within a period of two, four, or five months. I ask Allah (Exalted be He) that you will give me an explanation for this frightening dream. May Allah guide you to what brings out the good of this life and the Hereafter. Allah is in the help of a servant as long as he is in the help of his brother.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This nightmare is from Satan. It is ordained for you and for every Muslim man and woman seeing what he hates to spit dryly to his left side thrice and to seek refuge with Allah from Satan and from the evil of what he saw (three times). Then he should resume sleeping on the other side. This way, what he sees cannot harm him. One should not tell anyone about this because it was authentically reported that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#800080;">&#8220;A good dreamis from Allah and a bad dream is from Satan. Anyone who sees something (in a dream) that they hate, should spit to their left three times and seek refuge with Allah three times from the evil of Satan and of what they have seen. Then they should turn on the other side and it will not harm them. They should tell no one about ii.&#8221;</span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This authentic Hadith relieves both the believing man and woman seeing what they hate. Praise be to Allah, it is a great remedy available.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brother, you should put this into action and relieve your heart with this Prophetic remedy. May Allah grant us all success!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah informs about the Jinns when He sent His Messenger Muhammad and revealed the Qur&#8217;an to him. Among the ways He protected it (the Qur&#8217;an) was by filling sky with stern guards guarding it from all of its sides. The devils were then expelled from the places where they used to sit prior to that. This was so that they could not steal anything from the Qur&#8217;an and tell it to the soothsayers, thereby causing matters to be confused and mixed up. If this happened it would not be known who was being truthful. Allah did this out of His kindness to His creation, His mercy upon His servants and His protection of His Mighty Book (the Qur&#8217;an).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why the Jinns said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#339966;">And we have sought to reach the heaven; but found it filled with stern guards and flaming fires. And verily, we used to sit there in stations, to (steal) a hearing, but any who listens now will find a flaming fire watching him in ambush</span>.) meaning, whoever would like to steal some information by listening, he will find a flaming fire waiting in ambush for him. It will not pass him or miss him, but it will wipe him out and destroy him completely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#339966;">And we know not whether evil is intended for those on earth, or whether their Lord intends for them guidance</span>.) meaning, `we do not know if this &#8212; the matter which has occurred in the sky &#8212; is intended for those who are in the earth or if their Lord intends some guidance for them.&#8217; They stated this in such a manner out of their etiquette in phrasing their speech, because they did not attribute the doing of evil to anyone and they attributed the good to Allah. Verily, it has been recorded in the Sahih,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#339966;">And evil is not attributed to You (Allah)</span>.) It used to be that shooting stars (meteors) occurred before this, however it did not happen much, rather only occasionally. As was reported in the Hadith of Ibn `Abbas when he said, &#8220;While we were sitting with the Messenger of Allah a shooting star flashed in the sky. So the Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;">(What did you all used to say about this)</span> We replied, &#8220;We used to say that a great person has been born and a great person has died.&#8221; The Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;">(This is not so, rather whenever Allah decrees a matter in the heaven&#8230;)&#8217;</span>&#8216; and then he went on to narrate the rest of the Hadith which we have already mentioned in its entirety in Surah Saba&#8217;. This is what caused them to seek the reason for this occurrence. So they set out searching in the east and the west. Then they found the Messenger of Allah reciting (the Qur&#8217;an) while leading his Companions in prayer. Thus, they knew that this Qur&#8217;an was the reason for the sky being guarded. Therefore, some among them believed in it and the others became more rebellious in their transgression. A discussion of this has preceded in a Hadith of Ibn `Abbas concerning Allah&#8217;s statement in Surat Al-Ahqaf,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;">(And (remember) when We sent towards you (Muhammad) a group of the Jinn (quietly) listening to the Qur&#8217;an.) (46:29)</span> There is no doubt that when so many shooting stars began appearing in the sky, it horrified humans and Jinns alike. They were very disturbed and alarmed by it. They thought that it was the destruction of the world. As-Suddi said, &#8220;The sky was never guarded except if there was a Prophet in the earth or the religion of Allah was victorious and dominant in the earth.&#8221; So the devils before the time of Muhammad had taken sitting stations for themselves in the heaven of this world and they would listen to the matters that occurred in the heaven. But when Allah sent Muhammad as a Prophet and Messenger, they were suddenly pelted one night (with the flaming, shooting stars).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the people of Ta&#8217;if were frightened because of this and they began to say, `The dwellers of the sky have been destroyed.&#8217; This was because they saw the severe fires in the sky and the shooting flames. They began freeing their servants and abandoning their luxuries. So `Abd Yalayl bin `Amr bin `Umayr said to them and he was referred to for judgement among them &#8220;Woe to you O people of Ta&#8217;if! Hold on to your wealth and look at these guiding stars in the sky.If you see them remaining in their place, then the dwellers of the sky have not been destroyed, rather this has happened because of Ibn Abi Kabshah (&#8211; meaning Muhammad ). And if you look and see that you can no longer see these stars, then verily the dwellers of the sky have been destroyed.&#8221; So, they looked and saw that the stars still remained, and thus, they kept their wealth. The devils also were frightened during that night. They went to Iblis and informed him of what happened to them. So he (Iblis) said, &#8220;Bring me a handful of dirt from every land so that I may smell it.&#8221; So they brought it and he smelled it and said, &#8220;It is your friend in Makkah.&#8221; Then he sent a group of seven Jinns to Makkah, and they found the Prophet of Allah standing in prayer in Al-Masjid Al-Haram while reciting the Qur&#8217;an. They drew near to him eager to hear the Qur&#8217;an, until their chests almost pressed against him. Then they accepted Islam and Allah revealed their matter to His Messenger . We have mentioned this chapter in its entirety in the first section of the Kitab As-Sirah with lengthy discussion. Allah knows best and unto Him is all praise and blessings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter with the males among the Jinn, but they increased them in Rahaq</span>.</strong>) (27:7) meaning,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`we (Jinn) used to think that we had some virtuous status over mankind because they used to seek refuge with us whenever they (men) would settle in a valley or any place in the wilderness, the open country steppes and other places.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the custom of the Arabs in the pre-Islamic days of ignorance. They used to seek refuge with the greatest Jinn of a particular place so that no harm or evil would afflict them. Like one would do if he entered into the land of his enemies, in the vicinity of a great and powerful man, he would seek the protection and guardianship of that man. So when the Jinns saw that the humans were seeking refuge with them due to their fear of them, they increased them in Rahaq which means fear, terror and fright. They did this so that the people would be more afraid of them and seek refuge with them even more. As Qatadah said concerning this Ayah, (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">but they increased them in Rahaq</span></strong>.) means, &#8220;the Jinns were courageous and increased in insolence against them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>As-Suddi</strong> said, &#8220;A man used to set out with his family (on a journey) until he came to a piece of land where he would settle. Then he would say, `I seek refuge with the master (Jinn) of this valley from the Jinns, or that myself, my wealth, my child or my animals are harmed in it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Qatadah</strong> said, &#8220;When they sought refuge with them instead of Allah, the Jinns would overcome them with harm because of that.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abi Hatim recorded from `<strong>Ikrimah</strong> that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Jinns used to fear humans just like humans fear them, or even worse. So whenever humans would come to a valley the Jinns would flee. So the leader of the people would say, `We seek refuge with the leader of the inhabitants of this valley.&#8217; So the Jinns said, `We see these people fleeing from us just like we flee from them.&#8217; Thus, the Jinns started coming near the humans and afflicting them with insanity and madness.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, Allah said, (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter with the males among the Jinn, but they increased them in Rahaq</span></strong>.) meaning, in sin. Abu `Aliyah, Ar-Rabi` and Zayd bin Aslam, all said, (in Rahaq) &#8220;This means in fear.&#8221; Mujahid said, &#8220;The disbelievers would increase in transgression.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Go back and finish your mission, for you have not finished it.)</strong> Khalid went back and when the custodians who were also its servants of Al-`Uzza saw him, they started invoking by calling Al-`Uzza! When Khalid approached it, he found a naked woman whose hair was untidy and who was throwing sand on her head. Khalid killed her with the sword and went back to the Messenger of Allah , who said to him,</p>

Aboo Tasneem Daawood Adeeb al-Atharee, [Khutbah, Mar &#8217;05]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Overview</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Allaah wishes to make clear (what is lawful and what is unlawful) to you,and to show you the ways of those before you, and to accept your repentance,and Allaah is the All­Knower, All­Wise. Allaah wishes to accept your repentance, but those who follow their lusts, wish that you should deviate tremendously away from the right path. Allaah wishes to lighten (the burden) for you; and man was created weak.&#8221;</strong> [Sooratun-Nisaa&#8217;, 4:26-28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that reflective thoughts are not themselves harmful; rather what becomes harmful are constant (obsessive) ponderings. A thought about something is like a passer-by, if you do not call him, he will pass you by and go upon his way. However, if you call him, he will dupe and deceive you by his speech, and this is the easiest thing to do for the Nafs that is filled with falsehood. However, it is the most difficult thing to bear for the Nafs that is contended.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has placed in all of mankind two kinds of Nafs :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Nafs Ammaarah</strong> (the soul that commands evil), and  <strong>Nafs Mutma&#8217;innah</strong> (the soul that is content). They always oppose each other, so what is sweet for one is bitter for the other. There is nothing more difficult for the soul that commands evil than to go against its desires by working for Allaah&#8217;s pleasure, however, this is the most beneficial thing for it. Likewise, there is nothing more difficult for the soul that is content  than to work for other than the pleasure of Allaah. Every person has both a Nafs Mutma&#8217;innah and a Nafs Ammaarah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Additionally, there is an angel on the right side (of every person) and it works in conjunction with the Nafs Mutma&#8217;innah. Likewise, on the left side (of every person), there is a Shaytaan that works in conjunction with the Nafs Ammaarah, and there is a constant, ongoing struggle between the two and it does not cease until this person&#8217;s appointed time in this life ceases. Falsehood always sides with the Shaytaan and the Nafs Ammaarah, whereas the truth always sides with the angels and the Nafs Mutma&#8217;innah, and the victor alternates.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, victory comes with patience and whoever remains patient and has<b> </b>taqwaa (fear and consciousness) of Allaah, then he will be granted the upper-hand in this life and in the next. This is the law of Allaah that never changes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Khutbatul Haajah ….</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My Dear Brothers and Sisters in Al-Islaam, those of you who believe in Allaah and His Angels, His Books, His Messengers and the Divine Decree &#8211; the good and the evil of it, the sweet and the bitter of it. O You who believe, those of you who believe in the things that we cannot see, those things that are hidden from our view, those things like the Angels, and the Jannah and the Naar, the Paradise and the Hellfire, and those things that we can&#8217;t see like the Jinn and our Nafs. The Jinn is a creature that Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala has created to worship Him, similar to the human being, but he is a creature that we cannot see in this life and this Dunya with our eyes. And as Imaam as-Shaafiee (rahimahullaahi ta&#8217;ala) said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Anyone who says that they can see the Jinn in this life, then their testimony, (their Shahaadah) will never be taken. Their testimony for the contract of  marriage or contract of business or any type of testimony will not be accepted for no one can see the Jinn in this life. &#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other creatures that Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala has created is inside of ourselves, that creature is called an-Nafs. In the Khutbahtul Haajah the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihiwa sallam) used to say for every Jummah and every salaatul Eid whether it be Fitr or Adha and at the weddings, he used to say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Innal Hamda lillaah Nahmaduhu wa nasthaeenuhu wa nasthaghfirhu wa na&#8217;oozu billaahi min shuroori anfusinaa, wamin saiyyia&#8217;athia&#8217;amaalina ..</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah. We praise Him and beseech His help and in Him we seek forgiveness and we seek the refuge of Allaah from the mischief of our Anfus – the mischiefness of our souls, that Nafs similar to Shaitaan, similar to Iblees, similar to the Jinn that whispers to the human beings to make them think things, to make them say things, to make them do things that they should not be saying or doing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah subhanawata&#8217;ala He says :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Surely We created the human being and we know what his nafs whispers to him.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is not a Muslim who is sitting in this blessed Masjid, this House of Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala that does not have a jinn that whispers to him or her something evil. Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala again in His Book says (Surah 114 An-Naas) :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Say to them O Muhammad, [Peace and blessings be upon him] I seek refuge with the Lord of the human beings; the Master, the King ofthe human beings; the God of the human beings;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(there is a jinn that is called <strong>Al-Khannas</strong>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We seek refuge with our Lord, the King, the Master, the God of mankind from this Khannas; We seek refuge with Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala from the Khannas, the one who is Muthawa&#8217;ariee al-Mukhthafee &#8211; the one who is hidden, we can&#8217;t see him but he comes to us and he says, &#8216;say that, do this, say this and do that..&#8217; and he runs away.  He runs away the coward that he is. Those things go inside of our hearts and they go inside of our minds.  We seek refuge with Allaah from the one who whispers in the Sadr – in our sudoor (in our chests) from the jinn and the men. Because we have the Jinn (the Shayaateen) and the Shayaateen from the human beings. i.e we have the devils from the Jinn and the devils from the men and both of them whisper. But our Nafs is something that is with us all time and it whispers to us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Walillaahil Hamd – All Praise is due to Allaah – that Allaah (subhana wata&#8217;ala) has favoured this Ummah to not being held accountable for the things they have in their mind, for not being held accountable for the things they have in their hearts – unless they say those things or do those things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is not one of us that does not have evil thoughts – not one of us. All of us have evil thoughts. But the Prophet [Peace and blessings be upon him]  on the authority of Abu Huraira (radiallaahu tha&#8217;ala anhu warad&#8217;aahu) collected by Imaam Muslim in his saheeh, &#8216;the Prophet [Peace and blessings be upon him]  said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has absolved, Allaah has excused, Allaah has pardoned, Allaah has forgiven, Allaah has done away with for this  Ummah , for me – My ummah, for this nation, this Ummah of Islaam all the things that they think about &#8211; all the things that comes to their minds and their hearts – all those evil thoughts about backbiting their brother, and slandering their sister, and picking up that glass of beer, whisky or wine, when they have the thought of smoking the marjua&#8217;ana or have the thought to commit zinaa (wa iyyadu billaah) or have the thought of stealing or robbing or  any of those evil thoughts or even worse &#8211;  thoughts about prophets and messengers of Allaah, which some of us unfortunately have in our heads and in our minds or thoughts that are bad about Muhammad [Peace and blessings be upon him]  himself –Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala has excused us and pardoned us. &#8216;Maa lam tha&#8217;lam awthatha kallam.&#8217; As long as we don&#8217;t do those things or say those things then, those things that are in our minds of evil – those things that are in our minds that whisper to us from our nafs or from Shaitaan or evil, of wretchedness, those horrible thoughts that come to our minds we are forgiven. Walillaahil Hamd we are forgiven.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The companions of the Messenger of Allaah  [Peace and blessings be upon him]  &#8211; they were the best of human beings after the prophets and the messengers but they also used to have bad thoughts. As the hadith of the companions of the Prophet [Peace and blessings be upon him] said : &#8216;that a party of the companions of the messenger of Allaah [Peace and blessings be upon him] they came to him asking him : O&#8217; Messenger of Allaah, one of us have some things in the inside of our heads. We have some thoughts that comes to our minds that are so ugly, they are so horrendous, they are so horrible, they are so evil that we are even afraid to talk about them. The Messenger of Allaah [Peace and blessings be upon him] said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do you really have those type of thoughts in your minds? You really have those evil thoughts in your minds, you really find those things in your minds?&#8217; They said : &#8216;Yes, we have these evil thoughts O&#8217; Messenger of Allaah.&#8217; The Messenger of Allaah [Peace and blessings be upon him] said: &#8216;zaakaa sarihul Imaan. Zaakaa sarihul Imaan … &#8211; that is clear, pure,faith.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration collected by Imaam Abu Dawuud (rahimahullaah): the prophet [Peace and blessings be upon him] said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Allaahu Akbar, Allaahu Akbar, Allaahu Akbar.., Allaah is theGreatest, Allaah is the Greatest, Allaah is the Greatest, Praise be to Allaah the one Who has diminished, has minimized those evil thoughts to just a whisper..</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">to just a whisper so that you won&#8217;t say it or you won&#8217;t do it Wa lillaahil Hamd.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>** 2nd part of the Khutbah**</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our beloved brothers and sisters in Islaam, those of you who have been pardoned by Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala for the evil thoughts that you have in your minds and the evil suggestions that come to your hearts, O you who believe those of you who has been excused from those wretched ideas that you have, we must realize that we are human beings. We are fragile creatures. We are human beings that are created weak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are human beings that are not able to control ourselves except Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala gives us mercy to us – and except that Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala gives the bounty to us. We are creatures that we are not able to control ourselves as the Prophet [Peace and blessings be upon him]. He said that &#8211; when Allaah warned Adam in Jannah and left Adam as He wanted to leave him, for the time He wanted to leave him &#8211; then Iblees went around Adam looking at him and he saw that he was a creature at the point &#8216;into him&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Ibn Kathir (rahimahullaah) says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;going into him from his nostrils and out from his backside, checking him out and finding he was hollow – he realized that Adam was a creature &#8216;Laa yatha maalak&#8217; &#8211; that he was a creature who could not control himself. We are blessed by Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala to have the sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah [Peace and blessings be upon him] to explain to us what to do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are blessed by Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala to have the Qura&#8217;an to seek refuge with Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala so that when we go to bed at night – we cup our hands and we say : &#8220;Qul Huwallaahu Ahad,.. and we say Qul Aoozu birabbil Falaq.. and we say Qul Aoozu birabbin Naas..&#8217;so that Shaitaan or any evil will not approach us and then we spit in our hands and we wipe as much of our bodies that we can and we say Ayatul Kursi– the verse of the footstool before we go to bed and we seek refuge with Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala when we walk into the bathroom from the Khubz wal Khabaiz – from the male and female jinns and we seek refuge with Allaah tabarak wa ta&#8217;ala before we approach our wives, making dua against Shaitaan and him against his Qaidaah — against his plots and his harming our children.. and we can go on and on ..</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What Allaah and His Messenger [Peace and blessings be upon him] have given us to protect ourselves from Shaitaan and to protect ourselves from the whispers of our nafs. The Ulamaa in following the way of the Prophet [Peace and blessings be upon him] they have explained to us that everything begins as a &#8216;khatrah&#8217;  &#8211;  everything begins as a &#8216;thought&#8217;. So they have said, &#8216;Protect yourselves !! Ward off the thoughts !! And if you don&#8217;t ward off the thoughts, then the thought will become an idea. And ward off and make guard against the idea – because if you don&#8217;t ward off the idea then it will become lust.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It first begins as a thought.. brothers, then sisters it becomes an idea.. if you don&#8217;t ward yourself and guard yourself from the original thought, that thought will become an idea and if you don&#8217;t guard yourself from that idea, then it will become &#8216;shahwa&#8217; – lust. Now you have to make war on the shahwa. Now you have to make war, jihad on your desires, on your lusts. And if you don&#8217;t do that then that desire, that lust becomes resolved in determination. And if you don&#8217;t make war on that determination and resolve the results from that thought, from  that idea that is transmuted that changed from idea to lust then it will become &#8216;Azeema wahimma&#8217; &#8211; it will become resolved in determination.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if you don&#8217;t defend yourself from that , if you don&#8217;t make jihad on that, then it becomes an action. And if you don&#8217;t protect yourself and ward off from that and do the opposite of that action, then it becomes a habit. Then it becomes a habit &#8211; that thing becomes &#8216;you&#8217;. And it is going to be very, very difficult to get rid of this. If you don&#8217;t do the opposite of that thing that has become an action, it will become a habit and the Ulamaa of science say &#8216;that we are creatures of habits.&#8217; It starts with a thought. It starts with a thought which becomes an idea, an idea that becomes lust and a lust that becomes resolve and you let these things become planted in your heart and in your mind and then it becomes &#8216;you&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First a thought comes : &#8216;Tell a lie.&#8217;Then when you don&#8217;t do something to guard against that, it becomes an idea. It becomes an ideology in your heads. And then if you don&#8217;t guard against that, it becomes a desire. And if you don&#8217;t make war on that, then it becomes resolve – something that is becoming firmly planted in the soil of your nafs, in the dirt of your nafs and your nafs now becomes a seed that has become firmly rooted. And if you don&#8217;t guard against and get rid of that, then it becomes an action and from an action it becomes a habit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sumail (rahimahullah) one of the Tabi&#8217;oon, Sammaak Ibn Waleed (rahimahullaahi ta&#8217;ala) said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;I asked Ibn Abbas (radiallaahu anhu) there is something that I find in my chest.&#8217; Ibn Abbas  said, &#8216;What is it that you find in your chest.&#8217; He said: &#8216;It is something Wallaahi ya Abdullaah, (it means Abdullaah Ibn Abbas, I swear by Allaah), I don&#8217;t want to even mention it as it is so evil.&#8217; Ibn Abbas started laughing and said : Allaah tabarakwa ta&#8217;ala says &#8216;if you have doubt about any thing which Allaah has revealed, then ask the people of the Book – those who came before you for they also had doubts. To get rid of that evil thought you should say that Allaah is :&#8217;*Huwal Awwalu wal Aakhiru, wa Daahiru wal-Baatinu, wa huwa ala&#8217;akulli shai&#8217;in aleem.*&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what you should say. This is what Abdullaah ibn Abbas said. When those evil thoughts come to you or you have any doubts about your Deen, you have any doubts about the angels, you have any doubts about the messengers, you have any doubts about the sunnah, you have any doubts about anything of Islaam – you have any doubts whatsoever then say :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;*Huwal Awwalu wal Aakhiru, wad Daahiru wal-Baatinu, wa huwa ala kulli shai&#8217;in aleem.*&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala to protect us from the evil of ourselves, from the shuroor of our Anfus, from the evil of our nafs (when they whisper to us) and we ask Allaah to give us protection from the Shayateen – both from the Jinn and the men and we ask Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala by His Greatest Name to let us see His face and be in the closest proximity of the Prophet Muhammad [Peace and blessings be upon him]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) The first opinion is that the word should be pronounced as <span style="color:#ff0000;">Shiraki</span>, which means plots and plans. So, this part of the supplication would read, &#8220;<em>I seek refuge in You from the evil of my soul and from the evil and plans of Shaytaan</em>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) The second opinion, which seems to be the strongest, is that it should be pronounced as <span style="color:#ff0000;">Shirki</span>; this refers to whatever the Shaytaan is calling you towards, in terms of acts of worship, which result in associating partners with Allah. It doesn&#8217;t meant that Shirk is being commited by Shaytaan himself. On the contrary it is the person who commits the shirk in obedienec to Shaytaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For a more detailed explanation, refer to TuhfatAl-Ahwadee, Volume 9, Hadeeth 3452, by Shaykh Muhammad Al-Mubaarakpuri.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">(**)</span> Shaykh Al-Albanee mentioned that the last part,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">..is from another narration is Sunan At-Tirmidhi, narrated by Abdullah bin Ammaar, and is not mentioned as part of this supplication, which is also from Sunan At-Tirmidhee, but narrated by Aboo Hurayrah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Alif Laam Meem This is the Book that contains no doubt, guidance for those who fear Allah. Those who believe in the unseen, who establish the daily prayers and spend from what We have provided them with. Those who believe in what was revealed to you and what was revealed to those before you, and they are filled with conviction concerning the hereafter. They are upon guidance from their Lord, and they are the successful.&#8221;</strong></span> {Soorat-ul-Baqarah: 1-5}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) Related by Imaam ad-Daarimee in his Sunan as #3382 and #3383 from ‘Abdullah bin Mas’ood-may Allah be pleased with him-and it has been ruled as being <em>marfu’oo</em> [01] that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Whoever recites ten verses from Soorat-ul-Baqarah at night time the shaytaan will not enter the house that evening until the morning, (also) the first four verses of Soorat-ul-Baqarah, Aayat-ul-Kursee and the two verses after it, in addition to the three last verses of Soorat-ul-Baqarah beginning with: {…To Allah belongs what is in the heavens…}</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;…shaytaan or anything he dislikes will not come near him nor his family that day, and it is not recited over a mentally ill person except that he will recover from his illness.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At-Tabaraanee related it in his Kabeer as #8673, and al-Haythamee said in his Majma’ (#17014): &#8220;The men of this narration are the narrators of the Saheeh except that ash-Sha’bee did not hear directly from Ibn Mas’oud.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[01] T.N. Al-Khateeb (rahimahullah) said: &#8220;It is what has been narrated by a companion directly from the Messenger (may the peace &amp; blessings of Allah be upon him)&#8221;. Al-Baa’eeth-ul-Hatheeth Page 54.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The knowledge of Ghayb is one of the attributes of Lordship, thus no one knows the Ghayb of Heaven and Earth except Allah;</p>
<p>Allah (may He be Exalted) says,</p>
<p><strong>And with Him are the keys of the Ghayb (all that is hidden), none knows them but He</strong>.  (Surah Al-An`am, 6: 59)</p>
<p>He (Great is His Majesty) also says,</p>
<p><strong>Say: “None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghayb (Unseen) except Allâh”</strong> (Surah Al-Naml, 27: 65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jinn do not know the Ghayb, and this is proven in His Saying (may He be Exalted),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Then when We decreed death for him [Sulaimân (Solomon)], nothing informed them (jinn) of his death except a little worm of the earth which kept (slowly) gnawing away at his stick. So when he fell down, the jinn saw clearly that if they had known the Unseen, they would not have stayed in the humiliating torment</strong></span>.</span> (Surah Saba&#8217;, 34: 14 )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, anyone who claims to know the Ghayb will be a Kafir (disbeliever) and anyone who believes in this claim will be a Kafir as well, for they will be denying the Qur&#8217;an.</p>
<p>May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The below is taken from Tafseer Ibn Kathir:</span><br />
</strong><span style="color:#999999;">[from dar-us-salam english publication]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(14. Then when We decreed death for him, nothing informed them (Jinn) of his death except a little worm of the earth which kept (slowly) gnawing away at his stick. So when he fell down, the Jinn saw clearly that if they had known the Unseen, they would not have stayed in the humiliating torment.) </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:right;">[Noble Qur&#8217;an &#8211; Soorah Saba 34:14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah tells us how Sulayman, peace be upon him, died and how Allah concealed his death from the Jinn who were subjugated to him to do hard labor. He remained leaning on his stick, which was his staff, as Ibn `Abbas may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and others said. He stayed like that for a long time, nearly a year. When a creature of the earth, which was a kind of worm, ate through the stick, it became weak and fell to the ground. Then it became apparent that he had died a long time before. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">It also became clear to Jinn and men alike that the Jinn do not know the Unseen as they (the Jinn) used to imagine and tried to deceive people</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(nothing informed them (Jinn) of his death except a little worm of the earth which kept (slowly) gnawing away at his stick. So when he fell down, the Jinn saw clearly that if they had known the Unseen, they would not have stayed in the humiliating torment.)</strong> meaning, it became clear to the people that they (the Jinn) were lying.</p>

Verily, I see what you see not. Verily, I fear Allah for Allah is severe in punishment.</strong>&#8221;) [Soorah al-Anfal (8): 48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And (remember) when Shaytan made their (evil) deeds seem fair to them and said, &#8220;No one of mankind can overcome you today and verily, I am your neighbor.&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaytan, may Allah curse him, made the idolators&#8217; purpose for marching seem fair to them. He made them think that no other people could defeat them that day. He also ruled out the possibility that their enemies, the tribe of Bani Bakr, would attack Makkah, saying, &#8220;I am your neighbor.&#8221; Shaytan appeared to them in the shape of Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju`shum, the chief of Bani Mudlij, so that, as Allah described them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He﴿ Shaytan ﴾ makes promises to them, and arouses in them false desires; and Shaytan&#8217;s promises are nothing but deceptions) (4:120).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jurayj said that Ibn `Abbas commented on this Ayah, (8:48)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;On the day of Badr, Shaytan, as well as, his flag holder and soldiers, accompanied the idolators. He whispered to the hearts of the idolators, `None can defeat you today! I am your neighbor.&#8217; When they met the Muslims and Shaytan witnessed the angels coming to their aid, (he ran away), he went away in flight while proclaiming, (Verily, I see what you see not.)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Ali bin Abi Talhah said, that Ibn `Abbas said about this Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;No one of mankind can overcome you today and verily, I am your neighbor&#8217;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>&#8220;Shaytan, as well as, his devil army and flag holders, came on the day of Badr in the shape of a Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju`shum, man from Bani Mudlij, Shaytan said to idolators, `None will defeat you this day, and I will help you.&#8217; When the two armies stood face to face, the Messenger of Allah took a handful of sand and threw it at the faces of the idolators, causing them to retreat. Jibril, peace be upon him, came towards Shaytan, but when Shaytan, while holding the hand of a Mushrik man, saw him, he withdrew his hand and ran away with his soldiers. That man asked him, `O Suraqah! You claimed that you are our neighbor&#8217; He said, (Verily, I see what you see not. Verily, I fear Allah for Allah is severe in punishment) Shaytan said this when he saw the angels.&#8221;</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Some time ago we started to have a problem. We began to lose money and jewelry that we put in different places in our house. It is worth mentioning that only my children, their families, and myself live in the three storey house in question. No strange person lives with us and we do not suspect any body. We have asked some of those who have experience of such case. Some of them said that Jinn (creatures created from fire) are involved while others mentioned that it is a member of our family who took the money or jewelry but they could not state the name of the perpetrator. It is noteworthy that all of the inhabitants of the concerned house fear Allah (Exalted be He), perform the Faridahs (obligatory acts) properly, do not harm any one of any thing, and do not commit Haram (prohibited) things. To give some examples for the problems that we are facing, one of my sons brought to the house a sum of ten thousand Riyals but after about two or three hours and before depositing the sum in the bank; he was taken by surprise when he discovered the loss of four thousand Riyal even though the total sum was in his same bag. This was the last problem we had as it took place one week ago. Another example is that during the blessed month of Ramadan one member of the family left one thousand Riyal at home and went out to pray Tarawih (special supererogatory night Prayer in Ramadan). When he came back he did not find the sum mentioned above though he read Ayat-ul-Kursy (the Qur’anic Verse of Allah’s Chair, Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:255) on his money and no body was in the house when he went out.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">These are just a few of the many frequent cases of losing money and gold that we have experienced. Please provide us with your beneficial answer concerning this matter that causes huge troubles to us as we now keep our money and jewelry in one of the houses of my sons which is near to my house or in the bank.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">We can not keep any sum in the house even though it is known to every body that people can not dispense with having at least a small sum at home to use for daily needs. Answer us please. May Allah benefit and reward you with the best.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: In case it is proven that such money or jewelry are not taken by human beings either amongst the inhabitants of the house or other than them, it is &#8211; And Allah knows best &#8211; the work of the Satans among Jinn. They do such practices frequently by the permission of Allah (Exalted be He) and there is proof for this from the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) said regarding His Prophet Sulayman (Solomon, peace be upon him),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He said: &#8220;O chiefs! Which of you can bring me her throne before they come to me surrendering themselves in obedience?&#8221; A ‘Ifrît (strong one) from the jinn said: “I will bring it to you before you rise from your place (council).  </strong></span>(Surah Al-Naml, 27: 39)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, it is authentically reported on the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) deputed me to keep Zakat-ul-Fitr (obligatory charity paid before the Festival of Breaking the Fast) of Ramadan. A comer came and started taking (stealthily) handfuls of the foodstuff (of Zakat-ul-Fitr). I took hold of him and said, &#8220;By Allah, I will take you to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him).&#8221; He said, &#8220;Leave me, for I am needy and have many dependents, and I am in great need.&#8221; I released him, and in the morning Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) asked me, &#8220;O Abu Hurayrah! What did your prisoner do yesterday?&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! The person complained of being needy and of having many dependents, so, I pitied him and let him go.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;Indeed, he told you a lie and he will be coming again.&#8221; I believed that he would show up again as Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) had told me. So, I waited for him watchfully. When he (showed up and) started stealing handfuls of foodstuff, I caught hold of him again and said, &#8220;I will definitely take you to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him). He said, &#8220;Leave me, for I am very needy and have many dependents. I promise I will not come back again.&#8221; I pitied him and let him go. In the morning Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) asked me, &#8220;O Abu Hurayrah, What did your prisoner do.&#8221; I replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! He complained of his great need and of so many dependents, so I took pity on him and set him free.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;Verily, he told you a lie and he will return.&#8221; I waited for him attentively for the third time, and when he (came and) started stealing handfuls of the foodstuff, I caught hold of him and said, &#8220;I will surely take you to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) as it is the third time you promise not to return, yet you break your promise and come.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Let me go and I will teach you some words with which Allah will benefit you.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What are they?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Whenever you go to bed, recite Ayat-ul-Kursy (the Qur’anic Verse of Allah’s Chair, Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:255): Allâh! Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), Al-Hayyul-Qayyum (the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists). (If you do so), Allah will appoint a guard for you who will stay with you and no Satan will come near you until morning.&#8221; (Abu Hurayrah or another narrator added) that they (the Companions) were very keen to do good deeds&#8230; The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;He really spoke the truth, although he is an absolute liar. Do you know whom you were talking to, these three nights, O Abu Hurayrah?&#8221; I said, &#8220;No.&#8221; He said, &#8220;It was Satan.&#8221;</strong></span> (Hadith Mu`allaq (a Hadith missing link in the chain of narration, reported directly from the Prophet) related by Al-Bukhari in a manner hinting to its authenticity).

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">115- Ruling on those who claim to be mediators between mankind and Jinn for the sake of treating incurable diseases</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: I heard that there is a woman who deals with Jinn (creatures created from fire). She was told by Jinn that she will be a good mediator between mankind and Jinn in order to treat incurable diseases that physicians failed to treat. The woman is only a mediator, while the Jinn are the ones who will prescribe medicines and perform operations. But people cannot see them. What is the ruling on this regard?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: There is no basis for what you mentioned and such statements can not be relied upon. The tales of Jinn, very old women and those who serve the Jinn are unauthentic and can not be relied upon. It is not permissible to deem as authentic the sayings of old women, old men, youth or any other person who reports from the Jinn. One should guard himself against using or serving them. This is because if the Jinn use him, they will draw him to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) if they are unbelievers. Moreover, there is no certain way whereby we can distinguish the believer from the unbeliever. They may be hypocrites who deceive Mu&#8217;mins (believers) by these acts. This is because one can not discern their affairs or deal with them openly in order to know their status and morals from authentic sources to distinguish between the reliable and the unreliable ones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Briefly, there is great ambiguity and difference in morals and attributes between us and them whereby we can not know their realities. Whoever is a believer among them, we supplicate to Allah (Exalted be He) to grant him success and guidance. But we can not trust or rely upon them in treating patients, counseling with them or any thing else as this leads to claiming to know the Ghayb (the Unseen). Man may be tried by dealing with the Jinn and thinks that he knows the Ghayb through the Jinn. He will be, in this case, like those people about whom Allah (may He Glorified and Exalted) says: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘And verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter with the males among the jinn, but they (jinn) increased them (mankind) in sin and transgression&#8217;</strong></span>. Man will be in great danger if he deals with the Jinn. They may lead him to commit Shirk, Bid`ah (innovation in religion) and sins. Thus, man can cause harm to himself or to others unknowingly. Consequently, it is not permissible to deal with them for the sake of curing or any other purpose.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one knows or deals with any one of the Jinn, he has to call him to worship Allah alone, teach him goodness, call him to Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah) and obedience to Allah (Exalted be He). One should also advise him to teach others goodness and obedience to Allah (Exalted be He). <strong>But man should not trust them or ask them anything for people because they may give him something that brings harm to people</strong>. They may give him something good and then deceive him. Briefly, he who deals with them faces great danger because one cannot certainly discern their affairs because they see you and you cannot see them. They may conceal many things from you. They may also claim to be Muslims while they are hypocrites. They may deal with you in order to achieve certain purposes and then do whatever they desired when their purposes are achieved. If you deal with them, you will be in danger. Therefore, you have to avoid them<b> </b>except for the sake of calling them to Allah (Exalted be He), informing, and guiding them to the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: There is a woman called Masasah (sucker) who lives in a village. Men and women used to visit her for treatment especially those who suffer diseases in their abdomens, back or chest. Every one pays her one hundred Riyals. If a man suffers pains in his abdomen, she makes him lie down on his back and sucks his abdomen with her mouth. This means that she puts her mouth on the place of pain and sucks like the process of cupping without using anything. Then, she ejects from her mouth a pebble, vein or anything else. Is it permissible to do this? May Allah reward you well!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It seems that this woman is a sorcerer who deceives people by these acts. People think that she has knowledge and extraordinary abilities that are unknown to physicians as she sucks a man&#8217;s abdomen and then ejects pebbles and the like from her mouth. This woman may use the Jinn in order to trick people by showing them that she brings something out of their abdomens while there is nothing. She only deceives people&#8217;s sight as was done by the sorcerers during the confrontation between Musa (Moses) and Pharaoh. She might also have something in her mouth like pebbles upon visiting the patient. Then, she ejects it when she sucks his abdomen in order to convince people that this thing comes out of his abdomen. We believe that it is not permissible to visit or seek treatment with this woman and others like her. This is because this woman and those like her are sorcerers who deceive people with lies or with using Jinn and things that were prohibited by Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) as Shirk and other evil things that she does with patients for the sake of curing them. Briefly, it appears that this woman is a liar and a sorcerers who uses Jinn. Therefore, it is not permissible to visit her or those like her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He who visits a diviner and asks him about anything, his Salahs (Prayers) extending to forty nights will not be accepted</strong></span>. This Hadith was reported by Muslim in his Sahih.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was reported in another narration: He who visits a diviner or a fortuneteller and believes him in what he says disbelieves what was revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This women and those like her lie and invent things that are baseless. These false things are told by Jinn in order to deceive people and lead them astray without knowing the truth. Allah is the One sought for help.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: I have a story that I desire to tell you about in order to give me an interpretation or advice about it. My neighbor&#8217;s daughter who is eighteen years old was sick. She had a psychological disorder. Her father brought her to physicians, but they did not achieve any progress. Then, he brought her to diviners and sorcerers who told him that she was touched by Jinn and they would treat her. The girl stayed with them for one day only. Then, she returned home as she had completely recovered from her disease. She now leads a normal and tranquil life with her father. What is the ruling on this regard? May Allah reward you well!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This may be done by Jinn and their supporters. They may cause harm to a woman or a man in order to make him feel sick. Then, if the guardian of the patient visits them and asks them for help, they will help him and remove the causes of diseases they have done. They do this in order to deceive people and lead them to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and glorifying, resorting, seeking help and invoking Jinn and devils. All these acts are from evil acts and the machinations plotted by devils. Therefore, a Muslim should not be deceived by these things. He should not visit, resort or ask those people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: He who visits a diviner and asks him about anything, his Salah (Prayer) extending to forty nights will not be accepted. And: He (peace be upon him) said when he was asked about diviners: &#8220;Do not visit them!&#8221; He said: &#8220;They are nothing.&#8221; And: He who visits a diviner or a fortuneteller and believes him in what he says disbelieves what was revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him). And: He is not from us; who performs sorcery or has it performed for him, performs divination or has it performed for him or sees an evil omen or has it seen for him. All these acts, machinations and deception do not give people an excuse to visit them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>People should avoid them and seek cure from these diseases through legal remedies which includes reciting the Qur&#8217;an. Reciting the Qur&#8217;an is a remedy for diseases caused by Jinn and others. A Mu&#8217;min (believer) should recite for the patient and supplicate to Allah (Exalted be He) to grant him cure and recovery. Then, harm will be removed by Allah&#8217;s Will. This remedy was tried by the Imams (initiator of a School of Jurisprudence) and scholars in past and modern ages and was a cause of cure and remedy.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one died because of this disease, it would be his moment of death. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) predestined for him to die because of this disease that they think to be the handwork of sorcerers and Jinn. Therefore, one should not prefer his temporal desire for obtaining a cure at their hands through something that causes harm in his religion and incurs Allah&#8217;s wrath upon him to what pleases Allah (Exalted be He) and brings about His satisfaction. Therefore, one should follow legal instructions and remedies. If he dies, he will die according to his appointed moment of death. This is what should man think and do. He is not permitted to visit sorcerers or diviners out of fear of death. All these acts are great falsehoods, mischief in the earth, defiance of religion and aggression against what is legislated by Allah (Glorified be He). Allah is the One sought for help.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: The questioner says that she has a sister who complains about obsessive insinuations, especially while performing ablution. She requests His Eminence Shaikh to guide her to the best way which, by Allah&#8217;s Permission, will relieve her from this anxiety. </span> (Question no. 1, tape no. 247)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Many people, men and women, complain about the obsessive misgivings. The treatment of this disease is to <strong>seek refuge with Allah</strong> (Most Exalted be He) from Satan, because it is one of his manifold wicked insinuations and one of his plots.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is well-known that Satan is the open enemy of Allah, about whom He (Most Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Surely, Shaitân </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Satan)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> is an enemy to you, so take </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(treat)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> him as an enemy. He only invites his Hizb </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(followers)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> that they may become the dwellers of the blazing Fire</span></strong>&#8220;. (Surah Fatir, 35: 6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Most Exalted and Sublime be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;And if an evil whisper from Shaitân (Satan) tries to turn you away (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) (from doing good), then seek refuge in Allâh. Verily, He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower&#8221;. </strong></span>(Surah Fussilat, 41: 36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the treatment of this disease is to seek refuge with Allah from Satan, the outcast, while performing ablution, during prayer and in all other situations. Whenever one feels the evil misgivings, he should seek refuge with Allah from Satan by saying: I seek refuge with Allah from Satan, the outcast, and one should have strong will and sincerity to get rid of these misgivings and should have hope in Allah (Most Exalted and Sublime be He).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In order to fight against this enemy, one need <strong>strong will </strong>and <strong>sincerity</strong>, and be sure that no one saves man from Satan except Allah, Who is All-Omnipotent to do all things (Most Exalted be He). Therefore, it is the duty of all Muslims, men and women, to resort to Allah (Most Exalted be He) with sincerity and seek His Help to save them from this enemy whenever they feel these evil misgivings and in all other situations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The believer should seek help and support from Allah (Most Exalted be He) by saying: <em>O Lord, protect me from Satan and from his insinuations! O Lord, keep me away from his evil! O Allah, save me from his evil temptations and wicked thoughts.</em> One should ask his Lord and seek help from Allah, and Allah (Most Exalted be He) will protect him so long as the servant is sincere in his supplication. Allah (Most Exalted be He) says: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Call upon Me; I will respond to you</strong></span>. Allah does not break His Promise (Most Exalted and Sublime be He). However, man might not be serious in seeking help from Allah, and thus become heedless and call upon Allah without sincerity. Thus, there has to be sincerity and true desire in seeking the protection of Allah (Most Exalted be He). The person should resort to Allah and wholly submit himself to Him with complete faithfulness and hope in order to gain protection from this open enemy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If someone performs ablution he <strong>should not repeat</strong> his ablution due to devilish insinuations. Likewise, he should not repeat his prayer because of such insinuations. He should full trust that his ablution and prayer are valid and should not repeat any part of them due to Satan&#8217;s insinuations. For, if he inclines to obey Satan and repeats ablution or the prayer, then the enemy of Allah will prompt him with more evil temptations. Thus, whenever you perform ablution and you are confident that you have fulfilled all its requirements, then do not let doubt creep into your heart. Fear Allah and do not repeat some or all of its acts. Do not respond to the misgivings of Satan. The same should be done with regard to prayer which you should complete with no insinuations as having made mistakes therein. Do the same thing in every similar situation in which you withstand the misgivings of the enemy of Allah and beat him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Katheer – Allaah have mercy upon him – reports the following incident in his tafseer of <strong>Surah Al-Jinn, verse 11</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad b. Sulaymaan al-Najjaad said in his Amaalee: … Abu Mu’aawiyah said, I heard Al-A’mash say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“ ‘A jinni once came to us and I asked him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">what is the favorite food amongst you?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied, ‘Rice.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we gave some to them and I saw handfuls of rice being lifted and I couldn’t see anyone [picking them up].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked, ‘Do these false desires (bid’ah) that are amongst us exist amongst you?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied, ‘Yes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘How are the Raafidah amongst you?’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘The worst of us.’”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer said, ‘I presented this chain of narration to our Shaykh, Al-Haafidh Abu Al-Hajjaaj Al-Mizzee and he said, ‘This chain of narration is saheeh all the way to Al-A’mash.’’</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahya was commanded by Allaah with Tawheed, singling out Allaah with all worship, without ascribing partners to Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imam Ahmad</strong> narrated that Al-Harith Al-Ash&#8217;ari said that the Prophet of Allaah <em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah commanded Yahya bin [son of] Zakariya to implement <strong>five commands</strong> and to order the Children of Israel to implement them, but Yahya was slow in carrying out these commands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Isa (Jesus, son of Mary) said to Yahya, &#8216;<em>You were ordered to implement five commands and to order the Children of Israel to implement them. So either order, or I will do it</em>.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahya said, &#8216;<em>My brother! I fear that if you do it before me, I will be punished or the earth will be shaken under my feet</em>.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, Yahya bin Zakariya called the Children of Israel to <em><strong>Bayt Al-Maqdis</strong></em> (Jerusalem), until they filled the Masjid. He sat on the balcony, thanked Allaah and praised him and then said, &#8216;A<em>llaah ordered me to implement five commandments and that I should order you to adhere to them</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">The first</span></strong> is that you <strong>worship Allaah alone</strong> and not associate any with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The example of this command is the example of a man who bought a servant from his money with paper or gold. The servant started to work for the master, but was paying the profits to another person. Who among you would like his servant to do that? Allaah created you and sustains you. Therefore, worship Him alone and do not associate anything with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also command you to <strong>pray</strong>, for Allaah directs His Face towards His servant&#8217;s face, as long as the servant does not turn away. So when you pray, do not turn your heads to and fro.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also command you to <strong>fast</strong>. The example of it is the example of a man in a group of men and he has some musk wrapped in a piece of cloth, and consequently, all of the group smells the scent of the wrapped musk. Verily, the odor of the mouth of a fasting person is better before Allaah than the scent of musk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also command you to give <strong>charity</strong>. The example of this is the example of a man who was captured by the enemy. They tied his hands to his neck and brought him forth to cut off his neck. He said to them, &#8216;Can I pay a ransom for myself?&#8217; He kept ransoming himself with small and large amounts until he liberated himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>I also command you to always remember Allaah. The example of this deed is that of a man who the enemy is tirelessly pursuing. He takes refuge in a fortified fort. When the servant remembers Allaah, he will be resorting to the best refuge from Satan.</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">Q: What are the most important books that discuss the secrets of the souls and the treatment of wild whims, and who are the most important authors in this respect?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: One of the best books in this respect is the one written by <span style="color:#800080;"><strong>Ibn Al-Jawzy</strong></span> (may Allah be merciful to him). He was a preacher who thoroughly explored the souls. He wrote a book entitled <span style="color:#800080;"><strong>&#8220;Talbis Iblis&#8221; (Entanglements of the Devil)</strong></span> in which he discussed the ways that the devil uses to entangle humans in whims and suspicions. Ibn Al-Jawzy (may Allah be merciful to him) really excelled in this book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, there is a book entitled <span style="color:#800080;"><strong>&#8220;Ighathat-ul-Lahfan min Maka&#8217;id Al-Shaytan (Relieving the Distressed from the Stratagems of the Devil)</strong></span> by <strong><span style="color:#800080;">Ibn Al-Qayyim</span></strong> (may Allah be merciful to him), which discusses a valuable subject. It is summarized by <span style="color:#800000;">Shaykh `Abdullah ibn `Abdul-Rahman Ababtin</span> in <span style="color:#800000;">&#8220;Mukhtasar Al-Ighathah (The Summary of the Relief of the Distressed)&#8221;</span> and many other books.</p>
<p>May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says in Surah Al-A&#8217;raf,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(201. Verily, those who have Taqwa, when an evil thought comes to them from Shaytan, they remember (Allah), and (indeed) they then see (aright).)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(202. But (as for) their brothers (the devils&#8217; brothers) they (the devils) plunge them deeper into error, and they never stop short.)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#000000;text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Allah mentions His servants who have <span style="color:#800080;text-decoration:underline;">Taqwa</span>, obeying His orders, and avoid what He forbade</strong></span></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">(when comes to them)</span> an evil thought, or anger, or the whispers of Shaytan cross their mind, or intend to err, or commit an error,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">(they remember)</span> Allah&#8217;s punishment, as well as, His tremendous reward. They remember Allah&#8217;s promises and threats, then repent, go back to Him, seek refuge with Him and ask for forgiveness before death,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">(and (indeed) they then see (aright))</span> they become aright and aware of the error of their ways.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allah said next,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">(But (as for) their brothers they plunge them deeper)</span> in reference to the devils&#8217; brothers among mankind. Allah said in another Ayah, (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Verily, the spendthrifts are brothers of the Shayatin</strong></span>) (17:27) for they are followers of the Shayatin, who listen to them and obey their orders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">(They plunge them deeper into error)</span> the devils help them commit sins, making this path easy and appealing to them</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">(and they never stop short)</span> for the devils never cease inciting mankind to commit errors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">(But (as for) their brothers they plunge them deeper into error, and they never stop short.)</span> &#8220;Neither mankind stop short of the evil that they are doing nor the devils stop short of luring them. &#8221; Therefore,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">(they never stop short)</span> refers to the devils getting tired or stopping their whispering.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allah said in another Ayah,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>See you not that We have sent Shayatin against the disbelievers to push them to do evil</strong></span>) (19:83) persistently luring the disbelievers to commit evil, according to Ibn `Abbas and others.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Question</strong> : A Muslim sister asks about the ruling on turning one&#8217;s head during Salah to seek refuge in Allah from the devil called Khanzab (a devil that distracts a servant at the time of prayer)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: There is no harm in turning the head during Salah seeking refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan when casting his insinuations. Rather, it is desirable when there is a dire need for it on condition that it is done by moving one&#8217;s head only, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) ordered ‘Uthman ibn Abul-‘As Ath-Thaqafi (may Allah be pleased with him) to do so when he complained to the Prophet about the insinuating thoughts that Satan casts during prayers, so he ordered him <strong>to spit (dryly) to his left side three times and seek refuge in Allah from Satan</strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">.</span>[1] He did so and Allah granted him recovery.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for turning one&#8217;s head during performing Salah without a due reason, this is undesirable. When the Prophet (peace be upon him) was asked about this, he said: It is a quick stealing by which Satan takes away (a portion) from the prayer of a person (By making him glance left and right). May Allah guide us all to what pleases Him! He is All-Hearing and Responsive.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">Jabir reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (ﷺ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Iblis places his throne upon water; he then sends detachments (for creating dissension) ; the nearer to him in rank are those who are most notorious in creating dissension. One of them comes and says: I did so and so. And he says: You have done nothing. Then one amongst them comes and says: <strong>I did not spare so and so until I sowed the seed of discord between a husband and a wife.</strong> The Satan goes near him and says: <strong>&#8216;You have done well.</strong> A&#8217;mash said: <strong>He then embraces him.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Ayah &#8220;&#8230;and follow not the footsteps of Shaitan&#8221;</p>
<p>The second question of Fatwa no. 20703</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">Q 2: Allah (Exalted be He) says: and follow not the footsteps of Shaitan (Satan). What are the footsteps of Satan? Is looking at non-Mahram women (not a spouse or unmarriageable relatives) in real life or on satellite channels or talking to them on the phone or in the markets or flirting with them considered as following the footsteps of Satan? Is reading romantic books and art and fashion magazines with pictures of actresses and beautiful and charming celebrities considered as following the footsteps of Satan? What is our duty towards a person who does so? May Allah benefit us and you!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Following the footsteps of Satan as Ibn Kathir mentioned in his book in which he explained the meanings of the Qur&#8217;an (Tafsir Ibn Kathir vol. 1, p. 204) that Qatadah and Al-Suddy said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">&#8220;All sins are footsteps of Satan.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Ikrimah said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">&#8220;They are the incitements of Satan.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujahid said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">&#8220;Satan&#8217;s footsteps are his mistakes and sins.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Mijlaz said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">&#8220;Satan&#8217;s footsteps are vows involving sins.</span>&#8220;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Qurtuby (in Tafsir Al-Qurtuby vol. 1, P. 308) said, &#8220;I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">The correct view is that the utterance is general and covers all the sins and Bid`ahs (innovations in religion) but not the acts of Sunnah (commendable acts) nor the rulings of Shari`ah (Islamic law).&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Subsequently, it is clear that the footsteps of Satan apply to all the acts that involve disobedience to Allah (Exalted be He). So, whoever disobeys the orders of Allah (Exalted be He) and His Messenger (peace be upon him), violates the rulings of Shari`ah, and commits things which Allah (Exalted be He) has prohibited is disobeying Him.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All that is mentioned in the question is considered as footsteps and tricks of Satanabout which Allah (Exalted be He) says: He [Shaitân (Satan)] commands you only what is evil and Fahshâ (sinful), and that you should say against Allâh what you know not. Anyone who commits any such sins has to turn to Allah (Exalted be He) in sincere repentance and never do any such evil deeds again. Whoever knows any person who commits any such deeds has to advise them gently and leniently and explain the evil consequences of their bad deeds and encourage them to do good deeds and draw closer to Allah (Exalted be He) through supererogatory acts of worship and performance of Salah (Prayer) in congregation as Allah (Exalted be He) and His Messenger have ordered; because Salah prohibits immorality and wrongdoing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fatwa no. 19753</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: A man heard me cursing Satan one day and criticized me for that. He said it is prohibited to curse Satan, because cursing him makes him haughty. Is this correct? Please, advise. May Allah reward you!</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: When Satan incites a Muslim to sin or whispers (suggests) to him, it is permissible for him to <strong>seek refuge and protection in Allah</strong> Alone from Satan. Also, it is permissible for the Muslim who fears the harm of Satan&#8217;s plot, or that of his supporters, to <strong>seek the help of Allah to ward off Satan&#8217;s evil and harm</strong>. He should <strong>often recite Dhikr (Remembrance of Allah)</strong> so that Allah will rebuke him and thwart his plot in a disgraceful manner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allah (Exalted be He) states: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;And if an evil whisper comes to you from Shaitân (Satan), then seek refuge with Allâh. Verily, He is All-Hearer, All-Knower.&#8221; </strong></span>(Surah Al-A`raf, 7: 200)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Exalted be He) says: And say: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;My Lord! I seek refuge with You from the whisperings (suggestions) of the Shayâtîn (devils).&#8221; </span></strong>(Surah Al-Mu&#8217;minun, 23: 97)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;And I seek refuge with You, My Lord! lest they should come near me.&#8221; </strong></span>(Surah Al-Mu&#8217;minun, 23: 98)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was authentically reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that: &#8220;when getting up to pray, he (peace be upon him) used to say:<strong> I seek refuge in Allah the All-Hearing and All-Knowing from the accursed Satan , from his Hamz (evil whispers) and his Nafkh (arrogance) and his Nafth (spell and in that Hadith scholars interpreted Nafth as Poetry).&#8221; </strong>[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was also compiled by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad (Hadith compilation) Vol. 5 p. 59 on the authority of Abu Tamimah Al-Hujaimy that a man who was riding behind the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;One day as I was riding behind the Prophet on a donkey, it stumbled and I shouted, “Let Satan perish!” The Prophet said, “Do not say ‘let Satan perish,’ for if you say so he will feel important and haughty and he will say, ‘I thwarted him with my power!’ Instead say, ‘In the name of Allah,’ so that he will (feel humiliated and) be smaller than a fly” </strong>[2]. A similar narration was related by Abu Dawud in his Sunan (Hadith compilations classified by jurisprudential themes).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was mentioned in the book of Al-Samt wa Adab Al-Lisan (Silence and Etiquettes of the Tongue) written by Ibn Abu Al-Dunia p. 205 on the authority of Mujahid (may Allah be merciful with him) saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Seldom do people mention Satan but he attends to them; when he hears someone invoking curses on him, he says, &#8216;<strong>Indeed, you invoke curses on a cursed being</strong>.&#8217; There is nothing more breaking to Satan&#8217;s back than saying &#8216;there is no deity worthy of worship but Allah.'&#8221; This is the effective cure for fending off Satan&#8217;s harm from man, since the evil of the rebellious Jinn (creatures created from fire) cannot be removed except by that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah cursed Satan in His Book repeatedly when he became arrogant and refused to carry out the order of Allah to prostrate before Adam in honor and respect. As a result, Allah described Satan as an accursed outcast. He has been expelled from the mercy and Paradise of Allah on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">They (all those who worship others than Allâh) invoke nothing but female deities besides Him (Allâh), and they invoke nothing but Shaitân (Satan), a persistent rebel! Allâh cursed him. And he [Shaitân (Satan)] said: &#8220;I will take an appointed portion of your slaves.</span> [Surah Al-Nisa&#8217;, 4: 117-118]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">He may He be Exalted) stated: (Allâh) said: &#8220;Then, get out from here, for verily, you are Rajîm (an outcast or a cursed one).&#8221; [Tafsîr At-Tabarî] &#8220;And verily, the curse shall be upon you till the Day of Recompense (i.e. the Day of Resurrection).&#8221;</span> [Surah Al-Hijr, 15: 34-35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (peace be upon him) cursed Satan in his Salah (prayer) when he (the Prophet) resisted him and wanted to harm and destroy him. It was related by Imam Muslim in his Sahih (authentic) Book of Hadith on the authority of Abu Al-Darda&#8217; (may Allah be pleased with him) saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) stood up (to pray) and we heard him say:&#8221; I seek refuge in Allah from you.&#8221; Then said: &#8220;I curse you with Allah&#8217;s curse&#8221; three times, then he stretched out his hand as though he was taking hold of something. When he finished the prayer, we said: Messenger of Allah, we heard you say something during the prayer which we have not heard you say before, and we saw you stretch out your hand. He replied: Allah&#8217;s enemy Satan came with a flame of fire to put it in my face, so I said three times: &#8220;I seek refuge in Allah from you.&#8221; Then I said three times: &#8220;I curse you with Allah&#8217;s full curse.&#8221; But he did not retreat (on any one of these) three occasions. Thereafter, I meant to seize him. I swear by Allah that had it not been for the supplication of my brother Solomon he would have been bound, and made an object of sport for the children of Madinah. </span>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is permissible for the Muslim to curse Satan when he comes to harm him or tries to dissuade him from obedience to Allah. Nonetheless, he should not give up seeking refuge in Allah from Satan, always reciting Dhikr (Remembrance of Allah), Bismillah [In the Name of Allah] or other Adhkar (invocations), which are permissible under the Shari`ah (Islamic law). This guarantees protection of the Muslim against the evil of Satan.Based on the Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse) and Hadiths mentioned above, a Muslim should not take to cursing Satan needlessly as a form of following the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him).</p>
<p>May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">(6) <strong>Conjuration</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">Q: Among us are some members of a dervish order; one of them is a relative of ours. He is an illiterate man, not gifted by any agility or wit, but he drank a sip of water from the hands of the head of this order to be able to perform charlatan tricks and sorcery before the people. He can strike his stomach with every cutting weapon such as daggers, swords, pieces of wood, bullets, etc. He is neither a practicing Muslim, nor does he perform the obligatory acts of worship enjoined by Allah such as Salah (Prayer), Sawm (Fasting) and others.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">Please clarify the opinion of Islam regarding this matter. What is the secret of his ability to strike himself in this manner? Please reply in writing, as this phenomenon takes place in our country and in other Arab and Muslim countries as well.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Allah sent Muhammad (peace be upon him) as the Final Messenger, on the authority of Qur’anic texts and Ijma‘ (scholarly consensus), as Allah says (what means), Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allâh and the last (end) of the Prophets. (Surah Al-Ahzab, 33: 40). Hadiths were reported from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) by a significant number of trustworthy narrators to show that he is the Last of Prophets; and Muslims have unanimously agreed to this.</p>
<p><strong>Awliya’ (supporters) are of two types</strong>: Awliya’ of Allah, and Awliya’ of Satan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (may He be praised and Exalted) has explained in His Book and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace be upon him) that He has Awliya’ from among mankind, and that Satan also has his Awliya’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, Allah distinguishes between those who serve and support Him and those who serve and support Satan, saying (what means): No doubt! Verily, the Auliyâ’ of Allâh [i.e. those who believe in the Oneness of Allâh and fear Allâh much (abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which he has forbidden), and love Allâh much (perform all kinds of good deeds which He has ordained)], no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve. Those who believed (in the Oneness of Allâh &#8211; Islâmic Monotheism), and used to fear Allâh much (by abstaining from evil deeds and sins and by doing righteous deeds). For them are glad tidings, in the life of the present world (i.e. through a righteous dream seen by the person himself or shown to others), and in the Hereafter. No change can there be in the Words of Allâh. This is indeed the supreme success. (Surah Yunus, 10: 62-64).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah also states, Allâh is the Walî (Protector or Guardian) of those who believe. He brings them out from darkness into light. But as for those who disbelieve, their Auliyâ (supporters and helpers) are Tâghût [false deities and false leaders], they bring them out from light into darkness. Those are the dwellers of the Fire, and they will abide therein forever. (See V.2:81,82) (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 257). It is mentioned in the Sahih (authentic) Hadith narrated by Al-Bukhari and others, from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he stated, Allah says: “Whoever antagonizes a Waliy (sing. of Awliya’) of Mine has challenged Me to fight &#8211; or I have declared war against him.” The Prophet (peace be upon him) informed that if anyone declares hostility to the Awliya’ of Allah, he thus declares hostility and a fighting challenge against Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah also mentions the Awliya’ of Satan when He states: So when you want to recite the Qur’ân, seek refuge with Allâh from Shaitân (Satan), the outcast (the cursed one). Verily! He has no power over those who believe and put their trust only in their Lord (Allâh). His power is only over those who obey and follow him (Satan), and those who join partners with Him (Allâh i.e. those who are Mushrikûn i.e. polytheists. See Verse 6:121). (Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 98-100). Allah also says: And whoever takes Shaitân (Satan) as a Walî (protector or helper) instead of Allâh, has surely suffered a manifest loss. (Surah Al-Nisa’, 4: 119).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah also says: Verily, We made the Shayâtin (devils) Auliyâ’ (protectors and helpers) for those who believe not. And when they commit a Fâhishah (evil deed, going round the Ka‘bah in naked state, and every kind of unlawful sexual intercourse), they say: “We found our fathers doing it&#8221; until Allah’s saying: surely they took the Shayâtîn (devils) as Auliyâ’ (protectors and helpers) instead of Allâh, and think that they are guided. (Surah Al-A‘raf, 7: 27-30). Allah also says: And certainly, the Shayâtîn (devils) do inspire their friends (from mankind) to dispute with you, and if you obey them [by making Al-Maitah (a dead animal) legal by eating it], then you would indeed be Mushrikûn (polytheists); [because they (devils and their friends) made lawful to you to eat that which Allâh has made unlawful to eat and you obeyed them by considering it lawful to eat, and by doing so you worshipped them; and to worship others besides Allâh is polytheism]. (Surah Al-An‘am, 6: 121). Allah relates the statement of the Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham, peace be upon him) who said: &#8220;O my father! Verily I fear lest a torment from the Most Gracious (Allâh) should overtake you, so that you become a companion of Shaitân (Satan) (in the Hell-fire).&#8221; [Tafsir Al-Qurtubî] (Surah Maryam, 19: 45). Allah also says: O you who believe! Take not My enemies and your enemies (i.e. disbelievers and polytheists) as friends, showing affection towards them until Allah’s saying: Verily, You, only You, are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.&#8221; (Surah Al-Mumtahanah, 60: 1-5).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is authentically reported in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) from ‘Amr Ibn Al-‘As (may Allah be pleased with him) that he heard the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) say publicly, not in secret: Behold! The family of so-and-so (referring to one group among his relatives) are not of my Awliya’ (supporters). Verily, my Wali (Protector, Supporter, and Helper) is Allah and the righteous believers.</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong> Thus, the difference between the Awliya’ of the All-Merciful and the Awliya’ of Satan is</strong>:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Awliya’ of the All-Merciful are the Allah-fearing, pious believers, as Allah states: No doubt! Verily, the Auliyâ’ of Allâh [i.e. those who believe in the Oneness of Allâh and fear Allâh much (abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which he has forbidden), and love Allâh much (perform all kinds of good deeds which He has ordained)], no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve. Those who believed (in the Oneness of Allâh &#8211; Islâmic Monotheism), and used to fear Allâh much (by abstaining from evil deeds and sins and by doing righteous deeds). (Surah Yunus, 10: 62-63); whereas the latter are those who show hostility towards Allah and do not obey His Law.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, the best Awliya’ of Allah are His Messengers; Allah has manifested miracles and performed Karamahs (wonders) through His Messengers. Allah may also bring about Karamahs at the hands of His Awliya’; whereas the astounding feats performed by the Awliya’ of Satan are diabolical practices. The Shaykh of Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said, “Linguistically speaking a Mu‘jizah (miracle) refers to anything extraordinary, as defined by the precedent Imams like Imam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal and others who call it a sign, yet many of the latter Imams differentiate between them in terms of wording, attributing a Mu‘jizah (miracle) to a Prophet and a Karamah (wonder) to a Waliy. However, both of them signify something extraordinary.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Given this, the person in question is of the Awliya’ of Satan, and his mentioned acts are satanic and deception wrought on people’s eyes. These acts are nothing real; they are illusions and deception wrought on people by the help of the devils.<br />
May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">What are the Qur&#8217;anic verses that repel witchcraft?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Some scholars mentioned that one of the ways of protection from what may touch a person of witchcraft and Jinn possession or what may turn him away from his wife is to read <strong>Ayat-ul-Kursy</strong> and blowing it into water, and Surahs (Qur&#8217;anic chapters) <strong>Al-Fatihah</strong> (Opening Chapter of the Qur&#8217;an), <strong>Al-Kafirun, Al-Ikhlas</strong> and <strong>Al-Mu`awwidhatayn</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If someone recites these Surahs and the noble verse of Ayat-ul-Kursy, and the verses relating to witchcraft in <strong>Surah Al-A`raf</strong> and the two <strong>Surahs of Yunus</strong> and <strong>Taha</strong>; this is one of the causes of recovery.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a man drinks the water (over which these Surahs and verses are recited) and washes up with it, it will protect him witchcraft and free him from anything that makes him dislike and keep away from his wife.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The verses of <strong>Surah Al-A`raf </strong>(7: 117-119)<strong> </strong> are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And We revealed to Mûsâ (Moses) (saying): &#8220;Throw your stick,&#8221; and behold! It swallowed up straight away all the falsehoods which they showed. Thus truth was confirmed, and all that they did was made of no effect. So they were defeated there and returned disgraced.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These verses from Surah Al-A`raf are one ofthe causes of healing, by reciting them over water or blowing them into the sick person together with Surahs Al-Fatihah, Al-Kafirun, Al-Ikhlas, Mu`awwidhatayn as well as Ayat-ul-Kursy. One can either breath them over the patient or recite them over water and then have them drink it and wash up with the rest.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In <strong>Surah Yunus</strong> (verses 79-82), Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) said: &#8220;Bring me every well-versed sorcerer.&#8221; And when the sorcerers came, Mûsâ (Moses) said to them: &#8220;Cast down what you want to cast!&#8221; Then when they had cast down, Mûsâ (Moses) said: &#8220;What you have brought is sorcery; Allâh will surely make it of no effect. Verily, Allâh does not set right the work of Al-Mufsidûn (the evil-doers, corrupters). &#8220;And Allâh will establish and make apparent the truth by His Words, however much the Mujrimûn (criminals, disbelievers, polytheists, sinners) may hate it.&#8221; </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that one may either recite them over patients or recite them over water and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The verses of <strong>Surah Taha</strong> are verses 65-69:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>They said: &#8220;O Mûsâ (Moses)! Either you throw first or we be the first to throw?&#8221; [Mûsâ (Moses)] said: &#8220;Nay, throw you (first)!&#8221; Then behold! their ropes and their sticks, by their magic, appeared to him as though they moved fast. So Mûsâ (Moses) conceived fear in himself. We (Allâh) said: &#8220;Fear not! Surely, you will have the upper hand. &#8220;And throw that which is in your right hand! It will swallow up that which they have made. That which they have made is only a magician’s trick, and the magician will never be successful, to whatever amount (of skill) he may attain.&#8221;</em></span></p>

Fatwas of Nur `Ala Al-Darb&gt;Volume 3&gt;A chapter on issues related to witchcraft&gt;<a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/fatawaDetails.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;PageID=357&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Legal Wirds and supplications for seeking refuge in Allah are causes of protection from witchcraft</a></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">Q: A questioner asks: Nowadays people talk a lot about witchcraft, may Allah protect you and us from it! What is the right protection of Qur&#8217;an and <em>Sunnah</em> (acts, sayings or approvals of the Prophet) from it? May Allah reward you with the best.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Witchcraft is practiced and it is well-known. There is no doubt that some people may bring it about. A witchcraft practitioner is a <em>Mushrik</em> (one who associates others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) that must be referred to authorities for possible capital punishment if he is found guilty. We ask Allah for protection and well-being.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) ordered his governors to execute practitioners of witchcraft. The Prophet (peace be upon him) stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The prescribed penalty for a witchcraft practitioner is to be struck with the sword.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>[Related by Al-Tirmidhy, Book on ordained punishments, Chapter on the ordained punishment for a magician, no. 1460]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because he is a disbeliever calling to <em>Kufr</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for protection, it is to &#8220;<em>seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah from the evil of what He created</em>&#8221; three times in the morning and three times in the evening, and saying: &#8220;<em>In the name of Allah with whose Name nothing is harmful on Earth nor in the Heavens and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing</em>&#8221; three times in the morning and three times in the evening. These supplications are reported in Hadiths. Whoever does so will be protected by Allah from the evil of all things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reciting Surahs Al-Ikhlas and Al-Mu`awwidhatayn three times in the morning and three times in the evening are a cause of protection from witchcraft and any other harm.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ayat-ul-Kursy can also be recited three times upon going to bed, and this is a cause of protection from witchcraft and Satan. It can also be recited following each <em>Salah</em> (Prayer). All these bring protection and safety. We ask Allah for protection and well-being.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;He (sal-Allaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam) used to stand near to the sutrah, so that there was (a distance of) three cubits between him and the wall&#8221; [37] and &#8220;between the place of his prostration and the wall, (there was) enough space for a sheep to pass.&#8221; [38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>Do not pray except towards a sutrah, and do not let anyone pass in front of you, but if someone continues (to try to pass) then fight him, for he has a companion (i.e. a shaytaan) with him</strong>.»[39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would also say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>When one of you prays towards a sutrah, he should get close to it so that Shaytaan cannot break his prayer</strong>.»[40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sometimes &#8220;<strong>he would seek to pray at the pillar which was in his mosque</strong>.&#8221; [41]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>When he prayed [in an open space where there was nothing to use as sutrah he would plant a spear in the ground in front of him and pray towards it with the people behind him</strong>&#8221; [42];</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sometimes &#8220;he would to set his mount sideways and pray towards it&#8221; [43] but this is not the same as prayer in the resting-place of camels [44], which &#8220;he forbade&#8221; [45], and sometimes &#8220;he would take his saddle; set it lengthways and pray towards its end.&#8221; [46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>When one of you places in front of him something such as the stick on the end of a saddle, he should pray and not mind anyone who passes beyond it</strong>.»[47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once &#8220;he prayed towards a tree&#8221; [48] and sometimes &#8220;he would pray towards the bed on which &#8216;Aa.ishah (radhi-yAllaahu &#8216;anhaa) was lying [under her sheet].&#8221; [49]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (sal-Allaahu &#8216;alayhe wa sallam), would not let anything pass between him and his sutrah, hence once &#8220;<strong>he was praying, when a sheep came running in front of him, so he raced it until he pressed his belly against the wall [and it passed behind him]</strong>.&#8221; [50]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, once &#8220;while praying an obligatory prayer, he clenched his fist (during it), so when he had finished, the people said: &#8216;O Messenger of Allaah, did something happen during the prayer?&#8217; He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«No, except that the devil wanted to pass in front of me, so I strangled him until I could feel the coldness of his tongue on my hand By Allaah! Had my brother Sulaymaan not beaten me to it[51], I would have tied him (the devil) to one of the pillars of the mosque so that the children of Madeenah could walk round him. [So whoever can prevent something intervening between him and the qiblah, he must do so].»[52]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>When one of you prays towards something which is a sutrah between him and the people and someone intends to cross in front of him, then he should push him in the throat [and repel, as much as he can], (in one narration: he should stop him, twice) but if he refuses (to not pass) then he should fight him, for verily he is a devil</strong>.»[53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>If the person who passed in front of someone praying knew (the sin) on him, it would be better for him to wait forty than to pass in front. (Abu an-Nadr said: &#8220;I do not remember exactly whether he said forty days, months or years.&#8221;).</strong>»[54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>What Breaks The Prayer</strong></span></p>
<p>He used to say:</p>
<p>«<strong>A man&#8217;s prayer is cut off when there is nothing such as the end of a saddle in front of him, by: a [menstruating][55] woman, a donkey or a black dog</strong>.» Abu Dharr said: &#8216;I said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah, why the black dog rather than the red one?&#8221; He said:</p>
<p>«<strong>The black dog is a shaytaan</strong>.»[56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes :</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[36] lit., &#8220;screen, cover&#8221;; in the context of prayer, it refers to an object just beyond the place of prostration, within which nothing should pass, as is detailed in this section.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[37] al-Bukhaaree and Ahmad.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[38] al-Bukhaaree and Muslim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[39] Ibn Khuzaymah in his Saheeh (1/93/1) with a sound isnaad.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[40] Abu Daawood, Bazzaar (p. 54 &#8211; az-Zawaa.id) and al-Haakim, who declared it saheeh and adh-Dhahabee and an-Nawawee agreed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[41] al-Bukhaaree. The sutrah is a must for the Imaam or a person praying alone, even in a large mosque. Ibn Haanee said in his Masaa.il from Imaam Ahmad (1/66): &#8220;Abu `Abdullaah (i.e. Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal) saw me one day when I was praying without a sutrah in front of me, and I was in a (large) congregational mosque, so he said to me: `Take something as a sutrah&#8217;, so I took a man as a sutrah.&#8221; This contains an indication that Imaam Ahmad did not differentiate between big or small mosques in taking a sutrah &#8211; and that is surely correct, but this is something neglected by most people, including imaams of mosques, in every land that I have visited, including Arabia which I was able to tour in Rajab of this year (1410), so the `ulamaa should tell the people and advise them of this, explaining its ruling and that it is also required in the Two Sacred Mosques.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[42] al-Bukhaaree, Muslim and Ibn Maajah</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[43] al-Bukhaaree and Ahmad.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[44] i.e., their kneeling place.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[45] al-Bukhaaree and Ahmad.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[46] Muslim, Ibn Khuzaymah (92/2) and Ahmad.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[47] Muslim and Abu Daawood.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[48] an-Nasaa.ee and Ahmad with a saheeh isnaad.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[49] al-Bukhaaree, Muslim and Abu Ya`laa (3/1107).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[50] Ibn Khuzaymah in his Saheeh (1/95/1), at-Tabaraanee (3/140/3) and al-Haakim who declared it saheeh and adh-Dhahabee agreed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[51] Referring to the following prayer of the Prophet Sulaymaan (&#8216;alayhis-salaam) which was answered by Allaah, as described in the Qur.aan:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">{My Lord! Forgive me, and grant me sovereignty not allowed to anyone after me, for You are indeed the Granter of Bounties. So we subjected to his power: the Wind, gently flowing to his order, wherever he wished; and the devils, every kind of builder and diver, and also others bound together in fetters.} (Soorah as-Saad 38: 35-38)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[52] Ahmad, ad-Daaraqutnee and Tabaree with a saheeh isnaad, and similar in meaning to this hadeeth is found in al-Bukhaaree and Muslim and others on the authority of several Companions. It is one of the many ahaadeeth which the Qadiani group disbelieve, for they do not believe in the world of the jinn which is mentioned in the Qur.aan and the Sunnah. Their method of discarding the texts is well-known: if it is from the Qur.aan, they change its meaning e.g. the saying of the Exalted:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">{Say, it has been revealed to me that a group of jinns listened} (72:1); they say &#8220;i.e. a group of humans&#8221;! making the word &#8220;jinn&#8221; synonymous with &#8220;human&#8221;! Hence they play with the language and the religion; if it is from the Sunnah, then if it is possible for them to change it with a false interpretation they do so, otherwise they find it easy to declare it to be false, even if all the Imaams of Hadeeth and the whole ummah behind them are agreed on its authenticity, nay its being mutawaatir. May Allaah guide them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[53] al-Bukhaaree and Muslim, and the additional narration is from Ibn Khuzaymah (1/94/1).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[54] ibid.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[55] i.e. mature, and what is meant by `cut off&#8217; is `rendered futile&#8217;. As regards the hadeeth: &#8220;Nothing cuts off the prayer&#8221;, then it is a weak hadeeth as I have shown in Tamaam al-Minnah (p. 306).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[56] Muslim, Abu Daawood and Ibn Khuzaymah (1/95/2).</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">34. Narrated Abu  Huraira (radhi Allaahu anhu) : Allah’s Messenger (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“When one of you wakes up from his sleep, he must clean his nose (with water, by sniffling it in and then blowing it out) three times, for Satan spends the night inside one’s nostrils.” </span></strong><span style="color:#000000;">[1]</span></span> [Agreed upon].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]<strong> Satan’s spending the night inside the nostrils of a man is plausible. However, its actual state is better known to Allah</strong>. It may be that this is a figurative expression, because bad excretions gather in the nose and cause laziness, indolence, slackness and negligence. And all these states are satanic dispositions. Blowing water out of the nose upon awakening from sleep might be performed as an individual act, or along with ablution. It is  considered obligatory by Ahmad, while the majority of scholars consider it Sunnah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Shytan has power over the believers due to their sins</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A hadith states, &#8220;Allah is with the judge as long as he does not commit any injustice. If he commits any injustice, Allah is free from him and keeps Shytan with him.&#8221; [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Abu al-Faraj ibn al-Jauzi</strong> [2] has related a unique story from <strong>al-Hassan al-Basri</strong> (rahimahullah). The story, depending on how authentic it is, shows the ability of a human in overpowering Shytan if he is sincere to Allah in his religion and it shows how Shytan can take advantage of the human when he strays.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan al-Basri narrated that there was a tree that was worshipped instead of Allah. One man decided to chop down that tree. He was going to chop down the tree out of anger for the sake of Allah. On the way to the tree he met Iblees who was in the form of a man. Iblees asked him, &#8220;What do you plan on doing?&#8221; The man answered, &#8220;I am going to chop down that tree that is worshipped instead of Allah.&#8221; Shytan said, &#8220;If you do not worship it, why should it harm you if others do so?&#8221; The man replied, &#8220;I will chop it down.&#8221; Shytan then told him, &#8220;Would you like something better than that&#8221; Do not cut it and you will get two dinars every morning under your pillow.&#8221; &#8220;From where will I get that?&#8221; the man asked. &#8220;I will give it to you,&#8221; said Iblees. The man returned and the next morning he found two dinars under his pillow. The following morning he again found two dinars under his pillow. On the following morning he did not find anything. He got upset and went to chop down the tree. Shytan again appeared to him in the shape of the same man. Shytan asked him, &#8220;What do you want to do?&#8221; The man answered, &#8220;I plan on cutting down that tree that is worshipped instead of Allah!&#8221; Iblees said, &#8220;You have lied. There is no way you will be able to do it,&#8221; The man left to chop it down. The earth swallowed him and him until it almost killed him. Iblees asked, &#8220;Do you know who I . I am Shytan. I met you for the first time when you were angry for the sake of Allah and I had no power over you. I deceived you by two dinars and you stopped what you had intended to do [for the sake of Allah]. Now you have come because you are angry about the two dinars, and I have gotten mastery over you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>[1] This was recorded by al-Haakim and al-Baihaqi with a hasan chain. See al- Albanee Sahih al-Jaami, vol. 2, p.130</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>[2] Ibn al-Jawzi, Talbees Iblees, p. 43 [The author, al-Ashqar alluded to the fact that the authenticity of this story needs to be ascertained. Most likely, it is from the Israaeeliyaat or stories of the Jews and Christians.]</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Noble Qur&#8217;aan 07.al-Araaf verses 16-17</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">16. (Iblis) said: &#8220;Because You have `Aghwaytni&#8217;, surely, I will sit in wait against them (human beings) on Your straight path.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">17. &#8220;Then I will come to them from before them and behind them, from their right and from their left, and You will not find most of them to be thankful.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said that after He gave respite to Shaytan, <strong>(till the Day they are raised up (resurrected))</strong> and Iblis was sure that he got what he wanted, he went on in defiance and rebellion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, <strong>(“Because You have `Aghwaytani’, surely, I will sit in wait against them (human beings) on Your straight path.”)</strong> meaning, as You have sent me astray. Ibn `Abbas said that <strong>`Aghwaytani’</strong> means, “Misguided me.” Others said, “As You caused my ruin, I will sit in wait for Your servants whom You will create from the offspring of the one you expelled me for.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He went on, <strong>(Your straight path)</strong>, the path of truth and the way of safety. I (Iblis) will misguide them from this path so that they do not worship You Alone, because You sent me astray. Mujahid said that the `straight path’, refers to the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that Saburah bin Abi Al-Fakih said that he heard the Messenger of Allah saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>Shaytan sat in wait for the Son of Adam in all his paths. He sat in the path of Islam, saying, `Would you embrace Islam and abandon your religion and the religion of your forefathers&#8217; However, the Son of Adam disobeyed Shaytan and embraced Islam. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So Shaytan sat in the path of Hijrah (migration in the cause of Allah), saying, `Would you migrate and leave your land and sky&#8217; But the parable of the Muhajir is that of a horse in his stamina So, he disobeyed Shaytan and migrated. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So Shaytan sat in the path of Jihad, against one&#8217;s self and with his wealth, saying, `If you fight, you will be killed, your wife will be married and your wealth divided.&#8217; So he disobeyed him and performed Jihad. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Therefore, whoever among them (Children of Adam) does this and dies, it will be a promise from Allah that He admits him into Paradise. If he is killed, it will be a promise from Allah that He admits him into Paradise. If he drowns, it will be a promise from Allah that He admits him into Paradise. If the animal breaks his neck, it will be a promise from Allah that He admits him into Paradise</strong>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas commented on:</p>
<p><strong>(Then I will come to them from before them)</strong> Raising doubts in them concerning their Hereafter,</p>
<p><strong>(and (from) behind them)</strong>, making them more eager for this life,</p>
<p><strong>(from their right)</strong>, causing them confusion in the religion,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(and from their left)</strong> luring them to commit sins.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is meant to cover all paths of good and evil. Shaytan discourages the people from the path of good and lures them to the path of evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hakam bin Abban said that `Ikrimah narrated from Ibn `Abbas concerning the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then I will come to them from before them and behind them, from their right and from their left,) &#8220;<strong>He did not say that he will come from above them, because the mercy descends from above</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(and You will not find most of them to be thankful.)</strong> &#8220;means, those who single Him out in worship?.&#8221; When Shaytan said this, it was a guess and an assumption on his part. Yet, the truth turned out to be the same, for Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>And indeed Iblis (Shaytan) did prove true his thought about them, and they followed him, all except a group of true believers. And he had no authority over them, except that We might test him who believes in the Hereafter, from him who is in doubt about it. And your Lord is Watchful over everything.</strong>) (34:20-21).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why there is a Hadith that encourages seeking refuge with Allah from the lures of Shaytan from all directions. Imam Ahmad narrated that `Abdullah bin `Umar said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Messenger of Allah used to often recite this supplication in the morning and when the night falls,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn Baaz</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslims help their brothers among the jinn to obey Allaah and His Messenger just as they help their human brothers. Humans may help them in some matters without realizing it. They may help them to obey Allaah and His Messenger by teaching and reminding other humans, for the jinn may attend the lessons of humans in the mosques and elsewhere and benefit from them. Humans may also hear some things from the jinn which benefit them; they may wake them up to pray or draw their attention to things which may benefit them or harm them. All of this happens even though the jinn do not make themselves visible to humans. A jinn may make himself visible to some people when pointing them towards something good or something evil. This may happen, although it is rare. Usually they do not appear to humans, although their voices may be heard on some occasions when they wake a person for prayer or tell him of some things. In conclusion, the believing jinn help the believers even though the believers may not realize it, and they love everything good for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They may attend lessons, and they love to listen to the Quraan and knowledge, as stated above. The believers among the jinn attend the lessons of humans, at some times and in some lands, and they benefit from the lessons of humans. All of this happens and is well known. This has been clearly stated by many of the scholars whom the jinn contacted and asked about some issues; they told them that they had attended their lessons. All of this is well-known, and Allaah is the One Whose help we seek.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A Precious Gem: The Reward of Being Busy in the Service of Allah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the servant of Allah begins the day and the evening, without having any other concern except Allah, the Almighty, He will fulfill all his needs and relieve all his worries. He will empty the servant&#8217;s heart for the sake of His Love, his tongue will constantly remember Him and he will have the strength to perform religious duties for His sake.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if he begins the day and the evening, without having any other concern except the life of this world, Allah, the Almighty will cast worry and grief into his heart. He, the Almighty will leave him to himself, and keep his heart busy with things other than His Love. His tongue will not remember Allah but will only be concerned with the creation. He will use all his strength in things other than the sake of Allah, and he will remain busy in the service of creation. He will work very hard in the service of others. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Just like a bellows that pumps itself up and then squeezes itself to the utmost in the service of others. Therefore, whoever refuses to submit to Allah, to obey and love Him, will be afflicted with the servitude, love and service of creation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Almighty says in the Qur&#8217;an which means,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And whosoever turns away (blinds himself) from the remembrance of the Most Beneficent (Allah) (i.e. this Qur&#8217;an and worship of Allah), We appoint for him Shaitan (Satan devil) to be a Qarin (an intimate companion) to him&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(Az-Zukhruf, 43:36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sufyan bin &#8216;Uyaynah said, &#8220;You will never bring forward any famous proverb but I will bring the likeness of it from the Qur&#8217;an,&#8221; Thereupon someone said to him, &#8220;So where is in the Qur&#8217;an<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> &#8220;Give your fellow brother a date, and if he does not accept it then give him a firebrand.&#8221;</strong></span> He then recited the previous Qur&#8217;anic verse.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah made it obligatory upon all the servants to reject and disbelieve in at-taaghoot, and to believe in Allaah. Ibnul Qayyim (May Allaah have mercy upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“At-taaghoot is anyone whom the servants go beyond the due bounds, whether it is someone worshipped, obeyed or followed.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The taaghoot are many, and their heads are five:</p>
<p>1. Iblees (Satan), may Allaah’s curse be upon him.<br />
2. Whoever is worshipped and is pleased with that.<br />
3. Whoever calls the people to worship them.<br />
4. Whoever claims to possess anything from the knowledge of the affairs of the hidden and unseen.<br />
5. Whoever judges by other than what Allaah sent down.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof is the saying of Allaah, the Most High:<br />
“No one is to be compelled to enter the religion; true guidance has been made clear and distinct from falsehood. So whoever rejects at-taaghoot and truly believes and worships Allaah alone, then has grasped the firmest handhold that will never break.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the meaning of ‘laa ilaha illa Allaah’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is pointing to the fact that it is obligatory to worship Allaah alone and sincerely without any partners, because the first thing that Allaah commanded the servants with was to believe in Allaah and disbelieve in at-taaghoot. Moreover, they are many but their heads are five.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It means their leaders and those who a blindly followed by them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Iblees; he is the outcast and accursed Satan to whom Allaah said: “My curse is upon you till the day of resurrection.” [Saad 38:78]<br />
Iblees was with the angels, in their company and performing their actions. Then when he was commanded to prostrate to Aadam, the foulness, disdain and haughty pride within him was manifested and he refused to prostrate, became haughty and became from the disbelievers. So he was cast out from the Mercy of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Whoever is worshipped and pleased with that; he is the one who is worshipped besides Allaah and is pleased that he is being worshipped besides Allaah; he is one of the heads of the taaghoots and Allaah’s refuge is sought from that and it is the same whether he is worshipped in his lifetime or after his death, if he dies whilst having been pleased with that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Whoever calls people to the worship of himself; it is anyone who calls the people to worship him, even if they do not do so. He’s one of the heads of the taaghoots whether the people responded to his call or not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Whoever claims to possess anything from the knowledge of the affairs of the unseen and hidden; al-ghayb is whatever is hidden and unseen by man and it of two types: That which exists at present and that which lies in the future. What is hidden in the present is a relative matter, something may be known to one person and unknown to another. But the hidden and unseen of the future is something absolute and not know to anyone except Allaah alone, or to a messenger granted such knowledge by Allaah. So whoever claims such knowledge is a disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Whoever judges by other than what Allaah has revealed; judging by that which Allaah, the Most High, sent down is from the tawheed of Lordship (ar-rooboobiyyah) since it is applying the judgement of Allaah, which pertains to His Lordship and His complete sovereignty and authority.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore Allaah, the Most High, calls those who are followed upon other than what Allaah sent down ‘lords’ for their followers. He says:<br />
“They have taken their learned men and their rabbis as lord besides Allaah, and also the Messiah, the son of Mary. But they were not commanded except to worship Allaah alone. None has the right to be worshipped except Him. How free and far removed is Allaah from the partners they associate with Him.” [At-Tawbah 9:31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah calls those who are followed ‘lords’ since they are taken as legislators along with Allaah, the Most High, and He called them those who followed them their worshippers/devotees due to their having submitted to them and obeyed them in contradiction to the judgement of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. ‘Adiyy ibn Haatim said to Allaah’s Messenger (Peace be upon him) that they did not worship them, to which the Prophet replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Indeed they used to prohibit lawful things for them, and make lawful that which is forbidden for them, and they followed them &#8211; so that is their worship of them.” [Ahmad and Tirdmidhi] (Authenticated by Al-Albaanee)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And certainly, the Shayatin do inspire their friends to dispute with you,)</strong> Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Ishaq said that a man said to Ibn `Umar that Al-Mukhtar claimed that he received revelation. So Ibn `Umar said, &#8220;He has said the truth,&#8221; and recited this Ayah, (And certainly, the Shayatin do inspire their friends&#8230;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Zamil said, &#8220;I was sitting next to Ibn `Abbas at a time when Al-Mukhtar bin Abi `Ubayd was performing Hajj. So a man came to Ibn `Abbas and said, `O Ibn `Abbas! Abu Ishaq (Al-Mukhtar) claimed that he received revelation this night.&#8217; Ibn `Abbas said, He has said the truth.&#8217; I was upset and said, `Ibn `Abbas says that Al-Mukhtar has said the truth&#8217; Ibn `Abbas replied, <strong>`There are two types of revelation, one from Allah and one from the devil. Allah&#8217;s revelation came to Muhammad , while the Shaytan&#8217;s revelation comes to his friends.&#8217;</strong> He then recited, (And certainly, the Shayatin do inspire their friends&#8230;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also mentioned `Ikrimah&#8217;s commentary on the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Inspiring one another with adorned speech as a delusion.)</strong> Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(to dispute with you,)</strong> Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn `Abbas commented;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Eat not of that on which Allah&#8217;s Name has not been mentioned&#8230;) until,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;to dispute with you,) <strong>&#8220;The devils inspire their loyal supporters, `Do you eat from what you kill but not from what Allah causes to die&#8221;&#8217;</strong> As-Suddi said; &#8220;Some idolators said to the Muslims, `You claim that you seek Allah&#8217;s pleasure. Yet, you do not eat what Allah causes to die, but you eat what you slaughter&#8217; Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and if you obey them&#8230;), and eat dead animals,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(then you would indeed be polytheists. ) Similar was said by Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak and several others among scholars of the Salaf.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Isti&#8217;adhah : Seeking Refuge with Allah &#8211; Tafseer Ibn Kathir &#8211; Surah Fatihah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Isti`adhah : </strong>&#8220;a uthu billahi minash Shaitaanir Rajeem&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Isti`adhah means, &#8220;I seek refuge with Allah from the cursed Satan so that he is prevented from affecting my religious or worldly affairs, or hindering me from adhering to what I was commanded, or luring me into what I was prohibited from.&#8221; Indeed, only Allah is able to prevent the evil of Satan from touching the son of Adam. This is why Allah allowed us to be lenient and kind with the human devil, so that his soft nature might cause him to refrain from the evil he is indulging in. However, Allah required us to seek refuge with Him from the evil of Satan, because he neither accepts bribes nor does kindness affect him, for he is pure evil. Thus, only He Who created Satan is able to stop his evil. This meaning is reiterated in only three Ayat in the Qur&#8217;an. Allah said in Surat Al-A`raf,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the foolish (i.e. don&#8217;t punish them).) (7:199)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is about dealing with human beings. He then said in the same Surah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And if an evil whisper comes to you from Shaytan, then seek refuge with Allah. Verily, He is Hearing, Knowing (7: 200).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah also said in Surat Al-Mu&#8217;minun,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Repel evil with that which is better. We are Best-Acquainted with the things they utter. And say: &#8220;My Lord! I seek refuge with You from the whisperings (suggestions) of the Shayatin (devils). And I seek refuge with You, My Lord! lest they should come near me.&#8221; (23:96-98).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further, Allah said in Surat As-Sajdah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal. Repel (the evil) with one which is better, then verily he, between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend. But none is granted it (the above quality) except those who are patient ـ and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion (of happiness in the Hereafter, i.e. Paradise and of a high moral character) in this world. And if an evil whisper from Shaytan tries to turn you away (from doing good), then seek refuge in Allah. Verily, He is the Hearing, the Knowing) (41:34-36).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Tafsir of Isti`adhah (seeking Refuge)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and stay away from the foolish (i.e. don&#8217;t punish them). And if an evil whisper comes to you from Shaytan (Satan), then seek refuge with Allah. Verily, He is Hearing, Knowing) (7:199-200),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Repel evil with that which is better. We are Best-Acquainted with things they utter. And say: &#8220;My Lord! I seek refuge with You from the whisperings (suggestions) of the Shayatin (devils). And I seek refuge with You, My Lord! lest they should come near me.&#8221;) (23:96-98) and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Repel (an evil) with one which is better, then verily he with whom there was enmity between you, (will become) as though he was a close friend. But none is granted it except those who are patient ـ and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion (of happiness in the Hereafter, i.e. Paradise and of a high moral character) in this world. And if an evil whisper from Shaytan tries to turn you away (O Muhammad ) (from doing good), then seek refuge in Allah. Verily, He is the Hearing, the Knowing.) (41:34-36) These are the only three Ayat that carry this meaning. Allah commanded that we be lenient human enemy, so that his soft nature might make him an ally and a supporter. He also commanded that we seek refuge from the satanic enemy, because the devil does not relent in his enmity if we treat him with kindness and leniency. The devil only seeks the destruction of the Son of Adam due to the vicious enmity and hatred he has always had towards man&#8217;s father, Adam. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Children of Adam! Let not Shaytan deceive you, as he got your parents ﴿Adam and Hawwa&#8217; (Eve)﴾ out of Paradise) (7:27),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surely, Shaytan is an enemy to you, so take (treat) him as an enemy. He only invites his Hizb (followers) that they may become the dwellers of the blazing Fire) (35:6) and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Will you then take him (Iblis) and his offspring as protectors and helpers rather than Me while they are enemies to you What an evil is the exchange for the Zalimun (polytheists, and wrongdoers, etc)) (18:50).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The devil assured Adam that he wanted to advise him, but he was lying. Hence, how would he treat us after he had vowed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;By Your might, then I will surely, mislead them all. Except Your chosen servants among them (i.e. faithful, obedient, true believers of Islamic Monotheism).&#8221;) (38:82-83)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So when you ﴿want to﴾ recite the Qur&#8217;an, seek refuge with Allah from Shaytan, the outcast (the cursed one). Verily, he has no power over those who believe and put their trust only in their Lord (Allah). His power is only over those who obey and follow him (Satan), and those who join partners with Him.) (16:98-100).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shytaan appears as a sincere adviser to humans</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Source</strong> : Quoted in ibn al-Jauzi, Talbees Iblees, p.39</p>
<blockquote><p>“And he swore unto them (saying): Lo! I am a sincere adviser unto you” (al-Araaf 21).</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Wahb ibn Munabbih has related the following lengthy story from the people of the book.” We present it here to show the way of Shytan in his attempt to mislead mankind. The story warns humans about Shytan”s “sincere advice”. One must oppose the thing that Shytan is calling to. Wahb said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a pious worshipper of the tribe of Israel. He was the most pious person of his time. During his time, there were three brothers who had a sister. She was a virgin. And they had no sister other than her. They were all about to leave the town to go to war. They did not know with whom to leave their sister and who they could trust to look after her. They all agreed to leave her with that pious person. They all trusted him. They went to him and asked if they could leave her with him. She would be in the building next to him until they return from the fighting. He refused their request and sought refuge in Allah from them and their sister. They persisted until he finally acquiesced. He said, “Put her in the house next to my place of worship.” So they put her in that house and they left, leaving her there. She remained living next to that pious person for some time. He would put food for her in front of his building of worship. Then he would lock the door and return to his place of worship. He would then tell her to come out of her house and take the food. Then Shytan approached him softly. He encouraged him to treat her kindly. He told him that it was not good to make the woman come out of her house during the day as someone may come upon her. If he took the food directly to her door that would mean a greater reward for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continued for some time to go to her door and place the food at the front of her door without speaking to her. Then Iblees came again and encouraged him to do good and get more reward. He said, “If you took her the food and placed it in the house for her, you would get a greater reward.” He continued to encourage him. So he started to take the food into her house. He continued like that for some time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Iblees came again and again encouraged him to do good. He said, “If you talk to her for a while she will be put to ease by your conversation as she is in a state of fear and she is all alone.” He then started talking to her from atop his place of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Iblees came again. He said, “If you were to come down and talk to her while she sits at her door and talks to you, that would be even more comforting for her.” He continued to encourage him until he came down and sat at his door and would talk to her. The girl would come out of her building and sit at her door and they would talk for a while.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Iblees came again and encouraged him to get great rewards for treating her well. He said, “If you were to go from the door of your place of worship and sit close to her door, that would be even more comforting for her.” He continued exhorting him until he did so. He continued that act for a while. Then Iblees came again. This time he said, “If you enter her house and talk to her, and not make her show her face in public it would be even better for you.” He continued exhorting him until he entered her house and spent the whole day talking to her. Then when night fell, he returned to his place of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Iblees came to him after that and continued to make her more appealing to him. Until the worshipper got upon her and kissed her. And Iblees continued to make her look nice in his eyes and desire her until he finally had sex with her. She got pregnant and gave birth to a boy. Then Iblees came and told the worshipper, “Do you not realize what the brothers of the girl will do to you when they see she has given birth to your son” You will not be safe if your matter becomes clear. You should go to the boy and kill it and bury it, that way you can conceal your affair and they will not do anything to you for what you did to her.” Then he said to him, “Do you think she will conceal from her brothers what you did to her and your killing of her son. Take her, kill her and bury her with her son.” He continued spurring him on until he killed her and threw her in the ditch with her son. Then he put a large rock over them and leveled it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he returned to his place of worship and worshipped therein. He stayed in that state for as long as Allah willed until the brothers came back from the fighting. They came to him and asked him about their sister. He mourned her loss and started to cry. He said, “She was the best of women and that is her grave.” The brothers came to the grave and cried over their sister and asked Allah to have mercy on her. They stayed at her grave for a few days and then went to their families. When the night overtook them and they went to their beds, Shytan came to them in their sleep in the form of a traveler. He started with the eldest and asked him about their sister. The brother told him what the pious man had stated and how they were shown her grave. Shytan told him that the pious man had lied. He said, “He did not tell you the truth about your sister. He got her pregnant and she had his son and then he killed and buried her out of fear of you. Then he threw them in a ditch he dug behind the door of the house she was staying in, to the right of the entrance. Go and enter the house in which she stayed and on the right of the entrance you will find everything I told you about.” Then he went to the middle brother and did the same. Then he went to the youngest brother and did the same. When they woke, they were all surprised at what they had seen. When they met each other, they all said, “Isaw an amazing thing last night,” and they informed each other of what they had seen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eldest said, “That dream has nothing to it so just ignore it.” The youngest said, “I will not leave it until I go and look at that place.” They all went until they reached the door of the place where there sister stayed. They opened the door and looked for the place that was described to them in their dreams. They found their sister and her son buried in a ditch, as they were told. They asked the worshipper about it and he confirmed what Iblees had told them. They then took him and were about to crucify him. When they had him on the wooden cross, Shytan said to him, “You know that I am your companion who tempted you by the woman until you got her pregnant and you killed her and her son. If you obey me today and deny Allah, who formed and shaped you, I will rescue you from your predicament.” The worshipper then belied Allah. When he belied Allah, Shytan left from being between him and the others and they were able to crucify him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many scholars related this story in their commentary to the following verse,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Or the likeness of Shytan when he tells man to disbelieve, then, when he disbelieves, says to him,  “Lo! I am innocent of you. Lo! I fear Allah, the Lord of the Worlds” ” (Surah al-Hasr 16).</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They mention that this verse refers to this worshipper and to others similar to him. Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">This story, and others similar to it, are from the Israaeeliyaat or stories which have their source in the books or tales of the Jews and Christians. We do not say it is true nor do we say it is false, but it is allowed to narrate them as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “Narrate stories about the Tribe of Israel if there is no harm in that.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Transcription:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Any Muslim with any Iman within them, and with their Aqeedah and their Manhaj try to understand that the TV is a Shaitan. That the TV is behind all evils. TV is behind the destruction of families. The reason behind this talk is to remind the Muslim Brothers and sisters so they can follow the reminder when it comes to them. This is not to make them apply this to their intellect and if they do so, they will say that it doesn&#8217;t apply to them.. I am aware of the TV, Like many people say they have a TV o­nly for the CNN. Some brothers or the sisters they claim that they have the TV o­nly for the News. Some brothers they say have the TV o­nly for the Travel Show. Somebody may say what does that Travel Show have to do with the Muslim, or the Salafee? Look how twisted .. sometimes we may be and how Shaitan puts us to sleep. So we find excuses against ourselves. That brother he may say: &#8220;Yeah, I am watching the Travel Show&#8221;. What does that have to do with your life? From a channel to another, SubhanaAllah they may be watching Bay Watch, Wrestling, Ophrah ….. then what? They are not o­nly the o­nes watching, not adults o­nly, but the kids are also watching.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the command of Allah and His messenger came to you, u must apply it. In Surah Ahzab : 36</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;It is not befitting for any believing men or women that when Allah and His Messenger (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) decreed upon a matter that they will have a choice in regard to the decision and whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) indeed he is in a clear mistaken error.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are a lot of evils he is going to mention about the TV. o­ne of the evils is enough to make TV haram, not the 20. The brother has selected 20 and the 20 are the many many evils of the TV. But his is o­nly a selection. o­ne of the reasons I mention is enough for any o­ne who has Iman who has understood the ayah, and he still has the TV, he will put the TV in the trash. If you look at the arrows o­n the remote, they are faded, because the thumbs have been o­n it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people after reading or hearing these evils may seem, nothing is applicable o­n me. Nothing is applicable o­n you? 20 major destructive things, that destroys the marriages, destroy the education, destroys the Dawah, destroys the religion, destroys men and women, destroys children, destroys that the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) lived upon, destroy the Aqeedah…. None is applicable o­n you??? Who are you? Simply he is saying &#8221; I don&#8217;t care what you are saying, but the TV stays. I cannot do without do without it. Cannot do without Oprah, cannot do without Bold and the Beautiful… cannot do without Bay Watch.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first evil, the first reason why a Muslim, a salafi should get rid of the TV if they are still holding to o­ne : looking at women. It is not permissible for a man to look at another woman, not even her picture. Because Allah has commanded us in Surah Noor : O Muhammad give a command, and say to the believe man to lower their gaze. Do we men lower our gaze.. when the girl behind the register smiles to us.. when she is dressed to kill?? We look to the left, now to the right, there is no o­ne watching me, no beards, no Muslims, no koofis ..I am going to look now, I am going to look.. may be I will engage in conversation because those women are vicious. They want to start something with you. Your Islaamic they want to see how you stand.. &#8220;Are you Muslim? Are you Islaamic?&#8221; It&#8217;s like a challenge to them.. the Muslim man with a beard… they have been pushed by the open enemy to man which is the Shaitan and you have been seeing those women o­n TV all day and night and now it is reality in front of your eyes. What are you going to do about it? We have to lower our gaze When we go to our doctor&#8217;s appointment, when we go to any places, while driving (it may be hard to lower the gaze and driving) but yet we have to lower our gaze. Don&#8217;t look at women that are not permissible and you have no business looking at them. It is not permissible to look at the face of the woman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What about the man who is looking at every single part of the woman. What about those people who go beyond the TV and subscribe channels that they pay more money, so that they can watch naked women.. Aoozu billah. HBO / cable they pay more money to watch more naked women. They spend money that Allah has provided for us to look after and maintain our families and for Allah&#8217;s cause, good causes. What are we doing now? When the Muslims pay for cables they are saying we are the salafi, we are going to make sure you are not going to run out of business. We will keep you o­n business. We are saying: the contract is 10 million, we will make sure we will keep our commitment to pay $40 to $70 per household for what? To see Madonna?? To see disbelievers … to watch stinky Kaafirs and they can stay in the job. They win. A brother has 5 kids, he needs money for the kids. We need to spend o­n our families. Who are we deceiving? For cables and things how harams our hands are tied. Shaitan ties our hands. Put some sadaqa box to support some Dawah, a Masjid, for Islamic schools and causes, that which will benefit our kids ourselves, now we are going to sit o­n our heads. Now all of a sudden we find ourselves tied up. Shaitan is tying up. But to spend in the haram the screw is loose.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise it is not permissible for women, for women to look at men. They show naked men, so it is not permissible. So for those women they have to fear Allah subhanwa tala. Ayah in Soorah Noor :31, applicable o­n us: &#8220;Say to the believing women to lower their gaze&#8221; and he says he doesn&#8217;t want anyone to understand him wrong here… Now the women have the TV o­n and are they going to lower their heads down and they can sneak a look? And when that hunky man is not o­n TV now they can watch? Because men and women they run the TV. There will not be no TV without men and women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3rd Reason why a Muslim, a Salafi should not have a TV in any place in his house is because the TV brings corruption bad manners to the home. Now you are tying to raise your kids upon the Book of Allah &amp; the proper Sunnah of the Messenger (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) and upon the way of the Salaf but then when you leave the kids watching TV, they are not going to learn any of that. None of the above. Rather they will learn how to imitate the Kuffar, the enemies of Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) the enemies of Islam, and it is haram to imitate the Kuffar. Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) narrated and it is recorded in Abu Dawud &#8220;Whoever resembles a people is o­ne of them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do you think your child will come up to you and say: Abi I want to be like Aysha, I want to be like Safia and Hafsa. Ummi I want to be like Fathima, Khadija, no, she wants to be like the Dixi chicks, Bay watch figure. Because You as a parent did not teach her who Fathima was, who Ayesha was., rather you left her to the Satan Box. Kids know how to maneuver, since the remote is easy. Mothers don&#8217;t want to spend time with their girls, with their kids, so she chases them to kids room saying: go to your room, go and watch some TV.. go now, I have some work to do&#8221;. Another reason she chases the kids to the room is so the mother can watch TV downstairs without disturbance from kids. Money that is very important she spends buying a new TV if there isn&#8217;t o­ne for her to watch her favourite programs. Money that should be spent o­n Dawah, programs in Masjids. But she buys another TV so she can watch her own programs. So now how evil are these? Bad manners. You see the husband dealing with his wife, the way he talks to her, the way he is intimate with her is like the Kuffar deal with o­ne another… the way the Kuffar deal with o­ne another. Simply because he wants to imitate. Now he is a psycho. They don&#8217;t pay attention to what he is doing because he is so into that. The TV has now become the part of their life. Marriage life is now a carbon copy of what is happening in Soap operas, in the moveies, show talks tele dramas. These are all lies. Wives talking back. Spouses not satisfied with sexual relations.. Many talk shows survive because they backbite, lots of lies and falsehood…tales, laughing at the faults and misfortunes of others.. while the Salfi is stuck in front of the TV, his nose in the TV laughing, giggling for his backbiting. Half of the Talk shows are backbitings, falsehood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4th reason is why a Muslim should not have a TV in his home because the TV is a waste of time since there is no benefit whatsoever. Prophet said (recorded in Bukhari): There are 2 bounties, 2 favours, 2 blessings of Allah which many, many people are not using them in the right way is health and free time. Is he going to read the Bukhari, teach someone. No, he is going to spend the time in front of the TV.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The TV keeps some of the Muslims, not to pray at the time. Doesn&#8217;t let us pray o­n time. Shaitan is giving you a choice now. At the time of the Maghrib that is when they usually start. Now are you going to pray Maghrib or watch your favourite programs / team? If it the sports channel.. and you are watching a team, is it the team of the Sunnah, is it the team of Tawheed? the way the players are clad.. even males watching males… in shorts above their thighs?? It is a team comprising a bunch of Kaafirs making a fortune because of me and you, you and you. Don&#8217;t you know if people stop watching TV, i.e if we all boycott TV they want have 20 million dollar contracts for those guys. There wont be any fortunes for them because we are paying for them. The TV turns o­ne away from the remembrance of Allah. It is waajib for men to pray in Jamaah with the Muslimeen. If the wife is reminding : Honey it is time to do salah. He will say: Yes, I know. She says: I am serious. It&#8217;s time to for Salah.&#8221; He says : &#8220;I am serious too, don&#8217;t you have to do some laundry to do in the basement??? Don&#8217;t you want to go to the market?&#8221; All of a sudden he wants her to go to the market. He tries to get rid of this wife, he tries to get rid of the o­nly conscious reminder he has in his house, the last chance to get back to his senses and get make his salah in the Masjid. He sometimes gets ugly ya ikhwan .. angry, they beat the wives, scold them, because the wives remind them to stop the TV and go to the Masjid. . Men divorcing their wives because they turn off the TV before the game was over and now he didn&#8217;t see the last part of the match. It could be just a sports game. He feels out of place that he has nothing to contribute (belittle) to the conversation with his friends who talk about a shot, a sixer, a four…. He goes home frustrated and takes it o­n his wife over a TV over a show time. Allah says, &#8220;Woe to those who neglect their prayers.&#8221; This is a reminder to what?? Just get rid of the TV.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Salafi should get rid of his or her TV which is a very important point : Teaching our kids false beliefs. TV corrupts our kids, including our sisters. No o­ne will disagree to the fact, whether salafi or not, these do not have any benefit. If the parents are not doing good in their Aqeedah and the Manhaj at least they hope that their kids become students of knowledge, that the kids can read and memorize the Quran and the kids can understand the Deen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But let me tell you right now if you have a TV at home, you have put that child o­n an bad, evil way, he is going to be a student of knowledge in Islam… he is going to be a student of knowledge in corruption. He will teach other kids how to steal, how to flirt with women, how to slander other, how to belittle and ridicule others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Somebody may say: Hold o­n, hold o­n, hold, my kids are watching o­nly cartoons. They don&#8217;t watch adult stuff. May be yes, but Barney Bear, little Barneys..Tom and Jerry, Goofy, …. Whatever… Cindrella,…(They lived happily ever after). So now they may say kids just watch cartoon. Cartoon is evil. Cartoon is evil. First of all because of pictures. That is the first evil. It is not permissible to draw any pictures and Shiekh Fawzan when he was asked about the cartoon he said that it was not permissible. Picture drawing is not allowed ….pictures are haram. There is an authentic Hadith that the people who will have severe punishment o­n the Day of Judgement are the picture makers. It will be said to them to bring to life what you have drawn. But cartoon are not any pictures. They give more power to resemble the creation of Allah. They are worse… they are moving pictures… they talk.. they talk to our kids and grab their attention…. The kids who watch cartoons are so spaced out…engrossed.. we can&#8217;t talk to them….They are like &#8220;What is it ha, later, later.?&#8221; Sometimes you got to say &#8221; You have to do it now,&#8221;..they will go to the kitchen to take the trash with their eyes glued to the TV. ..they may bump into something, break something, why because they don&#8217;t want to let the opportunity pass. If u tell them to do something…they don&#8217;t hear… if you tell them to do something they do it in such a hurry…. Phew…..like a jet they do……they may spill the trash then if they did a good job with the trash, they walk towards the TV in slow motion……. If you shout more to do something they walk backwards…. Slow….. throwing trash out of the window watching the TV. If you give another yelling they may be going backwards and eyes still glued to the TV and don&#8217;t be amazed if they throw the thrash o­n the porch or out of the window. .landing o­n somebody.. like the neighbour&#8217;s head …. It is a lot worse if it lands o­n the land lord&#8217;s head . You&#8217;ve got to find another spot then to live. Simply because those kids are so into this Shaitan called TV.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And don&#8217;t you watch those kids who watch TV after the program what are they going to be doing?? Especially after wresting?? Is he going to come to the mother and say : Ummi you remember this hadith?? Father, can we now continue with surah An-Aam?? Mother can you teach me about Omar Ibn Al Khattab, Abu Bakr? No, No, No .. like brothers say : Monkey see monkey do. In his mind he is a hero now. In his mind he&#8217;s a man. Now he wants to be that hero that he saw o­n TV. He is now going to be slamming and smashing and breaking things in front of him.. things are going to get broken…trying to wrestle with his brothers and sisters.. kids get hurt. .. Imitate that personality o­n TV Aoozubillah…. the way those men are clad to wrestle…Bulldog&#8217;s names..</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the end we blame it o­n the kids. If he talks bad to the elders, we blame it o­n him. If he does badly in school, we blame it o­n him. If he says something he shouldn&#8217;t say, we blame it o­n him. This is the way of the Kuffar. The Kuffar when it is serious they don&#8217;t take responsibility. Because o­ne of the principles, fundamentals in their Aqeedah is to blame it o­n Jesus. o­ne of the main Aqeedah of the Kuffar is Jesus takes the sin. It&#8217;s like Jesus has nothing to do and he is taking the sins of all the fornicators, …it&#8217;s like saying you can smoke all the cocaine you want, fornicate with all the girls, rape all the women, steal all you want and blame it o­n Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, for the love of Jesus. Why do we have to be like this and blame it o­n the kids?? Don&#8217;t you know that having TV, no o­ne is content with a 19&#8243;, 20&#8243;25&#8243; TV, everyone wants the 54&#8243;, 66&#8243;, I don&#8217;t know I am guessing the sizes …they want to see the bidah and the Kufr from a big angle. They don&#8217;t want to see the innovation so small. They want to really get a good view. They don&#8217;t want to see the Kufr in a small dimension. They want to see it large, large. No body wants to see it in black and white, in colours. They want to see everything in colour. We find in some houses, in their living room, a TV, a huge TV, they spent a lot of money buying it, to which they are answerable o­n the Day of Judgement as to how they spent their money … they have the nerve to put next to the TV, a collection of Books of Hadith, a collection of books of Aqeedah, Sahih Bukhari next to the Shaytan. Why there?? This is an insult to Islamic studies, to Imam Bukhari and an insult to the Quran. (Shelf that holds the TV stand)….This is serious. Rather it is incumbent upon the guardians, the parents, the guardian to educate their kids, to educate o­n Islam, the path of Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) and the Sahabas. And Allah says :Surah Tahrim:6 &#8220;O You who believe! Save yourselves and your families from a fire whose fuel is men and stones…&#8221; If you are the man of the house, be responsible and save yourselves, save your wives, save your children save anyone who lives in your house.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the TV, there is music. NO o­ne can deny this. Even those who claim they have TV for news.. there is music in the news. CNN starts with the music. They start with music. Commercials are based o­n Music. Music is haram. Music is not disliked, it is not okay, you may do it or u may not… it is HARAM in its entirety. Some body may say, that is right, but I listen o­nly to country music,, it talks about dogs and trucks and all that stuff there is no foul language…It is Haram. Music is Music and there is no permissible music. The daleel .. we are the Salafis and everything has to have (proof) : ayah in Surah Luqman : Allah says &#8220;there is among people those who buy …..idle talks, speeches and expressions…&#8221; They spend some fortunes so that they turn people away or themselves turn away from the path of Allah. There is no benefit whatsoever in Music. No benefit whatsoever. (There is no cure in something that Allah has made Haram…no relaxation…not to ease stess…)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are some channels that have been introduced in Saudi, dish… they get all the haram channels… aoozubillah.. This is also applicable to us because we get stuff like these through VCR&#8217;s, DVD&#8217;s, … some of their channels display programs related to the seerah of the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam)….. eg. A well known movie among the Muslims is &#8216;The Message&#8217;… the Message of destruction. That&#8217;s what it is. It is not permissible to watch that movie. You ask the people of knowledge about Anthony Quinn, … He will never reach Hamza even if he becomes Muslim. How far is he from Hamza radiaAllahu anhu. He is dead… Fabricated stories… o­n behalf of the Prophet, the companions…the Muslims who took those movies did not ask the permissibility form the scholars such as Sheikh Rabei, Sheikh Albani .. they don&#8217;t care about that. They want to make some money… that is the bottom line. They don&#8217;t care if it is o­n the sunnah. The movie Omar Mukhtar… in Libya .. The lion of the Desert… It is Lion of the Hellfire… Anthony Quinn… it is Kufr. So it is not permissible. If we watch it, we are commanding falsehood and helping in sin and transgression. Allah says: &#8220;help o­ne another upon good and righteousness.. not upon sin and transgression.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They defame the Sahabas…especially in the Muslim countries. They dress in turbans, horses, swords and all that etc. and give some characteristic to Omar Ibn Al-Khattab, the companion of Rasulullah drinking alcohol, singing, dancing with a Kaffirah.. prostitute. Did they ask the people of knowledge?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The TV is a means of dissemination and spread of innovation. Why because this is the way of the innovators. o­ne of the ways of the innovators is that he doesn&#8217;t turn never, ever turn back to the people of knowledge. These are people who do not check back to the scholars. Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) said …every Bidah is astray and every Bidah… is in the hellfire. Not some Bidah. Why? Whenever a bidah is spread, a sunnah died. Know this for sure. Whenever a bidah is spread it takes the place of the Sunnah… If you spread the Sunnah, it will wipe away the Bidah Insha-Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the TV they bring news, they don&#8217;t care which is right, not correct.. People get hurt, honours… then later they say Oooops we made a mistake.. sorry. Families get destroyed. Incorrect news. They give compensation money…that TV brings news that is not correct.. they mix news that which is right which that which is not right. That&#8217;s how those poor viewers are victims and prey to falsehood. The brothers and sisters then start carrying the false news…. This spreads like wild fire. TV reflects the lives of people.. the way they walk, the way they talk,. in their wife&#8217;s behaviour, in their children&#8217;s behvaiour, dress, behaviour, clothing.. the kid&#8217;s salah…. While we are in the khushoo of our salah… the kids singing Jingle bells, jingle bell. How many time when we are deep in the khushoo of our salah we hear kids shouting those slogans they hear o­n TV.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">False statements : elections, women can do whatever u want…. Freedom….. u r in a free land.. you can do whatever you want. Indirectly those who watch TV are slave to the Shaitan. Freedom is when you are free from shirk, disbelief, free from being a slave to a human being. Indirectly they are slaves, he works hard to make payments o­n the house, the car, the TV, the gym, …he can&#8217;t take a week off without being worried that you want be able to pay bills? If he doesn&#8217;t make his payments the house is gone, the car is gone, the TV is gone. Don&#8217;t be mislead freedom , freedom, free land. They are slaves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12th reason why, you, me and all Salafis should get rid of the TV, is the sin of the o­ne who bought the TV and he leaves it behind after his death. He leaves an inheritance which is a disobedience to Allah for his family. See how evil it is. He dies leaving a TV in a home, he dies leaving an evil. Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) said &#8221; Whoever introduced to this Deen, or left behind a practice of life something evil, he will be punished and also receive the equal amount of punishment for anyone who follows that bad way.&#8221; Your account with Allah is receiving bad things. You go to the Masjid but he kids and wives are watching TV… and your evil account is increasing. .. Kids are watching TV. If the kids are watching TV with friends…. More sins. Wives are watching after you die. See how the TV keeps you away from the remembrance of Allah. Especially those after Isha who stay up late watching TV programs, program after program, movie after movie, then when it is time for Fajr he is tired. He can&#8217;t. He is beat. Why? He was in Jihad? He was wasting his money, may be keeping some family members up and it is very sad that some kaafir neighbours complain against the Muslims that they have the TV too loud. It should be the other way about. Muslims complaint against the kaafir? But it is the kaafir who is complaining that the TV is too loud and the Music is too loud.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is for the woman. They find themselves o­ne o­n o­ne with the TV. She watches o­nly CNN, travel channel (though she hates that), news, cartoon.. .. as soon as the husband goes to work. … she switches to her favourite show…… Wa Laa howla wala….. who are we fooling and deceiving? Except ourselves. She is attracted to a man who is more cuter than her husband, huskier than her husband?? Now she&#8217;s gonna face the husband&#8217;s reality. She wants him to look like that Kaafir?? You know that magic word?? Khula???? Brother Imaam, can I have a Khula??? What did the husband do?? She&#8217;s gonna find all kinds of excuses,,, lies.. See the evil. Likewise with men… when they see the women, faked women…they are not women because they are fake.. if they were women, they would know how to guard their modesty. They are the slaves in the hands of Jews, they are the tool, the product. Women are now a product of the Jews are who making money.. promoting sex through the women. Now the man is looking at those fancy, fake women, the way they talk, walk, the way they look, sit……(don&#8217;t get your imaginations running… ya ikhwan). Even if his wife does not fit that description but is good, and a good salafi.. she loves her man …..she is not &#8220;all that&#8221;. Are you all that?? The man is not &#8220;all that&#8217; but he wants his wife to be all that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That the o­ne who watches is gone in disobedience to Allah. There is nothing in TV but disobedience o­ne after the other. o­ne thing after the other he is disobeying. If he comes home after work, without TV, he will read the Quran, talk to his wife, spend quality time instead of sitting next to each other like idols, like polls. Some women doesn&#8217;t notice the husband sitting next to her .. vice versa. Same for the man. She is trying to get the start a conversation but he is not there. He rather listens to the woman o­n the TV rather than his wife. The proofs are well established that the husband has to spend quality time with his family and wife.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever watches TV he cannot deceive you and try to say he knows and follow Quran and Sunnah. You can&#8217;t have both in your home. o­ne of them has to leave the place for the other. If you have the Quran and the Sunnah, the TV should not be there, If you have the TV know that you have got &#8220;NO&#8221; Qruan and Sunnah. Some have Quran in their hands and the remote in the other. This is an insult to the Quran of Allah. Some say the Tasbeeh with the remote in their hands. Teaching kids and the remote in the other.. When his favourite program comes he says : &#8220;take a break&#8221; he says to the kids… he should take a break from innovation, take a break from sinning and disobeying the law of Allah. That is the BREAk he should take. The law for the book of Allah and the law for the Music they will never gather in the heart of men. You can&#8217;t have both in the same heart. o­ne has to be given up for the other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people will say : kids will go to the neighbours to watch TV or go to the street and learn bad habits .. these are poor excuses which parents give for the well being of their children. If you have time for your kids why do they have to go to neighbours. Why do they have to go the streets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The TV promote fear from those movies. and things. People who don&#8217;t watch TV live in peace, tranquility. 911 episodes…puts fear…horror movies put fear in the hearts. .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The TV teaches people how to steal, professionals in stealing, how to fornicate, how to drink alcohol, how to get a blind date, verily he is blind…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (sallallahu alaihi wa sallam) said (This is Serious) : <strong>Three people Allah wont look at them o­n the Day of Judgement. o­ne who is disrespectful to his parents. The woman who looks like a man, she wants to be the man in her house. She wants to say yes or No. The woman who takes the job of the man. So fear Allah sisters. Third is the youth : the youth who has no jealousy what so ever in regards to his family. </strong> How can he have no jealousy when he allows the TV into his home. He allows his wife to watch the haram and he allows himself to watch the haram.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are some of the evils. We need to start o­n good notes and get rid of the TV.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>May Allaah reward the sister who Transcribed from the Audio </em></p>
