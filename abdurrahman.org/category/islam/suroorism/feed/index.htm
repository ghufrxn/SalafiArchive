										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The definition of the people who adhere and ascribe to this methodology:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Suroorees are a group of people or a sect that ascribe themselves to <strong>Muhammad Suroor Zayn-ul-‘Aabideen</strong>. They have some aspects of the Sunnah and some aspects of Bid’ah (innovation) in them. The most important characteristics that can be noted from them are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <strong>They attack the rulers and speak about them in a manner that results in evil, corruption and danger</strong>. It appears that they declare the leaders to be disbelievers, but this can only be understood by way of their circumstances and actions and cannot be picked up from their words. This is since the path they take is the path of the Khawaarij or close to it, knowing that the religious texts state the obligation of hearing and obeying the rulers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And our rulers in this land (of Saudi Arabia) are Muslims – all praise be to Allaah. They use Allaah’s Legislation for judging in their court systems and they establish the prescribed punishments (hudood). So declaring them to be disbelievers or talking about them in a manner that leads to revolting and rebelling against them is considered a great form of causing corruption. Due to this, we must warn against those who adhere to this methodology or rid ourselves from them, especially since they have attacked the scholars of this land by reviling them, making slanderous remarks against them and accusing them of betraying the Deen. This matter indicates what they are behind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. <strong>They call to Jihaad, but they do not intend by it the Jihaad against the disbelievers.</strong> Rather it seems like they intend by it to change the leaders, knowing that we cannot rid the leaders of their errors. And we do not claim that they are infallible however we say: It is obligatory to obey them and to advise them in a private manner because they are Muslims. And the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) forbade us from rebelling against the leader unless the one rebelling sees clear disbelief upon him by which he will have a proof from Allaah in the matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. <strong>They claim that the scholars in this land do not understand the current affairs</strong>. And they can be refuted by the fact that the Muftees and the judges do not issue a fatwa in a single issue nor do they judge in a single matter except after coming to know its state of affairs, which encompasses it, such as the cause, the conditions for the ruling and its effects. So whoever claims that these scholars and judges do not understand the current affairs then he has wronged himself and spoken what is not permissible for him to say. As for knowing the plans and schemes of the enemies and so on, then this falls under the jurisdiction of each country’s army.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Shaikh Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi’ee<br />
SOURCE: Tuhfat-ul-Mujeeb ‘alaa As’ilat-il-Haadir wal-Ghareeb (pg. 143-147) [Original source is a tape “Questions from England” recorded in Ramadaan 13, 1416H]<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Question:</b> There is a group amongst us (in Britain) called Muntadaa Al-Markaz Al-Islaamee. They are connected with Muhammad Suroor and they sell his books and interact with him. And they have a tazkiyah (approval/recommendation) from Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez Ibn Baaz and Shaikh Ibn ‘Uthaimeen that encourages cooperating with them and being connected to them. So what is your advice to Al-Muntadaa Al-Islaamee and what is your advice to the Salafees who cooperate and work with them in Da’wah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer:</b> My advice to them is that they return to the condition they were upon when they were spreading the Qur’aan and Sunnah in their magazine “Al-Bayaan” and in their magazine “As-Sunnah”. We were extremely pleased with the magazine “As-Sunnah” and likewise with the magazine “Al-Bayaan”. But then the reality became clear – that they were in fact Hizbees (partisans), who called people away from the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I advise them to not clash with the Muslim rulers. This partisanship (<i>hizbiyyah</i>) has caused divisions within the unity of the callers to Allaah from among the Ahlus-Sunnah in Yemen, and in the lands of the Haramayn, Najd and in Sudan and in Egypt, as well as in many of the Muslim countries.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They call people to not have any concern for knowledge. There used to be a group of students that was studying with us, then they attached themselves to these people, and all of sudden they started to have contempt for their brothers (other students) and for us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Studying the Qur’aan and the Sunnah to them is like a seashell (i.e. it is hollow and empty). And performing worship in the masjid to them is also like a seashell. And these are the masaajid, about which the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“If one of you makes wudoo (ablution) and he does it well, then he goes out to the masjid – nothing brings him out except the prayer, he does not take one step except that Allaah raises him one level due to it and one sin gets erased from him. So when he prays, the angels do not stop sending their prayers upon him, as long as he is in prayer, saying: ‘O Allaah, bless him, O Allaah, have mercy on him.’ And none of you ceases to be in prayer while he is waiting for the (next) prayer.” </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I say: If Shaikh Ibn Baaz and Shaikh Ibn ‘Uthaimeen gave <i>tazkiyah</i> (approval) to Al-Muntadaa before the Gulf Crisis, then they are both excused from that, because even we ourselves praised the magazine “Al-Bayaan” a lot, and we called people to cooperate in working with them. And if they gave their <i>tazkiyah</i> after the Gulf Crisis – and I don’t think that is so – then they are both considered to be in error. So I say to the two Shaikhs: These people have split the Muslims here in Yemen and they have turned to attacking and showing enmity to the Ahlus-Sunnah. Rather, their harm has become great – and I do not say that their harm is greater than that of the Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen – for they are only like scraps as compared to the Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen. And they are the ones who transgress against many of the masaajid of Ahlus-Sunnah, amongst which is a masjid in ‘Aden, the masjid of the people in Buraiqah, which Shaikh Ahmad Ibn ‘Uthmaan is the Imaam of…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if these two Shaikhs issued a <i>tazkiyah</i> (religious approval), then they should take it back, just as I took mine back when their affair became clear to me during the Gulf Crisis, and when their enmity became apparent to me in Yemen. And from their heads is ‘Abdul-Majeed Ar-Reemee, Muhammad Al-Baydaanee and ‘Abdullaah Ibn Faysal Al-Ahdal. They have begun mocking and ridiculing their brothers. And if you were to read the Qasaa’id (poetic verses) of ‘Abdul-Majeed you would have found them according to the Sunnah, but now they have diluted and melted away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I advise the mashaayikh to recant form their approvals (<i>tazkiyaat</i>), for Allaah says in His Noble Book: <b>“And do not argue on behalf of those who deceive themselves. Verily, Allaah does not like anyone who is a betrayer, sinner.” </b>[Surah An-Nisaa: 107]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says: <b>“Have you not seen those who claim sanctity for themselves (i.e. given themselves <i>tazkiyahs</i>). Nay, but Allah sanctifies whom He wills. And they will not be dealt with unjustly, even equal to the extent of a <i>fateel</i> (small thread).” </b>[Surah An-Nisaa: 49]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says in His Glorious Book: <b>“So do not purify (give <i>tazkiyah</i> to) yourselves, He knows best who has Taqwaa.” </b>[Surah An-Najm: 13?]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they use this <i>tazkiyah</i> (approval) for the purpose of deceiving the people, so it is not acceptable if it is used for this time, because it has become clear from them that they attack Shaikh Al-Albaanee and that they criticize Shaikh Ibn Baaz, when he issued a fatwa allowing the treaty with the Jews during the Gulf Crisis. And they rejoice at this so that they can chase the people away from the scholars, because no one has remained with them! So they say: “We have no choice for these people, except to attack their scholars, because we (ourselves) are scholars.” And if their Shaikh opposes them he suddenly becomes from the Takfeeri group!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They invited Abu Suhaib, who was Syrian, to teach amongst them. So after he taught amongst them for as long as Allaah willed, they said: “We feel that the fruits of your teaching should be repaid to you, so pick any land and we will give you the proper permits. So he responded: “The lands belong to Allaah and do not belong to you. Cut off the salary you pay me because I don’t want it.” Then the students remained with him and all praise be to Allaah not one student was produced from them. Even though they are troublemakers, still by Allaah’s Grace, they have no effect. So I advise the Salafi brothers to stay far away from these Hizbees (partisans), because they are not looking for anything except to build the membership of their party.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if ‘Aqeel Al-Muqtaree comes to you, or Muhammad Al-Mahdee or other than these two, and the people say: “This is a scholar from the scholars of Yemen”, then do not host him or allow him entry. And do not attend his lectures, because he only goes touring around for the sake of collecting dollars!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And one brother who came from America informed me that they were touring through America, giving lectures, and they would say: <b>“The one who supports an orphan and me are like this!”</b>[1] So a man from the crowd stood up – and he was looking for aid for Bosnia and Herzog – and said: “The one who supports the orphan is the one who feeds him not the one who begs.” So they began to dispute with one another all because of the worldly matters (Duniyaa)!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When worldly aspirations enter into the Da’wah, it’s blessing diminishes, as Allaah says: <b>“Does not the sincere worship belong to Allaah?” </b>[Surah Az-Zumar: 3] And He says: <b>“And they were not commanded except to worship Allaah, making their worship (Religion) sincerely to Him (alone).” </b>[Surah Al-Bayyinah: 5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for their magazine of begging, which we call “Al-Furqah” (causing divisions) Magazine, and which they call “Al-Furqaan” (The Criterion), then I challenge them to bring any of its issues which doesn’t have begging in it. And I challenge Muhammad al-Mahdee to bring forth a student of knowledge that can be studied under. Rather, you find that he has transformed ‘Abdullaah Ibn Ghaalib, Muhammad Al-Baydaanee and many others, for they used to be students of knowledge here (in Yemen), but then he deluded them and misled them!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I forgot to mention Muhammad Al-Hadeeyah who came charging from Sudan to Riyadh, then to Jeddah, then to Qatar and then to Abu Dhabi, then to Dubai, all for the purpose of building a masjid for the Sufis!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I advise you to stay far away from these individuals! And perhaps someone may say: “So then who should we study under?” So my response is: I hold that it is an obligation on our noble brothers in the lands of the Haramayn and Najd to send to their brothers some people (to teach them) who are not Hizbees (partisans). And it is an obligation on us also, to send to our brothers in England some of our students who can be studied under, even if they stay for three or five months.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore I say: It is an obligation to turn our attention to the Qur’aan and the Sunnah. As for the lectures of the innovators, then you will see them stampeding and ramming (like wild beats) in their lectures, but then when they finish, they say: “We have a project for establishing an educational center.” And this educational center is in the district of Daleel.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I advise the brothers – may Allaah preserve them – to request from Shaikh Ibn Baaz – may Allaah preserve him – that he send to them someone that can teach them. And I advise my brothers here (in Yemen), that one of them should go to (them) and stay for three months, then return and someone else go. This does not fall into the realm of advice only; rather I consider it to be an obligation. But I don’t mean that a brother should arrive at England and then they waste his time by traveling around or that he doesn’t find students who want to seek knowledge from him. So they must learn some Arabic, ‘Aqeedah (Creed), Islamic Fiqh and Hadeeth of the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Imaam Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi&#8217;ee<br />
SOURCE: His book Tuhfat-ul-Mujeeb &#8216;alaa As&#8217;ilat-il-Haadir wal-Ghareeb (pg. 179-185)<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Question: </b>What is Suroorism and what are its clear signs. Is it real or just part of one&#8217;s imagination?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer: </b>All praise is due to Allaah, Lord of the worlds and may the peace and blessings of Allaah be on our Prophet, Muhammad, his family and Companions. I bear witness that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah &#8211; alone and with no partner. And I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and messenger. To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Suroorism is an ascription to the brother Muhammad Suroor Zayn-ul-&#8216;Aabideen. He used to be in Kuwait where he came out with some good books in which he clarified the beliefs of the Shee&#8217;ah, as well as other good books. Then he moved to Germany and then to England where he eventually settled. There, he produced the Magazine entitled &#8220;Al-Bayaan&#8221; and we were extremely pleased with it. Then he produced another magazine called &#8220;As-Sunnah&#8221; and likewise we were extremely pleased with it. And we said: &#8220;This is the answer to what we have been waiting for.&#8221; And some of our brothers praised the magazine &#8220;Al-Bayaan&#8221; and even we praised it in the past, saying: &#8220;There cannot be found anything equal to it.&#8221; However the condition of the Hizbees is that in the beginning they call to the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah until the people&#8217;s hearts grow attached to them and their strength increases. Then when they come to know that criticism against them will have no effect on them, they manifest what they are truly upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The magazine &#8220;As-Sunnah&#8221;, of which it is more proper that it be called &#8220;Al-Bid&#8217;ah&#8221; calls people away from the scholars and it accuses them of being inactive, paid by the government and not having an understanding of current affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But all praise be to Allaah, the reality of the Surooris came out in the open during the Gulf Crisis. This was from the Grace of Allaah, &#8216;azza wa jall. I remember reading at that time some words (in their magazine) in which there was an attack against Shaikh Al-Albaanee for having produced a tape called: &#8220;An Encounter with a Suroori.&#8221; Then a few pages later they praised Shaikh Ibn Baaz. So I realized the significance of this praise &#8211; so that it won&#8217;t be said that: &#8220;They attack the scholars!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some days after the fatwa of Shaikh Ibn Baaz concerning the permissibility of making a treaty with the Jews was issued, they launched an attack against Shaikh Ibn Baaz. So it was in fact a well-devised scheme to chase the people away from the scholars! And the magazines &#8220;Al-Bayaan&#8221; and &#8220;As-Sunnah&#8221; gave the understanding that it was more proper to refer to those Salafees who understood the current affairs in Yemen concerning the affair of the Yemeni Crisis.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I say: O you masaakeen [1]&#8230;who is it that is unaware of the condition of the Muslims? Rather, all of the matter lies in fixing this current situation we find ourselves in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what has befallen the Muslims from losses, fear and suffering, then it is due to our sins. Allaah says: <b>&#8220;Allaah puts forth the example of a town (Makkah) that dwelt in security and well-being; it&#8217;s provision coming to it in abundance from every place, but it denied the Blessings of Allaah. So Allaah made them taste the extreme hunger (famine) and fear because of what they used to do.&#8221; </b>[Surah An-Nahl: 112]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if we have come to realize the sickness, then what is the cure? Allaah says: <b>&#8220;Allaah has promised those among you who believe and do good deeds, that He will certainly grant them ascendancy (i.e. Khilaafah) in the land as he granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the ability to practice the Religion, which He has chosen for them. And He will place in exchange of their fear a sense of security (provided), that they worship Me and do not ascribe any partners to Me.&#8221; </b>[Surah An-Noor: 55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is the sins that have brought humiliation upon the Muslims. And it is their dealing with interest, their allowing of fornication in many of the Islamic lands and their preferring and submitting to man-made laws brought by way of the enemies of Islaam, and how much more can we list&#8230;and the going out without Hijaab and indecent exposure, and their mixing of the sexes in the schools and the universities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the cure is in returning to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah, and then by returning to the scholars. Allaah says: <b>&#8220;And when there came to them a matter concerning (public) security or fear, they announced it to the people. But if only they had referred it back to the Messenger or to those encharged with authority amongst them, those who have the ability to derive a proper conclusion from it would have understood it.&#8221;</b>[Surah An-Nisaa: 83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is an obligation on us to return to the scholars: <b>&#8220;These are the parables that We send forth to the people, yet no one (truly) understands them except those with knowledge.&#8221; </b>[Surah Al-&#8216;Ankaboot: 43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But what you see is a person memorizing three or four subjects and then he takes that around to the masaajid, charging and ramming (like a bull). Then his companions nickname him Shaikh-ul-Islaam! So is this knowledge? Rather, knowledge is sitting upon a mat with your needs tucked below you (hearing from a shaikh) &#8211; enduring with patience the hardships of hunger and bareness. Just look at the condition of the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger and what they went through.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the people of knowledge, they are the ones who put each thing in it&#8217;s proper place, as was stated in the previous ayah. And Allaah says: <b>&#8220;Verily, in that is a reminder to those who possess knowledge.&#8221; </b>[Surah Ar-Room: 22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says: <b>&#8220;Is the one who knows that what has been revealed to you from your Lord is the truth then like he who is blind? But it is only the men of understanding that pay heed.&#8221; </b>[Surah Ar-Ra&#8217;ad: 19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The affliction that the Muslims are being tested by is their being ignorant about their Religion. So anyone that memorizes some ayaat and ahaadeeth and then begins to talk about it, especially if he has some eloquence in speech, people say: &#8220;This is a Shaikh.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allaah, the reality of the matter became clear, as it is said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;If you hear the eloquent one speaking, do not give yourself into him<br />
For this unnatural (way of speaking) is something artificial<br />
Be pleased with taking knowledge and understanding, and<br />
His eloquent speech will come to an end without any fight.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says when informing us of the story of Qaaroon: <b>&#8220;So he (Qaaroon) went forth before his people in his arrogance. Those who are desirous of the life of this world said: &#8216;Ah, would that we had the like of what Qaaroon has been given! Verily, he is the owner of a great fortune.&#8217; But those who had been given knowledge said: &#8216;Woe to you! The reward of Allaah is better for those who believe and do righteous deeds, and this none shall attain except those who are patient. So We caused the earth to swallow him and his dwelling place. Then he had no group or party to help him against Allaah, nor was he one of those who could save themselves. And those who had desired to have been in his position the day before, began to say: &#8216;Know you not that it is Allaah who enlarges the provision or restricts it to whomsoever He pleases of His slaves. Had it not been that Allaah was gracious to us, He could have caused the earth to swallow us up (also)!&#8217; Know you not that the disbelievers will never be successful?'&#8221; </b>[Surah Al-Qasas: 79-82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is an obligation on us to return to the people of knowledge and to learn, just as when Jibreel went to the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) to teach the Companions how to ask questions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I will never forget what &#8216;Abdul-Qaadir Ash-Shaybaanee, the small ignoramus, said: &#8220;We will send some of our brothers to Abee &#8216;Abdir-Rahmaan (i.e. Shaikh Muqbil) to get some gulps (of knowledge) in two months, and then we will send them to some of the centers to take over grounds from the Ikhwaan Al-Muslimeen.&#8221; So I said: &#8220;In two months it&#8217;s possible to produce callers to Allaah?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if it is the ignorant ones that are in charge of directing the Da&#8217;wah groups, then I give the tidings of the demise of such Da&#8217;wah groups. So we must gather with the scholars and take knowledge from them, as our scholars in the past did. Salmaan Al-Faarisee sat and sought knowledge with the first scholar he encountered until he died, and then a second and a third until he came upon the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) and followed him. And this is how the companions of Mu&#8217;aadh (raa) were. Before he passed away, they said to him: &#8220;Who shall we go to (for knowledge after you)?&#8221; He said: &#8220;To &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Mas&#8217;ood.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when one of the brothers demands one of the Hizbees to seek knowledge, he says: <b>&#8220;Amongst you are those who want this world and amongst you are those who want the Hereafter.&#8221;</b>[Surah Aali &#8216;Imraan: 152] And then he says: &#8220;Allaah said this ayah with regard to the Companions&#8221; &#8211; meaning, they acknowledge that they have no patience in seeking knowledge and in suffering hunger. They prefer to live close to people in buildings and cars and in the worldly life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then we hear them say: &#8220;You attack the different organizations.&#8221; So who told you that we attack the organizations? Yes, we attack some of the organizations that consist of partisanship, restricted Walaa (loyalty), thievery and misappropriation of money. These are the kinds of groups that we criticize and call the people away from.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a Da&#8217;wah (call) that is based on lies and deceptions, but the reality will become manifest. For the Da&#8217;wah of &#8216;Alee Ibn Al-Fadl manifested itself and the reality of the Da&#8217;wah of the Mu&#8217;tazilah, the Shee&#8217;ah and Sufis manifested themselves. And the ones who will expose and make these realities manifest, by the Permission of Allaah, are Ahlus-Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And all praise be to Allaah, Ahlus-Sunnah are the ones who always examine and rectify the Muslim ummah. The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;There will not cease to be a group from my ummah that is triumphant upon the truth. Those who abandon them will not be able to harm them until Allaah&#8217;s Command (i.e. Promise) comes to pass and they are upon that (condition).&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Shaikh Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee, may Allaah preserve him, in the lands of the Haramayn and Najd, is exposing the Hizbees and clarifying what beliefs they are upon. And likewise Shaikh Abul-Hasan in Ma&#8217;ribi[2] and Shaikh Muhammad Ibn &#8216;Abdil-Wahhaab in Hudaydah and Shaikh Muhammad Al-Imaam in Ma&#8217;bar and Shaikh Qaasim and the brother Muhammad As-Somalee in Jaami&#8217;-ul-Khair in San&#8217;aa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I advise the brothers, because many of them all praise be to Allaah are receptive, to return to the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah and to call to them, and to not waste away their lives in glorifying Shaikh so and so. And if they were to abandon such sheikhs, they would say: &#8220;Beware of him, he is from Jamaa&#8217;at At-Takfeer&#8221; or &#8220;He is a government agent.&#8221; These are words of one who doesn&#8217;t fear Allaah.</p>
