<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>1- Definition of Islam</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Please, illustrate to me the meaning of Islam.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <strong>Islam</strong> means <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>total submission to Allah (Exalted be He) through belief in His Oneness, and showing subservient and servile obedience to Him</strong></span>. This is the meaning of Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabic root word ‘<strong>Aslama</strong>&#8216; means to show submission and surrender to someone and obey his commands. Accordingly, Islam means surrender and submission to Allah&#8217;s Will by means of believing in His Oneness, being devoted to Him, obeying His commandments and abandoning what He has prohibited. Such is Islam, about which Allah (Exalted be He) says: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Truly, the religion with Allah is Islam</strong></span>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Besides, a Muslims are thus called as they show complete submission to Allah and obey Him, abiding by His Commandments and refraining from what He has prohibited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam is also a name for <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>all the Commandments of Allah (Exalted be He) and His Messenger (peace be upon him)</strong></span>, including Salah (Prayer), Sawm (fast), Zakah (obligatory charity), Hajj (pilgrimage), faith and so on. Such categories fall under Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this regard, Allah (Exalted be He) says: (<span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favor upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion</b></span></span>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) also says: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers</strong></span>, )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, a Muslim is a person who submits himself to Allah (Exalted be He) as far as words, practical behavior and belief are concerned. In other words, Islam stands for total submission to and abidance by His Commandments in all aspects of life.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Belief that Allaah created us and gave us provision and did not leave us without purpose.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first matter is that Allaah created us and gave us provision and did not leave us without purpose.<sup>3</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>The first: that Allaah created us</strong>”: meaning, He produced us from non-existence, so before we were created we were nothing, just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">هَلْ أَتَىٰ عَلَى الْإِنسَانِ حِينٌ مِّنَ الدَّهْرِ لَمْ يَكُن شَيْئًا مَّذْكُورًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Has there not come upon man a time-period when he was nothing worthy of mention</strong>.</span> [76:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the One free of all imperfections said:<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قَالَ كَذَٰلِكَ قَالَ رَبُّكَ هُوَ عَلَيَّ هَيِّنٌ وَقَدْ خَلَقْتُكَ مِن قَبْلُ وَلَمْ تَكُ شَيْئًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He said: that is the case, however your Lord has said, “It is easy for Me and I have already created you before, when you were nothing.” </strong></span>[19:9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Man, before he was created was nothing, and the One who brought him into existence and created him is Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَمْ خُلِقُوا مِنْ غَيْرِ شَيْءٍ أَمْ هُمُ الْخَالِقُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Were they brought into existence without any creator, or are they themselves their own creators? </strong></span>[52:35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>and He gave us provision</strong>”: since we need provision, we need food and drink and clothing and habitations and transport and requirements then He the Perfect, He knew our needs, so therefore He made subservient for us whatever is in the heavens and the earth all of it for our welfare in order for us to be able to remain alive, and in order for us to use that to help us upon the purpose for which we were created – which is the worship of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>and He did not leave us without purpose</strong>”: <em>Al-Haml</em> it means something which is neglected and abandoned which no-one cares about. So Allaah created us and gave us provision for a wise purpose, He did not create us in vain, nor without purpose. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَفَحَسِبْتُمْ أَنَّمَا خَلَقْنَاكُمْ عَبَثًا وَأَنَّكُمْ إِلَيْنَا لَا تُرْجَعُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do you think that you were created uselessly and that you will not be returned to us? </strong></span>[23:115]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Perfect said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَيَحْسَبُ الْإِنسَانُ أَن يُتْرَكَ سُدًى</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَلَمْ يَكُ نُطْفَةً مِّن مَّنِيٍّ يُمْنَىٰ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ كَانَ عَلَقَةً فَخَلَقَ فَسَوَّىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Does man think that he will be left without any duties? Was he not previously a drop of semen emitted, then he became a clot, then Allaah created and fashioned him as a human in due proportion? </strong></span>[75:36-38]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا خَلَقْنَا السَّمَاءَ وَالْأَرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا بَاطِلًا ۚ ذَٰلِكَ ظَنُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا ۚ فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا مِنَ النَّارِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We did not create the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them without purpose. That is the assumption of those who disbelieve, so woe to those who disbelieve from the Fire!</strong></span> [38:27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah only created us and created these provisions for us and these faculties for a tremendous wisdom and a tremendous purpose and it is that we should worship Him, He the Perfect and Most High.  And He did not create us like cattle, which were created for the welfare of the servants, then they will die and pass away because they are not duty-bound, they were not commanded and they were not forbidden. Rather He created us for His worship, just as He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَا أُرِيدُ مِنْهُم مِّن رِّزْقٍ وَمَا أُرِيدُ أَن يُطْعِمُونِ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الرَّزَّاقُ ذُو الْقُوَّةِ الْمَتِينُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And I did not create <em>jinn</em> and mankind except to worship Me alone. I do not desire from them any provision and I do not want that they should feed Me. Indeed Allaah, He is the Great Provider, the Possessor of Tremendous Power, the Strong.</strong></span> [51:56-58]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He did not create us just for the life of this world that we should live in it and roam  around freely and make merry and eat and drink and make ourselves at home in it and that there is nothing after it. Rather life is a planting-ground and a market place for the next life so that we should equip ourselves in it with righteous deeds. Then we will die and move on from it, then we will be resurrected, then we will be taken account of, then we will be recompensed in accordance with our deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the purpose behind the creation of the <em>jinn</em> and mankind. And the proof for that is many <em>aayahs </em>which prove <em>al-Ba‘ath</em> (the raising to life after death) and <em>an-Nushoor</em> (the resurrection) and <em>al-Jazaa’</em> (the recompensing) and <em>al-<u>H</u>isaab</em> (the reckoning). And the intellect proves this, because it would not befit the Wisdom of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, that He should create this amazing creation, and that he should subject this creation to the descendents of Aadam, and then just leave them to die and pass away without any result, this would be futile play, so the results of these deeds must certainly appear in the next abode.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefore, there can be from the people those who spend their whole lives in the worship of Allaah and in obedience to Him, and yet he is in poverty and is needy and maybe he is one who is oppressed and hard-pressed and who suffers difficulty and he does not attain anything from the reward of his actions in this world. And vice versa, that from the people there can be a person who is an unbeliever, an evil atheist who roams around as he wishes and makes merry in this life. He enjoys a life of luxury and he is given whatever he desires, and he commits that which Allaah has made forbidden, and he oppresses the people, and he transgresses against them and he devours their wealth and he kills people without any right, and he overcomes and he behaves tyrannically, and then he dies upon that condition, he has not been struck with anything from punishment. Does it befit the Justice of Allaah the Perfect and Most High and His Wisdom that He should leave this obedient person without any reward and that he should leave this unbeliever without any recompense? This does not befit His Justice, the Perfect and Most High, and therefore He has made the next abode to recompense this doer of good for the good which he did, and this doer of evil for the evil which he did. So in it the fruits of deeds will become apparent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this world is the an abode of action, but as for the hereafter then it is an abode of recompense, either paradise or the fire, and he did not leave us without purpose as is thought by the atheists and the <strong><em>Duhriyyoon</em> </strong>(those who think that death is the end of us). He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَالُوا مَا هِيَ إِلَّا حَيَاتُنَا الدُّنْيَا نَمُوتُ وَنَحْيَا وَمَا يُهْلِكُنَا إِلَّا الدَّهْرُ ۚ وَمَا لَهُم بِذَٰلِكَ مِنْ عِلْمٍ ۖ إِنْ هُمْ إِلَّا يَظُنُّونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they say, “There is no life except our life in this world, we die and our children live, and nothing brings an end to us except Time.” And they do not have certain knowledge, rather they just surmise.</span> </strong>[45:24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the saying of the atheists those who do not believe in the return to life and resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah the Mighty and Majestic rebutted them, so He said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَفَنَجْعَلُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ كَالْمُجْرِمِينَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَا لَكُمْ كَيْفَ تَحْكُمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Shall we make the Muslims like the criminals just the same? What is wrong with you how do you judge?</span> </strong>[68:35-36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَمْ حَسِبَ الَّذِينَ اجْتَرَحُوا السَّيِّئَاتِ أَن نَّجْعَلَهُمْ كَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ سَوَاءً مَّحْيَاهُمْ وَمَمَاتُهُمْ ۚ سَاءَ مَا يَحْكُمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do those who commit evil deeds think that We will treat them just the same as those who truly believe and work righteous deeds, the same in their life and after their deaths? What an evil judgement they make. </strong></span>[45:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَمْ نَجْعَلُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ كَالْمُفْسِدِينَ فِي الْأَرْضِ أَمْ نَجْعَلُ الْمُتَّقِينَ كَالْفُجَّارِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Or shall We make those who truly believe and work righteous deeds like those who cause corruption upon the earth, or shall We treat those who are dutiful to Allaah just like the wicked unbelievers? </strong></span>[38:28]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is not possible and this will never be the case.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ibn Taymiyyah rahimahullaah wrote a letter to the then Christian King of Cyprus inviting him to Islam and exposing the lies and corruption being committed by the priests and monks whilst they knew fully well that they were upon falsehood. After mentioning the devoutness of the King, his love for knowledge and good conduct towards the people, Ibn Taymiyyah then invited him to embrace Islam and adopt the correct belief. He did this in a gentle and exemplary manner addressing his intellect, and entrusted him to behave benevolently towards the Muslims in Cyprus, not to strive to change the religion of a single one of them.</p>

<strong> The Test</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The closest thing to man is himself. How many of us really know about ourselves before even thinking about the environment surrounding us? There are many great things in ourselves that we are either heedless regarding their magnificence or that we take for granted. Let us take the following journey back to the days when each one of us was an “embryo” inside the womb of his mother:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Who took care of me with utmost care and graciousness when I was a tiny seed settled on the wall of the uterine with three layers of darkness surrounding me?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who made my mother’s blood bring me food I need until I grew up to a stage in which my body was able to stand the air, the light, and the hands of people who turn me around?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, when the contractions pushed me, and I was “squeezed” out and to the world of tests and trials I came out!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who shielded you inside as a “fertilized egg”? Then who made your residence enlarge as you grew up? Who opened the way for you when you came out naked without belongings or wealth?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There you came so poor and needy. Two “containers” of milk hanging on your mother’s chest came to the rescue! Who commanded the milk to develop and then to stand ready for your lips to come and suck it out? A milk so agreeable to you, neither cold nor hot; neither salty nor bitter. You were so thirsty and so hungry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who turned the hearing of your mother and filled it with mercy, love and attachment? The moment she hears you crying she comes forth led by her mercy and love. She would prefer to see herself in pain not you! You enlighten her life. Who put all of that in her heart?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When your body got stronger and your belly size became bigger, you needed another kind of food. Who put in your mouth the cutting and grinding “tools”? Who held your teeth from growing during the period of your breastfeeding? It was a mercy for your mother when they were held and a mercy for you when they came out! And the stronger you became, the more you got from these “tools” of your mouth! Thereupon you used a new set of “tools”: the molars working on meat, bread and all kinds of solid food. Who provided you with these “instruments” and made them easy for you to utilize.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When we came out we knew nothing. What a burden it would have been if we were born in a state possessing the intelligence of an adult wrapped in diapers? What kind of living it would be? Would we receive the care and kindness you normally get as developing newborns?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our intelligence developed gradually and we were able to slowly but surely familiarize ourselves with our surroundings. Who is the One Who is All-Wise and Most Merciful, the One Who is ever watching over us and providing us with the means we need in due proportions and exact measurements?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then who is the One Who fashioned our heads with hair as a beauty and protection from cold and heat? Who adorned the face of the growing man with the distinctive beauty of the beard and kept the woman’s face soft, radiant and hairless?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many are turning away from the one who created us and increasingly becoming heedless regarding the true objective behind our existence. They are misled by a concept and a “theory”. That is it! A “theory” that practically denies the existence of the true God (Allaah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Darwin [1], presented a &#8220;theory&#8221; that denies the creation of man as well as creation itself. The theory was announced in the second half of the nineteenth century. Although it is an &#8220;assumption,&#8221; there are those who consider it scientific evidence to support their arguments against the reality of creation. The theory claims that the origin of life lies in a single small animal that was &#8220;developed&#8221; on its own from water. The &#8220;environment&#8221;, according to the theory, imposed specific structural changes on this organism producing new features in it. These changes were then inherited in the offspring and further transformed with time to produce more advanced creatures of which man is the highest form. This is the theory of Darwin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many critical aspects of the lives of people are still affected, knowingly or unknowingly, by some basic elements of Darwin&#8217;s theory, mainly the idea of &#8220;development&#8221; and its link to the &#8220;environment.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The objectives of this book are to:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A) Examine the basics of the theory and the evidence supporting them.<br />
B) Provide the essential facts that disprove the validity of the theory&#8217;s assumptions.<br />
C) Discuss the influence of the theory on the life of this world.<br />
D) Relate man to his Creator and hence to the purpose of our creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah (God) to enlighten the hearts of those men and women who will read this book, and to guide them to worship Him alone by submitting their wills to His will. The submission and obedience to Allaah&#8217;s Will and Commands as detailed in the last Revelation to mankind, the Qur&#8217;an, is the meaning of Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who is need of the Mercy of Allaah<br />
<em>Saleh As-Saleh</em></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>From A Small Animal to Man!</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>A Theory With A Broken Chain</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Background and Basics of The Theory:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) The theory depends on what was observed in archeological discoveries at the time of Darwin: old and new geological layers contained different remains from different forms of creation. The &#8220;old&#8221; layers contained &#8220;primitive&#8221; forms of creation while more recent layers contained more &#8220;advanced&#8221; forms. Darwin concluded that the &#8220;more advanced&#8221; creatures originated (evolved) from the &#8220;lower primitive” ones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) The theory also depends upon an idea that was prevailing at the time of Darwin in which it was thought that all animal embryos were similar at their early stages of development. This brought a conclusion that &#8220;the origin of all beings is one&#8221; and that &#8220;evolution&#8221; on earth occurred in the same way it occurred inside the wombs of living beings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) Furthermore, the theory cites &#8220;differences in the roles&#8221; of the appendix in man in comparison to that in monkey. Since it is assumed that it &#8220;does not have a role&#8221; to play in the function of the human body while it can digest plants in monkeys, the theory suggested that the appendix in man is an underdeveloped form that was a left over from monkeys.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(4) The theory assumes the presence of a &#8220;Natural Selection&#8221; process in which there are &#8220;elimination factors&#8221; that can abolish the weak living beings while the strong ones are kept, and that their characteristics are to be inherited in their offspring. With time these characteristics will accumulate in the new beings producing new characteristics. According to Darwin, this represents the &#8220;evolutionary&#8221; process that makes of these new characteristics &#8220;higher&#8221; forms of life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(5) The theory suggests a &#8220;Sexual Selection&#8221; process by which there is a tendency of the male and female to mate with the strong and best members of both sexes. The characteristics of the &#8220;best&#8221; will be &#8220;inherited&#8221; and those associated with weak animals would be &#8220;eliminated&#8221; because of the lack of tendency and/or interest to mate the weak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(6) Whenever a new characteristic is evolved it is inherited in the offspring.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">REALITY VS THEORY</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(1) The Points about Archeology</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The science of archeology is far from being complete and no one can claim that the search has been completed under the earth or sea layers. The door is still open for more discoveries that may contradict the theory. Assuming, however, that the findings of this science are completed, this does not establish that &#8220;higher&#8221; forms of life are developed from &#8220;lower&#8221; ones. This is only evidence for organized existence of these beings (in any form) at times when the environment is suitable for that. On the other hand, the archeological studies at the time of Darwin estimated that man&#8217;s life on earth was 600,000 years whereas new archaeological discoveries give an estimate figure of 10 Million years. This is a reflection of the incompleteness of these studies and that this science is still variable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also important to note that there are many &#8220;missing links&#8221; in the so-called &#8220;evolutionary chain&#8221; of Darwin&#8217;s theory. For example there are no archeological data to link animals of &#8220;single cells&#8221; and those of “multiple cells” nor between invertebrate animals and fish or amphibians. The same is true between amphibians and reptiles and between amphibians and birds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(2) The Point About Embryos</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was a wrong conclusion made by some scientists because of the less sophisticated microscopy present at Darwin&#8217;s time. Today&#8217;s technology demonstrates that there are fine differences between the structure, build up and organization of animal embryos.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(3) The Point About The Appendix</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The presence of this organ in man does not represent a concrete evidence for the development of man from a &#8220;monkey&#8221;. Rather its presence is inherited from the grand-man who depended upon vegetation as a source of food to help him digest it. In addition, there could be other important functions for the appendix that are not discovered yet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(4) The Point About Natural Selectivity</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>(a) Elimination &#8220;Factors&#8221; &amp; Life &#8220;Factors&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Surely there is a law and discipline that work to eliminate the living creatures, weak as well as strong. Allaah ordained death on every living being. The elimination factors are not the only factors that affect life on this planet. There are &#8220;life factors&#8221; as well, and that there is a discipline of mutual dependency and relationship between the living being and its environment. These &#8220;factors&#8221; represent the true means which Allaah has provided: sun, seas, wind, rain, plants, gravity, etc. All of these means are coordinated to provide survival for man, animals and plants. Considering the &#8220;elimination factors&#8221; alone and disregarding the &#8220;life factors&#8221; is confusion on the part of Darwin&#8217;s theory. When scientists try to formulate theories to explain certain matters in the outside world, they take into account all factors of influence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>(b) Natural Selectivity or &#8220;Mother Nature&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Surely those in support of the theory of evolution like to refer to &#8220;Mother Nature&#8221; as the &#8220;source&#8221; that provides and supports the &#8220;natural selectivity.&#8221; &#8220;Mother Nature&#8221;, however, lacks wisdom, power, self-coordination, will, and knowledge. Natural things such as wind, lightning, water, storms, warmth, severe cold, etc. can cause destruction or deformation. How could these conditions explain the beauty of the creation and its fine course of establishment and coordination? How could the minute elements in the egg of a bird &#8220;know&#8221; that the egg must appear in the form of a bird and thus it has to break its own shell to survive? The One Who had created nature provided all the means for its course of existence and activity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now we see that many who arrogantly deny Allaah&#8217;s existence try to divert the attention of the people to worship this &#8220;new&#8221; deity called &#8220;Mother Nature&#8221;! In many conversations some people are reluctant to say &#8220;God&#8221; when they want to refer to &#8220;supernatural&#8221; phenomena. Instead, they say: &#8220;Mother Nature&#8221; did such and such. They like to look &#8220;normal and advanced&#8221; and not &#8220;strange and backward&#8221; in front of others. The idea of &#8220;how people will look at me,&#8221; overshadows that God (Allaah) is more important than people. It is a reflection of psychological defeat in front of secularism, which itself is the major fruit of Darwin’s theory. It is lack of true faith in the true God, Allaah. A believer in Allaah would not fear saying the Name of his Creator, the Most Merciful, and the Most Compassionate. He knows that those around him will one day die, but Allaah is the Everliving. So, who must count first? He knows that Allaah is the Sustainer and Provider and not the “Chairman of the Boards” nor the “Chief Executives,” managers, or any other boss! This is the benefit of worship of Allaah: A liberation from slavery to anything and (or) anyone but Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>(c) &#8220;Mother Nature&#8221; Is Not The &#8220;Creator&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A simple comparison between man and nature illustrates that man can see, hear, know, learn, reason, etc. whereas nature has none of these qualities. How could man then be &#8220;more advanced&#8221; than a &#8220;creator&#8221; known as “Mother Nature?&#8221; This proves the falsehood of the idea of god-Mother Nature. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Say (O Muhammad) [صلى الله عليه وسلم [2] to mankind): How do you worship besides Allaah something which has no power either to harm or benefit you? But it is Allaah, Who is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 5:76).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In many aspects, nature is under man’s service, and its resource is under his disposal, as Allaah had decreed in the Final Revelation to mankind, the Qur&#8217;an:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“See you not (O men) that Allaah has subjected for you whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth, and has perfected His graces upon you (both) apparent [3] and hidden [4]? Yet of mankind is he who disputes about Allaah without knowledge or guidance or a Book giving light.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 31: 20).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With the progress of technology some people became even more arrogant. Not only do they refer to &#8220;Mother Nature&#8221; as the &#8220;founder or creator,&#8221; but aim to control nature itself. It is a strange conclusion! Allaah has made it very clear that there will be this type of people:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“The likeness of (this) worldly life is as the rain which We send down from the sky, so by it arises the intermingled produce of the earth of which men and cattle eat until when the earth is clad with its adornments and is beautified, and its people think that they have all powers of disposal over it. Our Command reaches it by night or by day and We make it like a clean-mown harvest, as if it had not flourished yesterday! Thus do We explain the Signs (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, laws, etc.) in detail for people who reflect.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 10: 24).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>(d) The &#8220;Laws&#8221; of Nature</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some consider that &#8220;Nature&#8221; represents the &#8220;Laws&#8221; that govern the universe. They try to explain how things occur, but do not answer questions like: Who created this universe? Who put the &#8220;Laws&#8221; into effect? This leaves them separated by an artificial barrier into two &#8220;personalities&#8221;: one that best &#8220;fit&#8221; the society (i.e. the outside) and tries to give &#8220;interpretations&#8221; for what occurs in the universe; and one kept within themselves confessing that God (Allaah) is the One commanding these &#8220;supernatural&#8221; phenomena. But under dangerous circumstances, you hear them calling: “Oh my God!” or “God help me!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the old ages, man knew that rain came down from the sky. Today we know a lot about this process, from the evaporation of water up to the formation of raindrops, there is a reflection of real actions. In their references, scientists do not tell us how did these realities become laws. For example: why are these laws coordinated in ways allowing birds to fly in the air, fishes to live in the water, and man to live on the earth? &#8220;Nature&#8217;s&#8221; qualities are not its own. It has been given the attributes we feel and see around us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The true Creating Power has all the Perfect Attributes and All-Perfect Actions. He is Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Say (O Muhammad (peace be upon him)): Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth? Say: &#8220;(It is) Allaah.&#8221; Say: &#8220;Have you then taken (for worship) Auliyâ&#8217; (protectors) other than Him, such as have no power either for benefit or for harm to themselves?&#8221; Say: &#8220;Is the blind equal to the one who sees? Or darkness equal to light? Or do they assign to Allaah partners who created the like of His creation, so that the creation (which they made and His creation) seemed alike to them.&#8221; Say: &#8220;Allâh is the Creator of all things; He is the One, the Irresistible.</span> (Qur’aan 13: 6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The One Who has created (everything), and fashioned it in due order and proportion; Who has measured and granted guidance. </span>(Qur’aan 87: 2-3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“The One who has created the seven heavens one above another, you can see no fault in the creation of the One (Allaah) Whose Mercy encompasses everything. Then look again: “Can you see any rifts?” “Then look again and yet again, your sight will return to you in a state of humiliation and worn out.” </span>(Qur’an 67: 3-4).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Allaah is He Who raised the heavens without any pillars that you see. Then He ascended the ‘Arsh (the Throne in a manner that suits His Majesty). He has subjected the sun and the moon (to continue going round)! Each running (its course) for a term appointed. He regulates all affairs, explaining the Aayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) in detail, that you may believe with certainty in the meeting with your Rabb.</span> (Qur’an 13: 2).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“He has created the heavens without any pillars, that you see, and has set on the earth firm mountains, lest it shake with you. And He has scattered therein animals of all kinds. And We send down water (rain) from the sky, and We cause (plants) of every goodly kind you grow therein.”</span> (Qur’an 31: 10).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And indeed We [5] created the heavens and the earth and all between them in six Days and nothing of fatigue touched us [6].”</span> (Qur’an 50: 38).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>(e) A God Other Than Allaah!?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In an Address to man, Allaah sends clear and vivid verifications as well as challenges for man and for these &#8220;gods&#8221; that some invoke and worship:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Is not He (better than your gods) Who has made the earth as a fixed abode, and has placed rivers in its midst, and has placed firm mountains therein, and has set a barrier between the two seas (of salt and sweet water). Is there any god with Allaah? Nay, but most of them know not.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 27: 61).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Is not He (better than your gods) Who created the heavens and the earth, and sends down for you water (rain) from the sky whereby We cause to grow gardens full of beauty and delight. It is not in your power to cause the growth of their trees. Is there any god with Allaah? Nay, but they are a people who ascribe equals (to Him)!”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 27: 60).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Is not He (better than your gods) Who guides you in the darkness of the land and sea, and Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His Mercy (Rain)? Is there any god with Allaah? High Exalted be Allaah from all that they ascribe as partner (to Him)!”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 27: 63).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Is not He (better than your gods) Who originates creation, then repeats it, and Who gives you sustenance from heaven and earth? Is there any god with Allaah? Say, &#8220;Bring forth your proofs, if you are truthful.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 27: 64).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Say (to the disbelievers): &#8220;Tell me, if Allaah took away your hearing and your sight, and sealed up your hearts, who is there-an &#8220;ilah&#8221; (a god) other than Allaah could restore them to you? Look, how variously We explain the Signs, yet they turn aside.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 6: 46).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many in this world have turned to worship many created things or beings. Divine attributes has been given to Buddha, ‘Eesa (Jesus), Saints, Monks, Musa (Moses), Prophets, Places, Rivers, Cows, Temples, etc., Do these &#8220;gods&#8221; benefit or harm?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And they worship besides Allaah things that hurt them not, nor profit them and they say: &#8220;These are our intercessors with Allaah.&#8221; Say: &#8220;Do you indeed inform Allaah with that which He knows not, in the heavens or on earth? Far is He removed from every imperfection! And far is He above all that which they associate as partners with Him!”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 10: 18).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Where did they find &#8220;Names&#8221; for them?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“You do not worship besides Him but only names which you have forged, you and your fathers, for which Allaah has sent down no authority. The command is for none but Allaah. He has commanded that you worship none but Him, that is the (true) straight religion, but most men know not.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 12: 40).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Where are the things they have created?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“This is the creation of Allaah. So show me that which those (whom you worship) beside Him have created. Nay but the wrong-doers (and those who do not submit to Allaah) are in plain error.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 31: 11).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8216;Tell me or inform me (what) do you think about your (so-called) partner-gods to whom you call upon besides Allaah, show me, what they have created of the earth? Or have they any share in the heavens? Or have We given them a Book, so that they act on clear proof therefrom?&#8217; Nay, the wrong-doers (and those who do not believe in Allaah) promise one another nothing but delusions.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 35: 40).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In fact they are unable to create even a fly:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Verily! Those on whom you call besides Allaah, cannot create (even) a fly, even though they combine together for the purpose. And if the fly snatched away a thing from them, they would have no power to release it from the fly. So weak are (both) the seeker and the sought.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 22: 73).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>They themselves are created, aren&#8217;t they?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Attribute they as partners to Allaah those who created nothing? But they themselves are created.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 7: 191).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>They cannot even help themselves!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“No help can they give them, nor can they help themselves.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 7: 192).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ‘Have you then taken (for worship) protectors other than Him, such as no power either for benef) it or for harm to themselves?’ Say: ‘Is the blind equal with the one who sees? Or darkness equal with light? Or do they assign to Allaah partners who created the like of His creation, so that the creation (which they made and His creation) seemed alike to them.’ Say: Allaah is the Creator of All things. He is the One, the Irresistible.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 13: 16).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>They cannot answer those who invoke upon them!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“So call upon them and let them answer you if you are truthful.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 7: 194).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above proofs are sent down from Allaah to bring people to their senses. This is a Mercy and Kindness from Allaah for mankind. He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Allaah Is the One Who sends down manifest Aayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations etc.) to His slave (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) that He may bring you out from darkness into light. And verily, Allaah is to you Full of Kindness, Most Merciful.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 57: 9).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(6) The Point About &#8220;Sexual Selection&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The survival of the strongest is not evidence for selective developmental evolution. The only thing that can be understood about the mating tendencies is that they will maintain continuity in the same strong kind and an end to the weak kind. Thus:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) The muscles of a strong athlete will not be inherited in his offspring.<br />
(ii) The mind of a high quality scholar will not be transferred to his children by inheritance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The saying that newly acquired characteristics can be inherited is rejected by modern genetic studies as well as known facts. Any quality that is not an intrinsic part of the genome is &#8220;temporal&#8221; and is not transmitted to the offspring by inheritance: Muslims circumcise their babies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their children are not born circumcised!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(7) &#8220;Under-developed Theory&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have not seen (or heard about) certain types of animals coming to existence through the process of developmental transformation. There was no monkey transformed into a man even after hundred years or so!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The nose of a dog is more sensitive in its smelling function than that of man. Is the nose of the dog more &#8220;advanced&#8221; than that of man? Or are the birds (with flying abilities) and frogs (with amphibian abilities) more &#8220;developed&#8221; than man? The eye of the camel and that of the horse or donkey can see during day and night, is it true then that these animals represent more &#8220;advanced&#8221; forms than man?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The male man, like the male elephant, has breast marks while horses and male donkeys do not (except some resemblance to whatever their respective mothers were). So, why does the male man continue to possess this feature while it was not present in some &#8220;lower&#8221; beings?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Scientists have called Darwin&#8217;s study a &#8220;Theory&#8221; and clearly there is always a difference between theory and reality. A theory by definition is falsifiable.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCES</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The idea of &#8220;selection for the strong&#8221; had a tremendous influence on humanity. It made it easy for some strong men and strong nations to think and feel that they are strong and superior because of an &#8220;evolutionary selective process.&#8221; They feel that they are entitled to certain practices of domination according to the idea &#8220;survival is for the best!&#8221; This is well manifested in the colonial expansions, racism, and in many practices by many of the so-called &#8220;democratic nations&#8221; who practice the principle of supremacy: &#8220;Might is Right.&#8221; The idea of &#8220;development&#8221; interprets life as a &#8220;constant struggle between living beings and that the survival is only for the one that best fits the environment around it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In reality this environment is a materialistic one and it dictates the type of development, its size, and its direction in an imposed way leaving no role for the living being. This idea is very well used in our times to support the materialistic life of the modern world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Materialism is imposed in a way as an integral part for &#8220;development.&#8221; In the name of &#8220;development&#8221; today&#8217;s &#8220;secondary&#8221; things for your home are becoming the &#8220;necessary&#8221; items of tomorrow and if you don&#8217;t buy them you are going to &#8220;look different,&#8221; &#8220;rejected&#8221; and a &#8220;drop out&#8221; because you do not &#8220;fit&#8221; the environment around you. Just look around and see the many thousands of things that were &#8220;secondary&#8221; a year ago and became &#8220;essential&#8221; a year later! Open a woman’s dresser today and see the latest &#8220;fashion&#8221; dresses and shoes. Come next month and you find &#8220;new&#8221; ones. She has to &#8220;fit&#8221; into the &#8220;environment&#8221; around her. Men are also influenced with this &#8220;fit the environment&#8221; concept. Who is doing this to the World? Many are those who contribute to this problem. They come from “big businesses”, media sectors, politicians, military establishments, academia, ‘the world of fashions’, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the name of progress, many people are influenced by the materialistic environment and are driven away from Allaah, their Creator. On the other hand, many are discovering the truth regarding the very essence of the purpose of existence. They are finding true, satisfactory and beneficial life in the code of life which their Creator has described in the final revelation to man: the Noble Qur’an. They came to know the beauty and reality of the following verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Say: (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): “Truly, my prayer, my sacrifice, my living, and my dying are for Allaah, the Rabb [the Creator, the Owner, and the One Who Commands and Administers everything] of the ‘Aalameen [all that exists].”</span> (Qur’an 6: 162).</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Why Did The &#8220;Theory” Spread?</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The theory came at a critical moment in the conflict between the church and many of its corrupted doctrines on one hand and the secular sector (especially scientists) in the 19th century Europe, on the other hand. During this conflict many scientists were killed and/or persecuted. This theory was one of the weapons that were raised by the scientists in their fight with the religious authorities in and outside Europe. It was presented as &#8220;The Scientific&#8221; reference of the mind. It was introduced in the education programs of most of the colonized countries as &#8220;Scientific Knowledge&#8221; to support its acceptance. Many colonized Muslim countries were targeted and this caused a great deal of negative influence on many generations, especially with the victory of the secular-scientific thoughts in Europe over the church-made laws. This played a role in the spread of secular thoughts in many parts of the world. For many it helped promote a stand against church oppression, and when it served its purpose it was transformed to serve the purpose of influence and secularism.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most people had no idea about the theory itself and/or the its concept of &#8220;selectivity&#8221; that was used as a “pretext of justification” for colonization, reflecting the prejudice of “being better” than those “weak ones” from the “other” world communities.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>THE QUR&#8217;AN AND THE &#8220;THEORY&#8221;</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allaah, the Most High, tells us about any matter, it comes from the One Who is All-Knowing. Whatever man knows is nothing compared to what Allaah, the Exalted, Knows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Allaah knows and you know not.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 216).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Should He not Know, what He created? And He is the Most Kind and Courteous (to His slaves) All-Aware (of everything).”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 67: 14)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why do people question their origin when they did not witness its creation? This is result of secular reasoning. Without the reality of creation, there is no purpose for man&#8217;s existence:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“I called them not to witness (nor took their help in) the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor (even) their own creation.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 18: 51).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whatever Allaah decrees in relevance to man&#8217;s creation is different from &#8220;theories&#8221;! Allaah, the AllKnowing, tells us that He informed the Angels about the creation of Adam before it happened:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And (remember) when your Rabb said to the angels: Verily, I am going to place (mankind) generations after generations on earth.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 30).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, Most High, told us about the kind of material from which Adam was created: dust and water, and the offspring of Adam from sperm:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“O mankind! If you are in doubt about the Resurrection, then verily! We have created you from dust (i.e. Adam) then from a Nutfah (mixed drops of male and female sexual discharges i.e. offspring of Adam) then from a clot (a piece of thick coagulated blood) then from a little lump of flesh, some formed and some unformed (miscarriage) that We may make (it) clear for you (to show our Power and Ability to do what We will). And We cause whom We will to remain in the wombs for an appointed term, then we bring you out as infants [7], then (give you growth) that you may reach your age of full strength. And among you there is he who dies (young), and among you there is he who is brought back to the miserable old age, so that he knows nothing after having known.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 22: 5).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“He is the One Who has created you from clay and then decreed a stated term (for you to die).”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 6: 2).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah shaped Adam by His own Hands [8]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Allaah said:&#8221;O! Iblees (Devil) what prevents you from prostrating yourself to one whom I have created with both My Hands.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 38: 75).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (Muhammad-صلى الله عليه وسلم) also informed us that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“When Allaah created Adam from a Handful from all of the earth (material), the children of Adam came just like the earth: amongst them the red, the white and the black and those who are in between; the easy and the sad; the evil ones and the good ones.&#8221;</span> [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah then changed this clay into “sounding clay:”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“He created man (Adam) from a sounding clay like the clay of pottery.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 55: 14).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Exalted and Magnificent, breathed into this clay a created and honored soul and life came into Adam and he became Adam that can hear, see, talk and think:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“So, when I have fashioned him (in due proportion) and breathed into him his soul created by Me, then you (angels) fall down prostrating to him.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 15: 29).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Right after Adam&#8217;s creation he started to speak:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And He taught Adam the names (of everything); then He showed them to the angels and said &#8216;Tell Me the names of these if you are truthful.&#8217; They (angels) said: &#8216;Far is You (Allaah) removed from every imperfection, we have no knowledge except what you have taught us. Verily, it is You, the AllKnower, the All-Wise. He said: O Adam! Inform them of their names&#8230;”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 31-32).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even the first woman was created from the first man, Adam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“O mankind! Be dutiful to your Rabb, Who created you from a single soul (Adam) and from him (Adam) He created his wife, and from them both He created many men and women..”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 4: 1).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the creation of Adam, Allaah commanded angels to prostrate to Adam; all of them obeyed. This is a great Honor to Adam. Iblees (the Devil) refused out of arrogance:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And (remember) when We said to the angels: &#8220;Prostrate to Adam.&#8221; So they prostrated except Iblees (the Devil). He was of the Jinns10; he disobeyed the Command of His Rabb.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 18: 50).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah expelled him from His Mercy, and warned Adam against him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Will you then take him (Iblees) and his offspring as protectors and helpers rather than Me while they are enemies to you? What an evil is the exchange for the wrong-doers (and polytheists).”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 18: 50).</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>THE TEST</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Both Adam and his wife were tested in Paradise. They were allowed to eat from all the fruits of Paradise. They were ordered, however, to stay away from a particular tree:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And We said: O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the Paradise and eat both of you freely with pleasure and delight of things therein as wherever you will, but come not near this tree or you both will be of the wrong-doers.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 35).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They disobeyed Allaah by eating from it and Allaah sent them down to earth to live with their posterity, that He may test their obedience and submission to Him. Certainly they repented and Allaah, Oftforgiving, accepted their repentance. The status of the children of Adam is above that of monkeys or lizards:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And indeed We have honored the children of Adam, and We have carried them on land and sea and have provided them with At-Tayyibat (lawful good things), and have preferred them above many of those whom We have created with a marked preference.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 17: 70).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the true origin of man: an honored being above that of a cockroach or a mouse! The response of man must be that of thanks to his Creator, Allaah, manifesting itself in true submission and obedience to Him. This is the meaning of Islam. It is the religion of man since Adam, peace be upon him and it is the same religion of Noah, Ibraaheem (Abraham), Musa (Moses), ‘Eesa (Jesus) peace be upon them all. It is manifested in its final, completed, and preserved form in the Qur&#8217;an that was revealed to Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم. It calls man to dissociate himself from any form of worship to other than his Creator, Allaah<a href="http://AbdurRahman.org/">.</a></p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]Charles Robert Darwin (1809-1882).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] The Arabic inscript صلى الله عليه وسلم is an invocation recited after the name of the Prophet Muhammad is stated. It reads: Sallaa Allaahu ‘Aleihi Wasallam, which means: May Allaah Praise his mention and safeguard him from every imperfection and from all kinds of evil.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] i.e. Islamic Monotheism, the lawful pleasures of this world, including health, good looks, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] i.e. One&#8217;s faith in Allaah, knowledge, wisdom, guidance for doing righteous deeds, and also the pleasures and delights of the Hereafter in Paradise, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]The “We” refers to Allaah Himself. It is common with Semitic languages for any monarch to use the “We” and “Us” when referring to himself. And to Allaah belongs the best example. He Glorifies Himself as suits His Majesty. When Allaah says: “We” or “Us,” no one who is familiar with the Arabic lexicology understands that this refers to “more than one God united in one!” Allaah is One and Unique and all of His Attributes describe His Essence, not qualities of separate “gods”! He is the Most Merciful, the Provider, the Creator, the Oft-Forgiving, the Originator, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] The authenticity of the contents of any book, which describes Allaah with imperfect Attributes, is questionable. Allaah acts, originates, creates, and does what He wants such that neither tiredness nor slumber or sleep overtakes Him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Neither slumber, nor sleep overtakes Him. (Qur’an 2:255)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] Prophet Muhammad, may Allaah exalt his mention and render him safe from every imperfection, said: &#8220;(As regards your creation), every one of you is collected in the womb of his mother for the first forty days, and then he becomes a clot for another forty days, and then a piece of flesh for another forty days. Then Allaah sends an angel to write four words: He writes his deeds, time of his death, means of his livelihood, and whether he will be wretched or blessed (in the Hereafter). Then the soul is breathed into his body&#8230;&#8221;(Collected in Saheeh Al-Bukhari which contains the most authentic traditions of the Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم (vol. 4, hadeeth # 549). The texts are published by Dar-Arabia (Beirut, Lebanon) in English and Arabic. This narration came from Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم who was un-lettered. These early stages of growth of the human body were known only approx.1400 years after the Prophet&#8217;s explanation. These statements, together with other prophecies by the Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم is a testimony that a) he was a true messenger of Allaah and b) the Qur&#8217;an he was trusted with is a true Revelation from Allaah. Those searching for the truth can find in the Qur&#8217;an their objective if they are sincere in their strive.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] All of the Attributes of Allaah are real and true. He informed us about Himself and about His Attributes. He speaks only the truth. In all of His Attributes He is perfect and distinct from His creation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And nothing is like unto Him. He is the All-Hearer AllSeer.” ( Qur&#8217;an 42: 11).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] Related by the scholars of Hadeeth: Al-Tirmithee and Abu Dawood and Al-Hakim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] Jinns are beings created with free will, living on earth in a world parallel to that of man, and are invisible to human eyes in their normal state. The term &#8220;Jinnee&#8221; (English: Genie) is equivalent to Jinn, and Jaann may be used as its plural or as another singular form. In Islamic literature, Shaytaan (English: Satan, Devil) is a name given to disbelieving Jinns. Amongst them are the believers and non-believers.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">بسم االله الرحمن الرحيم</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. I begin to write</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THE innate nature (<em>Fitrah</em>)</strong> in man recognizes what is good and bad, what is true and false. It recognises that the attributes of God (Allah) must be true, unique, and all-perfect. It does not feel comfortable towards any kind of degradation of His Attributes, nor does it relax towards attributing human-like qualities to the Creator. Many who became &#8220;<em>discontent with God</em>&#8221; did so because of the practices of the Church in medieval Europe and because of claims such as &#8220;<em>God dwells in a son</em>&#8221; and that &#8220;<em>everyone is born with an original sin</em>&#8220;. They “<em>escaped</em>&#8221; into worshipping a new thing called &#8220;<em>mother nature</em>.” With the advancement of materialistic technology others from different &#8220;religions&#8221; adopted the concept of &#8220;<em>forget God</em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em>let us live this life and enjoy it</em>.&#8221; They revived the old “god&#8221; of Rome, the &#8220;<em>god of desire</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Today</strong> we can see that all of this materialistic progress produced a spiritual vacuum that led to complex social, economical, political, and psychological problems. Many of those who &#8216;<em>fled</em>&#8221; their religions  are in search again. Some try to &#8220;<em>escape</em>&#8221; the complexity of their daily lives through various means. Those who examined the Qur&#8217;an and Islam found a complete code for life that requires man to fulfil the purpose of his existence on earth. Allah does not want man to be enslaved to any false deity: nature, drugs, lust, money, other men or women, desire, or sex. This holds true for Muslims and non-Muslims as well. He gives the proofs that He Alone is the One Who can deliver man to free himself from the slavery to any form of creation and to turn to his Creator Alone. He is the <strong>First</strong>, nothing before Him. He is the <strong>Last</strong>, everything ends except Him. He is <strong>Most High</strong>, nothing above Him. He is <strong>Most Near</strong>, nothing is beyond His reach. <strong>He does not beget</strong>, <strong>nor is He begotten</strong>. He is the Lord of Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad, the Praise and Mercy of Allah be upon them all.  To Him Alone man must submit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Mankind</strong> must know about the purpose of their existence on earth; their responsibility towards their Creator and what they must do in preparation for the Day on which they will return to Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Saleh As-Saleh</em></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE PURPOSE AND THE RETURN</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>ALLAH</strong> created man and man belongs to Him. He (سبحانه و تعالى) ordained that one day man shall die and return to Him. This world is a transitional period. Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) wanted man to shape his life according to what He (سبحانه و تعالى) had decreed. This is the meaning of worship. Worship requires absolute obedience, humility and love for Allah, Who promised an Eternal life in Paradise for those who obey and worship Him alone, and an Eternal abode in Hell for those who reject Him and His orders:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“So those who believed (in the Oneness of Allah) and did righteous deeds will be in Gardens of Delight (al-Jannah, Paradise).”</strong></span> (Qur’an 22: 56)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“But those who disbelieve and belie Our Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, signs, revelations, etc.) such are the dwellers of the Fire, they shall abide therein forever.”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 39)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Man&#8217;s life at home, as a farmer, a car-dealer, an electrician, a computer consultant, a president, a company’s C.E., a spouse, etc., has to abide by a way of life according to the guidelines Revealed by Allah. He is the one who defined what is good and what is bad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He stated that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Whoever works righteousness, whether male or female, while he (or she) is a true believer (in the Oneness &amp; Uniqueness of Allah), verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e., AlJannah).”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 16: 97)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Revelation contains all the details about what is good and bad. It is not left for the limited nature of man to define what is good and what is bad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And We have sent down to you the Book (the Qur&#8217;an) as an exposition of every thing and a guidance, Mercy, and glad tidings for those who have surrendered (to Allah as Muslims).”</strong></span> (Qur’an 16: 89)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The command is for none but Allah. He has commanded that you worship none but Him (i.e. Pure Monotheism), that is the (true) straight religion, but most men know not.”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 12: 40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah made it clear that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Whosoever does righteous good deed it is for (the benefit of) his own self, and whosoever does evil, it is against his own self, and Your Rabb (Lord) is not at all unjust to (His) slaves.”</strong> </span>(Qur&#8217;an 41: 46)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Greatest good is achieved when the believer fulfils the role prescribed for him by his Creator, Allah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“And I (Allah) created not the Jinns and men except they should worship Me (Alone).”</span></strong> (Qur’an 51:56)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Message of Islam fits the Fitrah in man. Allah created man in the best form. He (سبحانه و تعالى) gave this Fitrah the ability to believe in the Unseen. The animal lives within the framework of his senses while man can relate to a broader scheme amongst which is the ability to believe in the Unseen. Thus man&#8217;s soul and its horizon are broader and more open than that of animals. Man knows that the electric current is composed of small particles known as electrons. While we are unable to see these particles, their effects could be seen on an instrument known as the oscilloscope in the form of electron waves. In Nature and in ourselves we can see the Signs of Allah everywhere and we must relate, therefore, to the Creator in the perfect way He has chosen. This is His right upon us: to worship Him Alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) asked his companion Mu‘adh ibn Jabal:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O Mu’adh! Do you know what is due to Allah from His lbaad (the created beings) and what is due them? I responded: &#8220;Allah and His messenger know best.” He continued: &#8220;What is due to Allah from His Ibaad is to worship Him alone and never associate any other being with Him. What is due to them is not to punish any person who does not associate anyone (or anything) with Him.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Man, through the faculties that Allah has bestowed upon him, can relate to the unseen atom with its unseen electronic &#8220;shells&#8221; that build up its characteristics. Man can also relate through his Fitrah to his Creator. The Fitrah recognizes the Attributes of the true God and His Signs in the creation although it is unable to see Allah in this life. One can then easily understand that the greatest reward Allah had given to the believers is the actual seeing of Himself on the Day of Judgement. Knowing Allah in His Names and His Attributes drives man to fulfil the purpose for his presence on earth as stated in the above verse and in Allah&#8217;s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The command is for none but Allah. He has commanded that you worship none but Him (i.e. Pure Monotheism), that is the (true) straight religion, but most men know not.”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 12: 40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Attributes and His Signs in His Creation testify for His Oneness and that He is the Only True God who deserves to be worshipped. The rejecting man underestimates His Lord. He may reject any worship to Allah or turn to worship other than Allah. Amongst the rejectionists, there are those who think that this Universe has founded itself or it came to exist by co-incidence. This necessitates that man &#8220;has no goal to fulfil,&#8221; because he came into being without a defined goal! Consequently, a moral or a value system becomes meaningless. Accordingly, man is just a responding &#8220;tool&#8221; for &#8220;mother nature&#8221; which, according to Darwin himself, &#8220;acts haphazardly&#8221;! This way of thinking is aimlessness, and it occurs when man does not recognize his relation with the One who has created life and death, the Universe and everything around man, all in due proportion:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things.”</strong></span> (Qur’an 65: 3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who reject man’s need to His Creator, Allah, are the aimless ones. Allah refers to them in the Qur&#8217;an:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“They have hearts (minds) wherewith they understand not, they have eyes wherewith they see not, and they have ears wherewith they hear not (the Truth). They, are like cattle, nay even more astray; those! They are the heedless ones.”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 7: 179)</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">CREATION IS IN NEED OF ALLAH</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Man always looks for what benefits him and what protects him from harm. However, to accomplish this, man must be able to realize what is harmful. He must then know whom he should need, trust, and love so that he can attain what is beneficial as well as feel good about his choice. He also must know the proper and good approach that would make him achieve this goal. This latter condition requires that man:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a) Know about harm<br />
b) What ways can be used to drive harm away</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Certainly, man can have no better guidance than that which comes from the One Who has perfected everything, and the One who Has No deficiency in Himself nor in His Attributes. The One Who is Ever-Living and who does not die. There can be no One better than the One Who Has no need for anything; the One Who is Rich; the Giver, the One Who, after all, controls man&#8217;s soul, and runs all affairs. Man is so poor to Him. He is Allah, the True and only God. Man can bring harm to himself if he seeks other than Allah for help. Allah is the One Who can help man drive away any harm for it cannot occur without His Will and His Power.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) sent down His Books and chose His Messengers to guide man to:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a) Know His Lord as He (سبحانه و تعالى) has explained about Himself, and<br />
b) Seek Him Alone while living in accordance with His plan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowing Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes liberates man from worshipping any form of creation because creation is weak and imperfect and is in need of the Creator, Allah. The knowledge about Allah leads man to know that he is created to live according to Allah&#8217;s way as revealed to the last Messenger, Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم). This Revelation contains a complete code of life. Everything that is beneficial or harmful is established so that man can focus his life around this Revelation. If man commits wrong and knows that Allah is Oft-Forgiving he would turn to Him and to Him Alone seeking His forgiveness:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Know, therefore, that there is no God who deserves to be worshipped except Allah; and ask forgiveness for your sins.”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 47:19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is wrong to think or believe that Allah created other “gods” besides Him so that man turns to them for help, loves them or fear them, etc. He is the same God of all nations. He does not order that people should make of stars, sun, fire, Jesus, Moses, etc. gods besides Him. He (Most Exalted) cannot be &#8220;contradictory.&#8221; He has one way (religion) that calls man to surrender his will only to Him. He (سبحانه و تعالى) warned that if man, even Muhammad-صلى الله عليه وسلم and any Prophet or Messenger, would take partners with Him, then his work will fail and he will be among the losers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And verily, it had been revealed to you (O Muhammad) as has been revealed to those before you: If you join others in worship with Allah (then) surely (all) your deeds will be in vain and you certainly be among the losers. Nay! But worship Allah and be among the grateful.”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 39: 65-66)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let us think what Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم), the man-Prophet, who knew Allah best, used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O Allah, I seek refuge in You for Your Pleasure and against Your Wrath, and in Your Forgiveness and against Your Punishment and in You from You, I cannot Praise You as You can Praise Yourself.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;I have surrendered myself to You, I have directed my face to You, I have entrusted my affairs to You, I have compelled my back to refuge in You, in want and in fright of You, there is no resort nor survival from You except (in turning) to You, I have faith in your Book (i.e., the Qur&#8217;an) which You brought down and in the Prophet (Muhammad) you have sent.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When we read in the Qur&#8217;an that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Whatever of Mercy (i.e., of good), Allah may grant to mankind, none can withhold it, and whatever He may withhold, none can grant it thereafter. And He is the All Mighty, the All-Wise”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 35:2),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and when we read:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;If Allah touches you with hurt, there is none who can remove it but He; and if He intends any good for you, there is none who can repel His favour which He causes it to reach whomsoever of His slaves He will, and He is the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221;</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 10: 107),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">we should be motivated to return to Him Alone at times of ease and at times of hardship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when we read that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“If Allah helps you none can overcome you, and if He forsakes you, who is there, after Him, that can help you? And in Allah (alone) let believers put their trust”</strong> </span>(Qur’an 3:160)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur&#8217;an, therefore, leads man to a true liberation from any false attachment. It brings peace to the heart. It helps the believer against hypocrisy and all forms of dishonesty. Imagine, for example, a believer facing a problem at work. He sees wrong and faces unlawful practices. He does not fear rejecting what is wrong. He knows that the job is only a mean to gain his sustenance. While he may be unable to correct what is wrong, he knows well that Allah is the One Who provides. If he leaves his job for the sake of Allah, Allah will give him a better one:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him. He will make a way for him to get out (from) every (difficulty), and He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine.”</strong></span> (Qur’an 65: 2-3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above necessitates that man must depend upon Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) asking Him Alone for assistance. It also requires that man must love Allah and worship Him alone to gain His pleasure and His help. Is it not true that the people who consider this life as the &#8220;Final Goal&#8221; end up worshipping many things in it? You see them so careful about &#8220;having it all.&#8221; They torture themselves: pain; difficulty; constant worry; keeping their hands in the banks for loan after loan to keep up with the &#8220;demands&#8221; of development.&#8221; They are under the constant threat of fore-closure. They constantly see poverty in front of their eyes. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) says: Son of Adam: fill your time with My worship and I will fill your heart with richness, and end off your poverty. But if you do not, I would make your hands fully busy (i.e., in worldly affairs) and I would not end off your poverty.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our purpose of existence on earth is more meaningful than being slaves to worldly gains. There can be no meaningful life better than that prescribed by our Creator Allah. Every act done according to Allah&#8217;s way is an act of worship. Man is the beneficiary and Allah is in no need:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“O mankind! It is you who stand in need of Allah, but Allah is Rich (Free of all wants and needs), Worthy of All Praise.”</strong></span> (Qur’an 35: 15)</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE MODERN CIVILIZATION</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“We can pray to God yet live life as we like”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people think that: to live an Islamic life is &#8216;restrictive&#8217;! Islam, however, is the medium code of life. It recognizes that within the Fitrah there are motivations that influence man&#8217;s role on earth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• a drive to eat,<br />
• a drive to drink,<br />
• a drive to have a home,<br />
• a drive for sex,<br />
• a drive for ownership,<br />
• a drive for success, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Without control, all of these legitimate motives could be very dangerous. What constitutes a perfect control is the discipline that gives an organised manifestation for these motivations without totally abolishing them or becoming enslaved to them. Islam deals with this Fitrah by providing a Divine Discipline that elevates man above animals. Man lacks perfect knowledge as well as perfect wisdom. Therefore, he is unable to provide a perfect way of life. Allah, Most Perfect in His Wisdom and Knowledge perfected a course of life and set limitations and rules all of which are beneficial to man:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“These are the limits (set) by Allah, so approach them not.”</strong> </span>(Qur’an 2: 187)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“These are the limits set by Allah, so do not transgress them.”</strong></span> (Qur’an 2: 229)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why Islam does not condone celibacy because it is against the Fitrah. The fo llowing incident describes the Islamic stand towards life:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that some of the companions of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) asked his (the Prophet&#8217;s) wives about the acts that he performed in private. Someone among them (among the companions) said: I will- not marry women; someone among them said&#8230; 1 will not eat meat (and fast all day); and someone among them said: 1 will not lie down in bed (and stand in prayer all night). He (the Prophet-صلى الله عليه وسلم) praised Allah and glorified him and said: What has happened to these people that they say so and so, whereas I observe prayer and sleep too; I observe fast and suspend observing them; I marry women also? And he who turns from my Sunnah (way), he has no relation with me.]&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam does not condone the surrender to lust as it is the case in this contemporary &#8220;civilization&#8221;! Islam recognises the natural inclination of man towards the love of women, children, gold, silver, possessions, etc. Such inclination is essential to drive man towards settlement and civilization:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;It Is He who had brought you forth from the earth and settled you therein.&#8221;</strong></span> (Qur’an 11: 61)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Beautified for men is the love of things they covet: women, children, much of gold and silver (wealth), branded beautiful horses, cattle and well-tilled land. This is the pleasure of the present world&#8217;s life; but Allah has the excellent Return (Paradise with flowing rivers. etc.)”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 3: 14)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These inclinations are not the objective! They are to be taken in a balanced way. The way to deal with them is real, and Allah gives a detailed description of the balanced approach that gives man a perfectly balanced pleasure in this life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The use of the word &#8220;restrictive&#8221; comes from those who think that they live a &#8220;free&#8221; life. They accept many man-made restrictive rules that affect every aspect of our lives, although these rules are not perfect because man is imperfect. Man accepts these rules thinking that they benefit him. If the reward is high and the Benefit is eternal, should not man accept what is high and leave what is low? There is no sense in accepting what is lower!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Would you exchange that which is better for that which is lower?”</strong> </span>(Qur’an 2: 61)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Seeking the perishable goods of the worldly life. There are much more profits and booties with Allah.”</strong></span> (Qur’an 4: 94)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“You desire the good of this world, but Allah desires (for you) the Hereafter. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.”</strong> </span>(Qur’an 8: 67)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This worldly life has good things in it. They are, however, perishable. Allah, The AllWise, organised the way to achieve what is good without transgressing and/or oppressing others. Capitalism allows ownership without limits. This produces political, social, and economical injustice, as is evident in Capitalist countries. On the other hand the failed communism suppressed the inclination of man towards private ownership.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam responds in a perfectly balanced way when it deals with the human soul. As stated in the above verse (Qur&#8217;an 3:14), it is normal for man to love money, gold and silver, women, etc. The challenge, however, is to take a medium and just course in dealing with this love.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam prohibits usury, monopoly, compulsion, theft, robbery, hoarding gold and silver, luxurious spending, conceitedness (if wealthy). On the other hand Allah ordained a fixed annual charity that limits inflation and provides a sharing process for the poor. Also He decreed a medium course of spending. All of these represent control mechanisms to prevent social, political and economical injustice. Have we thought about the fact that usury (in the form of interests on loans) holds people as well as nations under the siege of the banks and multinational financial institutions?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the name of “modern freedom,” men and women are easily driven by their lusts to &#8220;enjoy&#8221; a sexual &#8220;affair&#8221;. Nowadays, man knows that the consequences are harmful. Allah had provided man with a control mechanism for his sexual desires, in the form of legal marriage to more than one woman. He (سبحانه و تعالى) made of this mechanism a legal and a moral binding process to protect women. It is not an affair! It is a very real and medium course for those who are able to support more than one house, and for those who have strong sexual desires. It is very realistic. It is done in the open and not in motels, hotels, or private apartments such that when the woman gets pregnant the man takes a flight saying, “Bye, Bye honey!” The craze for lust is affecting the life of others! AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases are just some examples.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Man accepts the accountability principle laid down by his boss in a company. There are man-made restrictions on flights and on the use of many instruments. Man thinks they are there to protect him. In part this may be true, but how about the guidelines that are set by Allah to save the whole living of man? Such guidelines come from the One who is Perfect, not man who is imperfect! The “freedom” that leads a person to an eternal destruction in a Confined Place called Hell is the utmost restriction. The true freedom of man is that which builds a civilization that has a Divine value system and in which man submits to His Creator Alone. A civilization that reacts with the life of this world and links it to the Day of Return. On that Day everyone will be held accountable in front of the One Who is All-Just, All-Wise, All-Merciful, Sever in Punishment, and OftForgiving, Allah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“It is He Who has made the earth subservient to you (i.e., easy for you to walk to live and to do agriculture in it, so walk in the paths thereof and eat of His provision and to Him will be the Resurrection (of the dead).”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 67: 15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the above verse there is a reminder for man that, while searching for his sustenance, he must abide by what Allah had decreed. Consequently, there is accountability, either reward or punishment. This calls for responsibility and not “restriction”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another reminder on the road to build the responsible society:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“But seek, with that (wealth) which Allah has bestowed on you the Home of the Hereafter, and forget not your portion of legal enjoyment in this world and do good as Allah has been good to you and seek not mischief in the land. Verily Allah likes not the mischief-doers.”</strong></span> (Qur’an 28: 77)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Civilization is not only professional progress in materialistic forms. Although this is required, it has to comply with the moral system as prescribed by the Creator to have a meaningful outcome. Otherwise this progress will bring man&#8217;s own destruction by promoting an attachment to desires as well as a power struggle to control the world&#8217;s resources. This is best explained in the verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“O mankind! We have created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female and made you into nations and tribes that you may know one another. Verily, the most honourable of you in the sight of Allah is that (believer) who is best in religion and best in good deeds. Verily Allah is All-Knowing. All-Aware.”</strong></span> (Qur’an 49: 13)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who live according to Allah&#8217;s way will be the best in His sight. Those are the truly successful ones who can build a true civilization. The following Ayah illustrates some beautiful aspects of this civilization:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“O you who believe! Enter not houses other than your own, until you have asked permission and greeted those in them, that is better for you, in order that you may remember. And if you find no one therein, still, enter not until permission has been given. And if you are asked to go back, go back, for it is purer for you, and Allah is Knower of what you do. There is no sin for you that you enter (without taking permission) houses uninhabited (i.e., not possessed by anybody) (when) you have any interest in them. And Allah has knowledge of what you reveal and what you conceal. Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and protect their private parts from sins. That is purer for them. Verily Allah is aware of what they do. And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts, etc.)”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 24:27-31)</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">The Way Out</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The modern civilization has influenced many parts of the world. It attracted many people through its materialistic progress. In this civilization acts like dedication, honesty, honouring an appointment, respecting the rights of others, are not purely done for the sake of Allah, but for the sake of interest. Such features are limited within the frame work of social interactions. This mostly exists in the so called &#8220;pragmatic&#8221; or the &#8220;freeworld civilization&#8221;. When carefully examined, it is a narrow-minded, self-oriented, and eventually self-destructive approach. In the modem civilization, one hand is extended to shake with, while the other is ready to intervene when there are &#8220;conflicting&#8221; interests. Because of the actual worship of self-interests, people of this &#8220;civilization&#8221; must deal &#8220;nicely&#8221; with each other so as to minimise &#8220;friction.&#8221; There is a continuous &#8220;lubrication&#8221; of this system to keep it running with the least possible friction. But when it comes to people who are not part of the &#8220;free-world,&#8221; intervention, rather than &#8220;lubrication,&#8221; takes place under the banner of &#8220;Global Interests,&#8221; &#8220;Humanitarian Aid,&#8221; or &#8220;World Order&#8221;! The recent position towards systematic killings of Muslims in Bosnia is a vivid manifestation of this real nature of modem civilization. Compare the position towards Bosnia with the quick response and intervention for the sake of &#8220;interests&#8221; in other parts of the World. When it comes to politics, there is rarely any moral binding. Lying, cheating, and dishonouring the rights of others are practiced in the name of National Interests!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the economical front, the usury (interest system) is an open rip off that unlawfully uses people&#8217;s money making some rich and others poor. Every possible mean is used to advertize products regardless of their benefit. On the issue of sex, there is chaos never like it in history. The family structure is in disarray. Divorce rates are soaring. Teenagers are depressed. Many take antidepressant drugs on the job! The wide-spread psychology clinics on street corners of “effluent” suburbs is an evidence of complex social living. Suicide amongst the youth is alarming. Many people resort to take dogs or cats as &#8220;honest friends.&#8221; The market of drugs is depleting people&#8217;s money and health. AIDS is a direct response to arrogance against the natural and morally abiding decrees regarding sexual needs as set by the Creator. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Sins didn’t spread in any particular nation until they openly conduct it and as a result plague and other illnesses that were not present among their predecessors became widespread amongst them.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Cancer could have been a sufficient warning to reflect upon our estimate of Allah and His Attributes. However, the arrogance and disregard of Allah produced a &#8220;worship&#8221; of lust and brought what is worse than cancer. Could people stop neglecting to think about the purpose of life before more evil appears?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Evil (sins and disobedience of Allah, etc.) has appeared on land and sea because of what the hands of man have earned (by oppression and evil deeds, etc.), that (Allah) may make them taste a part of that which they have done, in order that they may return (by repenting to Allah, and begging His Pardon).”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 30: 41)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when man forgets Allah and His reminders:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“So, when they forgot that (the warning) which they had been reminded, We opened to them the gates of every (pleasant) thing, until in the midst of their enjoyment in that which they were given, all of a sudden, We took them to punishment, and lo! they were plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows.”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 6: 44).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For those who &#8216;worship&#8217; technology and who arrogantly think that they are building all powers of disposal over the earth, a reminder from Allah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>”Verily, the likeness of (this) worldly life is as the rain which We send down from the sky, so by it arises the intermingled produce of the earth of which men and cattle eat until when the earth is clad with its adornments and is beautified, and its people think that they have all powers of disposal over it, Our command, reached it by night or by day and We make it like a clean-mown harvest, as if it had not flourished yesterday! Thus do We explain the Signs (proofs, revelation laws, etc.) in detail for people who reflect”</strong></span> (Qur’an 10: 24)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many civilizations vanished before and were destroyed when they stood against the way of Allah. We do not have a special relationship with Allah that may save us when we ignore Him and follow our desires! The only true way of salvation is to submit to Him and His way as Revealed in the Qur&#8217;an and as explained by the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. This is the true way of Salvation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">A Final Word to Those Who Submitted to Allah in Islam</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam is the perfect way of life. Muslims vary in terms of their adherence to the Faith. There are those whose beliefs and practices adhere well to the way of Allah. Some commit sins but repent and regret. Others disobey and think they will be forgiven just because they are Muslims. Many resort in their worship to other than Allah. They call upon righteous men, dead or alive, and love them like they love Allah. This is the only sin that Allah does not forgive. Any Muslim who sets up rivals with Allah exits the fold of Islam. What matters is the pure submission to Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslims are called to liberate themselves from any worship to other than Allah. Following deviated sects that call for Sufism (mystic ways), Shee’ism (which gives Divine Attributes to men like Khumeini, and to certain Imams), Ismaa’eelism (another mystic sect that, like Sheeism, gives Divinity to ‘Ali Bin Abee Talib, the honourable companion of the Prophet Muhammad-صلى الله عليه وسلم), and all other ways that lead Muslims out of Islam, must be avoided.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the state, family, and individual levels, Muslims must apply the Law (Sharee’ah) of Allah in all of its aspects as detailed by Allah in the Qur’an and by the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم). This is the true way of Justice on earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The duty of the true Muslims is to call for the correction of beliefs and practices that contradict the purpose of man&#8217;s existence on earth. In the course of their duty, they can only depend upon Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) Alone, seeking His Guidance, Help and refuge in Him Alone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">In the name of Allaah the most Beneficent the most Merciful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The True God is Allaah, And Man is Need of Him.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I testify that there is no true god worthy of worship except Allaah and that Muhammad is Allaah’s true slave and Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The term <em><strong>worship</strong> </em>in Islam translates to a code of life, because worship means everything which Allaah loves from actions and (or) sayings that are apparent and (or) hidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many are those who do not believe in Allaah as the Only True God. Many as well believe that there is a Creator. However, they are in state of confusion as to who is this Creator. In this article a presentation is aimed to direct to the conclusion that Allaah is the true &#8220;God&#8221;, the Creator, and that man is in need of Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Creator must be the creator of everything, the heavens, the earth an all that is in between them, mankind and all that exists. It is anticipated that anyone who says “I believe in the Creator,” that he believes in this. It also entails that he should necessarily believe that the Creator possesses Perfect Attributes. He is Perfect in His attributes, in Himself, in His Names, and in His Actions. This is a natural flow, otherwise, it is a delusion not a true belief in the &#8220;Creator.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I believe in a Perfect Creator,&#8221; should lead to another obvious admission: if you believe that the Creator is Perfect then He is Perfectly Wise in all of His Actions. Does He then Create because of a Perfect Wisdom, or aimlessly? This is the important linkage. Does He Create for a need? Or He Creates based upon Wisdom? It is anticipated that to be in harmony with having belief in the Creator, that His Wisdom is necessarily is linked to His Knowledge, His Will and to all of His Attributes. The question, therefore, would you think the One who creates does so for a purpose or He creates to leave the creation aimless? The person who believes the Creator is Perfect, would agree that His creating is not aimless. If so, then Who else other than Allaah has stated this? And you know where? It is in His Final Revelation to man.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Contemplate what He has said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Did you think that We have created you in play without any purpose and that you will not be brought back to us, so exalted be Allaah the true king none has the right to be worshipped but He, the Lord of the Supreme Throne”</strong></span> [Quran 23: 115-116].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Does man think that he will be left aimless (without purpose)?</strong></span> [Quran, 75:36].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah is the One whom you believe to be &#8220;the Creator.&#8221; He chose this title for Himself and He stated that He is the Only Creator, and that He Creates with Wisdom:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Such is Allah, your Lord, the Creator of all things, there is no god but He: Then how ye are deluded away from the Truth!</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;an, 40:62].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">So this creation which Allaah creates must have a code organizing its existence and its aims. Hence:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- Allaah creates and His creating is all Wise and for a purpose.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- Allaah did not leave us aimless. He set a code to live accordingly. So He legislates, commands, and prohibits, and justly sets reward and accountability, because He is all Just.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- In all aspects of this code, the manifestations of His Names and Attributes become known, contemplated and realized. Being the Creator necessitates creating as well as purpose, guidance and legislations. Whoever ascribes is rewarded, since He is the Most Generous. When one commits a sin, he realizes that his Creator accepts repentance and is oft-Forgiving. So the manifestations of Allaah&#8217;s Names and Attributes become realized on earth and this is beloved to Allaah, the Creator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- Allaah gives man life, physical sustenance, and spiritual guidance through the revelation which He entrusted His Messengers with. He guides man to know how to benefit from the provisions, what is good for him and what is harmful. He raises in honor those who submitted to Him, and justly puts in humiliation those who disdain and are arrogant. He Forgives and is Merciful; He punishes and rewards in order that man shapes his life with the code that is all beneficial to man and which makes his life on this earth upright. And it cannot be upright unless man ascribes to the guidance sent to him by His creator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5- If all mankind come to ascribe to his code (i.e. worship) Allaah on one heart, then this does not oblige any change in Allaah&#8217;s Essence nor in His Attributes. If all the creation is on one heart, this does not increase in the dominion of Allaah anything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why He stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>But Allah is free of all wants, and it is ye that are needy.</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;an, 47:38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6-And that is why He mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“If you do good, you do good for your own selves”</span> </strong>[Qur&#8217;an, 17:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;And whoever does righteous good deeds, then such will prepare a good place in paradise for themselves.&#8221;</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;an, 30:44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) related in the authentic hadith that Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“O My slaves, you will not attain harm in Me so as to harm Me, and you will not attain benefit in Me so as to benefit Me; O My slaves, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to be as pious as the most pious heart of any one man of you, that will not increase My Kingdom in anything; O my slaves, were the first of you and last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to be as wicked as the most wicked heart of any one man of you, that will not decrease My Kingdom in anything; O My slaves, it is but your deeds that I reckon up for you and I recompense you for. So let him who finds good praise Allaah and let him who finds other than that blame no one but himself.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported in Saheeh Muslim, No. 6246]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On daily basis the person makes what is known as ritual purity (wudu). In every drop of water used to wash the face, hands, arms, head, and feet, sins fall off. It is therefore a tangible and intangible benefit to man. Listen to what Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Allaah does not want to place you in difficulty but He wants to purify you and to complete His favour upon you that you may be thankful.&#8221;</strong> </span>[Qur&#8217;an, 5:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also concerning the ritual of offering a sacrificial animal (from the cattle) in the pilgrimage, we read in the Qur&#8217;an:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allaah but it is piety from you that reaches Him.&#8221;</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;an, 22:37].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In human to human relationship, people do good for each other to attain their own interests, or to be praised. But with Allaah, if you do good, you do good for yourself, because this good that you do does not benefit Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In light of the above, we need to contemplate the great purpose for which we have been created. This is clearly stated by Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And Allaah have not created not the jinn and the men except that they should worship me alone.&#8221;</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;an, 51: 56-57]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they are called for what benefits them. Remember the definition of worship in the beginning of this discussion? They are the ones who, if they comply, will win. And that is why He asserted in the next verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I seek not any provision from them nor do I ask that they should feed Me.”</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;an, 51:57].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why did Allaah mention food and provisions here? It is traditionally known that the greatest need for man is the need for food, clothing and residence. This requires means and provisions, and this is the wealth. That is why Allaah began with it: <strong>“I seek not any provision from them,”</strong> and then He referred to food, because it is the thing most needed by people: <strong>“nor do I ask that they should feed Me,&#8221;</strong> because He is all-Rich, free of all want; Self-Sufficient, needs nothing. He related to us in things we relate closely to so as to make this matter vividly clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, the creation of man is not to bring a benefit for Allaah, but to establish this code of life which links him to his Creator. The Noble objective is to submit and deliver. Otherwise there can be no love of our Creator without submission. And to deliver so as to establish uprightness. But who defines what is good and upright? It is laid down by the one who is All-Knowing and Perfect: Allaah. If it is left to us, then your good is an evil to me and vice versa! So, the code of life is set in accordance with what Allaah has defined as worship, outwardly, and inwardly. So imagine someone saying he loves Allaah and worships others besides Him or to the exclusion of Him! This is neither submission nor compliance. That is why love and magnification of Allah means worshipping none but Him. This is the essence of all the revealed Messages to all the Prophets and Messengers. It is a single Message of Tawheed: singling Allaah alone as the true God worthy of worship and disassociating from any kind of worship to other than Him</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We often hear people say: what is important is &#8220;love.&#8221; In reality, the true love is the love of Allaah, our Creator, sustainer, and provider. No one is more beloved to Allaah than the one who loves Him and praises Him and complies with His code which He has set for us in this life. Shirk (opposite of Tawheed): associating partners with Allaah in worship is the most hated thing to Allaah because this diminishes (or may eliminate) the love of Allaah. It sets between Allaah and man an associate, and that is why Allaah does not love it. It takes away from the love of Allaah alone and equates Allaah, the Perfect, with the imperfect. This is not even acceptable in human relations. So one must not set up any rival to Allaah in worship. Allaah warned about this, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And of mankind are some who take for worship others besides Allaah as rivals, they love them as they love Allaah but those who believe love Allaah more than anything else.&#8221;</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;an 2, 165]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the truly beneficial thing to man is to know of His Creator, magnify Him, and love Him so that he gains His love and thus be amongst the happy ones in this life and in the hereafter. However, since man has tendencies towards his own lusts and desires, then this objective cannot be attained except when man follows what is pleasing to His Creator, Allaah. The stronger man&#8217;s love of Allaah is, the more he gains of His love and guidance. In practice this needs to be translated into compliance with the code of life set by Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who is in need of Allaah is the created, because the One who is Self Sufficient and Perfect is Allaah. It is out of His generosity and benevolence that He is rewarding for singling Him alone in worship. And in that, His names and attributes become manifested, and this is beloved to Him. He loves for the person to repent; He loves for the person to return to Him in repentance; He loves forgiving; He loves pardoning; He loves clemency, and He loves justice because He is All-Just. When man realizes the manifestations of Allaah’s Names, Attributes and actions in the creation, then he knows the meaning of worship and clings to that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I hope that in this discussion, there is a benefit for the person who says that he believes in the Creator, and that it takes him to the final conclusion of submitting to Allaah in Islam. As to those who do not believe in Allaah, they are directed to the discussions we have on this matter under the title: <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2015/02/21/who-deserves-to-be-worshipped-alone-dr-saleh-as-saleh/"><strong>&#8220;who deserves to be worshipped alone”</strong></a> on the site <a href="http://www.understandislam.net" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.understandislam.net</a>. And all Praise is due to Allaah, the most Beneficent the most Merciful.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Below are some examples taken from your Gospels [11] that confirm and support what Muhammad came with from the Qur’aan and his teachings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the seventh verse of Chapter 4 of the Gospel of Mathew, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Jesus said to him: ‘Again it is written, You shall not tempt the Lord your God.’”</strong></span> [Matthew 4:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. In this same chapter, there occurs a story about Jesus and the Devil, in which the Devil ordered Jesus to prostrate to him. So the Messiah Jesus responded to him, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Be gone Satan, for it is written: &#8216;You shall worship (prostrate only to) the Lord your God and Him only shall you serve (i.e. worship).’”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what all the messengers came with and it is the argument that Jesus used against the Devil. So this clearly proves that all of the prophets including Jesus and Muhammad came to establish that God was One and that He was the Lord and only One deserving of being worshipped.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jesus relied on the previously revealed books (from God) as proof, which state that God is the only Lord and that He is the only One who has the right to be worshipped and prostrated to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, Allaah revealed to (Prophet) Muhammad: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And We indeed sent to every nation a messenger (saying to his people): ‘Worship Allaah alone and avoid the false deities.’ So amongst them were those whom Allaah guided and amongst them were those whose misguidance was justified.”</strong></span> [Qur’aan 16:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also revealed to him: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And We did not send any messenger before you except that We revealed to him: ‘There is no deity that has the right to be worshipped in truth, except Me, so worship Me alone.’”</strong></span> [Qur’aan 23:25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these statements that were revealed to Muhammad are in complete conformity with what Jesus stated in his reply to the Devil. It is also in conformity with what Jesus said when calling the Tribe of Israel:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Verily, Allaah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. This is the Straight Path.”</strong></span> [Qur’aan 19:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it agrees with what he will say on the Day of Judgement when his Lord will ask him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“O Jesus, son of Mary, did you tell the people: ‘Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allaah?’ He will reply: ‘Glory be to You! It was not for me to say what I had no right to say. If I had said such a thing, You would have surely known about it. You know what is in my inner self though I do not know what is in Your Self. Truly, only You are the All-Knowing of all that is hidden. I did not tell them anything except for what You commanded me to tell them, (which was): Worship Allaah, my Lord and your Lord. And I served as a witness for them for as long as I was with them. But when You took me up, You were the Watcher over them, and You are a Witness to all things.’”</span></strong> [Qur’aan 5:116-117]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. In Chapter 11 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 25, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“At that time Jesus declared: ‘I thank thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that Thou hast hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to babes (infants).’”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Jesus was one of God’s servants and messengers. He acknowledged the right of his Lord who created him and bestowed His blessings on him, and therefore turned to Him, in thanks and affirmation that He alone was the Lord of the heaven and earth. This is since He is the One who created these two creations (the heaven and the earth), as well as everything inside them, in between them and whatever lies below the ground. No one else had any part in this – neither Jesus or anyone else – nor can anyone rival Him in that matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. In Chapter 14 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 23, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And after he had dismissed the crowds, he (Jesus) went up on the mountain by himself to pray.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Prayer is one of the greatest acts of worship that can be performed to God, and no one engages in it except for a lowly servant who stands in need of the mercy of his Lord and Creator. This is as Allaah says in the Qur’aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“O mankind! It is you who stand in need of Allaah, whereas Allaah is Rich (free of all needs), Most Praiseworthy.”</span> </strong>[Qur’aan 35:15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The Messiah (Jesus) will never be too proud to reject being a servant of God, nor the angels who are the ones close (to Him). And whoever is too proud and rejects worshipping Him, then He will gather them all together unto Himself.”</strong> </span>[Qur’aan 4:172]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Jesus was a servant of God, and he was not nor will he ever be too proud to worship Him. This is his condition and the condition of all of the prophets and angels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. In Chapter 26 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 39, it states that the Messiah (Jesus):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“fell on his face and prayed, ‘My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as Thou wilt.’”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in this text, there is proof that Jesus was a servant (worshipper) of God who had no control over repelling harm from himself or bringing benefit to himself. And there is evidence in this text that he sought refuge in God during times of hardship, seeking His assistance and humbling himself before Him, in order to remove the harm and danger that was approaching him. So he fell prostrate with his face on the ground, seeking nearness to Him, lowering himself before Him, showing his need for Him and expressing the belief that no one has the ability to repel harm except Him. This is the state of all of the messengers, not to mention all of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. In Chapter 21 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 46, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“But when they tried to arrest him, they feared the multitudes, since they held him to be a prophet.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is proof in this verse that the masses of people who believed in God and in Jesus were monotheists with pure and sincere faith, and that they believed that Jesus was a messenger and a prophet. This proves that their prophet, Jesus, had taught them this and cultivated them to believe in that. So they did not used to believe that he was God or the son of God, since he would not teach the people these things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. In Chapter 23 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 10, it states that Jesus said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“Neither be called masters, for you, even the Messiah, has One master.”</span> </strong>[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This text resembles the Qur’anic text in which Allaah informs us that His messenger Jesus told the Tribe of Israel: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“And verily, Allaah is my Lord and your Lord.”</span></strong> [Qur’aan 3:51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah is the Lord of Jesus, as well as his Master, Nurturer and Owner. He is the Lord, Master and Owner of all mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslim scholar, Taqee-ud-Deen al-Hilaalee, pointed out in his treatise “Clear Evidences” that: Some translators have distorted this text, but that the English translation was saved from this corruption.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. In Chapter 17 of the Gospel of John, verse 3, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And this is the eternal life – that they know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This text confirms that which all of the messengers came with, which was that there is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and it confirms that Jesus was a messenger of God. This was during his time, and every nation had its own time and messenger, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“And We did not send any messenger before you except that We revealed to him: ‘There is no deity that has the right to be worshipped in truth, except Me, so worship Me alone.’”</span> </strong>[Qur’aan 21:25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“And We indeed sent to every nation a messenger (saying to his people): ‘Worship Allaah alone and avoid the false deities.’”</span></strong> [Qur’aan 16:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. In Chapter 12 of the Gospel of Mark, verses 28-30, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he (Jesus) answered them well, asked him, ‘Which commandment is the first of all?’ Jesus answered, ‘The first is: Hear, O Israel! The Lord our God, the Lord is One. And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.&#8217;”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the first commandment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in verse 32 of the same chapter, it states that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“The scribe said to him, ‘You are right, teacher. You have truly said that He is One, and there is no other but He.’”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then in verse 34 of the same chapter, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And when Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, ‘You are not far from the kingdom of God.’”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This first commandment mentioned by Jesus is the same commandment that Allaah prescribed to all of His messengers, including Jesus – and this was the commandment that the messengers passed on to their nations:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“He has ordained for you the same religion that He ordained for Noah and which We revealed to you (O Muhammad) and ordained for Abraham, Moses and Jesus – that you should establish the Religion and make no divisions in it. Intolerable for the polytheists is that which you call them to.”</span></strong> [Qur’aan 42:13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The religion that God ordained for them was the pure monotheistic Faith, which is represented in the statement: “There is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah.” He ordered all of his messengers to call to this, and it is that which the polytheists found difficult to accept and for which reason they fought against God’s messengers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the same thing that Abraham and Jacob, also known as Israel, commanded the people with, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“And remember when Abraham and (his son) Ishmael were raising the foundations of the House (Ka’bah at Makkah), saying: ‘Our Lord! Accept this from us. Verily, You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knower. Our Lord! Make us submissive unto You, and of our offspring, a nation submissive unto You. And show us how to perform the ceremonies required during the pilgrimage (to the Ka’bah), and accept our repentance. Truly, You are the One who accepts repentance, the Most Merciful. Our Lord! Send amongst them a messenger of their own (i.e. Muhammad), who shall recite unto them Your verses and teach them the Book and the Wisdom (Prophetic Teachings), and purify them. Verily, You are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.’ And who turns away from the religion of Abraham except for he who fools himself? Truly, We chose him in this world and in the Hereafter, he will be among the righteous. When his Lord said to him: ‘Submit yourself’, he said: ‘I have submitted myself (as a Muslim) to the Lord of all that exists.’ And this (submission to Allaah) was enjoined by Abraham upon his sons, and also by Jacob, saying: ‘O my sons! Allaah has chosen for you the (true) religion, so do not die except while you are Muslims (i.e. submitting to the Will of your Creator).’ Or were you witnesses when death approached Jacob? – When he said to his sons: ‘What will you worship after me?’ They said: ‘We shall worship your God, the God of your forefathers – Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac – One God and to Him we submit (as Muslims).’”</span></strong> [Qur’aan 2:127-133]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is truly a tremendous religion, in which they submitted their will to the Lord of all that exists, turned to Him in repentance and sought refuge in Him to make their offspring an offspring that submit themselves to God. And they invoked Him to send a messenger from amongst them to them who would recite His verses unto them, teach them the Book and the Wisdom and purify them – the purification and wisdom that would keep them far away from polytheism, foolishness and misguidance. And Allaah rules here that whoever turns away from this religion, which is pure monotheism, only fools himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point derived from this is that the call of all of the prophets was in harmony in that they were calls to Monotheism and to Submission (to God) and that there was no deity that had the right to be worshipped except Allaah. They called their nations to this and counseled those who came after them from their offspring to abide by this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second point we want to focus on here, was the counsel of Israel, who was also known as Jacob. The text of the Bible in this regard is in conformity with the text from the Qur’aan in that the Biblical text indicates we should have love for God. This is also part of Islaam. In fact, the Religion of Islaam also consists of many aspects and great deeds apart from love (for the Creator).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look at how Jesus responded and what his tremendous counsel was. And look at the faith of the scribe who had asked the question looking for an answer to benefit from, and his statement: “<strong>You are right Teacher. You have truly said that He is One, and there is no other but He.</strong>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And look at how the Messiah responded to him, saying <strong>“You are not far from the kingdom of God.”</strong> This, and Allaah knows best, is a promise from him that he will be in Paradise, and it indicates that anyone who doesn’t believe in the Oneness of God and that He alone should be worshipped will not be allowed entry into Paradise. This is similar to what Allaah says in the Qur’aan, relaying to us what Jesus said to the Tribe of Israel:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Worship Allaah, who is my Lord and your Lord. Verily, whoever ascribes partners to Allaah in worship, Allaah will surely make Paradise forbidden for him and his final abode will be the Hellfire. And the wrongdoers will not have any supporters (in Hell).”</span></strong> [Qur’aan 5:72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Note: According to the language of the Torah and the Gospels, every righteous and dutiful follower of God is called a son of God, so Jesus was not particularized with this expression of “son of God.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. In Chapter 5 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 9, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. And in verse 45 of Chapter 5 of the Gospel of Matthew, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“So that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. In verse 4 of the Gospel of Matthew, Chapter 5, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“You, therefore, must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. In Chapter 6 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 1, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“Beware of practicing your piety before men in order to be seen by them, for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. In Chapter 23 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 9, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven.”</strong></span> [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These verses show that use of the terms “father” and “son” to refer to the connection between the Lord and His servant was a practice established in the Bible for all people, so the Messiah, Jesus, was not specifically characterized with this apart from others. [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps all of this was from the behavior of some of the Jews and Christians, but God knows best. This is since Allaah says in the Qur’aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“The Jews and the Christians say: ‘We are the children of God and His beloved ones.’ Say: ‘Why then does He punish you for your sins?’ Nay, you are but human beings from those He has created. He forgives whom He wills and He punishes whom He wills. And to Allaah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them. And to Him is the final return.”</span></strong> [Qur’aan 5:18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Any fair and balanced person with sound intellect will realize that the Qur’anic texts we mentioned contain in them a tribute, honor, warm reception and high praise for Jesus. And they confirm that he was a prophet and a messenger, and that he was one of the greatest messengers who carried the banner of Monotheism, called mankind to this Monotheistic Faith, which means making all worship purely for God alone, fought against polytheism, and warned those who adhere to it (polytheism) that they would reside eternally in the Hellfire – what an evil destination!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These verses from the Qur’aan also show how God absolved Jesus and his mother from the slander that the Jews accused them of, how He raised the status of Jesus and his mother and made the statements of the Jews against him and his mother to be considered as disbelief and immense slander.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the texts of the Qur’aan and the Bible are in conformity with the fact that Jesus was a servant and messenger of God. This is a perfect state that no one can attain except for the great messengers amongst whom was Jesus. The teachings of Prophet Muhammad also professed the same beliefs and the Muslims believed in all of this. So what then is wrong with Islaam and the Muslims? There is nothing wrong with it at all, in the eyes of those with sound intellects and impartiality. Rather, the wrong is against God Himself, since the terrible statement (that Jesus is the son of God), due to which the heavens are ready to tear apart, the earth split asunder, and the mountains fall in ruins is the opposite of what is indicated in the Qur’aan, the teachings of Prophet Muhammad and what the Muslims adhere to, not to mention what the monotheistic texts still preserved in the Bible indicate.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] Translator’s Note: The translation used for Biblical quotes in this booklet are from the Revised Standard Version of the Bible, which can be accessed on-line at bible.com. It should be noted that currently there are many translations of the Gospels (New Testament) in the English Language. The average person can view the various translations and notice gross changes/alterations in the interpretation and translation of many verses of the Bible, not to mention some being left out completely. This is a further proof that the Bible has been distorted and altered as confirmed by God in His Final Revelation, the Qur’aan, which He guaranteed to protect and preserve in its original form. Allaah says: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Verily, We sent down the Reminder (the Qur’aan) and We will surely preserve it (from corruption).”</strong></span> [Qur’aan 15:9] The likes of this promise and guarantee from God was not made for His previous revelations, hence the obvious and noticeable contradictions in the present-day versions of these revealed Books of God – the Torah and the Gospels.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] Translator’s Note: The use of the relationship of Father and Son to refer to the connection between God and His righteous servants is not just limited to the New testament of the Bible, rather, there can be found proof for it in the Old Testament as well:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“The sons of God saw that the daughters of men were fair; and they took to wife such of them as they chose.”</span> [Genesis 6:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men that were of old, the men of renown.”</span> [Genesis 6:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of men, he fixed the bounds of the peoples according to the number of the sons of God.”</span> [Deuteronomy 32:8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came among them.”</span> [Job 1:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?”</span> [Job 38:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14] See “The Clear Evidences” of Taqee-ud-Deen Al-Hilaalee (pgs. 6-10).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s Note:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further evidence from the New Testament that confirms this point that the use of the relationship between Father and Son as a substitute for the relationship between God and His servant is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“For they cannot die any more, because they are equal to angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.”</span> [Luke 20:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.”</span> [Romans 8: 14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“But to all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God.”</span> [John 1:12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“And not for the nation only, but to gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.”</span> [John 11:52]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“It is the Spirit himself bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of God.”</span> [Romans 8:16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“…because the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain the glorious liberty of the children of God.”</span> [Romans 8:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“That you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world.”</span> [Philippians 2:15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“See what love the Father has given us – that we should be called children of God; and so we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him.”</span> [1 John 3:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"> “By this it may be seen who are the children of God, and who are the children of the Devil, Whoever does not do right is not of God, nor he who does not love his brother.”</span> [1 John 3:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandment.”</span> [1 John 5:2]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="art">Man always looks for what benefits him and what protects him from harm. However, to accomplish this, man must be able to realize what is harmful. He must then know whom he should need, trust, and love so that he can attain what is beneficial as well as to feel good about his choice. He also must know the proper and good approach that would make him achieve this goal. This latter condition requires that man:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="art">1.Know about harm<br />
2.What ways can be used to drive harm away</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="art">Certainly, man can have no better guidance than that which comes from the One Who had perfected everything, and the One who Has no deficiency in Himself and in His Attributes. The One Who is Ever-Living and Who does not die. There can be no One better than the One Who Has no need for anything; the One Who is rich; the Giver; the One who, after all, controls man&#8217;s soul. Man is so poor to Him. He is Allaah, the True and only God. Man can bring harm to himself if he seeks other than Allaah for help. Allaah is the One Who can help man drive away any harm for it cannot occur without His Will and His Power.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) sent down His Books and chose His Messengers to guide man to:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1.Know His Lord as He (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) had explained about Himself, and<br />
2.Seek Him Alone while living in accordance with His plan</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowing Allaah&#8217;s Names and Attributes liberates man from worshiping any form of creation because creation is weak and is in need of The Creator, Allaah. The knowledge about Allaah leads man to know that he is created to live according to Allaah&#8217;s way as revealed to the last Messenger Muhammad . This Revelation contains a complete code of life. Everything that is beneficial or harmful is established so that man can center his life around this Revelation. If man commits wrong and knows that Allaah is Oft-Forgiving he would turn to Him and to Him alone seeking His forgiveness:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Know, therefore, that there is no God Who deserves to be worshiped except  Allaah; and ask forgiveness for your sins.&#8221;</strong>      (Qur&#8217;an, 47:19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="art">It is wrong to think or believe that Allaah created other &#8216;gods&#8217; besides Him so that man turns to them for help; loves them or fear them, etc. He is the same God of all nations. He does not order that people should make of stars, sun, fire, Jesus, Moses, etc. gods besides Him. He (Most Exalted) cannot be &#8216;contradictory&#8217;. He has one way (religion) that calls man to surrender his will only to Him. He warned that if man (even Muhammad  would take partners with Him, then his work will fail and will be among losers:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And verily, it had been revealed to you (O Muhammad ) as  has been revealed to those before you. If you join others in worship with Allaah (then) surely (all) your deeds will be in vain and you will certainly be among the losers. Nay!  But worship Allaah and be among grateful.&#8221;</strong>(Qur&#8217;an, 39:65-66)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="art">Let us know what Muhammad , the man-Prophet, who knew Allaah best, used to say:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;O Allaah, I seek refuge in You for Your Pleasure and against Your Wrath,and in Your Forgiveness and against Your Punishment and in You from You, I cannot Praise You as You can Praise Yourself.&#8221;</em> (Muslim, Abu Dawoud, at-Tirmidhi, ibn Majah)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;I have surrendered myself to You, I have directed my face to You, I have entrusted my affairs to You, I have compelled my back to refuge in You, in want and in fright of You, there is no resort nor survival from You except (in turning) to You. I have faith in Your book (i.e. the Qur&#8217;an) which You brought down and in the Prophet (Muhammad ) you have sent.&#8221;</em> (Al-Bukhari, Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="art">When we read in the Qur&#8217;an that:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;Whatever of Mercy (i.e. of good), Allaah may grant to mankind,  none can withhold it, and whatever He may withhold, none can  grant it thereafter. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.&#8221;</strong>   (Qur&#8217;an, 35:2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="art">And when we read that:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;If Allaah touches you with hurt, there is none can remove it but He; and if He intends any good for you, there is none who can repel His favor which He causes it to reach homsoever of His slaves He will, and He is the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221;</strong> (Qur&#8217;an, 10:117)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="art">We should be motivated to return to Him Alone at times of ease and at times of hardship.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when we read that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;If Allaah helps you none can overcome you, and if He forsakes you, who is there, after Him, that can help you. And in Allaah (alone) let believers put their trust.&#8221; </strong>(Qur&#8217;an, 3:160)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="art">The Qur&#8217;an, therefore, leads man to a true liberation from any false attachment. It brings peace to the heart. It helps the believer against hypocrisy and all forms of dishonesty. Imagine, for example, a believer facing a problem at work. He sees wrong and faces unlawful practices. He does not fear rejecting what is wrong. He knows that the job is only a means to gain his sustenance. While he may be unable to correct what is wrong, he knows well that Allaah is the One Who provides. If he leaves his job for the sake of Allaah, Allaah will give him a better one. Allaah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him. He will make a way for him to get out (from) every (difficulty), and He will provide him from (sources) he could never imagine.&#8221;</strong>(Qur&#8217;an, 65:2-3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="art">The above texts, necessitates that man must depend upon Allaah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) asking Him Alone for assistance. It also requires that man must love Allaah and worship Him Alone to gain His pleasure and His help. Is it not true that the people who consider this life as the &#8220;Final Goal&#8221; end up worshiping many things in it? You see them so careful about &#8220;having it all&#8221;. They torture themselves: pain, difficulty, constant worry, keeping their hands in the banks for loan after loan to keep up with the &#8220;demands of development&#8221;. They are under the constant threat of fore-closure. They constantly see poverty in front of their eyes. The Prophet  said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;Allaah says: &#8216;Son of Adam: Fill your time with My worship and I will fill your heart with richness, and end off your poverty. But if you donot, I would make your hands fully busy (i.e. in worldly affairs) and I would not end off your poverty.'&#8221;</em> (At-Tirmidhi said that it is a good hadeeth)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="art">Our purpose of existence on earth is more meaningful than being slaves to worldly gains. There can be no meaningful life better than that prescribed by our Creator Allaah. Every act done according to Allaah&#8217;s way is an act of worship. Man is the beneficiary and Allaah is in no need:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O mankind! It is you who stand in need of Allaah, but Allaah is Rich (Free of all wants and needs), Worthy of All Praise.&#8221;</strong> (Qur&#8217;an, 35:15)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The submission and obedience of man to His Creator is the essence of Islam. The Name “Islam” is chosen by God (Allaah) and not by man. It is the same message revealed to all the prophets and Messengers by Allaah and which they spread amongst their respective nations. In its final and universal form it was revealed to Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم: may Allaah exalt his mention and save him and his message from all kinds of evil).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is the identifying name or title of the Majestic, sole and True God. This noun which is the name of Allaah applies to none other than Him. He, Most Majestic and Most High, has other names all of which follow on from His name Allaah. The meaning of the name Allaah is the ma’looh (that which is worshipped out of love, magnification, deification, and longing). He is the Creator: to Him belongs the Commandment. No worship is worthy of being given to a stone, statue, a cross, a triangle, Khomeini, Farakhan, Elijas, Malcom’s X or Y, Ghandi, Krishna, Gurus, Buddha, Mahatma, Emperor, Joseph Smith, Sun, Moon (not to that from Korea too), Diana, light fire, rivers, cows, Rama, Temples, Prophets, Messengers (Yes! Muslims do not worship Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم), Saints, Priests, Monks, Haile Selassie, Movie Stars, Sheiks, etc.!! All are created beings or things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The name Allaah is not chosen by man and it is not named after a prophet, saint or any famous man. The name “Allaah” was referred to by all prophets including Adam, Jesus, Moses, and by the last and final Prophet, Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم), as the One true God who deserves to be worshipped alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The innate nature in man (fitrah) recognizes what is good and bad, what is true and false. It recognizes that the Attributes of Allaah must be True, Unique, and All-Perfect. It does not feel comfortable towards any kind of degradation of His Attributes nor does it relax towards associating human qualities to the Creator. Many who became “discontent with God” did so because of the practices of the Church in medieval Europe and because of the claims of “god dwelling in a son”, and that “everyone is born with an original sin”. They “escaped” into worshipping a new theory called “mother nature” as well as the “material world”. With the advancement of materialistic technology others from different religions adopted the concept of “forgetting about God” and “let us live this life and enjoy it!” not realizing that they have chosen the worship of the “origin god” of Rome: The god of desire!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Today we can see that all of this materialistic progress produced a spiritual vacuum that led to complex social, economical, political, and psychological problems. Many of those who “fled” their “religions” are in search again. Some try to “escape” the complexity of their daily lives via various means. Those who had the chance to examine the Qur’an and Islam, proceed with a complete code for life which requires man to fulfill the purpose for his presence on earth. Allaah does not want for man to be enslaved to any false deity: nature, drugs, lust, money, other men, desire, or sex. He provides the proofs that he is the One who can deliver man from the slavery to any form of creation and to turn to his Creator alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Creator has Perfect Attributes. He is the First, nothing is before Him. He is the Last, everything ends except Him; the Most High, nothing is above Him; the Most Near, nothing is beyond His reach and his compassing, and He is the Most High in His nearness. He is the Ever-Living, to Him we shall all return, where everyone will be dealt with in the Most Perfect and Just way. He does not beget nor is He begotten. Those who attribute Divinity to Jesus forget or ignore the fact that Jesus was in a mother’s womb. He needed nutrition; he was born and grew up to be a man. He was trusted with the Gospel (Injeel) as a message to the Children of Israel. A man-messenger calling his nation not to worship him. A man who needs to eat, walk, sleep, rest, etc. cannot have Divine Attributes because he is in need, but Allaah, the God of Jesus, is far above any imperfection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With respect to Buddhism, Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Rastafarianism, etc., all are forms of worship to created beings/things in one form or another. Jews had attributed a nationalistic belonging to Allaah: “The Tribal God” of Israel. Men and women following these religions were born with the natural inclination of worshipping their Creator, Allaah. It is their parents who had driven them into their respective traditions. Once they are exposed to the Signs of Allaah around them, or in the Qur’an, or to someone who triggers their Fitrah (natural inclination to worship Allaah alone), the reverting process begins, and that is why we see a universal spreading of Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many distortions of Islam in the media, worldwide. However, Despite the wrong practices of some Muslims (rulers and ruled) in some countries, those who seek the truth are judging Islam according to its doctrines. That is why we continue to witness a global growth in the number of people accepting this true religion of Allaah. The opposition to Islam will intensify with the spread of this truth in the world. This is not a conflict of “civilizations”, but rather the real struggle between the truths presented in the creed and principles of Islam and false doctrines and ways of worship. This is a real challenge for those who seek the Truth. Man is created for a purpose: to live a life in accordance with Allaah’s way. Why Not? Do we posses the air we breathe? Did we create ourselves or others? Or were we ourselves the Creators? So is it our right to ignore our Creator when we are all need of Him? Allaah is All-Just and All-Wise. He does not intend confusion for His Creation. The religion accepted to Him is the one chosen by Him. Its essence must be One, because He is One and only one True God. It is the religion of submission to the Will and Commandment of the One Who brought us to life, the Ever Living who will never die. It is the complete way of life for all mankind. All these qualities are chosen by Allaah in His only religion: Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I hope that you will come with an open heart to read the Noble Qur&#8217;aan, because none can expose the truth better than the Word of Allaah. The Qur&#8217;an was revealed to Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) in Arabic and it is not authored by him for he was unlettered. The translations of its meanings into many languages are available in bookstores or in an Islamic Center close to you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You may want to know how does one become a Muslim. In order to become a Muslim one must openly recite ash-shahaadah (the profession of faith): La ilaaha illallaah, Muhammad Rasoolullaah which means that there is no true god except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah. This means that there is no god worthy of being worshipped but Allaah, and that He must be worshipped only according to the teaching of His Messenger Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم). Those teachings are best understood by the Prophet’s companions, and those who rightfully follow their path until the Day of Resurrection. They are called as-salaf as-saalih (the Righteous Predecessors). May Allaah, the Most High, guide us all to this path.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the full attestation that Allaah, The One free of all imperfection, The Most High, exists. No one openly denied the existence of Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic, except by way of haughtiness. Otherwise it is impossible for any reasonable person to claim that this creation was appeared by chance or it came into existence without a cause, due to the fact that this is something impossible to occur as agreed upon by the people of sound intellect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the existence of Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic, is something proven by all kinds of evidences:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) Rational<br />
(ii) Fitriyyah [from Fitrah: Natural disposition],<br />
(iii) Legal, and<br />
(iv) Hissiyyah [from Hiss: What is experienced and perceived].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of these four evidences prove the existence of Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>intellectual proof,</strong></span> then it is that we witness the existence of this universe and what occurs in it from things which is rather impossible for any creature to do. The existence of creation: the heavens, the earth and what is in them from the stars, mountains, rivers, trees, the speaking, the speechless, and so forth. How did this existence come into being? Did it appear by chance? Or did it occur without a cause? Or did it bring itself into existence? These are three possibilities whereby the intellect does not accept a fourth possibility. All of these possibilities are futile and false.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <strong>it appearing by chance</strong>, then this is something that the intellect as well as reality itself denies, because you cannot bring such magnificent creation into existence just by chance; there must be a cause for each effect. Furthermore its astounding arrangement and harmonious order that has no conflict or collision within it, makes it impossible that it all came about randomly. This is because that which would come into existence by chance, its development would not be ordered because all of it is random and by chance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the possibility that <strong>creation brought itself into existence</strong>, then it is also clearly impossible. This is because before its existence, creation did not exist, it was nothing; and that which is nothing cannot bring into existence that which does not exist.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the third possibility that <strong>this existence came to exist without a cause</strong>, then the meaning is the same as our saying that it appeared by chance; and this, as preceded, is impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It remains to be said that existence has someone who brought it into being, and He is Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic. He, The Most High, Says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Were they created by nothing? Or were they themselves the creators? (did they create themselves?) Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Nay, they have no certainty?</span> [Qur’aan, soorat at-Toor (52): 35-36].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, this creation rationally proves the existence of Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>proof of the natural disposition</strong></span> for the existence of Allaah, then it is so evident that it does not require a proof. This is because man is created upon the natural disposition (Fitrah) of belief in his Rabb. The Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Every child is born upon the natural disposition, then his parents change him into a Jew, or a Christian, or a Majian.”</span> [35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why in case something suddenly befalls upon a person in this life such that it may destroy him, he would say with his tongue and without feeling: “O Allaah!” or “O Rabb!” or the like. This proves that the innate nature of man has been created upon the belief in the existence of Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the proof of the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Hiss</strong> (i.e What is experienced and perceived) </span>for the existence of Allaah, then it is very often that we hear of supplications being answered by Allaah. Also the person himself who calls upon Allaah, his supplications are indeed responded to. Many are those who invoked Allaah and said: “O [Yaa] Rabb,” and behold! They saw response was right before his eyes! Indeed in the Qur’aan there are many examples for this, like the Saying of Allaah, The Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And (remember) Ayyub (Job), when he cried to his Rabb: “Verily, distress has seized me, and you are the Most Merciful of all those who show mercy”. So We answered his call, and We removed the distress that was on him.</span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-Anbiyaa’ (21): 83-84].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, there are many other examples from the Sunnah, one of which is the Hadeeth reported by Anas ibn Maalik in which he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“A man [a bedouin Arab] entered the mosque on the day of Jum’ah whilst the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) was delivering the Khutbah, and said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah, property is being destroyed, and the passages have become blocked, so supplicate Allaah to send rain down upon us.’ The Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) raised his hands and then said: ‘O Allaah send down rain upon us; O Allaah send down rain upon us.’ The sky was clear without any cloud in it. The Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) did not come down from his pulpit except that rain was flowing from his beard, may Allaah’s Salaat and Salaam be upon him. There was a downpour of rain for one week. Then on the succeeding Friday a man (the same man or someone else) entered the mosque and said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah, the houses are collapsing and wealth is being flooded, so supplicate Allaah to stop the rain for us.’ The Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) raised his hands and began to say: ‘around us and not upon us,’ pointing with his hands, and he did not point to any direction except that it cleared.” [36] People then stepped out walking in the sunshine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many are the supplications which a person calls upon his Rabb (Allaah) to be answered are indeed responded to. This is a proof contained in what is experienced and perceived for the existence of Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Shar’ee proof for the existence of Allaah</span></strong>, then it is beyond being enumerated. Indeed the Qur’aan in its entirety as well as all of the affirmed Ahaadeeth in their legal and informative nature, proves the existence of Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic, as Allaah Says concerning the Sublime Qur’aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Had it been from other than Allaah, they would have surely found therein much discrepancy.</span> [Qur’aan, soorat an-Nisaa’ (4): 82].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The belief in the existence of Allaah, is one of the matters that comprise(s) the belief in Allaah. As for the belief in Allaah’s Ruboobiyyah, Uloohiyyah, Names and Attributes, then a detailed discussion of these branches of Tawheed has preceded.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Transcript</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Part 1 &#8211;</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Alhamdulillah</em> &#8211; all praise is due to Allah Who made the path to Him easy for those who really believed, the One Who made the path of guidance leading to His pleasure and He made the sign of following the Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم as evidence. And <em>alhamdulillah</em> for His Decrees, the Universal and the Legislative ones. <em>Alhamdulillah</em> &#8211; for He deserves all the Praise. <em>Wa ash-hadu al-laa ilaha ilAllah</em> &#8211; and I bear witness that no god deserves worship except Allah, the True God, without a partner or an associate. And I bear witness that Muhammad ‘<em>abduhu</em>, <em>al-Mustafa</em>, <em>(is)</em> His chosen slave and Messenger and Prophet, the truthful one, who is inspired and sent as a mercy to mankind, an evidence against all those who rebel.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah <em>subhana wa ta’aala</em>, when He got Adam down to earth, He sent him down by a Decree, manifesting His perfect Attributes and Actions, so that Adam returns to his earlier, best conditions. He wanted, <em>subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala</em>, to make Adam and his offspring taste from the toils of this life, and its worries and concerns, that which will make him magnify and make them magnify the value of entering the Abode of Bliss again, because the opposite is manifested by its opposite, and if they were to be raised in the Abode of Bliss, they wouldn&#8217;t have estimated its proper value.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also, <em>subhana wa ta&#8217;aala</em>, wanted to command them and to test them and to try them, and Paradise is not the Abode for checking legal responsibility, so He sent them down to Earth. And in return, He compensated for that with the best of rewards, which would not have been possible to attain without His Commands and Legislations. And He <em>subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala</em> wanted to make from them Prophets and Messengers and friends and martyrs, loving them and they love Him. So He left a free encounter between them and between His enemies, and tried them through that. And when they preferred that which leads to their Creator, and exerted themselves and their wealth in His Pleasure and in that which He loves, they attained from His Love and from His Pleasure and Nearness to Him, that which would not be possible to attain without all of this happening &#8211; sending them for the place of trials and checking.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, <em>subhana wa ta&#8217;aala</em>, is qualified with the best Names: the Oft-Forgiving, the Most Merciful, the Oft-Pardoning, the Clement One, the One Who lifts in honor, and the One Who humiliates to disgrace, the One Who gives life and causes death, and it is  inevitable that the manifestations of these Names occur, and thus, His Hikmah, His Wisdom was to send Adam down and his offspring in an abode, manifesting upon them that, which is entailed by His Beautiful Names: forgiving whomever He wishes, having Mercy upon whomever He wishes, lifting in honor whomever He wishes, disgracing in humiliation whomever He wishes, lifting in might whomever He wishes, and avenging from whomever He wishes, giving and taking &#8211; all in accordance with His Wisdom, Knowledge and Justice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala</em>, is al-Malik, the King, and the King, He is the One Who commands and prohibits, the One Who commands and forbids, the One Who gives reward and the One Who punishes, the One Who honors and the One Who humiliates, so His Kingship entailed that Adam and his offspring be in an abode, upon them manifested the rulings of the King; then He takes them to an Abode, perfecting what His Decrees entail. He <em>subhana wa ta&#8217;aala</em> sent them , to an abode in which their belief in the Unseen is the beneficial belief, whereas the belief in the witnessed, it is such that everyone will believe on the Day of Resurrection, when, at that time, no soul will be availed except if it believed in the Unseen. So if they were created in the Abode of Bliss, they wouldn&#8217;t have attained the rank of believing in the Unseen, and the enjoyment and the honor cannot be attained without the belief in this Unseen. As a consequence of their belief in the Unseen, they will be in the Abode of enjoyment and honor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allah <em>subhana wa ta&#8217;aala</em> created Adam from a hold: He held a Hand-full from all earth, and the earth has the good and wicked, the easy and difficult, the honorable and the wretched and the mean. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said, <span style="color:#808000;"><em>&#8216;Allah created Adam from a hold of a Hand-full from all earth, and so the children of Adam came like the earth. From them is the white and the black and the red and the yellow, and between them, and the easy and the difficult, and the wicked and the good.&#8217;</em></span> And this <em>hadith</em> is of authentic narration. So He knew <em>subhana wa ta&#8217;aala</em>, that in the loins of Adam, there are those who are not fit to be in His Abode, so He brought them down to an abode to extract from them the good and the wicked from their loins, then He distinguished them separately in two Abodes, making the good the ones deserving His Nearness in His Abode of Paradise, and as to the wicked to be the inhabitants of the Abode fitting the evil and wicked ones. That&#8217;s why Allah said, &#8216;<span style="color:#008000;"><em>In order that Allah may distinguish the wicked disbelievers from the good believers and put the wicked, one on another, heap them together and cast them into Hell; those, it is they who are the losers</em></span>.’ And when He <em>subhana wa ta&#8217;aala</em> knew that amongst his offspring, Adam&#8217;s offspring, there are those who are not fit for Allah&#8217;s Closeness and Nearness, He threw them down to an abode from which He extracted those and <em>(will) </em>send them to the abode that fits them. Perfect Wisdom and penetrating Will, and this is the <em>Taqdeer</em> of al-Aziz al-Aleem, this is the Decree of the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when He said to His angels &#8211; &#8216;<span style="color:#008000;"><em>And remember when your Lord said to the angels: &#8216;Verily I am going to place mankind, generations after generations, on earth&#8217;, they said, &#8216;Will You place therein those who will make mischief therein and shed blood, while we glorify You with praises and thanks?&#8217;, He answered them, &#8216;I know that which you don&#8217;t know</em></span>.&#8217; Then He made His Knowledge manifested to His slaves and to His angels, in that which He made, on earth, from the special of His creation and His Messengers and His Prophets and His friends, and from those who draw near(ness) to Him, exerting themselves and their lives for His Love and for His Pleasure and content, while struggling against their lusts and their desires, leaving that which is beloved to them in order to draw nearer to Him, abandoning their lusts for His Pleasure, exerting their blood and themselves in His love and praising Him day and night, worshiping Him while facing the impediments of desire and lusts, and the self and the enemy, while you, the angels, worship Me without any impediment opposing you, and without any lust overwhelming you, and without an enemy facing you; your worship of Me is just like your breath. Furthermore, I want to make manifest that which is hidden from you in relation to My enemy and his war against Me and his arrogance, taking the path against My Pleasure. This and that were hidden in the father of mankind and the father of Jinn. So He brought them both down, making manifest that Knowledge which was known only to Him <em>subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala</em>, and making manifest His Wisdom, and His Decree was perfected and executed, and then it became clear to the angels, that Knowledge which Allah kept from them and which they knew not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And since He <em>subhana wa ta&#8217;aala</em> loves the patient ones, and loves the good-doers, and those who fight in His Cause in ranks solidified, and those who turn to Him in repentance, and those who purify themselves in His Pleasure, and those who love gratitude &#8211; and His Love is the utmost of honor &#8211; then accordingly, His <em>Hikmah</em>, His Wisdom, is to put Adam and his offspring in an abode to bring forth these qualities, through which they can attain the highest of His honors from His Love. And thus, their sending down to the earth is from the greatest favors upon them. &#8216;<span style="color:#008000;"><em>But Allah choses for His Mercy whom He wills, and Allah is the Owner of great Bounty.</em></span>&#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He <em>subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala</em> wanted to have from Adam&#8217;s offspring an offspring who will receive His Help and Love and they love Him. His Love of them is their greatest objective and perfection, and this would not be manifest except by agreeing to His Pleasure and following His Command, and relinquishing the wills of the self and its desires, so He brought them down to an abode, commanding them therein and forbidding them from what He forbade them, so they carried on His Commands and kept away from His Prohibitions, attaining through that their love of Him, so He gave them His Love. And this is from His Perfect Wisdom and Perfect Mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>subhana wa ta&#8217;aala</em>, when He created His creation in states and conditions and many forms, part of His Decree is that He made Adam and his offspring excel over many of His creation; He made their &#8216;<em>ubudiyyah</em> to Him, their slavery in worship of Him, the best of their ranks. It is affirmed that Allah <em>subhana wa ta’aala</em> sent Jibril to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم , giving him the choice to choose between to be a king-Prophet, or a slave-Prophet. He looked at Jibril as if consulting him. Jibril indicated to him, &#8216;Be humble&#8217;, so he said, &#8216;Rather I choose to be a slave-Prophet.&#8217; And this hadith is reported by Ahmad and others and its chain is sahih, is correct. And Allah mentioned him, the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم , as a slave in the highest mentioning of ranks, in the rank of &#8216;Isra, of Ascension to Heaven; He called him a slave worshiper, and in the rank of da&#8217;wah and in the rank of challenges, He called him &#8216;abd, slave. In the rank of Isra&#8217;, He <em>subhana wa ta&#8217;aala</em> described him and mentioned him, &#8216;<span style="color:#008000;"><em>Glorified be He (Allah) Who took His slave, Muhammad&#8230;</em></span>&#8216; &#8211; He didn&#8217;t say, His Messenger Muhammad, He didn&#8217;t say His Prophet Muhammad &#8211; &#8216;for a journey by night from the Sacred Mosque&#8217;, the Sacred Haram, &#8216;to the farthest mosque&#8217; in Jerusalem, in al-Quds, denoting that he attained this rank of &#8216;<em>ubudiyyah</em>, of slavery to Allah, and this is at the highest and most perfect station a person can reach.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the station of da&#8217;wah, in Surah al-Jinn, <span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8216;(It has been revealed to me that) When the slave of Allah (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم )</em></span>&#8216; &#8211; He didn&#8217;t call him His Messenger, He didn&#8217;t call him His Prophet here &#8211;  &#8216;<em>stood up invoking (his Lord Allah) in prayer to Him they (the Jinns) just made round him a dense crowd as if sticking one over the other (in order to listen to the Prophet&#8217;s recitation).</em>&#8216; At this da&#8217;wah station, He called him, the slave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the station of challenge also He called him a slave, as in Surah al-Baqarah 2:23, &#8216;<span style="color:#008000;"><em>And if you (Arab pagans, Jews, and Christians) are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down (i.e. the Qur&#8217;an) to Our slave (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), then produce a Surah (chapter) of the like thereof and call your witnesses (supporters and helpers) besides Allah, if you are truthful</em></span>.&#8217; A station of challenge. And in the sahihain, al-Bukhari and Muslim, in the <em>hadith</em> of intercession and when the Prophets direct people to go to whom? To go to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم; listen to Jesus peace be upon him, to &#8216;Isa <em>&#8216;alayhi salaam</em>, saying to them, &#8216;<strong>Go to Muhammad, a slave whom Allah <em>subhana wa ta&#8217;aala</em> forgave him his past and future sins&#8217;</strong>, indicating that he صلى الله عليه وسلم attained this greatest and most perfect station, and this is the station of &#8216;<em>ubudiyyah</em> to Allah, slavery to Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if this &#8216;<em>ubudiyyah</em> to Allah has this level, then His Wisdom entailed that Allah made Adam and his offspring reside in an abode to work for this rank through their obedience to Him and through drawing nearer to Him in that which He loves and abandoning and relinquishing their familiarities, what they prefer, for His Sake, and this therefore, is from His perfect Bounty and Favor upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>subhana wa ta&#8217;aala</em> wanted His slaves, whom He bestowed upon them from His Bounty, wanted them to appreciate the Bounty so that they become more loving of Him and more perfect in their gratitude, and more in their enjoyment of what He gave them, so He <em>subhana wa ta&#8217;aala</em> made them see what He does to His enemies and what He prepared for them of punishments and all sorts of painful torments. This would not have been, without having them on earth and testing and trialing them, giving success to whom He wishes, as Mercy and Favor from Him, and humiliation to whom He wishes, entailed by His Wisdom and Justice, and He is All-knowing and All-Wise. Each of them received what they received because to him &#8211; either one &#8211; is the proper place: one receiving the Mercy and the Bounty and fitting for it, and the other not fit for that, and therefore dealt with His Justice. And there is no doubt when the believer sees his enemy and the enemy of the One he loves, and Who is most beloved to him, Allah, seeing him going through the punishments, while he is enjoying the Mercy and the Bliss of Allah, then his pleasure increases and his enjoyment intensifies. And the Favors will be perfected.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He <em>subhana wa ta&#8217;aala</em> created us &#8211; created them to worship Him, this is the objective sought: Allah says what means, &#8216;<span style="color:#008000;"><em>I have created Jinn and mankind for the sole purpose of worshiping Me Alone</em></span>,&#8217; and it is known the perfected &#8216;ubudiyyah requested from the creation would not occur in the Abode of Bliss and other living, rather it occurs in the abode of trials and tests. As to the Abode of Bliss, that&#8217;s an Abode of enjoyment and favors, it is not an Abode for testing and trials and legal checking of responsibility. So it is from the Favor of Allah upon Adam and his offspring that He made them examine and see what their enemy did to them and to their father, so they are to be prepared and take guard. And if it is said, &#8216;It would have been possible that He may not try them with their enemy&#8217;, then it is to be said, &#8216;It preceded that Allah <em>subhana wa ta’aala</em> created Adam and his offspring in a form which entails their mixing with the enemy and to be tried by him, and if He would have wished, He would have created them like the angels: intellect without desire. So in this case, the enemy would not have a way to them. But had they been created on this nature, there would have been creation other than the creation of the children of Adam. The children of Adam had been formulated on intellect and desire, and that&#8217;s why they have to face the enemy.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And since man&#8217;s happiness is in Allah&#8217;s Love, and since the true love can be attained when the beloved is given precedence and preference over everything else from the desires of the self, and since this requires hardship in obedience and to attain His Pleasure, in this way, the love really settles and its affirmation becomes known through such struggles. As such then, His <em>Hikmah</em>, His Wisdom, Allah&#8217;s Wisdom entailed bringing them to this abode which is engulfed with desires and what the self loves, in order for them to attain His Love and giving Him preference and precedence over everything else. And that&#8217;s why they can bear the difficulties and <em>(have) </em>patience against temptations and misguidance. Through that, the authority of love intensifies and its tree in the heart grows and its fruits on the limbs sprout, because the true love is the one which is affirmed despite the impediments, and the other love which is conditional upon pleasure, good health, is not affirmed when it is faced by impediments and oppositions, because the thing which is dependent upon a conditional thing, will not exist when the condition is not existing. And anyone who loves you for a certain objective, he will turn away from you when his objective is over. And there is a difference between the one who worships Allah in all of his conditions, happiness, prosperity, distress, adversity, testing and trials, from the one who worships Him only in conditions of prosperity and happiness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And since to Allah belongs all the perfect Praise, then, the manifestation of the causes which He is to <em>(be) </em>praise<em>(d)</em> for them, this is entailed by the fact that He is the Praised One, and that it is binding to His Praise. How is that? Because the causes are of two types: a bounty and a justice, and He is praised in all of that. Therefore, it is inevitable that the causes of justice be manifested so that the perfect Praise is attained, which He deserves. In the same manner, that He <em>subhana wa ta&#8217;aala</em> is praised for His Favors and Bounties and Rewards, He is praised for His Justice and Avenge and Punishment, because all of that originates from His Might and Wisdom. And that&#8217;s why He <em>subhana wa ta&#8217;aala</em> pointed to this so many times, as in Surah ash-Shu&#8217;ara, where He mentions at the end of each story from the stories of the Messengers and their nations, He mentions the following verse, in <em>(Chapter) </em>26, meaning, <span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8216;Verily! In this’</em></span> – what happened to the Messengers in their confrontation with their nations and the punishment that came to their nations when they rejected &#8211; <span style="color:#008000;"><em>‘is indeed a sign (or a proof), yet most of them are not believers. And verily, your Lord! He is truly the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.&#8217;</em> </span>So here, He tells us that this is coming from His Might, which comprises His Perfect Ability, and from His Wisdom, which comprises His Perfect Knowledge and putting things in their fitting places. So, He put His Favor and safety to His Messengers and their followers, and put His Anger and Revenge and destruction on their enemies, each in its proper place, because of His two Attributes: &#8216;Izza wa Hikmah &#8211; Might and Wisdom. And that&#8217;s why He subhana wa ta&#8217;aala, after He tells us about His Decree between the people of happiness and people of wretchedness and the destiny of each of them to their respective abodes, which do not fit except them, and which his wisdom cannot entail except that, He said, <em>(in Chapter) </em>39:75, which means, &#8216;<span style="color:#008000;"><em>And you will see the angels surrounding the Throne, exalting [Allah] with praise of their Lord. And it will be judged between them in truth, and it will be said, &#8220;[All] praise to Allah, Lord of the worlds, the Lord of all that exists</em></span>.”&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">On this one we stop, and we continue this subject <em>inshaaAllah</em> tomorrow, and this is based on Imam Ibn Qayyim&#8217;s <em>rahimahullah</em> discussions on the Wisdoms of Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;aala and His creation, and this is from his book &#8211; based upon such discussion which he had in his book, &#8216;Miftahu Daarus-Sa&#8217;aadah&#8217; – ‘The Key to the Door of Happiness’.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">We ask Allah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala to have mercy on Imam Ibn Qayyim rahimahullah and to make us from the people of the Abode of Happiness, al-Jannah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">Wa salAllahu &#8216;ala Muhammadin  wa &#8216;ala aalihi wa sahbihi wa sallam. <em>[end of part 1]</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em> </em></p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Part 2 &#8211;</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillahir-rahmanir-rahim. All praise is due to Allah, the Most High, the Originator and Creator of the heavens and the earth. He decrees what He wills, and He does what He wills. He subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala brought Adam to earth, put him and his offspring in an abode, commanding them and forbidding them, in order to bring forth from them those that He loves and they love Him. His Love of them is their utmost objective for perfection and the most of nobility they can attain, and such objectives, noble and high, cannot be achieved except in complying with what pleases Allah and following His Decrees and Commands, and abandoning the self and its lusts. His Wisdom subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala made them excel over eachother in order those upon whom He bestowed the Mercy give gratitude to Him and for them to know that they were given this favor and this honor, and were they all to be equal in the favor and safety, then no one having favor would really estimate its value and would not exert at all thanks as it should be exerted, because he would see of the others the same as his condition, all equal in favorability. But from the main causes for extracting the shukr, the gratitude, is, that those who receive Allah&#8217;s na&#8217;mah and favor, sees his condition in an opposite condition to others, not forgetting that there is nothing that Allah loves most from the slaves more than his humility and humbleness and submissiveness before His Hands subhana wa ta&#8217;aala, and poverty to Him, and this is not achievable in the abode of endless Bliss, where there is perfect Bliss and there is no accountability and no legal responsibility. The causes that will bring forth the humility and humbleness from man to Allah, for them to be in the Abode of endless Bliss, is not perceivable, because this would be mixing together two opposites. And that&#8217;s why they are here, in order to bring it forth here on earth, and to prove themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He <em>subhana wa ta&#8217;aala</em>, to Him belongs the Commandment and Creation, and the Commandment is His Legal Ways with which He sends His Messengers and brought down His Books, and the <em>Jannah</em> is not <em>Daarut-takleef</em>, an abode for legal checking of responsibility. It is an Abode of <em>Na&#8217;eem</em>, Pleasure and Bliss. So, His <em>Hikmah</em>, <em>subhana wa ta&#8217;aala</em>, His Wisdom, entails extracting Adam and his offspring to this abode here, upon them, the rulings and the decrees to be applicable, in order to manifest from them what is entailed by His Commands. Since we know that His Action <em>subhana wa ta’aala</em> is from what is entailed by His Perfect Names and Attributes, similarly, His Amr and Sharra&#8217;, His Command and His Legal Ways and what they produce from reward and punishment, all of this is from what is entailed by His Names and Attributes. And Allah directed to this meaning in many parts of His Book; listen to what He said in Surah al-Qiyaamah verse 36, <em>(which means)</em>, &#8216;<span style="color:#008000;"><em>Does man think that he will be left Suda [neglected without being punished or rewarded for the obligatory duties enjoined by his Lord (Allah) on him]?</em></span>&#8216; &#8211; functionless, without being commanded nor forbidden, nor to be punished or rewarded. And, you know, this is obviously in opposition to the perfection of Allah&#8217;s Wisdom and His <em>Ruboobiyyah</em>, His Lordship, and His Might, wa &#8216;<em>Izzati</em>. And His Wisdom does not fit to have such a neglected creation. And that&#8217;s why He <em>subhana wa ta&#8217;aala</em>, in this Statement, look at it carefully: &#8216;<em><span style="color:#008000;">Does man think that he will be left neglected?</span></em>&#8216; &#8211; this is denunciation for anyone who claims this to be the case. Similarly, when He said in Surah al-Mu&#8217;minoon 23 verse 115, <em>(which means)</em>, &#8216;<em><span style="color:#008000;">Did you think that We had created you in play (without any purpose), and that you would not be brought back to Us?</span></em>&#8216; It&#8217;s not befitting His Wisdom. Next verse: <span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8216;So Exalted be Allah, the True King, La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Lord of the Supreme Throne!&#8217;</em></span> He glorifies Himself, declared it above any imperfection in this respect, because this is in opposition to what is entailed by His Names and Attributes, <em>subhana wa ta&#8217;aala</em>. Many are the verses like this in the Qur&#8217;an.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Add to this the fact that Allah <em>subhana wa ta&#8217;aala</em> loves from His slaves many things to be done, but these cannot be done without the causes that lead to them, and then cannot be done except in this <em>Daar</em>, in this abode of tests and trials. For He <em>subhana wa ta&#8217;aala</em> loves the patient and the persevering, and He loves those who give gratitude, and He loves those who fight in His Way, and He loves those who often repent, and loves those who are pure and purify, and there is no doubt that the manifestation of these beloved things, without their causes, is not perceivable. Impossible! And Allah <em>subhana wa ta&#8217;aala</em> loves <em>taubah</em> from His slaves, and He is so pleased with it. Allah is more pleased with the repentance of His slave than a man who encamps at a place where his life is jeopardized but he has his riding animal carrying his food and water. He then rests his head and sleeps for a short while and wakes to find his riding animal gone. He starts looking for it and suffers from severe heat and thirst or what Allah wished him to suffer from. He then says, &#8216;I will go back to my place.&#8217; He returns and sleeps again and then, getting up, he raises his head to find his riding animal beside him, as in Sahih al-Bukhari, Vol 8, 320. What is meant here is that this Pleasure of Allah is in response to the <em>taubah</em> from the slave, to the repentance from the slave, and therefore repentance and sin are inter-related and they are causes which draws the Pleasure of Allah. Because it is impossible for what is entailed to occur without that which entails it. So this Pleasure is due to the <em>taubah</em>, which is related to the sin, and it is impossible for this to occur in the Abode of Bliss, because there is no sin in the Abode of Bliss. And since this Pleasure to Allah is so beloved than its non-existence, then His Love necessitated to create its causes, which would lead to it, and which are beloved to Him. And that&#8217;s why man is in this abode of trials and tests and sins and repentance, with all these causes that would lead to that which is beloved to Allah and therefore for His Pleasure.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, Allah made Paradise an Abode of Reward, and divided it into ranks, people dwelling in different ranks according to their deeds. And on this condition Allah created it, because of the Wisdom entailed by His Names and Attributes. Paradise are levels on top of levels, and between each two levels is as that which is between the heavens and the earth, as came in the <em>hadith</em> reported by al-Bukhari, from the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, <span style="color:#808000;"><em>&#8216;Paradise is 100 levels, between each two levels is that which is between the heavens and the earth (from a distance).&#8217;</em></span> And the Wisdom of Allah <em>subhana wa ta’aala</em> necessitates the habitation of these levels, and that it will be established, and differences between levels of people in these different ranks in accordance with their deeds, as therefore entailed by His Wisdom <em>subhana wa ta&#8217;aala</em>. And it is, as more than one of the Righteous Predecessors has mentioned, they are saved from the Fire of Hell by the Forgiveness and Pardoning of Allah, and they will enter Paradise by His Favor and Bounty and Forgiveness, and they will be divided into the ranks and levels and abodes within Paradise in accordance with their deeds. So the entrance and admittance to the Paradise originally is by the Bounty and Favor and Forgiveness of Allah and His Mercy, and this is what explains the <em>hadith</em> of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, &#8216;<span style="color:#808000;"><em>None of you will enter Paradise by his deeds.</em></span>&#8216; They said, &#8216;Nor even you, O Messenger of Allah?&#8217; he said, &#8216;Even me.&#8217; What he intended here صلى الله عليه وسلم, is the forbiddance to or negating the origin of admittance, and this is related to the Mercy and Bounty of Allah and His Forgiveness; and what is negated is the kind of trade, i.e. our works for <em>Jannah</em>. Because there is no comparison between man&#8217;s righteous deeds, even though they are beloved to Allah, and what Allah gives him from the Favors. Our deeds cannot stand to equate the Favors of Allah <em>subhana wa ta&#8217;aala</em> in no way. In fact, they will fall short in comparison with the least of His Favors upon us. And had it not <em>(been)</em> therefore for the Mercy of Allah upon His slaves, He wouldn&#8217;t have admitted them to Paradise. Because the deeds of man, even if they are so much, they on their own are not or do not necessitate the entrance to Paradise. What is intended therefore, is that His Wisdom, <em>subhana wa ta&#8217;aala</em>, necessitated the creation of Paradise on different levels, and to populate them with Adam and his offspring, in these levels, in accordance with their deeds, and this by itself entailed sending them to this abode of action and striving, where they are going to be different in terms of their deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He created Adam and his offspring generations after generations, as Allah spoke about this in Surah al-Baqarah, Chapter 2 verse 30, <em>(which means)</em>, &#8216;<span style="color:#008000;"><em>And (remember) when your Lord said to the angels: &#8220;Verily, I am going to place (mankind) generations after generations on earth</em></span>.&#8217; And as He <em>subhana wa ta&#8217;aala</em> said also in Surah al-An&#8217;am 165, <em>(which means)</em>, <span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8216;And it is He Who has made you generations coming after generations, replacing each other on the earth</em></span>.&#8217; And Allah said in Surah al-A&#8217;raf, Chapter 7 :129, <em>(which means)</em>, &#8216;<span style="color:#008000;"><em>It may be that your Lord will destroy your enemy and make you successors on the earth, so that He may see how you act?</em></span>&#8216; So Allah intended to remove Adam and his offspring from this succession on earth to inherit him the Abode of Bliss, and He <em>subhana wa ta&#8217;aala</em> knew  in His Foreknowledge that Adam and his offspring are weak and that they may hasten to that which is minimal and prefer it for that of the long-run in the Hereafter. Allah He knew, He created him, He knew his nature, so His Wisdom, <em>subhana wa ta&#8217;aala</em>, entailed admitting him to Paradise in the first place to recognize and to see its Bliss which he saw it really, in order what? In order what? So that he yearned to it, he longs to it and becomes more keen to return to it and becomes more intense in seeking it. Because loving something, requesting it, yearning, longing to it, is entailed by its examination, is entailed by examining it. Once it&#8217;s examined, once it is seen, then the attachment, the longing. So anyone who examines that which is good and sweet, he will be motivated intensely to attain, for when the self tastes, it longs to the thing. And that&#8217;s why, when the slave tastes the sweetness of <em>iman</em>, of faith, and it intermingles with his heart, it becomes established, and nothing will affect it. In Sahih Bukhari and Muslim, from the <em>hadith</em> of Abu Hurairah, illustrating this point, &#8216;Allah asks the angels, saying to them, &#8216;What are my slaves asking Me?&#8217; The angels respond, &#8216;They ask You Paradise.&#8217; &#8216;Did they see it?&#8217; They say, &#8216;No.&#8217; He says, &#8216;How about if they saw it?&#8217; &#8216;Had they seen it, they would be more intensely requesting it and seeking it.&#8217; So His Wisdom <em>subhana wa ta&#8217;aala</em> necessitated that He showed their father Paradise and made him dwell in it. Then He related to his offspring, his, Adam&#8217;s story therein, so they all became as if they saw it with their father. And those who had been created for it, responded and hastened to it, not looking for the early gains in this life, rather, they prepare themselves for it and looked at it that it was taken away from him by his enemy: <em>shaytan</em>. And therefore he looks at it as his first Abode, longing for it, always yearning to it, to his Abode, to his first home. And he <em>rahimahullah</em> put the following poem, illustrating this point:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>&#8216;And come for the Jannaat of bliss, </em><br />
<em>it is your first home and therein is your camps, </em><br />
<em>but we are the captives of the enemy, </em><br />
<em>so do you see we return to our homes and be saved.&#8217;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the secrets of all these angles is that Allah <em>subhana wa ta&#8217;aala</em> in His Fore-decree and in His Wisdom, is that the sought objectives cannot be attained without it&#8217;s causes, causes which Allah made them means to attain these goals, and from these goals is the highest in bliss and most magnificent in bliss, and therefore it cannot be attained except in causes which He had set leading to it. And imagine the lower objective that we encounter, if they cannot be attained except by their respective causes, though weak and disconnected many times, like gaining the food, looking for food, looking for drink, looking for clothing, looking to have children, wealth, prestige, in this life; so how it could be under your delusion that the attainment of the most highest objectives and the most noble, would be without causes leading to it, and that these causes cannot be except in this life, in this abode of striving and cultivation. So therefore, consequently, habitating Adam and his children in this land, on this earth, and creating for them the means for them to utilize, to reach that greatest objective of bliss, is from His Perfect Bounty and Favor upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Not to forget, the other secret is that He <em>subhana wa ta&#8217;aala</em> made the Message and Prophethood and love and speaking to whomever He spoke to and slavery to make from the most noble of His creation, so He put them in an abode extracting from them Prophets, sending them the Messengers, taking from them beloved to Him, speaking to Musa directly and taking from them martyrs and slaves and friends and specials who love Him and He loves them, and therefore, sending them to this abode is from the perfection of His Wisdom, from His Bounty, Favors and goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the secrets is that He manifested for His creation what is entailed by His Names, <em>subhana wa ta&#8217;aala</em>, and also He made Himself known to His creation by His Actions, His Names and His Attributes as well, and in that which He put forth amongst them from His friends and from His enemies, and gave them help against them and humiliating them, the enemies, responding to those who responded to Him, fulfilling their needs, making them turn in all sorts of good and evil, in all of this making it known to them that He is their Lord and He is their King, and that He is Allah, <em>la ilaha illa hu</em> &#8211; none has the right to be worshiped but He, and that He is the One, All-Knowing, All-Wise, All-Hearing, All-Seeing, the True God, and anything besides Him or to the exclusion of Him is <em>baatil</em>/false. And thus, the evidences for His Rububiyyah, for His Lordship, and His Tawheed on the earth is compounded and His slaves knew Him and attested to His Tawheed, and the losers rejected Him and committed shirk, unjustly and arrogantly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who, therefore, ponders His Signs witnessed on earth and His Signs heard on this earth and His Signs seen, and their effects, would come to know His perfect Wisdom in habitating Adam and his offspring in this abode for an appointed term. Because verily Allah had created <em>Jannah</em>, Paradise, for Adam and his offspring, and He made the angels therein servants for Adam and his offspring, however, His Wisdom necessitated that He created for them an abode from where they take provisions to the other One which He created for them, and that they will not attain it except with these provisions, as Allah <em>subhana wa ta&#8217;aala</em> said about this abode in Surah an-Nahl 16:7, &#8211; this is the example of moving on this earth from one place to the other, then how about the movement from this life to the Next one? &#8211; <em>(which means)</em>, &#8216;<span style="color:#008000;"><em>And they carry your loads to a land that you could not reach except with great trouble to yourselves. Truly, your Lord is full of Kindness, Most Merciful</em></span>.&#8217; So if this is applicable to moving from one place to the other in this life, that it requires some great trouble, then what about the case of moving from this life to the Abode in the Hereafter? And Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;aala said also with the same meaning in Surah al-Baqarah, <em>(which means)</em>, &#8216;<span style="color:#008000;"><em>And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is At-Taqwa (piety, righteousness, etc.). So fear Me, O men of understanding!&#8217;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the deceived ones sold their houses for the cheapest and most degradable price, and the successful ones sold themselves and their wealth and put it a price for Paradise, and so they won, and they won the great reward. Allah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala said in Surah at-Taubah 9:111, <em>(which means)</em>, &#8216;<span style="color:#008000;"><em>Verily, Allah has purchased of the believers their lives and their properties; for the price that theirs shall be the Paradise</em></span>.&#8217; Nasallaahu min fadhlih &#8211;  Nasallaahu min fadhlih.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allah did not expel Adam from it, except that He intends to return him to it in the most perfect way. It is as if, ‘O Adam, don&#8217;t be worried about My Saying to you, &#8216;Get out of it&#8217; because it is for you that I created. I am the One Free of want concerning it, Paradise, and regarding everything else, and I am the One Who is Most Generous, Most Noble, and I don&#8217;t enjoy there anything, because I am the One Who feeds, but fed not <em>(am not fed)</em>, and I am the Rich, Free from all want. Rather, come down to the abode of seeding, and if you spread the seed and the produce stands up firm and it becomes a harvest, then afterwards come, I will give you in full, return, that which you need most; one single seed for 10, to 700 folds, much more amplified reward, because I am Most Perfect in Knowledge concerning your benefit than yourself, and I am the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;aala to make us from those who plant the seeds and take care of it; we ask Him subhana wa ta&#8217;aala to amplify the reward in Paradise, in seeing His Face, inni huwa &#8216;ala kulli shayin qadeer, walhamdulillahi Rabbil &#8216;Alameen, wa la ilaha ilAllaha al-&#8216;Aliyyul-Qadeer, wa Allahumma salli &#8216;ala Muhammadin wa &#8216;ala aali wa sahbih wa sallam, and may Allah&#8217;s Mercy be upon Iman Ibn Qayyim rahimahullah, wa salAllahu &#8216;ala nabiyyina Muhammadin wa akhira da&#8217;wana alhamdulillahi Rabbil &#8216;Alameen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&#8216;Uthaymeen<br />
Sharh Usoolul-Eemaan (pp.4-7)<br />
Al-Istiqaamah magazine , Issue No.1 &#8211; Dhul-Hijjah 1416H / May 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh said in <i>Sharh Usoolul-Eemaan</i> (pp.4-7):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] <b>The deen (religion) of Islaam</b>: It is the way of life that Allaah sent the Prophet Muhammad <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> with. By it, Allaah terminated the validity of all other religions, perfected this religion for His worshippers, completed His favour upon them and has chosen only this religion for them &#8211; no other religion will be accepted by Him from anyone. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Muhammad is not the father of any man amongst you. Rather he is the Messenger of Allaah and the khaatim (last and final) of the Prophets.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:40].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islaam as your religion.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:3].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed the religion with Allaah is Islaam.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan 3:19].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Whosoever seeks a religion other than Islaam, never will it be accepted from him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan 3:85].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; obligated all of mankind to take Islaam as their religion. So Allaah said, whilst addressing His Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Say: O Mankind! Indeed I have been sent to you all as the Messenger of Allaah; to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. None has the right to be worshipped except Him; it is He who gives life and cause death. So believe in Allaah and His Messenger &#8211; the Prophet who can neither read nor write &#8211; who believes in Allaah and His Words. So follow the Messenger of Allaah so that you may be rightly-guided.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-A&#8217;raaf 7:158].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in <i>Saheeh Muslim</i> (1/93), from Abu Hurayrah <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;By Him in whose Hand is the life of Muhammad! There is no one from this nation, be he a Jew or a Christian, who hears of me and dies whilst not having eemaan (faith) in what I have been sent with, except that he will be one of the companions of the Hellfire.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <i>eemaan</i> (faith) in the Prophet implies: affirming that which he was sent with, along with acceptance of it and submission to it. Without these two matters, mere affirmation is not sufficient. This is why even though Abu Taalib (the Prophet&#8217;s uncle) affirmed what was sent to the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and that Islaam was the best of religions, yet he did not accept his message nor submit to it; and thus he did not have <i>eemaan</i> in the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] <b>The religion of Islaam</b> contains all that was beneficial from the previous religions. It is suitable for implementation in any age, any where and by any nation. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said, whilst addressing His Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And We have sent down to you the Book in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it, testifying to the truth contained therein whilst exposing the falsehood that has been added therein.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:48].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That Islaam is suitable for implementation in any age, any where and by any nation does not mean that it becomes submissive to nations &#8211; being altered and changed by them &#8211; as some people falsely think. But rather it means that whenever it is truly adhered to then it brings benefit and goodness to that nation, as well as reforming and correcting it &#8211; in whatever age or place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] <b>The religion of Islaam</b> is the religion of truth. It is the way of life that Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; guaranteed His help and victory to those who truly adhere to it, and that He would make it dominant over all other religions. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;It is He who has sent His Messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth, that it may prevail over all other religions, even if the pagans detest it.&#8221;</b> [Soorah at-Tawbah 9:33].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allaah has promised to those amongst you who truly have <i>eemaan</i> (true faith and belief) and act in obedience to Allaah and His Messenger, that He will grant them ruler ship upon the earth, just as He granted it to those before them, and that He will establish their Religion for them and grant them the authority to practice their Religion which He chose and ordered them with. And He will certainly change their situation to one of security, after their fear. Providing that they worship and obey Me, not associating anything else in worship with Me. Then, whoever rejects this favour by disobedience to their Lord &#8211; then they are the rebellious transgressors.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Noor 24:55].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] The religion of Islaam is a complete religion comprising both <i>&#8216;aqeedah</i> (beliefs) and <i>sharee&#8217;ah</i> (laws).</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>It commands them with <i>tawheed</i> (to single out Allaah alone for worship) and prohibits them from shirk (associating partners with Allaah, in that which is particular to Him).</li>
<li>It commands them with being truthful and prohibits them from lying.</li>
<li>It commands them with <i>&#8216;adl</i> (justice) and prohibits them from injustice and oppression.</li>
<li>It commands them with fulfilling trusts and prohibits them from acting treacherously.</li>
<li>It commands them keeping promises and prohibits them from breaking them.</li>
<li>It commands them with kindness and good treatment of parents and prohibits them from disobedience to them in that which is not sinful.</li>
<li>It commands them with joining the ties of relations and prohibits them from severing them.</li>
<li>It commands them with good treatment of neighbours and prohibits the causing of harm to them.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In short, Islaam orders alls that is good, from manners and morals, and prohibits all that is evil from it. Likewise, it orders all actions which are righteous and good and prohibits all actions that are evil and harmful. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed Allaah enjoins upon you justice, kindness and the giving of good to relatives and near ones. And He prohibits you from all shameful and evil deeds, oppression and transgression. Thus He admonishes you, that you may take heed and be reminded.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nahl 16:90].</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[From the &#8216;Invitation to Islam&#8217; Newsletter, Issue 5, October 1998]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A bomb goes off in a marketplace in Jerusalem. A suicide bomber launches himself into a bus full of women and children in Tel Aviv. Foreign tourists get massacred at a holiday resort in Luxor, Egypt. Villages upon villages get annihilated in Algeria. The list of events worldwide which have come to symbolise the &#8216;Islamic terror&#8217; are endless. From the times in the 70&#8217;s and 80&#8217;s when Pan Am and TWA aeroplanes would be highjacked, to the mid 80&#8217;s in war torn Lebanon where Americans and Europeans would be held as hostages for years; all such incidents have come to be identified with the religion of Islam. Such incidents from past and present have undoubtedly affected Muslims worldwide and more so in the West. Any Muslim, who wants to practice his/her religion and expresses the pious desire to live under the banner of Islam, is labelled a fundamentalist or extremist. Any Muslim man who walks down a busy street in London or Paris (and Paris moreso) with a beard and a scarf on his head, is looked upon as being a terrorist who&#8217;s probably got an AK47 stashed somewhere on his person. Muslim women who are veiled can&#8217;t go anywhere in the Western world without being taunted as being oppressed or being mad (for covering up). However, are such beliefs and opinions about Islam really justified?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Exploding the myth</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the many short comings which has arisen in the West, is judging Islam by the conduct of a minority of its people. By doing this, segments of Western society have deliberately played off the desperate actions of many Muslims, and have given it the name of Islam. Such behaviour is clearly not objective and seeks to distort the reality of Islam. For if such a thing was done Judge a religion by the conduct of its people) then we too could say that all Christianity is about is child molesting and homosexuality [1] whilst Hinduism was all about looting and breaking up mosques [2]. Generalising in such a manner is not seen as being objective, yet we find that the Western world is foremost in propagating this outlook on Islam. So what is the reality of Islam? How does one dispel the myths which have been created and spread so viciously? The only way to examine Islam is to simply examine its belief system. Look at its sources, the Qur&#8217;an and Sunna, and see what they have to say. This is the way to find the truth about what Islam says about terror, terrorism and terrorists. One who is sincerely searching for the truth, will do it no other way. The very name Islam comes from the Arabic root word &#8216;salama&#8217; which means peace. Islam is a religion which is based upon achieving peace through the submission to the will of Allaah. Thus, by this very simple linguistic definition, one can ascertain as to what the nature of this religion is. If such a religion is based on the notion of peace, then how is it that so many acts done by its adherents are contrary to peace? The answer is simple. Such actions, if not sanctioned by the religion, have no place with it. They are not Islamic and should not be thought of as Islamic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Jihad </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word jihad sends shivers down the spines of many Westerners. They readily equate this term with violence and oppression. However, it must be said that the meaning of jihad, as a &#8216;holy war&#8217;, is something which is totally foreign and not from Islam. If anything, such a description belongs more so to Christianity and its adherents. It was terms like this which were used to justify the slaughter and pillage of towns and cities during the crusades by the Christians. By simply looking into the sources of Islam, one is able to know that the true meaning of jihad is to <i>strive/make effort in the way of Allaah. </i>Thus striving in the way of Allaah can be both peaceful and physical. The Prophet Muhammed (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>&#8220;The best jihad is (by) the one who strives against his own self for Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic&#8221; [3]. </i>In the Qur&#8217;an, Allaah also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>So obey not the disbelievers, but make a great jihad </b>(effort)<b> against them </b>(by preaching)<b> with it</b> (the Qur&#8217;an)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Furqan 25:52).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By controlling and fighting against ones desires, the Muslims can then also physically exert themselves in the path of Allaah. It is this physical or combative jihad which receives so much criticism. Because of the sheer ignorance of this type of jihad Islam is regarded as terror, and Muslims are regarded as terrorists. However, the very purpose of this physical jihad is to raise the word of Allaah uppermost. By doing this, it liberates and emancipates all those who are crying out for freedom all over the world. If the likes of the pacifists of this world had their way, then the world would indeed be full of anarchy and mischief. The combative jihad seeks to correct this as Allaah says in the Qur&#8217;an:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>And if Allaah did not check one set of people by means of another, the Earth would be full of mischief. But Allaah is full of bounty to the worlds</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:251).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such would be the corruption on this Earth if there had never been a combative jihad that Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>For had it not been that Allaah checks one set of people by means of another, monasteries, churches, synagogues and mosques, wherein the name of Allaah is mentioned much, would surely have been pulled down. Indeed Allaah will help those who help His</b> (cause). <b>Truly Allaah is All strong, All mighty</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Hajj 22:40).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This combative jihad being both defensive and offensive, is something which is commanded by Allaah upon the Muslims. Through this command the oppressed and weak are rescued from the tyranny of the world:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>And what is the matter with you that you do not fight in the cause of Allaah and for those weak, ill treated and oppressed among men, women and children whose only cry is; &#8216;Our Lord, rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors and raise for us from you one who will protect and raise for us from you one who will help</b>&#8220;&#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah An-Nisa 4:75).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who knows the early history of Islam, will know that all those nations and empires which came under the fold of Islam were indeed previously oppressed. When the companions of the Prophet Muhammed (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) went out for the offensive jihad against the Egyptians, the Persians and the Romans, we find that the people did not resist against them at all. Rather, they accepted Islam on such a scale, that it is inconceivable that the jihad of Islam could be anything other then a liberation for these people; a liberation from centuries of tyranny. In fact, with the Byzantine Egyptians and the people of Spain, the Muslims were even beckoned to come and liberate these lands from the oppression of their kings. This is the glorious track record of the Muslim jihad Compare this with the brutal track record of warfare in the Western world over the centuries. From the crusades against the Muslims to the days of colonial warfare, the Western world has killed, destroyed and plundered everything which has come in its way. Even today this merciless killing goes on by the Western nations. While claiming to be about world peace and security, Western nations are ready to bomb innocent civilians at the drop of a hat. The classic example of this is the recent bombings of Sudan and Afghanistan. Whilst claiming that Sudan and Afghanistan were havens for Islamic terrorists, the bombings of these two nations could not have come at a better time for the American president Bill Clinton. The destruction of innocent lives which were a result of these bombings clearly seem to have been an attempt by Clinton to avert attention away from his sexual misdemeanours; [4] something which he so often gets caught up in. Without doubt this was the reason for such terror from the American military upon innocent people. This is the same American military which claims to enter the worlds trouble spots under the guise of being peace keepers. But</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>…</b> <b>when it is said to them; &#8216;Make not mischief on the Earth&#8217;, they say; &#8216;We are only peace makers&#8217;. Indeed they are the ones who make mischief, but they perceive it not</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:11-12)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The hypocrisy of the West is indeed astounding. </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By looking at the rules and regulations of this combative jihad it will be clear to any sincere person that this is indeed the religion of truth. When fighting an unjust enemy, no matter how unjust they are, it is forbidden by Islam that their retreating forces are mutilated, tortured or slaughtered. The treacherous violation of treaties and carrying out assassinations after a cease fire, are also prohibited. Allaah says in the Qur&#8217;an:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>And fight in the way of Allaah those who fight you. But do not transgress the limits. Truly Allaah loves not the transgressors</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:190).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Not transgressing the limits means not to kill women and children, for the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) <i>&#8220;forbade the killing of women and children</i>&#8221; [5]. Not transgressing the limits means that the elderly, the sick, monks, worshippers and hired labourers are not attacked. Not transgressing the limits means not killing animals wantonly, burning crops and vegetation, polluting waters and destroying homes, monasteries, churches and synagogues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>Allaah does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion, nor drove you out of your homes. Indeed, Allaah loves those who deal with equity</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Mumtahinah 60:8).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After reading such passages from the Qur&#8217;an and knowing about what Islam commands and prohibits in jihad, the rules of warfare are given a new meaning; a meaning of justice. How sad it is then, that whilst Islam is condemned for striking terror into the hearts of the people, the likes of the Serbs, the Indian army in Kashmir and the Israeli soldiers in Palestine are left untarnished for the atrocities they have committed in the name of warfare.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what about suicide bombing, is this too a part of jihad in Allaah&#8217;s path? From what has already been stated above, it can be deduced that this is not from the religion. However, unfortunately many Muslims have taken suicide bombing as being a virtuous act by which one receives reward. This could not be further from the truth. The Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>&#8220;Those who go to extremes are destroyed&#8221; </i>[6]. Suicide bombing is undoubtedly an extremity which has reached the ranks of the Muslims. In the rules of warfare, we find no sanction for such an act from the behaviour and words of the Prophet Muhammed (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) and his companions. Unfortunately, today (some misguided) Muslims believe that such acts are paving the way for an Islamic revival and a return to the rule of Islam&#8217;s glorious law. However, we fail to bear in mind that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>&#8220;Do not be delighted by the action of anyone, until you see how he ends up&#8221;</i> [7]. So, for example what is the end of a suicide bomber in Palestine?, a leg here, an arm there. Massive retaliation by the Israeli&#8217;s in the West Bank and Gaza. More Muslims killed and persecuted. How can we be delighted with such an end? What really hammers the final nail in the coffin of this act, is that it is suicide; something which is clearly forbidden in Islam. The Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>&#8220;He who kills himself with anything, Allaah will torment him with that in the fire of Hell&#8221; </i>[8]. Some are under the misconception that by killing oneself for an Islamic cause, one commits an act which deserves Paradise. Once when a man killed himself, the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>&#8220;He is a dweller of the Fire&#8221;. </i>When the people were surprised at this, the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>&#8220;A person performs the deeds which to the people appears to be the deeds befitting the dweller of Paradise, but he is in fact one of the dwellers of the Fire&#8221; </i>[9]. The taking of ones life which Allaah has given as a trust to the human, is a great sin. Likewise the taking of other lives (which is so often the case with suicide bombing) is also forbidden, as human life is indeed precious:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>&#8230;If anyone killed a person not in retaliation for murder or to spread mischief in the land, it would be as if he killed the whole of mankind. And (likewise) if anyone saved a life, it would be as if he saved the whole of mankind</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Maaida 5:32).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, all other types of extremities such as hostage taking, hijacking and planting bombs in public places, are clearly forbidden in Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Media</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By going through the teachings of Islam, it is clear that such a religion has only come to benefit mankind -not to destroy it. So why is there so much hatred for this noble religion in the West? The answer is simple, the media. It is the Jewish influenced media of the West which has portrayed Islam to be something that it is not. During the 70&#8217;s and 80&#8217;s when the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organisation) were carrying out daring highjacks on the worlds airways, the media in the West portrayed it as being Islamic. When the Shi&#8217;ite suicide bombers of the 80&#8217;s were causing so much havoc in the Lebanon and in the Gulf region, the media in the West portrayed it as a part of Islam. However, it is known by the heads of the media that the likes of the PLO were not an Islamic organisation, and that according to Islam, Shi&#8217;ites are outside the fold of Islam [10]. Yet such facts are never portrayed by a media which seeks to cover the truth of this religion. A number of years ago, when the Oklahoma City bomb went off, a headline in one of the newspapers, &#8216;The Today&#8217; [11], summed up this attitude. With a picture of a fire fighter holding a dead child in his arms, the headline read: <b>&#8220;In The Name of Islam&#8221; </b>Time has of course proven that this bigoted assumption was incorrect, as Timothy McVeigh, a right wing radical now faces the death penalty for the crime [12]. Likewise the bombs which went off in the Paris metro in 1995, were also blamed on Muslim fanatics. It has now emerged that the Algerian secret service who having routinely bribed many European journalists and MPs, were actually behind it. The desire to throw a veil over Islam is immense by these people:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>They intend to put out the light of Allaah with their mouths, but Allaah will complete His light even though the disbelievers hate</b> (it)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah As-Saff 61:8).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whilst trying to destroy Islam through this instrument of the media, the Jews clearly try to portray an image of themselves as being the oppressed people. Every year, we are reminded as to how many Jews perished under the Nazis in World War II. We are made to feel sorry for these same people who have gone on to commit so many crimes upon the Palestinian people. Some may say that this is a racist and biased viewpoint. But we say; If this media was not run and orchestrated by the Jews and was truly neutral, then why are Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir, two former Israeli prime ministers, not held aloft as being terrorists? Anyone who knows about the history of the Palestinian occupation will tell you that these two men were members of the Stem Gang and Irgun, two notorious Jewish terror groups who killed many innocent people [13]. If this media was truly impartial, then why does it not tell about the extent of the Israeli bombardment and illegal occupation of Southern Lebanon and its people? [14] And if this media really had nothing against the religion of Allaah, then why does it not inform the people that every day hundreds are entering the religion of Islam? Such things will never be highlighted in the Western media, simply because to do so would be against their very interests.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With such immense pressure against it, it is indeed a blessing from Allaah that Islam goes from strength to strength. It continues to grow faster then any other religion in the Western world, conquering the hearts and minds of thousands. All this should not even surprise us though, for Allaah has promised us that this religion will prevail:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>It is He who has sent His Messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth, so that He may make it victorious over all other religions, even though the disbelievers detest it</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah As-Saff 61:9).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a must that humanity comes towards the religion of Islam. Without it, we will continue to slip down the road of inequity and darkness. With it we can establish a society of justice and peace. Religion of terror? &#8230; no. The way forward? &#8230; yes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>There is no compulsion in religion. The right path has indeed become distinct from the wrong. So whoever rejects false worship and believes in Allaah, then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that will never break. And Allaah is All Hearing, All Knowing</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:256)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Footnotes</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1 </b>By using the many cases of child abuse and homosexuality by priests, Such a generalisation about Christianity could be made<br />
<b>2 </b>By using the incident of the destruction of the Babri mosque in Ayodya, India in December 1992 by Hindu zealots, such generalisations could be made about Hinduism<br />
<b>3 </b>Authentic &#8211; Reported by At-Tabaranee<br />
<b>4 </b>Years of sexual liaison with a White House aide, Monica Lewinski, has been proved against Mr Clinton. Since this time, a number of other women have also claimed that they have had affairs with the president. And this is the same man who propagates family values and to whom millions look up to!<br />

<b>10 </b>The beliefs which are contained in the books of the Shi&#8217;ites places them outside of the fold of Islam generally. However, upon the individual Shi&#8217;ite, the proofs need to be established before one can say that helshe is a disbeliever<br />
<b>11 </b>This newspaper no longer exists<br />
<b>12 </b>It is strange indeed that whilst the Western media criticises Islamic law for being barbaric and harsh, not a word is said about the fact that McVeigh too will be executed just as someone would in an Islamic state<br />

Amma ba&#8217;d</p>
<p><strong>Delving into the Sciences of the World to prove Islaam </strong></p>
<p><strong>Excerpts</strong> from Shaikh &#8216;Ubaid al-Jabiree (hafidhahullaah):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was not known at the times of the Salaf, nor was it known by the Companions of the Prophet Muhammad sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, or the imams of the Tabi&#8217;een (the Successors) or those who followed after them. This idea of researching the sciences behind the creation didn&#8217;t appear until about thirty years or so ago&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This idea of proving Islam through the Sciences is a bid&#8217;ah (an innovation). This type of study keeps us away from learning the true religion. My sincere advice to you my sister in Egypt, and other sisters of the Sunnah in Egypt, is that you shouldn&#8217;t listen to this and must not busy yourselves with this knowledge but rather you should focus on the knowledge of the Sharee&#8217;ah which is the knowledge of the Qur`aan and the Sunnah upon the understanding of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sunnah is a way of happiness and tranquillity in this life because the Prophet sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said: Whoever Allaah wants good for, He gives him understanding of the religion. So from this, we understand that whoever Allaah does not want good for, He does not give him understanding of the religion.</p>

by  Shaikh Saalih Al-Fawzaan<br />
Tanbeehaat ‘alaa Ahkaam takhtassu bil-Mu’minaat (pg. 6-11)<br />
Al-Ibaanah (dot) com (the website is down now, baarak Allaahu feekum)</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Status of the Woman before Islaam:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is meant “before Islaam” here is the period known as Jaahiliyyah (Days of Ignorance), which the Arabs used to live in specifically and the people of the whole world in general. This was when the people did not have any Messengers amongst them and they were void of any guidance. And as is stated in the hadeeth, <strong>“Allaah looked at them – both Arabs and Non-Arabs – and hated them, except for some remnants from the People of the Book (who stayed upon the true message).” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In most cases, the woman of this time period lived under critical conditions – especially those in the Arab societies, where they used to hate it when a girl was born. So amongst the Arabs were those who would bury their daughter while she was still alive until she died below the earth. And amongst them were those who let them live only to find a life of humiliation and degradation. Allaah says: <strong>“And when news of the birth of a female child was brought to any of them, his face would become dark and filled with grief. He hides himself from the people because of the evil that he has been informed of. Shall he keep her with dishonor or bury her in the earth? Certainly, evil is their decision.”</strong> [Surah An-Nahl: 58-59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says: <strong>“And when the female child who was buried in the ground will be questioned – for what sin was she killed?” </strong>[Surah At-Takweer: 8-9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word <strong><em>maw’oodah</em></strong> refers to the baby girl that was buried alive and left to die inside the earth. And if she was spared from being buried alive and allowed to live, then indeed she found herself living a life of degradation. This is since she was not allowed to inherit any portion of her relative’s estate no matter how much money he had and regardless of if she was suffering from poverty and dire need. The reason for this is because they would make the inheritance specific for men in exclusion of women. In fact, she would be distributed as part of her deceased husband’s estate, just as his money would be distributed in inheritance!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there would be found a score of women living under one man, since they would not put any limits to the number of wives they could marry. So they wouldn’t show any concern for what occurred to the women as a result of that, such as living under cramped conditions, inconveniences and injustice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Status of the Woman after Islaam: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But when Islaam came, it uplifted these injustices from the woman and returned her honor and self-esteem in humanity back to her. Allaah says: <strong>“O mankind, indeed We created you from a male and a female.” </strong>[Surah Al-Hujuraat: 13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah mentions that she is the partner of man in the origin of humanity and likewise, she is partners with man in terms of being rewarded or punished for actions performed. Allaah says:<strong>“Whoever does good deeds, &#8211; whether male or female – while he or she is a true believer, to him We will give a good life and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do.”</strong> [Surah An-Nahl: 97]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says: <strong>“So that Allaah may punish the male and female hypocrites and the male and female polytheists.”</strong> [Surah Al-Ahzaab: 73]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah made it forbidden to consider a woman as a possession to be inherited from her dead husband’s estate, as He says: <strong>“O you who believe, you are forbidden to inherit women against their will.”</strong> [Surah An-Nisaa: 19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah gave her independence in her individuality, such that she became one who can inherit as opposed to an object of inheritance. And Allaah gave the woman a right in the inheritance of her relative’s wealth. Allaah says: <strong>“There is a share for men and a share for women from what is left by their parents and close relatives, whether the property be small or large – a legal share.”</strong> [Surah An-Nisaa: 7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says: <strong>“Allaah commands you as regards your children’s inheritance: to the male a portion equal to that of two females. If there are only daughters, two or more, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance; if only one, her share is a half.”</strong> [Surah An-Nisaa: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this goes as well for the other texts that state a woman can inherit whether she be a mother, a daughter, a sister or a wife.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the area of marital affairs, Allaah limited a husband to marrying the maximum of four wives, on the condition that he treats all of his wives fairly and equally according to his ability. And He obligated to the husbands to live with them in kindness, as He says: <strong>“And live with them honorably.”</strong> [Surah An-Nisaa: 19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He made the dowry her right and He commanded that it be given to her in full except for that which she permits from her own good will. Allaah says: <strong>“And give to the women their dowry with a good heart. But if they, out of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it to you, take it and enjoy it without any fear of harm.”</strong> [Surah An-Nisaa: 4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah made her the caretaker, commanding good and forbidding evil in the household of her husband – and the leader over her children. The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: <strong>“A woman is the guardian of her husband’s household and she will be asked (on the Day of Judgement) concerning those under her care.”</strong> Also, Allaah made it obligatory for the husband to spend on her and to clothe her in a good manner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>What the Enemies of Islaam and their Offshoots want today from their stripping the Woman of her Honor and rights: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the enemies of Islaam – rather the enemies of humanity – today, from the disbelievers, hypocrites and those who have a disease in their hearts are enraged about what the Muslim woman has achieved from honor, glory and chastity in Islaam. This is because the enemies of Islaam from the disbelievers, hypocrites and those who have a disease in their hearts – they want from the woman that she serve as a trap by which they can lure and catch those with weak Eemaan and those who have perverted natures, after having fulfilled their depraved desires from her. Allaah says: <strong>“But those who follow their lusts wish that you should deviate tremendously away.”</strong> [Surah An-Nisaa: 27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And those who have a disease in their hearts among the Muslims want the woman to be a cheap commodity exhibiting herself to those people of lustful desires and devilish inclinations. They want her to serve as an open commodity before their eyes so that they may find entertainment in her beautiful appearance or perhaps they may make her do something far worse than that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why they expend great efforts in trying to make the woman go out of her home so that she can participate with men in their jobs – working side by side with them. Or that she can serve and tend to men as a nurse in the hospital or a flight attendant on an airplane or a teacher or professor in mixed non-segregated schools Or that she be an actress in the theatres or a singer or a broadcaster on the various forms of media – exposing her face and enticing men by her voice and appearance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the immoral magazines have taken pictures of young girls that are looking provocative and naked as a means for promoting and marketing their magazines. And some businessmen and companies have taken these pictures also as a means for promoting their product, such that they place these pictures in their advertisements and exhibits.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These evil actions are meant to distract the woman from her real and true duty, which is in the home. And this forces the husbands to hire female servants to raise their children and take care of the affairs of their households, which results in much mischief and great evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, we don’t restrict a woman from working outside of her home, so long as she abides by the following guidelines:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. She must have a need for doing this work or the community she lives in requires her to do this job, such that there cannot be found any man that can do the job.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. She should do this after fulfilling the job she has at home, which is her primary job.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. This job must be in an environment of women only, such as her teaching women (only) or doctoring and nursing female patients. And her work must be separate from men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Likewise, there is nothing that restricts her from learning the affairs of her Religion – in fact she is obligated to do this. And there is nothing preventing her from teaching about the aspects of her Religion, so long as there is a need for that and her teaching is held in an environment of (only) women. And there is no harm in her attending classes in a masjid and so on, while being consistent in that and segregated from men. This can be seen from the women in the beginning of Islaam (i.e. the Sahaabiyaat), in that they would work and study and attend the masaajid.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q: What is the wisdom behind prohibiting the flesh of swine?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Allah&#8217;s knowledge encompasses all things and His mercy, wisdom and justice embrace all things. Allah (Glorified be He) knows best what benefits His servants. He shows them mercy. He conducts all His affairs with wisdom. He commands His servants to do what brings felicity to them in this life and the life to come. He makes lawful all good things which benefit them and makes unlawful to them all harmful things.</p>
<p>Allah has declared the flesh of swine as prohibited and stated that its flesh is impure.</p>
<p>Allah (Exalted be He) states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Say (O Muhammad peace be upon him): “I find not in that which has been revealed to me anything forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it, unless it be Maitah (a dead animal) or blood poured forth (by slaughtering or the like), or <span style="color:#ff0000;">the flesh of swine (pork)</span>; for that surely is impure or impious (unlawful) meat (of an animal) which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allâh (or has been slaughtered for idols, or on which Allâh’s Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Allah (Exalted be He) also states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and prohibits them as unlawful Al-Khabâ’ith (i.e. all evil and unlawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Factual evidence has proved that pigs feed on dirt and impure things which they eat avariciously.</li>
<li>Medical experts state that worms are formed in the abdomen of eaters of the flesh of swine.</li>
<li>It also weakens the human sense of honor and destroys chastity.</li>
<li>Other harmful effects include indigestion and the inability to secrete digestive juices.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If their findings are proven true, then the flesh of swine is as an evil and impure substance. But if their findings are proven false, one of sound mind must still trust in Allah&#8217;s statement in the Qur&#8217;an which judges swine as impure. One must also believe in the prohibition of eating its flesh and submit entirely to Allah&#8217;s judgment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>It is Allah (Glorified be He) Who created it and He alone knows best its inherent harms. Does He know not that which He created while He is the Subtle, the All-Aware?</strong></p>
<p>May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Q: It is said: <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>why does Islam not prohibit slavery?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Allah (Exalted be He) has the perfect knowledge, wisdom, kindness and mercy. He is All-Knowing with the matters of His creation, Compassionate with His servants and Wise in His creation and legislation. Therefore, He legislated for people that which makes them good in the world and in the Hereafter and that which will guarantee their real happiness, freedom and equality in fair circumstances, comprehensive guidance and within limits that do not transgress the rights of Allah and that of His servants. He sent this legislation with His Messengers as announcers of glad tidings and warners. So he who follows His path and follows the guidance of His Messengers, deserves dignity and attains success and bliss. Whoever refuses to follow the straight path, he deserves to be killed or enslaved in order to establish justice, maintain security and peace and safeguard lives, honor and properties.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For these mentioned causes, Jihad (striving for the cause of Allah) was legislated to deter the oppressors and eliminate the corruptors and clean the earth from the wrongdoers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever among them is captured by Muslims, the ruler has the choice either to kill him if his evil is eminent and he will not be corrected, or forgive him and accept a ransom from him if he can be deterred by that or lead him to goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ruler may take him as a slave if he believes that holding him among Muslims will correct him, rectify him and cause him to find the way to guidance, believe in and submit to it due to what he can see of Muslims&#8217; justice, their kindness and good treatment. He may also listen to the texts of legislation and morals. Accordingly, his heart may be opened to Islam, Allah will make faith dear to him and make disbelief, transgression and disobedience unpleasant to him. Then, he will start a new life with Muslims to gain his freedom by an agreement of freedom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And let those who find not the financial means for marriage keep themselves chaste, until Allâh enriches them of His Bounty. And such of your slaves as seek a writing (of emancipation), give them such writing, if you find that there is good and honesty in them. And give them something (yourselves) out of the wealth of Allâh which He has bestowed upon you.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Noble Qur&#8217;an 24:33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">This also may be achieved through the expiation for false oath, Zhihar (a man likening his wife to an unmarriageable relative), vow or the like. It also may be achieved through the way of emancipation for the sake of Allah, seeking His reward and other kinds of emancipation. Therefore, it will be known that the origin of slavery is the capturing in Jihad against the disbelievers to correct those who were captured by isolating them from the evil environment they lived in and starting a new life in a Muslim community to guide them to the path of goodness, save them from evil, purify them from the effects of disbelief and error and make them deservea better life in which they enjoy security and peace.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Slavery in Islam is like a purifying machine or sauna in which those who are captured enter to wash off their dirt and then they come out clean, pure and safe from another door.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Jesus and  Muhammad (peace be upon them) in the BIBLE and the QUR&#8217;AN</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Biblical evidence of Jesus being a servant of God and having no share in Divinity</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">by Dr. M. Taqi-ud-Din al-Hilali, Ph.D.<br />
Professor of Islamic Faith and Teachings, Islamic University, Al-Madina</p>
<hr width="100%" />
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to the One to Whom all Dignity, Honour and Glory are due; the Unique with perfect attributes, Who begets not, nor is He begotten. He has no equal but He is the Almighty, Omnipotent. He sent His Messengers and Prophets to guide humanity towards monotheism; to worship Him Alone, the only One Worthy of worship, and to warn them of the eternal dire consequences of polytheism; associating partners with One Allah and the worship of creatures.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon all the Prophets and Messengers, especially on Muhammad, the last of the Prophets, and on all who follow him in righteousness until the Day of Recompense.</p>
<p><strong>CHRISTIANITY: MEN WITHOUT RELIGION </strong></p>
<p><strong>ISLAM: RELIGION WITHOUT MEN</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Muslim never lacks proofs about the purity and truthfulness of his religion, but what he lacks are those truthful brothers who stand for Allah and His Prophet <tt>SAW</tt> testifying to the truth. Indeed, in this age, Islam is a religion without men (custodians and propagators) whereas Christianity is men without a religion; yet, by their endeavour, adventurous spirit, patience and monetary contributions they are able to falsify truth and make falsehood appear true. In this materialistic age most of humanity have become slaves to wealth, fashions, and mansions.</p>
<p>There is none worthy of worship but Allah and in Him (Alone) do I put my trust, and towards Him am I destined.</p>
<p><strong>JESUS AND THE DEVIL IN THE BIBLE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the New Testament of the Bible, in the fourth chapter of the Gospel according to Matthew, the sixth and seventh verses clearly indicate that Jesus is an obedient mortal and God is the Master and Lord according to his saying in the seventh verse:</p>
<p>&#8220;It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord, thy God.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this chapter we read that the Devil actually carried the Messiah, and took him from place to place. How can the Devil carry God? Glory be to Allah; He is above such blasphemy!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Devil orders him to prostrate before him and worship him, even tempting him with worldly possessions. How can the Devil even dare such an audacity with God? When the Devil wanted Jesus to comply with his orders, he (Jesus) replied by saying that it was written (in the previous Books):</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou shalt worship the Lord, thy God; And Him only shalt thou serve.&#8221; Matthew 4:10.</p>
<p><strong>CHILDREN OF GOD</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jesus never called himself <em>Son of God</em> as far as I know but he used to call himself the &#8216;Son of Man&#8217; (ref. Mark 2:10) although he heard himself being called by that name he did not object as assumed in the Bible and did not consider the title exclusively for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to the Biblical term in the Old and New Testaments, every God- fearing righteous person is called &#8216;Son of God&#8217;. In Matthew 5:9 we read:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Blessed are the peace-makers, for they shall be called the children of God.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Matthew 5:45 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;That ye may be children of your Father which is in heaven&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>GOD THE FATHER</strong></p>
<p>In Matthew 5:48 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Matthew 6:1 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.&#8221;</p>
<p>Matthew 7:21 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not every one that sayeth unto me (Jesus), Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven: but he that doeth the will of my Father, which is in heaven.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>N.B. </strong>The word &#8216;Lord&#8217; here was translated as <em>Rabb</em> in the Arabic version of the Bible so that people may be convinced that Jesus is God! But if one studies the rest of the verse, one will note that the verse bears testimony to the subservience (to God&#8217;s Will) of the Messiah (Jesus). Therefore the correct translation should be:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Not every one that sayeth to me, O my Master, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obvious from the above readings from the Bible that the term &#8216;Father&#8217; is used for God in numerous places in the Bible. It is never used exclusively for the Messiah (Jesus).</p>
<p>Matthew 11:25 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;At that time Jesus answered and said, &#8216;I thank Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes.'&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>JESUS THE WORSHIPPER </strong></p>
<p>Matthew 14:23 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray&#8230;..&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: If he (Jesus) is God or a part of God then why did he pray? In fact, prayer is always from a submitting, needy and dependent one for the Mercy of Almighty Allah as mentioned in the Qur&#8217;ân. (V. 35:15):-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O mankind! it is you who stand in need of Allah but Allah is Rich (Free of all wants and needs), Worthy of all praise&#8221; (35:15).</p>
<p>And in (V. 19:93) of Qur&#8217;ân:-</p>
<p>&#8220;There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto the Most Beneficent (Allah) as a slave.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>A BIBLICAL STORY </strong></p>
<p>Matthew 15:22-28 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts and cried unto him, saying, &#8216;Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David: my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.&#8217; But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying; &#8216;Send her away, for she crieth after us.&#8217; But he answered and said, &#8216;I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then came she and worshipped him, saying, &#8216;Lord, help me.&#8217; But he answered and said, &#8216;It is not meet to take the children&#8217;s bread and to cast it to dogs.&#8217;</p>
<p>And she said, &#8216;Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters&#8217; table.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Jesus answered and said unto her, &#8216;O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<p>In this story about a woman from Canaan there are noteworthy points:</p>
<p>(1) Lack of mercy and love charged against Jesus (if the incident is reported correctly).</p>
<p>(2) Degraded discrimination in regard to the uplifting of his tribe and not for the others.</p>
<p>(3) Tribal pride of descendance and prejudice against others and calling them dogs.</p>
<p>(4) An ignorant polytheist woman debated with him and won him over.</p>
<p><strong>JESUS: A PROPHET OF ALLAH.</strong></p>
<p>Matthew 19:16-17 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And behold, one came and said unto him, &#8216;Good master, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?&#8217; And he said unto him, &#8216;Why callest thou me good? (There is) none good but one, (i.e.) God, but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<p>In the above verses we note this acknowledgment of his submissiveness (to Allah&#8217;s Will).</p>
<p>Matthew 21:45-46 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And when the chief priests and pharisees had heard his parable, they perceived that he spoke of them. But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude because they took him for a Prophet.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here it is proved that all those who believed in Jesus during his life-time did not believe in him being God or the Son of God or one in the doctrine of Trinity; but they believed in him as being a Prophet only. This is indeed one of the strongest points of evidence against those who believe in the Divinity of Jesus (Incarnation of God) if only they pondered.</p>
<p><strong>JESUS: A SERVANT OF ALLAH.</strong></p>
<p>Matthew 23:8 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8216;But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your master, even Jesus, and all ye are brethern.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here it is clearly proved that Jesus was servant of Allah, and that there is only One Master and He is Allah. In the Arabic version of the Bible this verse has been translated so that Jesus is meant to be the master whereas the English rendering is nearer the original sense.</p>
<p>Matthew 23:9 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father which is in heaven.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this you will note that fatherhood and sonship is meant to be the relationship between the Lord and His servants: it is meant in a general sense and not specifically for Jesus.</p>
<p>Matthew 24:36 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a definite proof that the Final Hour is unknown to any but Allah, thus Jesus&#8217; knowledge is imperfect like all other men; Allah Alone is All-Knowing, Omniscient.</p>
<p>Matthew 26:39 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And he (Jesus) went a little farther, and fell on his face and prayed, saying, &#8216;O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We note here that the person speaking is unaware of Allah&#8217;s Will and realizes the fact that he is a servant of Allah. He (Allah) Alone can cause the change.</p>
<p><strong>THE COMPILATION OF THE BIBLE</strong></p>
<p>Matthew 27:7-8 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And they took counsel and bought with them the potter&#8217;s field to bury strangers in. Wherefore that field was called the Field of Blood, unto this day.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From these verses we understand that the Bible (the New Testament) was not written during Jesus&#8217; life-time but long after the occurrence of the events described, having been retained in the memory of the people.</p>
<p>Matthew 27:46 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, &#8216;Eli,Eli, lama sabachthani? (My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me?&#8217;)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is according to their (Christians&#8217;) assumption that Jesus cried in a loud voice saying the above words while he was being crucified. This is a great insult as such words could only come from unbelievers in Allah. Further, it is incredible that such words should come out from a Prophet of Allah because Allah never breaks His Promise and His Prophets never complained against His Promise.</p>
<p><strong>JESUS: PREACHER OF MONOTHEISM (<em><strong>TAUHID</strong></em></strong><strong>)</strong></p>
<p>In John 17:3 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And this is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Mark 12:28-30 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, &#8216;Which is the first commandment of all?&#8217; And Jesus answered him: &#8216;The first of all the commandments is; hear O Israel, the Lord thy God is One Lord: and thou shalt love the Lord, thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<p>In Mark 12:32 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And the scribe said unto him, &#8216;Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is One God; and there is none other but He.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<p>In Mark 12:34 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;he (Jesus) said unto him, &#8216;Thou art not far from the kingdom of God&#8230;&#8217; &#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In these verses, Jesus (peace be upon him) himself had testified that Allah is the One God, there is none other than Him, and that whoever believes in His Oneness, he is near the Kingdom of Allah. Therefore whoever associates partners with Allah or believes in the Trinity is far away from the Kingdom of Allah, and whoever is far away from the Kingdom of Allah he is the enemy of Allah.</p>
<p>In Matthew 24:36 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of the heaven, but my Father only.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: A similar text was quoted from S.Matthew which is exactly as proclaimed by the Qur&#8217;ân in that none knows when the Hour will come except Allah. This establishes the fact that Jesus was subservient to Allah and that he had no share in Divinity: that he was an incarnation of God, was an innovation by the people of Canaan.</p>
<p>In John 20:16 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Jesus said unto her, &#8216;Mary&#8217;. She turned herself, and sayeth unto him, &#8216;Rabboni&#8217;, which is to say, Master, Jesus saith unto her, &#8216;Touch me not: For I am not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father; and to my God and your God.&#8217; Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she has seen the Lord, and that He had spoken these things unto her.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the above narrative Jesus clearly testified that Allah is his God and their God, making no difference between him and them in the worship of the One Allah. Whoever believes that Jesus is God has indeed blasphemed against Allah and betrayed the Messiah (Jesus) and all the Prophets and Messengers of Allah.</p>

<p><strong>BIBLICAL PROPHECY ON THE ADVENT OF MUHAMMAD (peace be upon him)</strong>John 14:15-16 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If you love me, keep my commandments. And I will pray the Father and He shall give you another Comforter that he may abide with you forever.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim theologians have said that &#8220;another Comforter&#8221; is Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah; and him to &#8220;abide forever&#8221; means the perpetuity of his laws and way of life (<em>Sharia&#8217;</em>) and the Book (Qur&#8217;ân) which was revaled to him.</p>
<p>John 15:26-27 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me: And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.&#8221;</p>
<p>John 16:5-8 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;But now I go my way to Him that sent me and none of you asketh me &#8216;Whither goest thou?&#8217; But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart. Nevertheless I tell you the truth; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and approve righteousness and judgment.&#8221;</p>
<p>John 16:12-14 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I have yet many things to say unto you, but you cannot bear them now. How be it when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak; and he will shew you things to come. He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and he shall shew it unto you.&#8221;</p>
<p>John 16:16 &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;A little while and ye shall not see me: and again a little while, ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim theologians have stated that the person who is described by Jesus to come after him in the above verses does not comply with any other person but Muhammad (peace be upon him) the Messenger of Allah. This &#8216;person&#8217; whom Jesus prophesied will come after him is called in the Bible &#8216;Parqaleeta&#8217; This word was deleted by later interpreters and translators and changed at times to &#8216;Spirit of Truth&#8217;, and at other times, to &#8216;Comforter&#8217; and sometimes to &#8216;Holy Spirit&#8217;. The original word is Greek and its meaning is &#8216;one whom people praise exceedingly.&#8217; The sense of the word is applicable to the word &#8216;Muhammad&#8217; (in Arabic).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>FINALITY ON PROOFS ON THE FABRICATION </strong><strong>OF THE STORY OF THE CROSS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) The Bible testifies to the fact that Jesus was known among the Jews; he used to preach and deliver sermons in the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem. It was therefore, unnecessary to hire a Jew for thirty pieces of silver to direct them to him as related in S. Matthew.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) It is related that one of the twelve disciples named Judas Iscariot was hired to direct the Jews to Jesus. They then sentenced him after which Judas was greatly ashamed and dissociated himself from their act and then committed suicide. All this took place within twenty four hours. The contradictions are obvious.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) The clearest proof which alone is sufficient to discredit this story is when the Jews passed the sentence of death against Jesus and intended to get the approval of the governor, Pontious Pilate.</p>
<p>Matthew 27:11-14 &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And Jesus stood before the governor: The governor asked him, saying, &#8216;Art thou the king of the Jews!&#8217; And Jesus said unto him, &#8216;Thou sayeth (sayest)&#8217;: And when he was accused of (by) the chief priests and elders. He answered nothing. Then said Pilate unto him, &#8216;Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?&#8217; And he answered him never (to) a word&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Christians will interpret the above verse to mean that Jesus wanted to die on the Cross for the redemption of mankind and for the forgiveness of their sins: if so, then why did he ask to turn away that cup from him (i.e. death)? Why did he cry out while on the Cross (as they assume): &#8220;O Lord, why hast thou forsaken me?&#8221; How could he have remained silent when the truth was being challenged? He was known for his soul-inspiring sermons challenging the learned Jewish <em>Rabbis.</em> No sane person can believe in this. If the story of the Cross is disproved then the very foundation on which Christianity is based, will be demolished.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslims believe that Jesus was not crucified by the Jews as revealed in the Holy Qur&#8217;ân by Allah in a crystal clear manner: V. 4:157,158.-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And because of their saying (in boast): &#8216;We killed Messiah Jesus, son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah&#8217;; &#8211; but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but the resemblance of Jesus was put over another man (and they killed that man), and those who differ therein are full of doubts. They have no (certain) knowledge, they follow nothing but conjecture. For surely, they killed him not (i.e., Jesus, son of Mary). But Allah raised him (Jesus) up (with his body and soul) unto Himself (and he <tt>alai-hiss-salaam</tt> is in the heavens).. And Allah is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jews themselves, together with the entire Christian world, believe that he was crucified. As proofs against their views and to prove the truth of the Muslim verdict through the Bible, I prepared the following set of questions based on the Book of S. Matthew in the New Testament of Bible. (Chapters 26 and 27):</p>
<p>(1) Did those who captured Jesus (according to their assumption) know him in person? or did they not know him?</p>
<p>S. Matthew testifies that they did not know him.</p>
<p>(2) Was it during the day or night that he was captured?</p>
<p>S.Matthew says it was during the night.</p>
<p>(3) Who was the one that directed them to him?</p>
<p>S. Matthew says: He was one of his twelve disciples called Judas lscariot.</p>
<p>(4) Did he direct them free of charge or for a fixed reward which they specified, for him?</p>
<p>S. Matthew says: He directed them to him for a fixed reward of thirty pieces of silver.</p>
<p>(5) What was the condition of Jesus during that night?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">S. Matthew says: He was fearful and prostrated in prayer saying: &#8220;O God, if it is possible for You to let this cup pass from me, then let it pass.&#8221; It is incredible that such words could come from a believer in God, let alone a Prophet of God, because all believers believe that God has power over all things.</p>
<p>(6) What was the condition of his eleven disciples?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">S. Matthew says: Sleep overcame them that night together with their teacher (according to their assumption) out of fear.</p>
<p>(7) Was Jesus contented with their condition?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">S. Matthew says (verses 40-46): He was not satisfied. He used to come to them to wake them up saying: &#8220;Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak.&#8221; Then he would come again to find them asleep and he would again wake them up and say the same thing. This weakness could not have been spoken of righteous pupils even if they were pupils of an ordinary pious teacher, let alone the disciples of Jesus, son of Mary.</p>
<p>(8) Did they help him when those ruffians captured him?</p>
<p>S. Matthew says: They forsook him and fled.</p>
<p>(9) Did Jesus have confidence in his disciples that night?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">S. Matthew says: Jesus informed them that they will all forsake him. Then Jesus said unto them: &#8220;Verily I say unto thee that this night before the cock crows, thou shall deny me thrice.&#8221; Peter said unto him, &#8220;Although I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee.&#8221; Likewise also said all the disciples. And so it happened.</p>
<p>(10) How did those ruffians capture him?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">S. Matthew says: They came to him with swords and staves after they were directed to him by a Jew, then they captured him as described in verse 57:</p>
<p>&#8220;And they that had laid hold on Jesus, led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the elders were assembled.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There they passed the sentence of death on him. The ruffians then took him away, spat on his face and struck him with their hands after which they stripped him of his clothes and clad him in scarlet robes, then placed a crown of thorns on his head and took him about, teasing and mocking him. They said to him: &#8216;You are the king of Israel according to your claim.&#8217; They severely degraded him.</p>
<p>(11) Who finally decided to pass the death sentence against him?</p>
<p>S. Matthew says: He was Pontious Pilate, a Greek Roman, who was at that time the governor of Palestine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(12) When the ruffians brought that man before the governor and informed him that the priest of the Jews passed the sentence of death by crucifixion according to their law (Torah), did he believe in them without investigation?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">S. Matthew says: He did not believe them but asked that man: &#8220;Is it true what they have said?&#8221; He remained silent. The question was repeated and he continued to remain silent. He remained silent in view of the truth; it was essential for him even if he was not a Prophet to clarify the truth and deny the false accusation of the Jews. The governor&#8217;s wife went to the governor and she said to him: &#8220;Have thou nothing to do with that just man? for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Bible states that Jesus delivered lengthy speeches to the Jews rebuking and warning them which amounted to defaming them. Then why was he silent that day? The governor&#8217;s intention for asking him was to stand for the truth.</p>
<p>(13) How was he crucified according to their assumption?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">S. Matthew says: They crucified him between two thieves both of whom abused him by saying to him, &#8220;If you are truthful then save yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>(14) This was a great calamity. What did he say while on the cross (according to their assumption)?</p>
<p>S. Matthew says (27:46):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, &#8220;Eli, Eli, Iama sabachthani? (that is to say,) my God, my God, why has Thou forsaken me?&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a blatant declaration of disbelief according to all theological authorities. Whoever relates it to a Prophet is a disbeliever according to the revealed religions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Almighty Allah, in the Qur&#8217;ân warns, the Jews and the Christians against their blasphemy; that Jesus is an incarnation of God (Allah) or the son of God (Allah) or in rejecting him totally; and that they must believe in him as a Messenger of Allah only:</p>
<p>&#8220;And there is none of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), but must believe in him (Jesus, son of Mary, as only a Messenger of Allah and a human being), before his (Jesus <tt>alai-hiss-salaam </tt> or a Jew&#8217;s or a Christian&#8217;s) death (at the time of the appearance of the angel of death). And on the Day of Resurrection, he (Jesus) will be a witness against them.&#8221; (V.4:159).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Why Allah sent Prophets and Messengers ?</strong></span><br />
Source:  Appendix II from  &#8216;Interpretations and Meanings of the Noble Qu&#8217;ran&#8217;<br />
By Dr. Muhammad Taqiuddeen al-Hilaalee, Ph.D. and Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ever since people innovated the dogma of joining others in worship along with Allah, Allah had been sending Prophets and Messengers to His devotees in order to invite them to the worship of Allah and Allah Alone, to order them not to ascribe partners unto Him and bring them out of the darkness of polytheism and into the light of Monotheism. All the Prophets preached the belief in the Oneness of Allah. The following verses from the Noble Qur&#8217;an illustrate this fact:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed, We sent Nooh (Noah) to his people and he said: &#8216;O my people! Worship Allah! You have no other Ilaah (God) but him. (Laa ilaaha ill Allaah, none has the right to be worshipped but Allah). Certainly, I fear for you the torment of a great Day!'&#8221; (Al-A&#8217;araaf, The Heights 7:59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And to &#8216;Aad (people, We sent) their brother Hood. He said: &#8216;O my people! Worship Allah! You have no other Ilaah (God) but Him. (Laa ilaaha ill Allaah, none has the right to be worshipped but Allah). Will you not fear (Allah)?'&#8221; (Al-A&#8217;araaf, The Heights 7:65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And to (the people of) Madyaan (Midian), (We sent) their brother Shu&#8217;ayb. He said: &#8216;O my People! Worship Allah! You have no other Ilaah (God) but Him. (Laa ilaaha ill Allaah, none has the right to be worshipped but Allah). Verily, a clear proof (sign) from your Lord has come unto you, so give full measure and full weight and wrong not men in their things, and do not make mischief on the earth after it has been set in order, that will be better for you, if you are believers.'&#8221; (Al-A&#8217;araaf, The Heights 7:85)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And to Thamood (people, We sent) their brother Saalih. He said: &#8216;O my people! Worship Allah! You have no other Ilaah (God) but Him. (Laa ilaaha ill Allaah, none has the right to be worshipped but Allah).'&#8221; (Al-A&#8217;araaf, The Heights 7:73)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): Worship Allah (Alone) and avoid (or keep away from) Taaghoot (all false deities etc. do not worship Taaghoots besides Allah).&#8221; (An-Nahl, The Bee 16:36)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every Prophet was sent unto his own nation for their guidance, but the Message of Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam &#8211; peace be upon him) was general for all mankind and jinn (a being created from smokeless flames).</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Say [O Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam)]: &#8216;O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allah.'&#8221; (Al-A&#8217;araaf, The Heights 7:158)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the aim of sending these Prophets and Messengers to mankind and jinn was only that they should worship Allah Alone, as Allah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And I (Allah) created not the jinn and men except they should worship Me (Alone)&#8221; (Adh-Dhaariyaat, The Winds that Scatter 51:56)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And to worship Allah means to obey Him and to do all that He has ordained, &#8211; and to fear Him by abstaining from all that He has forbidden. Then those who will obey Allaah will be rewarded in Paradise, and those who will disobey Him will be punished in the Hell-fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Islam continues to grow in America, and no one can doubt that!&#8221; CNN, December 15, 1995</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The religion of Islam is growing faster than any other religion in the world.&#8221; MIKE WALLACE, 60 MINUTES</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Five to 6 million strong, Muslims in America already outnumber Presbyterians, Episcopalians, and Mormons, and they are more numerous than Quakers, Unitarians, Seventh-day Adventists, Mennonites, Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses, and Christian Scientists, combined. Many demographers say Islam has overtaken Judaism as the country&#8217;s second-most commonly practiced religion; others say it is in the passing lane.&#8221; JOHAN BLANK, USNEWS (7/20/98)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;In fact, religion experts say Islam is the second-largest religion in the United States&#8230; Islam has 5 million to 6 million members, followed by Judaism, with approximately 4.5 million&#8230;.. And Islam is believed to be fastest-growing religion in the country, with half its expansion coming from new immigrants and the other half from conversions.&#8221; By ELSA C. ARNETT Knight-Ridder News Service</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Professor Keith Moore, one of the world’s prominent scientists of anatomy and embryology. University of Toronto, Canada. &#8220;It has been a great pleasure for me to help clarify statements in the Qur’an about human development. It is clear to me that these statements must have come to Muhammad from God, or &#8216;Allah&#8217;, because almost all of this knowledge was not discovered until many centuries later. This proves to me that Muhammad must have been a messenger of Allah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;But Islam has a still further service to render to the cause of humanity. It stands after all nearer to the real East than Europe does, and it possesses a magnificent tradition of inter-racial understanding and cooperation. No other society has such a record of success uniting in an equality of status, of opportunity, and of endeavours so many and so various races of mankind . . . Islam has still the power to reconcile apparently irreconcilable elements of race and tradition. If ever the opposition of the great societies of East and West is to be replaced by cooperation, the mediation of Islam is an indispensable condition. In its hands lies very largely the solution of the problem with which Europe is faced in its relation with East. If they unite, the hope of a peaceful issue is immeasurably enhanced. But if Europe, by rejecting the cooperation of Islam, throws it into the arms of its rivals, the issue can only be disastrous for both.&#8221; &#8211;H.A.R. Gibb, WHITHER ISLAM, London, 1932, p. 379.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It (Islam) replaced monkishness by manliness. It gives hope to the slave, brotherhood to mankind, and recognition of the fundamental facts of human nature.&#8221; &#8211;Canon Taylor, Paper read before the Church Congress at Walverhamton, Oct. 7, 1887; Quoted by Arnoud in THE PREACHING OF ISLAM, pp. 71-72.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The founder of twenty terrestrial empires and of one spiritual empire, that is Muhammed. As regards all standards by which human greatness may be measured, we may well ask, is there any man greater than he? &#8221; Lamartine, Historie de la Turquie, Paris 1854, Vol. 11 pp. 276-2727</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If a man like Muhammed were to assume the dictatorship of the modern world, he would succeed in solving its problems that would bring it the much needed peace and happiness.&#8221; George Bernard Shaw</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;How, for instance, can any other appeal stand against that of the Moslem who, in approaching the pagan, says to him, however obscure or degraded he may be &#8216;Embrace the faith, and you are at once equal and a brother.&#8217; Islam knows no color line.&#8221; (S. S. Leeder, VEILED MYSTERIES OF EGYPT)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Professor William W. Hay is one of the best known marine scientists in the United States for satellite photography and emote-sensing techniques. Professor Hay replied: I find it very interesting that this sort of information is in the ancient scripture of the Holy Qur’an, and I have no way of knowing where they would come from, but I think it is extremely interesting that they are there and that this work is going on to discover it, the meaning of some of the passages. Professor Hay: Well, I would think it must be the divine being!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Professor Yushudi Kusan: Director of the Tokyo Observatory, I can say, I am very mush impressed by finding true astronomical facts in the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Professor Alfred Kroner who is one of the world’s most famous geologists: &#8220;Thinking about many of these questions and thinking where Muhammad came from, he was after all a bedouin. I think it is almost impossible that he could have known about things like the common origin of the universe, because scientists have only found out within the last few years with very complicated and advanced technological methods that this is the case.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dr. T.V.N. Persaud is a Professor of Anatomy and Head of the Department of Anatomy, and a professor of Pediatrics and Child Health, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. He is the author or editor of 25 books, and has published over 181 scientific papers. In 1991, he received the most distinguished award presented in the field of anatomy in Canada. &#8220;It seems to me that Muhammad was a very ordinary man. He could not read or write. In fact, he was illiterate. We are talking about 1400 years ago. You have someone who was illiterate making profound pronouncement and statements and are amazingly accurate about scientific nature. I personally cannot see how this could be mere chance. There are too many accuracy’s and, like Dr. Moore, I have no difficulty in my mind in concerning that this is a divine inspiration or revelation which led him to these statements.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Joe Leigh Simpson, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the North Western University in Chicago in the United States of America. Professor Simpson said: It follows, I think, that not only is there no conflict between genetics and religion, but in fact religion can guide science by adding revelation to some traditional scientific approaches. That there exists statements in the Qur’an shown by science to be valid, which supports knowledge in the Qur’an having been derived from Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Professor Palmer a scientist from the U.S.: We need research into the history of early Middle Eastern oral traditions to know whether in fact such historical events have been reported. If there is no such record, it strengthens the belief that Allah transmitted through Muhammad bits of his knowledge that we have only discovered for ourselves in recent times. We look forward to a continuing dialogue on the topic of science in the Qur’an in the context of geology. Thank you very much.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Professor Tagata Tagasone, formerly Head of the Department of Anatomy and Embryology at the University of Shiang Mai in Thailand. He is now the Dean of the College of the Medicine at the University. From my studies and from what I have learned throughout this conference, I believe that everything that has been recorded in the Qur’aan 1400 years ago must be the truth, that can be proved by the scientific means. Since the Prophet Muhammad could neither read nor write, Muhammad must be a messenger who relayed this truth which was revealed to him as an enlightenment by the One Who is an eligible Creator. This Creator must be Allah, or Allaah. Therefore, I think this is the time to say ‘Laa ilaaha illAllaah’, that there is no Allah to worship except Allah, ‘Muhammad Rasool Allaah’, Muhammad is messenger of Allah&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Professor Armstrong, Scientist works at NASA, &#8220;I am impressed that how remarkably some of the ancient writings seem to correspond to modern and recent Astronomy. There may well have to be something beyond what we understand as ordinary human experience to account for the writings that we have seen.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Professor Dorja Rao, &#8220;It is difficult to imagine that this type of knowledge was existing at that time, around 1400 years back. May be some of the things they have simple idea about, but do describe those things in great detail is very difficult. So, this is definitely not a simple human knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;My choice of Muhammad to lead the list of the world&#8217;s most influential persons may surprise some readers and may be questioned by others, but he was the only man in history who was supremely successful on both the religious and secular level.&#8221; &#8211;Michael H. Hart, THE 100: A RANKING OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL PERSONS IN HISTORY, New York: Hart Publishing Company, Inc., 1978, p. 33.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;No other society has such a record of success in uniting in an equality of status, of opportunity and endeavour so many and so varied races of mankind. The great Muslim communities of Africa, India and Indonesia, perhaps also the small community in Japan, show that Islam has still the power to reconcile apparently irreconcilable elements of race and tradition. If ever the opposition of the great societies of the East and west is to be replaced by cooperation, the mediation of Islam is an indispensable condition.&#8221; (H.A.R. Gibb, WHITHER ISLAM, p. 379)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The nation&#8217;s claim to be a Christian country is about to meet its first challenge: the number of practising Muslims is set to overtake Anglican Christians&#8230;. There has also been a number of high-profile conversions to Islam from Christianity. These include Mike Tyson, the former world champion boxer; Chris Eubank, the British middleweight boxing champion, who has changed his name to Hamdan; and Cat Stevens, the pop musician, who calls himself Yousef Islam&#8230;. Prince Charles courted controversy earlier this year when he reaffirmed his claim that when he succeeds the throne, he does not wish to be the defender of only the Christian faith.&#8221; Rajeev Syal and Christopher Morgan Sunday Times (London, U.K.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I have studied him &#8211; the wonderful man &#8211; and in my opinion far from being an anti-Christ he must be called the saviour of humanity. &#8221; George Bernard Shaw in &#8220;The Genuine Islam&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Muhammad, the inspired man who founded Islam, was born about A.D. 570 into an Arabian tribe that worshipped idols. Orphaned at birth, he was always particularly solicitous of the poor and needy, the widow and the orphan, the slave and the downtrodden. At twenty, he was already a successful businessman, and soon became director of camel caravans for a wealthy widow. When he reached twenty-five, his employer, recognizing his merit, proposed marriage. Even though she was fifteen years older, he married her, and as long as she lived, remained a devoted husband. &#8220;Like almost every major prophet before him, Muhammad fought shy of serving as the transmitter of God&#8217;s word, sensing his own inadequacy. But the angel commanded &#8216;Read.&#8217; So far as we know, Muhammad was unable to read or write, but he began to dictate those inspired words which would soon revolutionize a large segment of the earth: &#8216;There is one God.&#8217; &#8220;In all things Muhammad was profoundly practical. When his beloved son Ibrahim died, an eclipse occurred, and rumours of God&#8217;s personal condolence quickly arose. Whereupon Muhammad is said to have announced, &#8216;An eclipse is a phenomenon of nature. It is foolish to attribute such things to the death or birth of a human being. &#8220;At Muhammad&#8217;s own death an attempt was made to deify him, but the man who was to become his administrative successor killed the hysteria with one of the noblest speeches in religious history: &#8216;If there are any among you who worshipped Muhammad, he is dead. But if it is God you worshipped, He lives forever.&#8221; &#8211;James A. Michener, &#8220;Islam: The Misunderstood Religion,&#8221; in READER&#8217;S DIGEST (American edition), May 1955, pp. 68-70.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;In little more than a year he was actually the spiritual, nominal and temporal rule of Medina, with his hands on the lever that was to shake the world.&#8221; John Austin, &#8220;Muhammad the Prophet of Allah,&#8221; in T.P. &#8216;s and Cassel&#8217;s Weekly for 24th September 1927.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Everything made so much sense. This is the beauty of the Qur&#8217;an; it asks you to reflect and reason&#8230;.When I read the Qur&#8217;an further, it talked about prayer, kindness and charity. I was not a Muslim yet, but I felt the only answer for me was the Qur&#8217;an and God had sent it to me.&#8221; Cat Stevens (Yusuf Islam), former British pop star.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Four years after the death of Justinian, A.D. 569, was born at Mecca, in Arabia the man who, of all men exercised the greatest influence upon the human race . . . Mohammed . . . &#8221; John William Draper, M.D., L.L.D., A History of the Intellectual Development of Europe, London 1875, Vol.1, pp.329-330</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Muhammad was the soul of kindness, and his influence was felt and never forgotten by those around him.&#8221; Diwan Chand Sharma, The Prophets of the East, Calcutta 1935, p. l 22.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;People like Pasteur and Salk are leaders in the first sense. People like Gandhi and Confucius, on one hand, and Alexander, Caesar and Hitler on the other, are leaders in the second and perhaps the third sense. Jesus and Buddha belong in the third category alone. Perhaps the greatest leader of all times was Mohammed, who combined all three functions. To a lesser degree, Moses did the same.&#8221; Professor Jules Masserman</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmed Versi, editor of the weekly Muslim News, said the growth of Islam has been constant: &#8220;The younger generation of Muslims that I have encountered is becoming more aware of its Muslim identity and is therefore practising its faith with vigour.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The extinction of race consciousness as between Muslims is one of the outstanding achievements of Islam and in the contemporary world there is, as it happens, a crying need for the propagation of this Islamic virtue&#8230;&#8221; (A.J. Toynbee, CIVILIZATION ON TRIAL, New York, p. 205)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Sense of justice is one of the most wonderful ideals of Islam, because as I read in the Qur&#8217;an I find those dynamic principles of life, not mystic but practical ethics for the daily conduct of life suited to the whole world.&#8221; &#8211;Lectures on &#8220;The Ideals of Islam;&#8221; see SPEECHES AND WRITINGS OF SAROJINI NAIDU, Madras, 1918, p. 167.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;History makes it clear however, that the legend of fanatical Muslims sweeping through the world and forcing Islam at the point of the sword upon conquered races is one of the most fantastically absurd myths that historians have ever repeated.&#8221; &#8211;De Lacy O&#8217;Leary, ISLAM AT THE CROSSROADS, London, 1923, p. 8.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Muslim community is much more aware of its religion and the use that religion plays within its community.&#8221; Dr Peter Brierley, executive director of the Christian Research Association, a London-based charity</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I have always held the religion of Muhammad in high estimation because of its wonderful vitality. It is the only religion which appears to me to possess that assimilating capacity to the changing phase of existence which can make itself appeal to every age. I have studied him &#8211; the wonderful man and in my opinion for from being an anti-Christ, he must be called the Saviour of Humanity. I believe that if a man like him were to assume the dictatorship of the modern world, he would succeed in solving its problems in a way that would bring it the much needed peace and happiness: I have prophesied about the faith of Muhammad that it would be acceptable to the Europe of tomorrow as it is beginning to be acceptable to the Europe of today.&#8221; &#8211;G.B. Shaw, THE GENUINE ISLAM, Vol. 1, No. 81936.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;A growing number of Muslims in America, more than 40 percent are African-American,&#8221; Charles Bierbauer, from the Senior Washington Correspondent</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The extinction of race consciousness as between Muslims is one of the outstanding achievements of Islam, and in the contemporary world there is, as it happens, a crying need for the propagation of this Islamic virtue.&#8221; &#8211;A.J. Toynbee, CIVILIZATION ON TRIAL, New York, 1948, p. 205.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The rise of Islam is perhaps the most amazing event in human history. Springing from a land and a people like previously negligible, Islam spread within a century over half the earth, shattering great empires, overthrowing long established religions, remoulding the souls of races, and building up a whole new world&#8221; &#8211; world of Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The closer we examine this development the more extraordinary does it appear. The other great religions won their way slowly, by painful struggle and finally triumphed with the aid of powerful monarchs converted to the new faith. Christianity had its Constantine, Buddhism its Asoka, and Zoroastrianism its Cyrus, each lending to his chosen cult the mighty force of secular authority. Not so Islam. Arising in a desert land sparsely inhabited by a nomad race previously undistinguished in human annals, Islam sallied forth on its great adventure with the slenderest human backing and against the heaviest material odds. Yet Islam triumphed with seemingly miraculous ease, and a couple of generations saw the Fiery Crescent borne victorious from the Pyrenees to the Himalayas and from the desert of Central Asia to the deserts of Central Africa.&#8221; &#8211;A.M.L. Stoddard, quoted in ISLAM &#8211; THE RELIGION OF ALL PROPHETS, Begum Bawani Waqf, Karachi, Pakistan, p. 56.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I am not a Muslim in the usual sense, though I hope I am a &#8220;Muslim&#8221; as &#8220;one surrendered to God,&#8221; but I believe that embedded in the Quran and other expressions of the Islamic vision are vast stores of divine truth from which I and other occidentals have still much to learn, and &#8216;Islam is certainly a strong contender for the supplying of the basic framework of the one religion of the future.'&#8221; &#8211;W. Montgomery Watt, ISLAM AND CHRISTIANITY TODAY, London, 1983, p. ix.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;I believe in One God and Mohammed the Apostle of God,&#8217; is the simple and invariable profession of Islam. The intellectual image of the Deity has never been degraded by any visible idol; the honours of the prophet have never transgressed the measure of human virtue, and his living precepts have restrained the gratitude of his disciples within the bounds of reason and religion.&#8221; &#8211;Edward Gibbon and Simon Ocklay, HISTORY OF THE SARACEN EMPIRE, London, 1870, p. 54.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;He was Caesar and Pope in one; but he was Pope without Pope&#8217;s pretensions, Caesar without the legions of Caesar: without a standing army, without a bodyguard, without a palace, without a fixed revenue; if ever any man had the right to say that he ruled by the right divine, it was Mohammed, for he had all the power without its instruments and without its supports.&#8221; &#8211;Bosworth Smith, MOHAMMAD AND MOHAMMADANISM, London, 1874, p. 92.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;His readiness to undergo persecutions for his beliefs, the high moral character of the men who believed in him and looked up to him as leader, and the greatness of his ultimate achievement &#8211; all argue his fundamental integrity. To suppose Muhammad an impostor raises more problems than it solves. Moreover, none of the great figures of history is so poorly appreciated in the West as Muhammad.&#8221; &#8211;W. Montgomery Watt, MOHAMMAD AT MECCA, Oxford, 1953, p. 52.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The doctrine of brotherhood of Islam extends to all human beings, no matter what color, race or creed. Islam is the only religion which has been able to realize this doctrine in practice. Muslims wherever on the world they are will recognize each other as brothers.&#8221; Mr. R. L. Mellema, Holland, Anthropologist, Writer and Scholar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It is impossible for anyone who studies the life and character of the great Prophet of Arabia, who knows how he taught and how he lived, to feel anything but reverence for that mighty Prophet, one of the great messengers of the Supreme. And although in what I put to you I shall say many things which may be familiar to many, yet I myself feel whenever I re-read them, a new way of admiration, a new sense of reverence for that mighty Arabian teacher.&#8221; &#8211;Annie Besant, THE LIFE AND TEACHINGS OF MUHAMMAD, Madras, 1932, p. 4.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The essential and definite element of my conversion to Islam was the Qur&#8217;an. I began to study it before my conversion with the critical spirit of a Western intellectual &#8230;. There are certain verses of this book, the Qur&#8217;an, revealed more than thirteen centuries ago, which teach exactly the same notions as the most modern scientific researches do. This definitely converted me.&#8221; Ali Selman Benoist, France, Doctor of Medicine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I have read the Sacred Scriptures of every religion; nowhere have I found what I encountered in Islam: perfection. The Holy Qur&#8217;an, compared to any other scripture I have read, is like the Sun compared to that of a match. I firmly believe that anybody who reads the Word of Allah with a mind that is not completely closed to Truth, will become a Muslim.&#8221; Saifuddin Dirk Walter Mosig, U.S.A.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The universal brotherhood of Islam, regardless of race, politics, color or country, has been brought home to me most keenly many times in my life &#8212; and this is another feature which drew me towards the Faith.&#8221; Col. Donald S. Rockwell, U.S.A. Poet, Critic and Author.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Medieval Islam was technologically advanced and open to innovation. It achieved far higher literacy rates than in contemporary Europe; it assimilated the legacy of classical Greek civilization to such a degree that many classical books are now known to us only through Arabic copies. It invented windmills ,trigonometry, lateen sails and made major advances in metallurgy, mechanical and chemical engineering and irrigation methods. In the middle-ages the flow of technology was overwhelmingly from Islam to Europe rather from Europe to Islam. Only after the 1500&#8217;s did the net direction of flow begin to reverse.&#8221; (pg 253) Jared Diamond a world renowned UCLA sociologist, and physiologist who won the Pulitzer Prize for his book: &#8220;Guns, Germs, and Steel.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Martin Wroe, LONDON &#8211; Noah&#8217;s Ark has been found on the Turkish-Iranian border, 32 kilometres from Mount Ararat, according to the leader of a team of scientists that has been investigating the site for six years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Turkish government is so convinced by the findings that, after years of intransigence, it has designated the site one of special archaeological interest and agreed to its excavation next summer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The remote site contains a buried, ship-like object, resting an altitude of 2,300 metres. At 170 metres long and 45 metres wide, it conforms almost exactly to the 300 cubit by 50 cubit boat that God told Noah to build, according to Genesis 6 in the Bible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On surrounding terrain, the American and Middle Eastern scientists have identified huge stones with holes carved at one end, which they believe are &#8220;drogue-stones,&#8221; dragged behind ships in the ancient world to stabilise them. Radar soundings indicate unusual levels of iron-oxide distribution.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Salih Bayraktutan, head of geology at Turkey&#8217;s Ataturk University, estimates the age of the &#8216;vessel&#8217; at more than 100,000 years. &#8220;It is a man-made structure and for sure it is Noah&#8217;s Ark.&#8221; The site is directly below the mountain of Al Judi, named in the Koran as the Ark&#8217;s resting place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">David Fasold, an American shipwreck specialist with no religious affiliation, has led the investigation. He says subsurface radar surveys of the site have produced &#8220;very good pictures.&#8221; &#8220;The radar imagery at about 25 metres down from the stern is so clear that you can count the floorboards between the walls.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He believes the team has found the fossilised remains of the upper deck and that the original reed substructure has disappeared. But the findings have infuriated the scores of Christian Ark-hunters who travel to Turkey, convinced the Ark will only be found on Mount Ararat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fasold, who calls himself an &#8220;Arkologist,&#8221; also argues that it was not a great flood that pushed the Ark into the mountains. He says it was &#8220;an astronomical event causing a tectonic upheaval, a tidal bore causing gravitational pull in the ocean waters that forced the boat into the mountains.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of Fasold&#8217;s team of geophysicists and geologists are reserving final judgement until the excavation and carbon-dating. But in a British TV series on the environment next month, team member Vendyl Jones, a Middle East archaeologist and inspiration for film character Indiana Jones, says it is &#8220;between maybe and probably&#8221; that they have found Noah&#8217;s Ark.</p>
<p><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Observer newspaper, 16 January 1994</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Prologue</strong>: The Quranic verse detailing about the resting place of the Noah&#8217;s Ark is found in Chapter Hood, verse 44 (Qur.aan 11:44). The verse says:</p>
<blockquote><p>{When the word went forth: &#8220;O earth! swallow up thy water and O sky! withhold (thy rain)!&#8221; and the water abated and the matter was ended. The Ark rested on Mount Judi and the word went forth: &#8220;Away with those who do wrong!&#8221;}</p></blockquote>
<p>The 49th verse of the same Chapter says:</p>
<blockquote><p>{Such are some of the stories of the Unseen which We have revealed unto you: before this neither you nor your people knew them. So persevere patiently: for the end is for those who are righteous}</p></blockquote>

<strong>Published: </strong>May 1997 Invitation to Islam Newsletter</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;">With leadership and conquest comes fame but fame did not affect this man whose only aim was to establish the religion of Allah on earth. His position as a Messenger of Allah was not exaggerated. His insistence on being a mere mortal like others was firm. And his desire to single out Allah alone for worship was stressed wholeheartedly.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;"><strong>&#8220;And We have not sent you except as a mercy to mankind&#8221;</strong> (Al-Anbiyah, The Prophets 21:107) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The year is 570 CE, five years after the death of the Roman Emperor Justinian. An army of men, horses and elephants ruthlessly march towards the city of Makkah, intending to wipe it out of existence. This is the army of the Abysinnian warlord Abraha, who after conquering Yemen is now advancing towards the sacred city of Makkah. One of the notables of Makkah, Abdul-Muttalib, has ordered all the women and children to go up into the mountains and take refuge there whilst the men go and fight. However, the men of Makkah are of no match to the deadly Abysinnian lancers who soon crush their resistance on the borders of the city.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Victory seems imminent for Abraha. Yet when the army advances to the fringes of the city, headed by its lead elephant, the creature stops unexpectedly and refuses to go any further towards the direction of Makkah. No amount of budging will make this beast go towards the direction of conquest, yet when the army turn it around, it is more than willing to go back. Suddenly from the distant horizon, a huge flock of birds is seen. Ominously it makes its way to the scene of the battle. In their beaks and claws the birds carry with them stones. Like lightning do they descend upon the confused army of Abraha and pelt them viciously with the stones. The stones start to cut and tear away at the bodies of these aggressors and reduce them to helpless wretches. The army of the tyrant are sent back in humiliation. It is no less than a miracle which has saved this sacred city.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This event was to be remembered by the Arabs as the year of the elephant and was to hold great significance in the balance of power in Arabia. But it was the event which occurred fifty days later in the same year which was not only to be remembered, but would also change the course of history forever. It was on the 12th day of the month of Rabi-al-Awwal[3], that in the house of Abdul-Muttalib a child was born. It was the child of Amina, the wife of Abdullah, the son of Abdul-Muttalib. This was the child who would change the way of life of all those around him. This was the child who would unite all people under one way. This was the child who would bring the great empires of the world to a standstill.</p>
<p>This child was Muhammad, the last and final messenger of Allah to mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The name Muhammad was given to the child by his grandfather Abdul-Muttalib. The name was one which was known amongst the Arabs at that time but was not common. The literal meaning of Muhammad is &#8216;the praised one&#8217;, and it is reported that upon being asked why Abdul-Muttalib had named his grandson so, he replied: &#8220;I did so with the desire that my grandson would be praised by Allah in Heaven and by men on earth&#8221;[4]. It seems as if the desire of Abdul-Muttalib came true, for it was the name of Muhammad (peace be upon him) which was to be uttered and praised more times than that of any person in history[5]. In fact it is not only men who praise this remarkable man, but also the Creator of the Heavens and the earth, Allah, and the inhabitants of the heavens, the angels:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily Allaah sends blessings upon the prophet, and his angels ask Allaah to bless him. Oh you who have believed ask Allaah to send blessings upon him and greet him with peace&#8221; (Al-Ahzab, The Confederates 33:56)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The grandson of Abdul-Muttalib was destined to become the greatest man ever to live.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The early life of Muhammad (peace be upon him) before his prophethood, is unknown to most people. His life is highlighted by his sublime character and noble manners. The world of Muhammed, ((peace be upon him) was a world of idolatry, a world in which women and slaves had no rights whatsoever, a world in which men would cheat each other for a few dirhams.[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However Muhammad (peace be upon him) was not like those around him. He was not known to swear or talk in a vile manner, nor was he known to drink or gamble. His honesty surpassed that of all others and he was known with the title of &#8216;Al-Ameen&#8217; (The trustworthy). In fact it was this quality of honesty which attracted so many people to his noble message.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The nature of the Arabs at the time of Muhammad (peace be upon him) was very barbaric and they would fight over the smallest of things, such as one tribes camel grazing on the land of another tribe. This would often result in wars which would last for years and take thousands of lives. In the year 605 CE the Kaabah was accidentally burnt down and a massive reconstruction programme had to be initiated. Many people were involved in it&#8217;s rebuilding. However, upon its completion, the issue of replacing the black stone in its original place, the south east corner of the Kaabah, arose. Each of the major tribes and clans wanted the honour of placing the black stone in its proper place. Civil war loomed over the Arabian peninsula. It was then suggested by Abu Ummayah al-Mugheera, one of the elders of Makkah, that the way to settle this dispute was to let the first person to come through the mosque&#8217;s gate the next morning, decide the fate of the matter. Lo and behold the first man to enter the mosque the next morning was indeed Muhammad (peace be upon him). Upon seeing him some of the Arabs exclaimed with joy, &#8220;here is the trustworthy one, we shall agree to his decision &#8211; he is Muhammad&#8221;. Muhammad (peace be upon him) asked for a sheet or a robe to be brought to him and to have the black stone placed in the middle of it. He then asked the elders of each of the major tribes to lift up the sheet from each of the corners. The elders did as they were instructed and took the black stone over to the south east corner. Muhammed (peace be upon him) then took the stone and placed it firmly in its resting place And so it was Muhammad (peace be upon him) who with wisdom and honesty saved the Arabs from self-destruction.[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad&#8217;s (peace be upon him) early life was wrought with unhappiness as he never saw his father Abdullah who died before he was born. At the age of six his mother, Amina passed away and he was entrusted into the care of his beloved grandfather Abdul-Muttalib. However, at the age of twelve, Abdul-Muttalib also passed away and Abu Talib, the uncle of Muhammed (peace be upon him), took charge of him. With such distress and heartache so early on in life, one would imagine that this boy would grow up to be rebellious and troublesome, as is the case in so many of our societies today[9]. But this was obviously not to be.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was Abu Talib who then reared and brought him up. Abu Talib was a trader and businessman and he sometimes took his nephew along with him on his trade journeys. It was these trade journeys which eventually formed the alliance between Muhammad and his future wife Khadija. Khadija was a wealthy widow from Makkah who was known for her noble character and morals. Soon Muhammed (peace be upon him) was working for Khadija as a manager for her trade caravans. It was his honesty and efficiency which led to Khadija&#8217;s proposal, and soon after Muhammed (peace be upon him) had returned from a trade journey to Syria, they were married.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was in the year 610 CE that the prophet Muhammed (peace be upon him) received the first revelation. It was the practice of Muhammad (peace be upon him) that he would often go up to the cave of Hira to meditate and pray to Allah alone. One night during the month of Ramadaan[10] while he was meditating, an angel appeared before him. This was the angel Jibraeel (Eng. Gabriel), the very same angel who had brought down revelation to the earlier prophets of Allah such as Jesus and Moses (upon them be peace). ln a thundering voice the angel commanded him &#8220;READ&#8221; . &#8220;I cannot read&#8221;, [11] replied Muhammad honestly. The angel grabbed hold of him and squeezed him so hard that Muhammed thought he would die of suffocation. &#8220;READ&#8221;, the angel commanded again. Muhammad&#8217;s reply was the same. So the angel squeezed him again and again, each time harder than the previous, and Muhammad replied the same, each time thinking that he would die of suffocation. The angel then released him and spoke the words which would be remembered as the first words of the final revelation to mankind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Read in the name of you Lord, Who Created. Who Created man out of a clot of blood. Read, and your Lord is the Most Bountiful. It is He who has taught man the use of the pen. Taught man that which he did not know.&#8221; (Al-Alaq, The Clot 96:1-5)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the start of the revelation from Allah to humanity. It was the final incorruptible message by which mankind would have to live by and worship according to. And it was Muhammed (peace be upon him), the son of Abdullah who was chosen to spread this good news.</p>
<p><strong>His Noble Character</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the character of the prophet Muhammed (peace be upon him) which was one of the main reasons for the spread of his noble message. As mentioned before, he never swore and he never spoke vilely about anyone. But after his appointment as a prophet of Allah, he not only observed these excellent qualities for himself, but also ordered all the Muslims to live their lives according to these noble traits. This is why we find that lying and cheating are totally forbidden in Islam, and about lying the prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;<strong>Lying leads to obscenity and obscenity leads to the fire of hell</strong>&#8221; [13]. For the Arabs to stop cheating and lying it would mean that the whole of their lives would have to be turned upside down. Cheating and lying during business transactions was a regular practice for the Arabs, and it was from this behaviour that the racist slogan &#8220;you cheating Arab!&#8221; was derived. Backbiting and slandering one another were totally forbidden and the prophet (peace be upon him) was instructed by Allah to inform the people that backbiting another Muslim was like:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;. . . eating the dead flesh of your brother&#8221; (Al-Hujjarat, The Dwellings 49:12)</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammed (peace be upon him) was known to laugh very little, if at all. Rather when he was happy he would express his delight by smiling and he is reported to have said: &#8220;Too much laughter kills the heart&#8221; [15]. Likewise when he was angry, he would not fly off the handle or start a tantrum, but rather the complexion of his face would simply turn red.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The generosity of Muhammed (peace be upon him) was so great that one of his companions, Ibn Abbas described his huge generosity as being like &#8220;. . . the blowing wind&#8221; [16] . To give charity during those days was outdated and those who gave charity were very rare in that troublesome society. But the trends of society were nothing to this man, who simply wished to attain the pleasure of Allah by helping those who were less fortunate then himself. In fact his giving of charity often meant that he had to sacrifice the pleasures of life for himself and his family. His wife Aisha reported that &#8220;&#8230;. three consecutive days would not go by without the family of Muhammed not eating their fill&#8221; [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The relationship between Muhammed (peace be upon him) and women has been subject to vicious attack by many western writers. He has been accused of being sexually immoral and depraved by his enemies. Many a feminist has accused him of depriving women of their rights. Yet the reality of this man is unknown to many of these ignorant people. When Muhammed (peace be upon him) left the cave of Hira, trembling and shaking like a leaf, who was the first person that this alleged male chauvinist turned to? When spreading the message of Islam who was the first person to respond to this so called &#8220;patriarchal&#8221; religion? The answer is Khadija, his wife, a woman. It was Khadija who comforted him during these initial days of anxiety. It was Khadija who reassured him of his role by accepting his message. And it was Khadija who gained so much respect and admiration from this remarkable man.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Pre-Islamic Arabia was characterised by the evil crime of burying baby girls alive because they were seen as a shame to the family. Yet it was this man Muhammad who spoke out vehemently against this great social crime. In fact he stated the great blessing and reward of having and rearing female children : &#8220;Whomsoever brings up two girls upon this religion, then me and him shall be like this in paradise [and he joined his forefinger with his middle finger]&#8221;[19]. His conduct with women was not like that of the men today, rather he treated the women as they deserved to be treated. He did not openly parade women about like cattle[20], as was done before the coming of Islam nor did he seek to please them by showing off his masculinity. Rather he as described as being &#8220;&#8230;&#8230;more shy than a virgin behind a veil&#8221;[21]. For a man who achieved so much in his lifetime it would be expected (by corrupt western standards!) that Muhammad would abuse his power with regards to women. Yet we do not find a single instance in his life in which he went out raping and destroying the honour of the women folk who were captured [as occurred is Bosnia and Kosovo, when the Serbian army attempted to rid their country of all Muslim presence -SA]. Rather it was the women of Arabia who came forward in their droves to accept the message of this man, who came to liberate humanity from the oppression of this world[22].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By the time of his death in the year 632 CE almost the whole of the Arabian peninsula had been conquered. A million square miles lay at his feet. Yet such was the humble nature of this man that he would mend his own shoes, sew his own clothes and milk his own goats. Such behaviour has become awe inspiring for millions of people and has thus led them to the beauty of this religion. As a leader for his people he was a great example of humility and mercy. When his companions walked past his house they could hear him crying in his prayer, so much so that it was like a &#8220;&#8230; boiling pot&#8221;[23]. He would continuously pray during the nights to such an extent that his feet would swell up. Upon observing this his wife Aisha asked him &#8220;..why do you pray so much, when your Lord has forgiven your past sins and your future sins?&#8221; and the reply from the prophet (peace be upon him) was &#8220;should I therefore not be a grateful servant of my Lord (by praying at night)&#8221;[24].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The famous conquest of Makkah is an event which shall be remembered for the justice and mercy which were shown that day. Even though he had the option to punish those who were guilty of oppressing the Muslims, Muhammed (peace be upon him) issued a general amnesty by which many people were forgiven. It was this behaviour which saw the amazing acceptance of Islam by almost the whole population of Makkah literally overnight.[25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With leadership and conquest comes fame but fame did not affect this man whose only aim was to establish the religion of Allah on earth. His position as a messenger of Allaah was not exaggerated. His insistence on being a mere mortal like others was firm. And his desire to single out Allaah alone for worship was stressed wholeheartedly. It is for this reason that he ordered his followers not to make any pictorial representations or statues of him. Before his death he condemned the &#8220;. . .Jews and Christians for taking the graves of their prophets and pious people as places of worship&#8221;[26]. By implication this made it haram (prohibited) for the Muslims to take the grave of Muhammed (peace be upon him) as a place of worship. For all those who call the Muslims &#8216;Muhammedans'[27], then this is the response which we as worshippers of Allah bring forward. Throughout history leaders of nations, ideologies and empires have often ended up becoming objects of worship. We find statues and pictures of Marx, Lenin, Caesar, Jesus, St Paul, Hitler, Napoleon, Confucius and so many others. Yet despite all the reminders of these people, it is still this man Muhammad (peace be upon him) who has had the most influence upon history, despite the fact that we find no 3-D visual image of him [28]. This is indeed a mercy from Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The world of the 7th century was a crumbling place. The empires of Rome and Persia were locked in constant battle. The Chinese and Indian civilisations were in moral decline. Christianity, Zoroastrianism and Judaism were all religions which were fast losing momentum. The case of the Arabs was clear to everyone and they were regarded as being at the bottom of this decaying pit. It was among this decadence that Allah sent Muhammad (peace be upon him). He was like the light to this world of ignorance. Like a lamp did he shine in this abyss of darkness. From the confines of Arabia it was his light that would reach the farthest regions of the earth and release the people from their burdens:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8216;O prophet. Verily We have sent you as a witness and a bearer of glad tidings and a warner, and as one who invites to Allah by His Permission, and as a lamp spreading light&#8221; (Al-Ahzab, The Confederates, 33:45-46)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Be thankful for small mercies&#8221; goes the saying of old. But the mercy which we have been given is far from small. Rather the greatness of this mercy will enable us to live and die upon a way of success and contentment. This mercy is the Sunnah (way) of the prophet Muhammad and through it we -by the will of Allaah- will enjoy an everlasting life to come. Indeed in the messenger of Allaah you have the most beautiful pattern of conduct for him who hopes in Allaah and the last day, and remembers Allaah much&#8221; (Al-Ahzab, The Confederates, 33:21)</p>

27 This was the name used for Muslims during the middle ages. It means one who worships Muhammed (peace be upon him). Unfortunately through their ignorance many westerners still know Muslims by this name.<br />
28 This fact has even been attested to by Christians, such us professor Michael Hart in his book &#8220;The 100: The most influential men in History&#8221;. Despite the fact that professor Hart casts doubt upon the source of the prophet&#8217;s law, he still cannot help but admit that this man exercised more influence on humanity then anyone else. It is for this reason that he places Muhammed (saws) in the No.1 position, even ahead of his lord Jesus, whom he places 3rd just behind St Paul<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the criticisms leveled at Islam by demented animal rights activists, is that it encourages the wide scale slaughter of animals. Every year after the annual Hajj (pilgrimage) Muslims worldwide sacrifice an animal for the pleasure of Allaah. Not only is this a religious duty benefiting the doer, but it also helps many starving people around the world, to whom the meat is sent to. This however, is blurred from the minds of the insane.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Animal Tragic” &#8211; Islam And The Treatment Of Animals</strong></span><br />
Source: Invitation To Islam Newsletter, vol.1 issue.6, July 1999</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Chained up bears in Russian circuses. A terrified fox running from the blood hounds. The Spanish bull being tormented in the arena with darts and knives. Elephant graveyards littered across India and Africa, courtesy of ivory hunters. Thousands of rare animals vanishing due to the deforestation of Central and Southern America. All these are examples of the tragic state of the creatures which live alongside us on this planet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, to be an animal in today’s world is not an easy life. Injustice against animals occurs in all of today’s societies. Living in the West, we hear many tales of cruelty towards animals in the ‘third’ world. The cruel cock fighting of South East Asia, the ‘barbaric’ animal delicacies of the Orient and the international smuggling of rare animals, are just some of the tales we hear. However, people in the West seem to forget that cruelty also goes on under their own noses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every year the cosmetics industry kills millions of animals for testing, just to appease the vain desires of people. Cattle and livestock are transported between the ‘civilised’ nations of Europe in the most horrendous conditions. And animals are brought to the verge of extinction just so that people can revel in the latest trends of jewellery and fashion. Indeed, to be an animal in today’s world is not as easy life!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is the solution to this cruelty? Do we all join the RSPCA and WWF? 1 Do we jump onto the bandwagon with the crazy animal rights groups and start bombing campaigns? No, clearly not, as such measures have eased the cruelty animals very little. So what do we do? The answer is simple, and has been available to the people of the world for the past 1400 years. It is none other than Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam and Animals – The Americans send a monkey into space and the Russians a dog. TV programmes about injured animals are aired daily. Cruelty to pets results in massive fines and imprisonment. Such actions by the non- Muslims are seen as liberating forces which have only come into existence this century. However, unknown to many, Islam endorsed this kindness to animals 1400 years earlier. It is Islam which first taught the world about compassion and Mercy to animals. The Qur’an and the Sunnah (way) of the Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam), give us guidance in all affairs. By worshiping Allaah through these sources, the treatment of animals is exemplified more than any other way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam teaches us that the creatures of the earth are from the signs of Allaah, by which we can recognize His Greatness. They are all here for a specific purpose which Allaah has ordained for them. From the tiniest ant to the largest Blue Whale, each animal on this earth provides a service by which life carries on uninterrupted. As Muslims, we see these creatures as an opportunity to reflect and ponder about the perfect artistry of Allaah. An example are the birds in the sky as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Do they not observe the birds above them, spreading out their wings and folding them in? None upholds them except the Most Merciful. Indeed He is the All-Seer of everything.” [Surah al-Mulk (67):19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These creatures offer us so much by way of their services. They are our food, our clothing, our livelihoods and our transportation across the land. All this they do for us at no cost or charge. As Muslims we have to therefore be grateful to Allaah for this magnificent blessing, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Thus We have made them (animals) subject to you that you may be grateful.” [Surah Al-Hajj (22):36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The gratitude to Allaah comes in the form of kindness towards these animals. Such is the mercy of Islam, that it produces this kindness through the expectation of Allaah’s reward, as the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said: “….there is a reward for kindness to every living thing” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this way Muslims see kind treatment of animals as a religious deed to please Allaah. To mistreat animals is thus disobedience to Allaah – something which we will be held accountable for, as the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) demonstrated when he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“A woman (from the previous nations) was tormented because of a cat which she had confined and staved till it died. She did not allow it to eat or drink while it was confined, nor did she set it free so that it may eat the insects of the earth. As a result of her wickedness she was condemned to Hell.” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People abuse and torture animals because they think that no one will hold them accountable. Once people accept that Allaah will hold us all to account, can such cruelty stop. By studying the beliefs and practising the injunctions of Islam, cruelty to animals can truly stop. Looking at the example of the Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) we can see exactly how animals should be treated. Thus, from the actions and saying of this amazing man, can so much be learned in this oppressive and unjust world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The way of Muhammad (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) – Once, during the early part of the day, the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) passed by a withered camel kneeling down near the gate of the mosque. At the end of the day he passed by the mosque again only to see the camel in the same state as before. When the owner of the camel was looked for but could not be found, he (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said to the people:<br />
“Fear Allaah regarding these dumb animals and ride them with care and feed them with care.” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The last Messenger to humanity also said:<br />
“Ride these animals peacefully, and when you are not in need of them keep them peacefully, and do not take them as chairs.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The lot of the animal in light of these sayings is exonerated beyond anything that the liberation movements of the West have produced. This is because the sayings of this man are not from is own desire, rather:<br />
“….it is (only) the revelation with which he is inspired”[Surah An-Najm 53:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said:<br />
“Beware of taking the backs of your animals as pulpits, for indeed Allaah, the Most High, has subjugated them for you to carry you to a land with great difficulty….” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look at the wisdom of these words O’ reader. Is this not an appreciation of the creatures which inhabit our planet? Whilst the rest of the world was steeped in savagery, here was this amazing man, 1400 years ago, improving the situation for every being on earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once, while entering an enclosure, the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) saw a camel. When the camel saw the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) it began to cry. So the Prophet went to it, wiped its back around its hump and rubbed it until it calmed down. Then addressing the owner of the camel, he (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said: “Will you not fear Allaah in regards to these animals which Allaah has placed under your control? For indeed it (the camel) has complained to me that you keep it hungry and fatigued.” [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The leader of a nation and a man to be followed by millions, is seen here comforting a creature which cannot even talk. Such behaviour has made the Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) the most influential man ever to exist. One does not hear of Confucious, Caeser, Napoleon, Hitler or any other famous leader ever expressing such mercy and compassion towards the creation. Even today, when leaders broadcast their own virtues to gain support, we find that they cannot even stop the cruelty which goes on in their countries. The widespread abuse of riding beasts (camels, elephants, horses, mules etc.) in circuses is one such example. The case of Mary Chipperfield, a circus trainer who was caught on camera beating elephants – only for her to be given them back – shows us how much the people truly need Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The killing of animals for the sake of sport and fun is something totally outlawed by the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) and Islam. He (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said:<br />
“Do not take any living thing as a target.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In fact, such is the severity of this, that Ibn Umar (a companion of the Prophet) said:<br />
“Indeed the Messenger of Allaah cursed the one who made a living thing a target.” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, big game safaris, bull fighting and fox hunting are all acts which were condemned by Islam even before they were invented by the Europeans. If pain has to be inflicted, such as for identifying purposes, then the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam)<br />
“….Prohibited striking animals in their faces or branding them on their faces.” [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The international smuggling of rare tropical birds and the theft of their eggs is something well highlighted. The motive to make profit from the suffering of some of the most beautiful creatures on earth, is a good reason for many. With Islam however, such a reason is not valid. Once the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) was on a journey with his companions. Some of his companions saw a nest with a bird and its two chicks. They took the chicks from the nest which made the bird swivel around in anxiety. When the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) saw this he said:<br />
“Who has caused distress to her regarding her children? Return her children to her”. [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kindness is even extended to those animals which Islam normally bars participation with, such as dogs. [12] The Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) informed us about a man from the previous nations who had seen a thirsty dog panting and eating mud. The man climbed into a well, filled his shoe with water and gave it to the dog. Because of this “….Allaah thanked and forgave him.” [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) also said:<br />
“Allaah forgave a prostitute (from the Israelites) who tied her shoe to her scarf and drew out some water (from a well) for a dog which she saw dying of thirst…..” [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The kind treatment of animals is topped up by the practical help which Islam advises with. The Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said:<br />
“Any Muslim who plants a tree gains the reward of giving in charity. What is eaten from it is charity, what is stolen from it, what the animals eat and what the birds eat is all charity….” [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Not only do these words encourage us to preserve the environment, but they also help us to provide a welcome sustenance to the animals around us. Developing from this, the Muslim will increase obedience to Allaah by leaving out bread and biscuits for the birds that visit the garden, or nuts for the squirrels who rummage around. Having heard these narrations about the last Messenger, only the unjust would say that Islam does not truly emancipate animals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Extremes – Cruelty to animals is one extreme regarding the beasts of the earth. On the other side of the spectrum we find that the lot of the animal is increased so much, that it has even superseded that of humanity. In today’s world people love and honour animals so much that they literally worship them! What could be more typical of this then the religion of Hinduism. Cows, monkeys, snakes, elephants and rats are among the many animals worshipped by Hindus. By going to this extreme of worshipping and loving animals, the lives of humans are usually forgotten and put in danger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A perfect example is the huge outbreak of plague in Calcutta, India, a few years ago. According to Hindu mythology, Ganesh the elephant headed deity, who is called upon to remove obstacles, used to ride upon a rat! Because of this the rat is considered sacred and thus the city could not be sectioned off. Such insane polytheistic behaviour resulted in this plague spreading and killing many people. Such is the deification of the rat in Hinduism, that in India special temples are dedicated for rats. In these temples Hindus live and eat with rats. Once the rats finish drinking milk provided for them, that which is left over is drunk by Hindus who consider the milk to have been blessed!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Other religions such as Jainism 16 have gone to such extremes, that we find that their religious monks and nuns constantly wear mouth veils lest they should swallow even a fly by accident!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The worship of animals is not just confined to organised religion. In the West, many pet owners are also guilty of this. The extent to which people love their pets has escalated beyond control. Every year millions are spent on pampering pets. If all the money from the beauty pageants for cats and dogs was sent to the starving millions around the world, so much human life could be saved. But no… the eccentric vices of the West deem that animal life is far precious then human life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With Islam, humans undoubtedly come first. The destruction of human life for the sake of animals is epitomised by the animal rights groups who are so fervent in the West. Activities of groups such as the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) clearly show how human life is so undervalued. By vandalising and destroying laboratories, such groups believe that they are liberating the poor animals who are tested therein. [17] However the human cost of such actions is ignored. By testing animals for medical research, remedies for cancer, Alzheimer’s, and many other degenerative illnesses are being developed. Such testing is very beneficial for humanity and has brought relief to many through the new drugs developed. Thus, in destroying incubators, computers and other valuable equipment, more people are kept in pain then animals. Letter bombs, car bombs, assassinations and throwing acid at scientists, are just some of the horrors which these terrorists have unleashed upon society. Every year innocent people get killed because of the love which these lunatics have for animals. Such people have clearly gone to extremes with the creatures of the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Slaughter</strong></span> – One of the criticisms levelled at Islam by demented animal rights activists, is that it encourages the wide scale slaughter of animals. Every year after the annual Hajj (pilgrimage) Muslims worldwide sacrifice an animal for the pleasure of Allaah. Not only is this a religious duty benefiting the doer, but it also helps many starving people around the world, to whom the meat is sent to. This however, is blurred from the minds of the insane. In countries such as Britain and France, protests against this are vigorous. In France such protests have been intensified with the support of people like Bridgett Bardot, the famous ‘sexkitten’ of French cinema. 18 If only these people were to examine the way of the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam), would they realise that even in the slaughter of animals Islam has regulated compassion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Islamic method of slaughtering is one which embodies true mercy. To have mercy whilst slaughtering will bring mercy from Allaah, as the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said:<br />
“Whosoever has mercy, even if he is slaughtering a sparrow, Allaah will have mercy upon him on the day of resurrection.” [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, the method of slaughtering with a knife (at the wind pipe) is far painless then the electric shocks or crushing bows to the head which are administered in the West. The Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said:<br />
“Allaah has enjoined goodness to everything.. when you slaughter, slaughter in a good way. Let every one of you sharpen his knife and let the slaughtered animal die comfortably.” [20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By using a sharp knife to slaughter, the pain is minimised and the animal dies very quickly. Such is the mercy of Islam, that it even forbids that a knife be sharpened in front of the slaughtered animal, lest it would feel terror and anxiety. Once the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) passed by a man who had his foot on the neck of a sheep. Whilst he was sharpening his blade, the sheep was looking towards it. The Prophet of Mercy (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said to him:<br />
“Do you intend to give it two deaths? Why did you not sharpen your knife before you laid it on the ground?” [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This compassionate behaviour of the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) was understood and implemented in the best way by his noble companions. Thus, we find that Umar, the second righteous caliph of Islam, once hit a man with a stick because he sharpened his blade in front of a sheep. Another time, Umar saw a man dragging a sheep to slaughter it. Umar hit him with a stick [22] and said:<br />
“Drive it – may your mother be bereaved of you – to its death in a nice way.” [23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After reading this, who can say that Islam encourages wide scale slaughter? Surely those who criticise Islam after knowing how merciful it is towards animals, do so from desire. Animals have been created for our use and provision; yet such is the beauty of Islam, that it has set a standard for use and provision which is truly humane. There is no other way which is so balanced in its treatment of the animals of the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From cruelty to craziness, the extremes regarding animals are astounding. These extremes show how ignorant people are of their purpose in life. Once people realise that Allaah deserves to be worshipped alone, will everything else fall into place. Our actions on this earth stem from whether or not we worship Allaah correctly. Those who worship Allaah correctly are those who treat the animals of the earth correctly. Those who worship other than Allaah, are those who go to extremes with animals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The world is beautiful and green and Allaah &#8211; be He exalted – has made you governors over it to see how you will act” 24 said Muhammad the last Messenger of Allaah. By worshipping Allaah as guided by Islam, we can act correctly with the animals, the plants and all that is in the beautiful and green world of ours. May Allaah help us to show compassion to all the creatures which He has created. Ameen</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do you know this Book?</strong></span><br />
[From the &#8216;Invitation to Islam&#8217; Newsletter, Issue 2, July 1997]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Of all the acclaimed masterpieces that the world has seen, nothing can be compared to the book known as the Qur&#8217;an. Millions have become Muslims upon simply hearing a verse from this amazing book, yet still the majority knows nothing of it. The Qur&#8217;an is the Final Revelation from the Creator to humanity. It was revealed in the year 610 CE to the Prophet Muhammed (Peace be upon him), and completed over a period of 23 years. These 23 years of revelation resulted in a book which comprised of 114 chapters and 6,666 verses. All of this was to become the primary source of law for the whole of mankind to live and die by.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The impact of this book is such that Allah says :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Had We[1] revealed this Qur&#8217;an upon a mountain, surely you would have seen it humble itself and crumble out of the fear of Allah. Such are the parables We put forward to mankind so that they may reflect&#8221; (Surah Al-Hashr 59:21)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, it seems as if the hearts of the people have become harder then the mountains which tower above us. When the Qur&#8217;an is recited or even mentioned, people turn away with disgust. In the West, this is primarily due to the negative exposure from the media. It has resulted in many non-Muslims not even wanting to hear the name of this amazing book. Muslims too, have become hardhearted because of the cultural influences of the West. Many young Muslims perceive the Qur&#8217;an to be nothing more then an old wrapped up book, which comes off the highest shelf once a year during Ramadan!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If people were to truly reflect upon this book, they would realise that nothing in this world is quite the same. So why should this claim be accepted over others? Why should the Qur&#8217;an be given precedence over the likes of the Bible, the Gita[2] or the Granth Sahib[3] ? The following reasons will inshallah give an indication as to why this book deserves the attention of all humanity.</p>
<p><strong>Preservation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There is probably in the world no other book which has remained twelve centuries with so pure a text&#8221;. Writing 200 years ago, these are the words of the famous English critic of Islam, Sir William Muir. But as Muslims we do not need Williarn Muir to tell us this. 1400 years ago, the Muslims accepted this reality when Allah revealed to them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed it is We who have sent down the reminder (the Qur&#8217;an), and indeed it is Us who shall preserve it&#8221; (Surah Al-Hijr 15:9)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These words have proved true to this very day. From the moment the first words were revealed to Muhammed (Peace be upon him), to this very day, every single letter and word of the Qur&#8217;an has remained unchanged.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Before Islam, all the revelations sent were not given this divine assurance. This is why we find that books like the Bible are riddled with corruption and inaccuracies. It is well known that man has tampered with the Bible to the extent that annually different versions are produced to suit trends and desires[4]. In fact this has been going on for so long that it is almost impossible to see what of the words of the Creator are left, if any!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With the Qur&#8217;an it is the exact opposite. The contents of this amazing book are stored in the hearts of millions of Muslims worldwide. Children as young as 12 have memorized the entire book in its original language, Arabic. There is no other religious scripture on earth which is orally preserved in its original language by so many and over such a period of time, without having been tampered somewhere along the line. The Bible is a prime example of this. Many Christians believe that English is the divine language of the Bible. However Jesus (as) spoke Aramaic. From Aramaic, his life-story was translated into Hebrew. From Hebrew it was translated into Greek. From Greek to Latin, and then finally from Latin to English! There has not been a single vicar, priest or layman in recorded history who has even memorised the Bible in English, let alone the Aramaic! As Muslims we believe the Qur&#8217;an can only be in the language it was revealed in, i.e. Arabic. Anything else is a translation and not the divine words of the Creator. A true test of this divine preservation would be to burn all the books and manuscripts in existence, to see which can return as it was. The Qur&#8217;an would be the only book which would return in its original form, letter for letter, word for word.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many Christians say that the Qur&#8217;anic claim of preservation needs to be backed-up by manuscript evidence. For us this is not a necessary criteria, but in order to quell the doubts, the Muslims have ample proof. Two copies of the Qur&#8217;an are in existence which date back to the Third Caliph Uthmaan (may Aah be please with him), 20 years after the death of the Prophet (Peace be upon him). These two copies are to be found in the Topkapi museum, Istanbul, Turkey and in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. The Tashkent copy is thought to have been the personal copy of the Caliph as it still contains stains of his blood, which was shed when he was murdered whilst reading it. Any copy of the Qur&#8217;an which is compared to these copies, will show that there is not a single difference between what we have today and what was in existence 1400 years ago. Thus Allah&#8217;s promise holds true.</p>
<p><strong>No Mistakes</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Man as a creature is fallible. For this reason anything which is produced by him will naturally have faults. With the Qur&#8217;an, such a notion cannot even be considered as it is from the one who is Infallible. In fact Allah clarifies this matter beautifully when he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Do they not consider the Qur&#8217;an? Had it been from other then Allah surely they would have found much discrepancies within it&#8221; (Surah An-Nisa 4:82)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Throughout history many have tried to scrutinize and search the Qur&#8217;an for mistakes and errors. To this day no one has been able to bring a shred of proof showing that this book is not from Allah. Some Christians have even called it the work of the Devil because the book affected them so much when they read it! With other scriptures, contradictions, mistakes and absurdities are constantly present. When people contrast these ambiguities with the Qur&#8217;an, it often results in the acceptance of this faultless book.</p>
<p><strong>The Arabic Language</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Upon hearing Qur&#8217;anic recitation, you may be rather startled. Besides hearing the reciter of the prayer, you often hear people in the background sobbing and wailing heavily. So what is it that makes these people cry so much? It is nothing more then the beauty and eloquence of this book which moves millions to tears. This beauty is expressed in the language of Arabic. Allah says :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed We have revealed this as an Arabic Qur&#8217;an so that you may understand&#8221; (Surah Yusuf 12:2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At the time of the Prophet (Peace be upon him) three modes of expression were used. There was normal speech, the speech of the soothsayer and poetry. The Arabs were the masters of their language, and poetry was their cultural highlight. Arabic poetry is split into 16 categories, each separate from the other. When the Qur&#8217;an was proclaimed to the Arabs it amazed them beyond all limits. It was like nothing they had ever heard before. It did not fit into the 16 categories of poetry, nor was it the speech of a soothsayer, and it certainly was not normal speech. If it was not all these, then it could only be the word of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eloquence and majesty of the early chapters of the Qur&#8217;an moved many to tears, and the beautiful Qur&#8217;anic Arabic converted millions of Arabs in the Middle-East. Not only did the Qur&#8217;an effect the lives of these Arabs, but it also transformed their culture. Even today, no serious study of the Arabic language is possible without reference to this book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reaction of some pagans was that they accused Muhammed (Peace be upon him) of being a soothsayer and a madman. In order to silence them, Allah issued a challenge. At first he asked them to produce a book like the Qur&#8217;an. When it could not be done, Allah asked them to produce ten chapters like it. When this too could not be done Allah finally stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And if you are in doubt as to what We have revealed to Our slave, then produce a chapter like it&#8221; (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:23)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The smallest chapter in the Qur&#8217;an is only 3 verses long (Chapter 108). The pagans at the time of the Prophet (Peace be upon him) could not even produce something as small as this, and since then no one else has completed this impossible task. All of this is in light of the fact that the Prophet Muhammed (Peace be upon him) could not read or write, thus refuting those who say that the Qur&#8217;an was his own handiwork.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur&#8217;an is the Final book of revelation. After it there will be no more. However, many have tried to deny this by producing their own new versions of the Qur&#8217;an. Among them have been the two false prophets, Musailama[5] and Ghulam Ahmed[6]. Many Chapters in the Qur&#8217;an are named after animals, such as the Ant, Spider etc. Musailama tried to copy this, and went about creating a chapter in his book called the Weasel! In Arabic it is called Al-Wabl and it hardly causes people to be struck in awe! On the other hand Ghulam Ahmed, the &#8216;British stooge&#8217;, claimed to receive revelation in cockney English!! Such foolishness could never compare to the beauty of the Qur&#8217;an with its clear and beautiful Arabic language.</p>
<p><strong>Science</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Over the past few decades much interest has been shown in the scientific content of the Qur&#8217;an. Scientific data which has been discovered in recent times, has been existent in this book for 1400 years. In fact the very common origin of this universe is stated clearly by Allah, the Most High:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Do not the disbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together, then We parted them. And We made from water every living thing. Will they then not believe?&#8221; (Surah Al-Anbiya 21:30)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This parting of the heavens and the earth is more commonly known to scientists as the &#8216;big bang&#8217;. It is also a fact that life originated from water and that every living cell is composed of 85% water. Without water life is impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The mountains of the earth, like icebergs, have roots going deep into the ground. This ensures that they will not topple with their extreme heights &#8211; this is known as &#8216;isostasy&#8217;. In this way the mountains are like the stakes which are used to anchor a tent. But this fact is already known to us when Allah says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Have We not made the earth an expanse and the mountains stakes?&#8221; (Surah An-Naba 78:6-7)<br />
&#8220;Allah has cast into the ground mountains standing firm so that it does not shake with you&#8221; (Surah Luqman 31:10)</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The embryological data which is found in the Qur&#8217;an is astounding. Allah describes the formation of a baby inside the womb from the very moment the sperm reaches the ovum, to its formation into a human. This data, which was only discovered about 30 years ago, has amazed many Western scientists. Amongst them is Dr Keith Moore from the University of Toronto, Canada. Dr Moore[7] is a recognized authority in embryological circles, with his university text book being set as a standard text in many universities throughout the world. When Dr Moore was asked as to how this information in the Qur&#8217;an could be explained, he replied: &#8220;It could only have been divinely revealed&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>History</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur&#8217;an is a book of historical accuracy. One accuracy which has corrected the mistakes of many Christians and historians, is the fate of the pharaoh who drowned in the Red Sea whilst pursuing Moses. The Biblical story would have us believe that the matter ended when the pharaoh drowned. But the Qur&#8217;an explains further. When he was drowning the pharaoh confessed his faith in Allah. But it was too late, and Allah promised him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This day We shall preserve you in your body, so that you may be a sign for those who come after you. But indeed many of mankind are heedless of Our signs&#8221; (Surah Yunus 10:92)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In 1898 the tombs of various pharaohs were discovered in the Valley of the Kings, in Egypt. In 1975 Dr Maurice Bucaille, an eminent French surgeon was allowed to examine the mummified bodies of Rameses II and the pharaoh who had pursued Moses &#8211; Merneptah. Dr Bucaille discovered that Merneptah had received very violent blows to several parts of his body and had suffered a massive heart attack. Amazingly, these are the results which occur when someone dies from drowning! Thus Allah had saved the body of the transgressing pharaoh as a sign for all humanity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For those who say that Muhammed (Peace be upon him) knew his history and wrote it in the Qur&#8217;an, the following shall prove otherwise. In the year 615 CE the Roman army was defeated by the Persians. About this event Allah revealed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Romans have been defeated in the lowest land, but in a few years they shall be victorious again, within three to nine years. The decision of the matter, before and after, is only with Allah&#8221; (Surah Ar-Rum 30:24)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The words of Allah proved true as the Persians were defeated at the battle of Issus, 7 years later in 622 CE. There is no possible way that Muhammed (Peace be upon him) could have known (if he wrote the Qur&#8217;an) that the Romans would be victorious. In fact he also did not know that the &#8216;lowest land&#8217; at which the battle was fought was literally that. The battle in 615 CE was fought on the shores of the Dead Sea, the lowest point below sea level on earth, at 1300 ft.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A book with these credentials could only be from the Creator of the heavens and the earth. A book which we need to acquaint ourselves with. A book . . .</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;. . . which has been revealed to you (O&#8217; Muhammed) so that you may lead mankind out of the darkness and into the light&#8221; (Surah lbrahim 14:1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Footnotes</strong> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 The word &#8216;WE&#8217; does not mean that there is more then one God. Rather it is a plural of respect which gives Allah grandeur over his creation.<br />
2 The Baghyad Gita is one of the Hindu scriptures.<br />
3 The Guru Granth Sahib is the Sikh scripture<br />
4 The most recent version of the Bible is the &#8216;Politically Correct Version&#8217;!!<br />
5 Musailama claimed prophethood just before the death of the Prophet Muhammed (Peace be upon him). He was from the region of Yamaamah in Arabia and from the tribe of Haneefah.<br />
6 Ghulam Ahmed was born in 1840 in Qadian, India. He claimed prophethood at the request of his imperialist masters, the British Government.<br />
7 Besides Dr Moore, there have been many other famous Western scientists who have accepted Islam. One of the most prominent was the famous French oceanographer, Jacques Yves Cousteau who has recently passed away. Cousteau was amazed at the accuracy of the Qur&#8217;anic statements regarding underwater activity and thus embraced Islam. As a result of his death, Cousteau&#8217;s life achievements have been highlighted in the Western media. However his acceptance of Islam was conveniently absent from the news-reports.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the biggest misconceptions that many non-Muslims have about Islam have to do with the word “Allah“. For various reasons, many people have come to believe that Muslims worship a different God than Christians and Jews. This is totally false, since “Allah” is simply the Arabic word for “God” – and there is only One God. Let there be no doubt – Muslims worship the God of Noah, Abraham, Moses, David and Jesus – peace be upon them all. However, it is certainly true that Jews, Christians and Muslims all have different concepts of Almighty God. For example, Muslims – like Jews – reject the Christian beliefs of the Trinity and the Divine Incarnation. This, however, doesn’t mean that each of these three religions worships a different God – because, as we have already said, there is only One True God. Judaism, Christianity and Islam all claim to be “Abrahamic Faiths“, and all of them are also classified as “monotheistic“. However, Islam teaches that other religions have, in one way or another, distorted and nullified a pure and proper belief in Almighty God by neglecting His true teachings and mixing them with man-made ideas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First of all, it is important to note that “Allah” is the same word that Arabic-speaking Christians and Jews use for God. If you pick up an Arabic Bible, you will see the word “Allah” being used where “God” is used in English. (Click here to see some examples of the word “Allah” in the Arabic Bible.) This is because “Allah” is the only word in the Arabic language equivalent to the English word “God” with a capital “G”. Additionally, the word “Allah” cannot be made plural or given gender (i.e. masculine or feminine), which goes hand-in-hand with the Islamic concept of God. Because of this, and also because the Qur’an, which is the holy scripture of Muslims, was revealed in the Arabic language, some Muslims use the word “Allah” for “God“, even when they are speaking other languages. This is not unique to the word “Allah“, since many Muslims tend to use Arabic words when discussing Islamic issues, regardless of the language which they speak. This is because the universal teachings of Islam – even though they have been translated in every major language – have been preserved in the Arabic language.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is interesting to note that the Aramaic word “El“, which is the word for God in the language that Jesus spoke, is certainly more similar in sound to the word “Allah” than the English word “God“. This also holds true for the various Hebrew words for God, which are “El” and “Elah“, and the plural form “Elohim“. The reason for these similarities is that Aramaic, Hebrew and Arabic are all Semitic languages with common origins. It should also be noted that in translating the Bible into English, the Hebrew word “El” is translated variously as “God“, “God” and “angel”! This imprecise language allows different translators, based on their preconceived notions, to translate the word to fit their own views. The Arabic word “Allah” presents no such difficulty or ambiguity, since it is only used for Almighty God alone. Additionally, in English, the only difference between “God“, meaning a false God, and “God“, meaning the One True God, is the capital “G”. In the Arabic alphabet, since it does not have capital letters, the word for God (i.e. Allah) is formed by adding the equivalent to the English word “the” (Al-) to the Arabic word for “God/God” (ilah). So the Arabic word “Allah” literally it means “The God” – the “Al-” in Arabic basically serving the same function as the capital “G” in English. Due to the above mentioned facts, a more accurate translation of the word “Allah” into English might be “The One -and-Only God” or “The One True God“.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">More importantly, it should also be noted that the Arabic word “Allah” contains a deep religious message due to its root meaning and origin. This is because it stems from the Arabic verb ta’Allaha (or alaha), which means “to be worshipped”. Thus in Arabic, the word “Allah” means “The One who deserves all worship”. This, in a nutshell, is the Pure Monotheistic message of Islam. You see, according to Islam, “monotheism” is much more than simply believing in the existence of “only One God” – as seemingly opposed to two, three or more. If one understands the root meaning of the word “Allah“, this point should become clear. One should understand that Islam’s criticism of the other religions that claim to be “monotheistic” is not because they are “polytheistic” in the classic sense, but because they direct various forms of worship to other than Almighty God. We will discuss the meaning of worship in Islam below, however, before moving on it should be noted that many non-Muslims are unaware of the distinction between simply believing in the existence of only One God and reserving all worship for Him alone. Many Christians are painfully unaware of this point, and thus you often find them asking how Muslims can accuse the followers of Jesus, peace be upon him, of being “polytheists” when they were all “monotheistic Jews”. First of all, it should be clarified that the word “polytheist” doesn’t really sound right in this context, since to many it implies simply believing in the existence of more than one God. So in an Islamic context, “associators”, “man-worshippers” or “creature worshippers” might be more accurate and appropriate terms – especially since Christians believe Jesus to be both “100% God and 100% man”, while still paying lip-service to God‘s “Oneness”. However, as we previously touched upon, what is really at the root of this problem is the fact that Christians – as well as the members of other religions – don’t really know what “monotheism” means – especially in the Islamic sense. All of the books, articles and papers that I’ve read which were written by Christians invariably limit “monotheism” to believing in the existence of “One Sovereign and Creator God“. Islam, however, teaches much more than this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Suffice it to say that just because someone claims to be a “monotheistic” Jew, Christian or Muslim, that doesn’t keep them from falling into corrupt beliefs and idolatrous practices. Many people, including some Muslims, claim belief in “One God” even though they’ve fallen into acts of idolatry. Certainly, many Protestants accuse Roman Catholics of idolatrous practices in regards to the saints and the Virgin Mary. Likewise, the Greek Orthodox Church is considered “idolatrous” by many other Christians because in much of their worship they use icons. However, if you ask a Roman Catholic or a Greek Orthodox person if God is “One”, they will invariably answer: “Yes!”…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…This brings us to a more important point: It should be clearly understood that what Islam is primarily concerned with is correcting mankind’s concept of Almighty God. What we are ultimately going to be held accountable at the end of our life is not whether we prefer the word “Allah” over the word “God“, but what our concept of God is. Language is only a side issue. A person can have an incorrect concept of God while using the word “Allah“, and likewise a person can have a correct concept of God while using the word “God“. This is because both of these words are equally capable of being misused and being improperly defined. As we’ve already mentioned, using the word “Allah” no more insinuates belief in the Unity of God than the use of the word “God” insinuates belief in the Trinity – or any other theological opinion. Naturally, when God sends a revelation to mankind through a prophet, He is going to send it in a language that the people who receive it can understand and relate to. Almighty God makes this clear in the Qur’an, when He states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Never did We send a Messenger except (to teach) in the language of his (own) people in order to make (things) clear to them.” (Qur’an, Chapter 14 – “Abraham”, Verse 4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Muslims, we think that it is unfortunate that we have to go into details on such seemingly minor issues, but so many falsehoods have been heaped upon our religion, that we feel that it is our duty to try to break down the barriers of falsehood. This isn’t always easy, since there is a lot of anti-Islamic literature in existence which tries to make Islam look like something strange and foreign to Westerners. There are some people out there, who are obviously not on the side of truth, that want to get people to believe that “Allah” is just some Arabian “God“, and that Islam is completely “other” – meaning that it has no common roots with the other Abrahamic religions (i.e. Christianity and Judaism). To say that Muslims worship a different “God” because they say “Allah” is just as illogical as saying that French people worship another God because they use the word “Dieu“, that Spanish-speaking people worship a different God because they say “Dios” or that the Hebrews worshipped a different God because they sometimes call Him “Yahweh“. Certainly, reasoning like this is quite ridiculous! It should also be mentioned, that claiming that any one language uses the only correct word for God is tantamount to denying the universality of God‘s message to mankind, which was to all nations, tribes and people through various prophets who spoke different languages.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align:left;">Sharh Usoolul-Eemaan (pp.4-7)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh said in <em>Sharh Usoolul-Eemaan</em> (pp.4-7):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] <strong>The deen (religion) of Islaam</strong>: It is the way of life that Allaah sent the Prophet Muhammad <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> with. By it, Allaah terminated the validity of all other religions, perfected this religion for His worshippers, completed His favour upon them and has chosen only this religion for them &#8211; no other religion will be accepted by Him from anyone. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Muhammad is not the father of any man amongst you. Rather he is the Messenger of Allaah and the khaatim (last and final) of the Prophets.&#8221;</strong> [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:40].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islaam as your religion.&#8221;</strong> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:3].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Indeed the religion with Allaah is Islaam.&#8221;</strong> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan 3:19].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Whosoever seeks a religion other than Islaam, never will it be accepted from him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.&#8221;</strong> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan 3:85].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; obligated all of mankind to take Islaam as their religion. So Allaah said, whilst addressing His Messenger <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Say: O Mankind! Indeed I have been sent to you all as the Messenger of Allaah; to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. None has the right to be worshipped except Him; it is He who gives life and cause death. So believe in Allaah and His Messenger &#8211; the Prophet who can neither read nor write &#8211; who believes in Allaah and His Words. So follow the Messenger of Allaah so that you may be rightly-guided.&#8221;</strong> [Soorah al-A&#8217;raaf 7:158].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in <em>Saheeh Muslim</em> (1/93), from Abu Hurayrah <em>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</em> that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> said: <em>&#8220;By Him in whose Hand is the life of Muhammad! There is no one from this nation, be he a Jew or a Christian, who hears of me and dies whilst not having eemaan (faith) in what I have been sent with, except that he will be one of the companions of the Hellfire.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em>eemaan</em> (faith) in the Prophet implies: affirming that which he was sent with, along with acceptance of it and submission to it. Without these two matters, mere affirmation is not sufficient. This is why even though Abu Taalib (the Prophet&#8217;s uncle) affirmed what was sent to the Prophet <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> and that Islaam was the best of religions, yet he did not accept his message nor submit to it; and thus he did not have <em>eemaan</em> in the Prophet <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] <strong>The religion of Islaam</strong> contains all that was beneficial from the previous religions. It is suitable for implementation in any age, any where and by any nation. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said, whilst addressing His Messenger <em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And We have sent down to you the Book in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it, testifying to the truth contained therein whilst exposing the falsehood that has been added therein.&#8221;</strong> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:48].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That Islaam is suitable for implementation in any age, any where and by any nation does not mean that it becomes submissive to nations &#8211; being altered and changed by them &#8211; as some people falsely think. But rather it means that whenever it is truly adhered to then it brings benefit and goodness to that nation, as well as reforming and correcting it &#8211; in whatever age or place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] <strong>The religion of Islaam</strong> is the religion of truth. It is the way of life that Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; guaranteed His help and victory to those who truly adhere to it, and that He would make it dominant over all other religions. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;It is He who has sent His Messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth, that it may prevail over all other religions, even if the pagans detest it.&#8221;</strong> [Soorah at-Tawbah 9:33].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Allaah has promised to those amongst you who truly have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith and belief) and act in obedience to Allaah and His Messenger, that He will grant them ruler ship upon the earth, just as He granted it to those before them, and that He will establish their Religion for them and grant them the authority to practice their Religion which He chose and ordered them with. And He will certainly change their situation to one of security, after their fear. Providing that they worship and obey Me, not associating anything else in worship with Me. Then, whoever rejects this favour by disobedience to their Lord &#8211; then they are the rebellious transgressors.&#8221;</strong> [Soorah an-Noor 24:55].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] The religion of Islaam is a complete religion comprising both <em>&#8216;aqeedah</em> (beliefs) and <em>sharee&#8217;ah</em> (laws).</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>It commands them with <em>tawheed</em> (to single out Allaah alone for worship) and prohibits them from shirk (associating partners with Allaah, in that which is particular to Him).</li>
<li>It commands them with being truthful and prohibits them from lying.</li>
<li>It commands them with <em>&#8216;adl</em> (justice) and prohibits them from injustice and oppression.</li>
<li>It commands them with fulfilling trusts and prohibits them from acting treacherously.</li>
<li>It commands them keeping promises and prohibits them from breaking them.</li>
<li>It commands them with kindness and good treatment of parents and prohibits them from disobedience to them in that which is not sinful.</li>
<li>It commands them with joining the ties of relations and prohibits them from severing them.</li>
<li>It commands them with good treatment of neighbours and prohibits the causing of harm to them.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In short, Islaam orders alls that is good, from manners and morals, and prohibits all that is evil from it. Likewise, it orders all actions which are righteous and good and prohibits all actions that are evil and harmful. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Indeed Allaah enjoins upon you justice, kindness and the giving of good to relatives and near ones. And He prohibits you from all shameful and evil deeds, oppression and transgression. Thus He admonishes you, that you may take heed and be reminded.&#8221;</strong> [Soorah an-Nahl 16:90].</p>
