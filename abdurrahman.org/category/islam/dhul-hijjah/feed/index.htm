<p>Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">“<strong>There are no days during which the righteous action is so pleasing to Allah than these days (i.e., the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah)</strong>.” He was asked: “O Messenger of Allah, not even Jihad in the Cause of Allah?” He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, “Not even Jihad in the Cause of Allah, except in case one goes forth with his life and his property and does not return with either of it.”</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/defects-in-the-sacrificial-animal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[The following is posted from: <a title="The Conditions of a Sacrificial Offering – Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2009/11/19/the-conditions-of-a-sacrificial-offering/">The Conditions of a Sacrificial Offering</a> – Imaam Muhammad bin Saalih Al-‘Uthaimeen ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Third Condition:</strong> The animal must be free of any defect that would prevent its slaughter from being valid and acceptable. These defects are of four types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <span style="color:#993300;">Clear defectiveness of the eye</span>: This is when the animal’s eye becomes sunken or it sticks out to the point that it looks like a knob or it becomes a pale white indicating clearly that it is one-eyed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. <span style="color:#993300;">Clear illness</span>: This is when the animal exhibits signs of sickness, such as a fever that keeps it from grazing and causes a loss of appetite, or an obvious scabies infection that will spoil its meat and harm a person’s health (if he eats it), or a deep wound that threatens to affect its health and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. <span style="color:#993300;">Clear limping</span>: This is when the animal is unable to step safely (without hurting itself) when walking.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. <span style="color:#993300;">Emaciation that causes brain loss</span>: This is based on what the Prophet said when he was asked about what types of animals one should avoid when sacrificing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He gestured with his hand and said: <strong>“They are four: The lame animal that clearly walks crookedly; the one-eyed animal that clearly has a defect in the eye; the sick animal that clearly has signs of illness; and the emaciated animal that is (usually) not picked.”</strong> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth was reported by Maalik in al-Muwatta from Al-Baraa’ bin ‘Aazib. In another version of this report narrated by Al-Baraa’ found in the <em>Sunan</em> collections, he said: “The Messenger of Allaah stood up amongst us and said: <strong>‘Four types (of animals) are not permissible to use as sacrificial offerings…’</strong> and he went on to mention them.” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore if these four defects are found in an animal, they prevent its slaughter and sacrifice from being valid. This goes as well for any other defect that is similar to or worse than these, which means that it is also not valid to sacrifice the following types of animals:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. A blind animal that cannot see with both its eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. An animal suffering from nausea until it releases its load and its harm is removed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. An animal that has been assisted in giving birth if natural delivery is difficult until the threat of danger is removed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. An animal afflicted by something fatal such as choking, falling from a high place, and so on until the threat of danger is removed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. A crippled animal, which is an animal that cannot walk due to a physical disability.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. An animal with one of its front legs or back legs broken.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if these last defects are added to the four mentioned in the narrations, the types of animals that cannot be slaughtered become ten in total. There are these six types plus the animals that suffer from the four previously mentioned defects.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(36. Verily, the number of months with Allah is twelve months (in a year), so was it ordained by Allah on the Day when He created the heavens and the earth; <strong>of them four are sacred</strong>. That is the right religion, so <strong>wrong not yourselves therein</strong>, and fight against the Mushrikin idolaters collectively as they fight against you collectively. But know that Allah is with those who have Taqwa.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Soorat at-Tawbah 9:36</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Year consists of Twelve Months</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Bakrah said that the Prophet said in a speech during his Hajj,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The division of time has turned to its original form which was current when Allah created the heavens and the earth. The year is of twelve months, out of which four months are sacred: Three are in succession Dhul-Qa`dah, Dhul-Hijjah and Muharram, and (the fourth is) Rajab of (the tribe of) Mudar which comes between Jumada (Ath-Thaniyah) and Sha`ban.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet then asked, (What is the day today&#8217;) We said, &#8220;Allah and His Messenger know better. He kept quiet until we thought that he might give that day another name. He said (Isn&#8217;t it the day of Nahr) We replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He further asked, (Which month is this) We again said, &#8220;Allah and His Messenger know better,&#8221; and he kept quiet and made us think that he might give it another name. Then he said,(Isn&#8217;t it the month of Dhul-Hijjah) We replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He asked, (What town is this) We said, &#8220;Allah and His Messenger know better,&#8221; and he kept quiet until we thought that he might change its name. He asked, (Isn&#8217;t this the (Sacred) Town) We said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Verily! Your blood, property and honor are sacred to one another like the sanctity of this day of yours, in this month of yours and in this city of yours. Verily, you will meet your Lord and He will question you about your actions. Behold! Do not revert to misguidance after me by striking the necks of one another. Have I conveyed It is incumbent upon those who are present to inform those who are absent, because those who are absent might comprehend (what I have said) better than some who are present.)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari and Muslim collected this Hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In a small book collected by Shaykh `Alam ad-Din As-Sakhawi, entitled, Al-Mashhur fi Asma&#8217; Al-Ayam wash-Shuhur, he mentioned that <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Muharram is so named because it is a sacred month. To me, it was so named to emphasize its sacredness.</strong></span> This is because the Arabs would switch it around. One year they would say it was a sacred month, the following year they would say that it was not. The author said, &#8220;&#8230;and <strong>Safar</strong> is so named because they used to leave their homes during that month for fighting and traveling. When saying `Safir&#8217; a place, it means to leave it&#8230; <strong>Rabi` Al-Awwal</strong> is called that because they used to do Irtiba` in it, that is to maintain one&#8217;s property&#8230; and <strong>Rabi` Al-Akhir</strong>, was so named for the same reasons. <strong>Jumada</strong> is called that because the water would dry up (Jamud) then&#8230;.They say <strong>Jumada Al-Uwla</strong> and <strong>Al-Awwal</strong>, or Jumada Al-Akhar or Al-Akhirah. <strong>Rajab</strong> comes from Tarjib, meaning to honor. <strong>Sha`ban</strong> because the tribes would separate and return to their homes. <strong>Ramadan</strong> was so named because of the severity of the Ramda&#8217; &#8211; that is &#8211; the heat, and they say that the branch Ramadat when it is thirsty&#8230;And the saying that it is a Name of Allah is a mistake, for there is no proof or support for that&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">The Sacred Months</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(of them four are sacred).</strong></span> The Arabs used to consider these months sacred during the time of Jahiliyyah, except for a group of them called Al-Basl, who held eight months of the year to be sacred as way of exaggeration in religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(Three are in succession; Dhul-Qa`dah, Dhul-Hijjah and Muharram, and (the fourth is) Rajab of (the tribe of) Mudar which comes between Jumada (Ath-Thani) and Sha`ban).</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said &#8220;Rajab of Mudar&#8221; to attest to the custom of Mudar, in saying that Rajab is the month that is between Jumada and Sha`ban, not as the tribe of Rabi`ah thought, that it is between Sha`ban and Shawwal, which is Ramadan in the present calendar. The four Sacred Months were made four, three in succession and one alone, so that the Hajj and `Umrah are performed with ease. Dhul-Qa`dah, the month before the Hajj month, was made sacred because they refrained from fighting during that month. Dhul-Hijjah, the next month, was made sacred because it is the month of Hajj, during which they performed Hajj rituals. <strong>Muharram, which comes next, was made sacred so that they are able to go back to their areas in safety after performing Hajj</strong>. Rajab, in the middle of the lunar year, was made sacred so that those coming from the farthest areas of Arabia are able to perform `Umrah and visit the House and then go back to their areas safely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(That is the right religion),</span> that is the Straight Law, requiring implementing Allah&#8217;s order concerning the months that He made sacred and their true count as it was originally written by Allah. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(so wrong not yourselves therein)</span> during these Sacred Months, for sin in them is worse than sin in other months. Likewise, sins in the Sacred City are written multiplied,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;and whoever inclines to evil actions therein (in Makkah) or to do wrong, him We shall cause to taste from a painful torment) 22:25. <strong>Similarly, sin in general is worse during the Sacred Months</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Ali bin Abi Talhah narrated that Ibn `Abbas said, Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Verily, the number of months with Allah&#8230;),</span> is connected to</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(so wrong not yourselves therein),</span> &#8220;In all (twelve) months. Allah then chose four out of these months and made them sacred, emphasizing their sanctity, making sinning in them greater, in addition to, multiplying rewards of righteous deeds during them.&#8221; Qatadah said about Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(so wrong not yourselves therein)</span>, <strong>&#8220;Injustice during the Sacred Months is worse and graver than injustice in other months. Verily, injustice is always wrong, but Allah makes things graver than others as He will.&#8221;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Allah has chosen some of His creation above others. He chose Messengers from angels and from men. He also chose His Speech above all speech, the Masajid above other areas of the earth, Ramadan and the Sacred Months above all months, Friday above the other days and Laylatul-Qadr (The Night of Decree) above all nights. Therefore, sanctify what Allah has sanctified, for doing so is the practice of people of understanding and comprehension.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Fighting in the Sacred Months</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(and fight against the idolators collectively),</span> all of you,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(as they fight against you collectively.)</span>, all of them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(But know that Allah is with those who have Taqwa)</span>, and know that initiating battle during the Sacred Months is forbidden. Allah said in other Ayat,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(O you who believe! Violate not the sanctity of the symbols of Allah, nor of the sacred month.)</span> 5:2,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(The Sacred Month is for the Sacred Month, and for the prohibited things, there is the law of equality (Qisas). Then whoever transgresses the prohibition against you, you transgress likewise against him)</span> 2:194, and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Then when the Sacred Months have passed, kill the idolators&#8230;)</span> 9:5. As for Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(And fight against the idolators collectively as they fight against you collectively)</span>, it includes permission for the believers to fight the idolators in the Sacred Month, if the idolators initiate hostilities therein. Allah said in other Ayat,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(The Sacred Month is for the Sacred Month, and for the prohibited things, there is the law of equality (Qisas))</span> 2:194, and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(And fight not with them at Al-Masjid Al-Haram, unless they (first) fight you there. But if they attack you, then kill them.)</span> 2:191.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Messenger of Allah laying siege to At-Ta&#8217;if until the Sacred Month started, it was a continuation of the battle against Hawazin and their allies from Thaqif. They started the fighting and gathered their men for the purpose of conducting war. The Messenger of Allah marched to meet them and when they took refuge in At-Ta&#8217;if, the Prophet laid siege to them so that they descend from their forts, but they inflicted casualties on Muslims. The siege continued for about forty days, during which a Sacred Month began, and the siege continued for several days in that month. The Messenger broke the siege and went back (to Makkah). So fighting that carries over into it the Sacred Month is not the same as initiating warfare during it, Allah knows best.</p>

<p><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The following is posted from Tafseer Ibn Kathir , Darussalam:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">﴿فَصَلِّ لِرَبِّكَ وَانْحَرْ ﴾</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Therefore turn in prayer to your Lord and sacrifice.</strong></span>) meaning, `just as We have given you the abundant goodness in this life and the Hereafter &#8212; and from that is the river that has been described previously &#8212; then make your obligatory and optional prayer, and your sacrifice (of animals) solely and sincerely for your Lord. Woship Him alone and do not associate any partner with him. And sacrifice pronouncing His Name alone, without ascribing any partner to Him.&#8217; This is as Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">﴿قُلْ إِنَّ صَلاَتِى وَنُسُكِى وَمَحْيَاىَ وَمَمَاتِى للَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ &#8211; لاَ شَرِيكَ لَهُ وَبِذَلِكَ أُمِرْتُ وَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ ﴾</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: &#8220;Verily, my Salah, my sacrifice, my living, and my dying are for Allah, the Lord of all that exists. He has no partner. And of this I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims.&#8221;</strong></span>) (6:162-163)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn `Abbas, `Ata,&#8217; Mujahid, `Ikrimah and Al-Hasan all said, &#8220;This means with this the Budn should be sacrificed.&#8221; Qatadah, Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi, Ad-Dahhak, Ar-Rabi`, `Ata&#8217; Al-Khurasani, Al-Hakam, Isma`il bin Abi Khalid and others from the Salaf have all said the same. This is the opposite of the way of the idolators, prostrating to other than Allah and sacrificing in other than His Name. Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">﴿وَلاَ تَأْكُلُواْ مِمَّا لَمْ يُذْكَرِ اسْمُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ وَإِنَّهُ لَفِسْقٌ﴾</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And do not eat from what Allah&#8217;s Name has not been pronounced over, indeed that is Fisq</span></strong>.) (6:121)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>وَلَيَالٍ عَشْرٍ</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>AND BY THE TEN NIGHTS</strong><br />
[[Meaning: And by the ten nights.]] Sooratul-Fajr (89):2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>AS-SA’DEE:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“He swore an oath after it by the ten nights; and they are, upon the correct saying, the [last] ten nights of Ramadaan, or the [first] ten of Dhul-Hijjah, since they are nights which comprise virtuous days; and such acts of worship and devotion occur in them as do not occur in other than them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in the [last] ten nights of Ramadaan Laylatul-Qadr (the Night of Decree) occurs, which is better than a thousand months; and in their days the fasting at the end of Ramadaan occurs, which is one of the pillars of Islam. And in the [first] ten days of Dhul-Hijjah there occurs the standing in ‘Arafah, wherein Allah forgives His servants with forgiveness that causes Satan to grieve.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Satan is never seen to be more humiliated and rejected then he is on the day ‘Arafah, because of what he sees from the descending of the Angels and mercy from Allah upon His servants; and many of the actions of the Hajj, and the ‘Umrah occur in them, and these are matters greatly honoured, and are deserving that Allah should swear an oath by them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">*</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>AT-TABAREE:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The people of explanation disagree about which ten nights these are. So some of them said: They are the ten nights of Dhul-Hijjah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">… Ibn ‘Abbas said: “The ten nights which Allah swore an oath by are the first ten nights of Dhul-Hijjah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">… ‘Ikrimah said: “The ten of Dhul-Hijjah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">… Mujaahid said regarding the saying of Allah-the Mighty and Majestic: وَلَيَالٍ عَشْرٍ : “The ten of Dhul-Hijjah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">… Qataadah said: “It used to be narrated to us that they are the ten of al-Adhaa.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">… Ibn Zayd said: “The first ones of Dhul-Hijjah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whereas others said: They are the ten (nights) at the beginning of Ramadaan. However what is the correct saying in that regard in our view is that they are the ten of al-Adhaa, because of the consensus of the evidence from the people of explanation upon it…”</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">*</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>‘ABDUR-RAZZAAQ</strong> </span>said in his ‘Tafseer’: “From Ma’mar: from Qataadah, regarding His Saying: <strong>وَلَيَالٍ عَشْرٍ : </strong>&#8220;The first ten of Dhul-Hijjah: (Allah made them the completion for Moosaa)’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">… Masrooq said: “They are the best of the days of the year.”</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">*</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>IBN KATHEER:</strong></span> “What is meant by the ten nights is the ten of Dhul-Hijjah, as was said by Ibn ‘Abbaas, Ibn az-Zubayr, Mujaahid, and a number of the Salaf and the later people; and it is established in the ‘Saheeh’ of al-Bukharee [no.969] traced back to the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم: &lt;&lt;There are no days wherein righteous action is more beloved to Allaah than these days&gt;&gt; &#8211; meaning the ten of Dhul-Hijjah. They said: “Not even Jihaad in Allah’s cause?” He said: &lt;&lt;Not even Jihaad in Allah’s cause, except for a man who goes out with his person and his wealth, and then he did not return with anything from that.&gt;&gt; And it is said: what is meant by that is the first ten of Muharram. Aboo Ja’far ibn Jareer quoted it, but he did not ascribe it to anyone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Aboo Kudaymah narrated from Qaaboos ibn Abee Zabyaan: from his father: from Ibn ‘Abbaas that he said concerning <strong>وَلَيَالٍ عَشْرٍ</strong> : It is the first ten of Ramadaan”, but what is correct is the first saying…”</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">*</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>ASH-SHAWKAANEE:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“They are the ten of Dhul-Hijjah upon the saying of the majority of the people of Tafseer…”</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">*</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Shaikh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen</strong></span> said in his ‘Tafseer Juz· ‘Amma’:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It is said that what is meant by <strong>وَلَيَالٍ عَشْرٍ</strong> is the ten of Dhul-Hijjah; and the days are referred to as ‘nights’ since the Arabic language is vast. So ‘nights’ may be mentioned when what is actually meant is the days; and ‘days’ can mean ‘nights’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is otherwise said that <strong>وَلَيَالٍ عَشْرٍ</strong> means the last ten nights of Ramadaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for upon the first (saying): those who say that what is meant by the ten nights is the ten of Dhul-Hijjah, then this is because the ten days of Dhul-Hijjah are virtuous days concerning which the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم said: &lt;&lt;There are no days wherein righteous action is more beloved to Allah than these ten days&gt;&gt; They said: “Not even Jihaad in Allah’s cause?” He said: &lt;&lt;Not even Jihaad in Allah’s cause, except for a man who went out with his person and his wealth, and then he did not return from that with anything.&gt;&gt; [Reported by al-Bukhaaree (no.969).]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who said that what is meant by the ten nights is the last ten nights of Ramadaan, then they said: the basic principle regarding ‘<em>layaalee</em>’ (nights) is that it refers to nights, and not to days; and they said: the last ten nights of Ramadaan contain the Night of Decree (Laylatul-Qadr), concerning which Allaah said :</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"> <strong>خَيْرٌ مِّنْ أَلْفِ شَهْرٍ<br />
</strong>[Sooratul-Qadr (97):3]</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[[Meaning: It is better than a thousand months]]; and He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>إِنَّا أَنزَلْنَاهُ فِي لَيْلَةٍ مُّبَارَكَةٍ ۚ إِنَّا كُنَّا مُنذِرِينَ</strong><br />
<strong>فِيهَا يُفْرَقُ كُلُّ أَمْرٍ حَكِيمٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[Sooratud-Dukhaan (44): 3-4]<br />
[[Meaning: Indeed We sent the Qur·aan down on a blessed night. Indeed We are warning Our creation. Within it every ordained affair is decreed]];</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and this saying is stronger than the first saying, even though the first saying is the saying of the majority.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the wording does not support the saying of the majority; rather it strengthens the second saying, that it is the last ten nights of Ramadaan; and Allah swore an oath by them because of their eminence, and because they contain the Night of Decree; and because with them the Muslims conclude the month of Ramadaan, which is the time of one of the obligatory duties of Islaam, and one of the pillars of Islaam. So therefore Allah swore an oath by these nights.&gt;&gt;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The second question of Fatwa no. 1474</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Q2: Is it permissible for a person to offer an Ud-hiyah (sacrificial animal offered by non-pilgrims) on behalf of a dead person?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: All Muslims have agreed upon its permissibility. So, it is permissible to offer Ud-hiyah on behalf of a dead person because of the generality of the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>When a man dies, his acts come to an end, but three, recurring charity, or knowledge (by which people) benefit, or a pious son, who prays for him (for the deceased).</strong>[1]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">(Narrated by Muslim, Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhy, Al-Nasa&#8217;y and Al-Bukhari in his book Al-Adab Al-Mufrad on the authority of Abu Hurayrah) </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Offering Ud-hiyah on behalf of the dead is also considered a Sadaqah Jariyah (ongoing charity) because it benefits the person offering it, the dead person and other people.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<p class="videodescription" style="text-align:center;">The Virtues of the Ten Days of Dhul-Hijjah &#8211; Shaykh Muhammad bin Saalih Al-&#8216;Uthaymeen رحمه الله. Translated by Abu &#8216;Abdullah Naasir Hussain حفظه الله.</p>
<p class="videodescription" style="text-align:left;"><strong>Transcription of the Video:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Shaykh Muhammad bin Saalih Al-‘Uthaymeen:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praises, abundant and blessed, are for Allah. I testify that none deserves to be worshipped except Allah alone, who has no partners a testimony which saves the one who says it from the punishment of Allah, and I testify that indeed Muhammad is His true worshipper and messenger. May the praise of Allah and peace be upon him, his family, his companions and everyone who follows them correctly until the Day of Judgment. As for what proceeds, O worshippers of Allah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You are indeed coming upon the ten blessed days, which Allah swore by in His statement:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">وَالْفَجْرِ وَلَيَالٍ عَشْرٍ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;By the dawn. By the ten nights.&#8221;</strong></span> [Soorah AI-Fajr: 1-2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is intended by the ten nights, as is held by many of the commentators, is that they are the ten days of Dhul-Hijjah. And the Prophet, may the praise of Allah and peace be upon him and his family, said about them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">There are no days in which the righteous actions are more beloved to Allah than these ten days.” They (the companions) said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, not even Jihad in the path of Allah?&#8221; He replied: &#8220;Not even Jihad in the path of Allah, except the one who goes out with his self and his wealth and returns with none of them</span>.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning that he went out and was martyred and didn’t return with anything. So, increase in these ten days, O brothers, increase in actions of righteousness: prayer and recitation of the Qur’aan, remembrance of Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, giving charity, fasting&#8230; Indeed the Prophet, may the praise of Allah and peace be upon him, did not make this statement except as an encouragement to hasten towards righteous actions. Audibly, and in abundance, say the takbeer (Allah is the Greatest). Abundantly utter the statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><i>Allaahu akbar, Allaahu akbar, laa ilaaha ill-Allaah, Allaahu akbar, Allaahu akbar, wa Lillaahi’l-hamd</i> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest, None deserves to be worshipped except Allah, Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest, and to Allah belongs all praise). </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So that you can &#8216;join’ the pilgrims, who have filled the horizons with the raising of their voices with the talbiya. So, fill the horizons, by raising your voices with the glorification and praise of Allah, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Allah is the Most Wise, the Most Merciful. When he legislated for the pilgrims to say the talbiya and to raise their voices with it and He legislated for them the sacrifice of an animal, He legislated for the people in their countries, to raise their voices with the <em>takbeer</em> (Allahu Akbar), the <em>tahleel</em> (Laa ilaaha ilIa-Allah) and <em>tahmeed</em> (Alhamdulillah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, that they should offer a sacrificial animal because it is one of the <em>nusuk</em> (rites of Hajj) by which one seeks a means of nearness to Allah, the Mighty and Majestic. So, sacrifice for yourself and for your families.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One sacrificial animal suffices a man and his family and there is no need for every individual (in a family) to offer a sacrifice even if they have the financial means. This is because, even though the Prophet, may the praise of Allah and peace be upon him, was the most generous of creation, he didn’t sacrifice for himself and his family except one sacrificial animal. Even though his family comprised nine women, he only sacrificed one sacrificial animal, may the praise of Allah and peace be upon him. As for the second sacrificial animal that he offered, it was for his nation &#8211; may Allah reward him for that with the best of rewards.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who intends to offer a sacrifice and the ten days have commenced, he should not remove any of his hair, his nails or any of his skin because the Prophet, may the praise of Allah and peace be upon him, prohibited this. For this reason, anybody who wants to act upon the Sunnah by trimming his moustache, plucking his armpits, clipping his nails, or shaving his private parts should do so before the commencement of these ten days because when the ten days begin, he should not remove anything from these things due to the prohibition of the Prophet, may the praise of Allah and peace be upon him and his family.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Q: What is the opinion of your Eminence regarding the opinion of the one who says that Sawm in the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah is Bid`ah (innovation in religion)?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This is an ignorant person who should be taught.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (peace be upon him)ordered that good deed should be done in them and fasting is one of the good deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There are no days during which the righteous action is so pleasing to Allah than these ten days (i.e. The first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah)</strong></span>.&#8221; They asked him: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>O Messenger of Allah, not even Jihad in the Cause of Allah?</strong></span>&#8221; He (peace be upon him) replied: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Not even Jihad in the Cause of Allah, except in case one goes forth with his life and his property and does not return with either of it.&#8221;</span></strong> Narrated by Al-Bukhari in his Sahih Book of Hadith. [1]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Though it is not certain whether the Prophet (peace be upon him) fasted them or not, yet it should be relied on what the Prophet said because saying is much more significant than practice. When saying is accompanied by practice, this will affirm the Sunnah. The Sunnah of the Prophet are divided into saying, practice, and approving. Though each of them forms the Sunnah, the saying is the most significant and strong of them. Then, the practice comes next and then approval follows.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There are no days during which the righteous action is so pleasing to Allah than these days</strong></span>.&#8221; [2] By these days the Prophet means the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah. Thus, if one fasts or gives to charity during them, one will be doing a great good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is ordained during these days also to recite Takbir (saying: &#8220;Allahu Akbar [Allah is the Greatest]&#8221;), Tahmid (saying: &#8220;Al-hamdu lillah [All praise is due to Allah]&#8221;), and Tahlil (saying: &#8220;La ilaha illa Allah [There is no god except Allah]&#8221;) because he (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;There are no days that are greater before Allah or in which good deeds are more beloved to Him than these ten days, so recite a great deal of Tahlil, Takbir, and Tahmid during them</strong></span>.&#8221;[3]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(37. It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah, but it is <em><strong>Taqwa</strong> </em>from you that reaches Him. Thus have We made them subject to you that you may proclaim Allah&#8217;s greatness for His guidance to you. And give glad tidings to the doers of good.) </span>&#8211; Suratul Baqarah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says: this sacrifice is prescribed for you so that you will remember Him at the time of slaughter, for He is the Creator and Provider. Nothing of its flesh or blood reaches Him, for He has no need of anything other than Himself. During the time of Jahiliyyah, when they offered sacrifices to their gods, they would put some of the meat of their sacrifices on their idols, and sprinkle the blood over them. But Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah,)</strong> Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn Jurayj said, &#8220;The people of the Jahiliyyah used to put the meat of their sacrifices and sprinkle the blood on the House, and the Companions of the Messenger of Allah said, &#8220;<strong>We have more right to do that</strong>.&#8221; Then Allah revealed the words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah, but it is Taqwa from you that reaches Him.)</strong> That is what He will accept and reward for, as mentioned in the Sahih,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Allah does not look to your appearance or your colors, but He looks to your hearts and deeds.)</strong> And in the Hadith; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(Indeed charity falls in the Hand of Ar-Rahman before it falls in the hand of the one asking.)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Thus have We made them subject to you)</strong> meaning, `for this purpose We have subjugated the Budn for you,&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(that you may proclaim Allah&#8217;s greatness for His guidance to you.)</strong> means, that you may glorify Him for guiding you to His religion and His way which He loves and is pleased with, and has forbidden you to do all that He hates and rejects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And give glad tidings to the doers of good.)</strong> means, `give good news, O Muhammad, to those who do good,&#8217; i.e., whose deeds are good and who remain within the limits prescribed by Allah, who follow that which has been prescribed for them, who believe in the Messenger and follow that which he has conveyed from his Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Note) The Udhiyyah is Sunnah Mustahabbah One animal is sufficient on behalf of all the members of one household. Ibn `Umar said, &#8220;<strong>The Messenger of Allah continued to offer sacrifice for ten years</strong>.&#8221; This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi. Abu Ayyub said: &#8220;At the time of the Messenger of Allah , a man would sacrifice a sheep on behalf of himself and all the members of his household, and they would eat from it and feed others, until the people started boasting ﴿by sacrificing more than one﴾ and things reached the stage that you see now.&#8221; This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi, who graded it Sahih, and by Ibn Majah. `Abdullah bin Hisham used to sacrifice one sheep on behalf of his entire family; this was recorded by Al-Bukhari. Concerning how old the sacrificial animal should be, Muslim recorded from Jabir that the Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Do not sacrifice any but mature animals, and if that is not possible, then sacrifice a young sheep.)</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: <strong>Al-Istiqaamah Magazine</strong>, Issue No.6 &#8211; Dhul-Qa&#8217;dah 1417H / March 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By the Grace of Allaah we have started the month of<i> Dhul-Hijjah </i>(the month of<i> Hajj</i> or Pilgrimage), in which Allaah has marked out, for both the pilgrims and the non-pilgrims, some very blessed days. So we shall mention here some of the virtues and rewardful acts that are connected to these blessed days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> DOING GOOD DEEDS IN GENERAL:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first ten days of<i> Dhul-Hijjah </i>are the best and most virtuous days of the year. They are the days in which Allaah the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; most loves the doing of good deeds. About this the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, “<strong>The best days in the world are the ten days.</strong>” [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibnul-Qayyim (d.751H) &#8211; <i> rahimahullaah</i> – said, “Indeed, its days are the most excellent of all the days with Allaah. And it has been confirmed in <i>Saheehul-Bukhaaree</i> (2/382), from Ibn ’Abbaas (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhumaa</i>) who said, that Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, “There ore no days during which good deeds are more beloved to Allaah than these (ten) days.” He was then asked, ‘Not even <i>jihaad</i> in the path of Allaah?’ So he replied, “Not even <i>jihaad</i> in the path of Allaah, except for a person who goes out with his self and his wealth, and comes back with nothing.” And it is these ten days that Allaah has taken an oath by in His Book, by His saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<b>By the Dawn and by the Ten Nights.</b>” [Sooratul-Fajr 89:1-2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why it is recommended to increase in making <i>takbeer</i> (saying <i>Allaahu akbar</i>), <i>tahleel</i> (saying<i> Laa ilaaha illallaah</i>) and <i>tamheed</i> (saying<i> Alhamdulillaah</i>) during these days &#8230;”[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, “There are no days that are greater with Allaah, and in which good deeds are more beloved to Him, than these ten days. So increase in making<i> tasbeeh </i>(saying <i>Subhaanallaah), tahmeed</i>,<i> tahleel and takbeer</i>, during them.”[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> FASTING THE DAY OF ’ARAFAH:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ninth day of<i> Dhul-Hijjah </i> is the day of ’Arafah, since it is on this day that the pilgrims gather at the mountain plain of ’Arafah, praying and supplicating to their Lord. It is <i> mustahabb</i> (highly recommended) for those who are not pilgrims to fast on this day, since the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) was asked about fasting on the day of ’Arafah, so he said, “It expiates the sins of the past year and the coming year.” [4] Likewise, the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, ‘There is no day on which Allaah frees people from the Fire more so than on the day of ’Arafah. He comes close to those (people standing on ’Arafah), and then He revels before His Angels saying, ‘What are these people seeking.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam at-Tirmidhee (d.275H) &#8211; <i> rahimahullaah</i> – said, “The People of Knowledge consider it recommended to fast on the day of ’Arafah, except for those at ’Arafah.” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><b> SLAUGHTERING ON THE DAY OF AN-NAHR AND ’EEDUL-ADHAA OR THE FOLLOWING THREE DAYS:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tenth day of<i> Dhul-Hiijah </i> is known as the day of <i>an-Nahr</i> (slaughtering), since it marks the ending of the major rites of<i> Hajj</i> (Pilgrimage), and commemorates the bounty and mercy of Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; in that He gave His beloved Prophet Ibraaheem &#8211; <i>’alayhis-salaam</i> &#8211; a ram to sacrifice in place of his firstborn son Ismaa’eel &#8211; <i>’alayhis-salaam</i>. And out of the ten best days of the year, it is the day of <i>an-Nahr</i> which is the most excellent day of the year with Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> – said, “The most excellent day of the week is the day of Friday, by the agreement of the Scholars. And the most excellent day of the year is the day of <i>an-Nahr</i>. And some of them said that it is the day of ’Arafah. However, the first opinion is the correct one, since it is related in the <i>Sunan</i> collections that the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, “<strong>The most excellent days with Allaah is the day of an-Nahr, then the day of al-Qarr (the day that the Muslims reside in Minaa)</strong>.” [7]” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>The greatest day of the<i> Hajj </i>(Pilgrimage) is the Day of an-Nahr (Slaughtering).</strong>” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The day of <i>an-Nahr</i> is also known as ’Eedul-Adhaa (the Festivity of Sacrifice) and is one of the two major festivals that Allaah has granted to this<i> Ummah</i>. Anas (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhu</i>) said, ‘The Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) came to al-Madeenah and the people of al-Madeenah had &#8211; since the times of <i>jaahiliyyah</i> (Pre-lslaamic Ignorance) &#8211; two days which they marked out for play and amusement. So the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, ‘I came to you, and you had two days of play and amusement in the times of <i>jaahiliyyah</i>. But Allaah has replaced them with something better for you: The day of al-Adhaa (sacrificing) and the day of al-Fitr (ending the Fast).” [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) also said, “The day of al-Fitr, and the day of an-Nahr, and the days of <i>at-</i>Tashreeq (the three days after an-Nahr) are our days of <i> ’Eed </i>(festivity); and they are days of eating and drinking.” [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">’Eedul-Adhaa, is a day in which the Muslims slaughter a camel, cow, sheep or goat, in commemoration of the sacrifice of Ibraaheem &#8211; <i>’alayis-salaam</i>. And this sacrifice is an obligation upon all those who have the means to do so &#8211; according to the most correct opinion of the Scholars. [12] The basis of this is the Prophet’s (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) saying, “One who has the ability to sacrifice, but chooses not to do so, should not approach our place of (<i>’Eed</i>) Prayer.” [13] And his (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) saying, “Whosoever sacrificed before the Prayer, then let him do so again. But whosoever has not sacrificed, then let him sacrifice.” [14] So this order refers to those who have the ability to do so &#8211; and Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards those who intends to sacrifice &#8211; normally the head of the household &#8211; then they are prohibited from cutting their hair or nails, starting from the first day of<i> Dhul-Hijjah </i> up until after the sacrifice. Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, “When the ten days start, and one of you intends to sacrifice, then let him not cut his hair or his nails.” [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> GLORIFYING ALLAAH WITH THE TAKBEER:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the day of ’Arafah (the 9th of<i> Dhul-Hijjah</i>), up until the<i> ’Asr </i>Prayer on the thirteen day, are days in which the <i>takbeeraat</i> (saying<i> Allaahu Akbar</i>) should be said. Imaam al-Khattaabee (d.456H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> – said, “The wisdom behind saying the <i>takbeeraat</i> in these days is that in the times of <i> jaahiliyyah</i> (pre-lslaamic ignorance), they used to slaughter for their <i> tawaagheet </i>(false objects of worship). So the <i>takbeeraat</i> were prescribed in order to indicate that the act of slaughtering is directed to Allaah alone, and by mentioning only His &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; Name.” [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah &#8211; <i> rahimahullaah</i> – said, “All praise be to Allaah. The most correct saying concerning the <i>takbeer</i> &#8211; that which the majority of the <i>Salaf</i> (Pious Predecessors), and the Scholars from the Companions and Imaams were upon &#8211; is to begin making the <i>takbeer</i> from <i>Fajr</i> (dawn) on the day of ’Arafah, up until the last day of <i>at-Tashreeq</i> (the thirteenth of<i> Dhul-Hijjah</i>), after every Prayer.” [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abee Shaybah relates, “That ’Alee (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhu</i>) used to make the <i>takbeer</i> beginning after the <i>Fajr</i> Prayer on the day of ’Arafah, up until after the ’Asr Prayer on the last day of <i>at-Tashreeq</i>.” [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards the actual wording of the <i>takbeeraat</i>, then nothing authentic has been related from the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>). However, certain wordings have been authentically related from a group of Companions. From them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas’ood (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhu</i>) would say, “Allaah is great, Allaah is great. None has the right to be worshipped except Him. And Allaah is great, Allaah is great. And to Him belongs all praise. [<i>Allaahu akbar</i>,<i> Allaahu akbar</i>,<i> Allaahu akbar</i>,<i> Laa ilaahaa illallaah</i>,<i> wallaahu akbar</i>,<i> Allaahu akbar wa lillaahil-hamd</i>.]” [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ’Abbaas (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhu</i>) said, “Allaah is great, Allaah is great, Allaah is great, and to Allaah belongs all praise. Allaah is greater and Sublime. Allaah is greater to what He has guided us to. <i>[Allaahu akbar</i>,<i> Allaahu akbar</i>,<i> Allaahu akbar</i>,<i> wa lillaahil-hamd</i>.<i> Allaahu akbar wa ajalla</i>.<i> Allaahu akbar ’alaa maa hadaanaa</i>.]” [20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unfortunately, many Muslims have neglected the <i>takbeer</i> established from our <i>Salaf</i> (Pious Predecessors) and have instead resorted to additions which have no basis at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr (d.856H) &#8211; <i> rahimahullaah</i> – said, “Indeed, additions have been invented upon this day, which have no basis at all.” [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And may Allaah have mercy upon the one who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<i>Every good is in following the Salaf; And every evil is in the innovations of the late-comers.</i>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And all praise is for Allaah, Lord of the worlds. And may Allaah extol and send the choicest blessings of peace upon our Leader, Muhammad, and upon his Family, his Companions, and all those who follow them.</p>

<p>–</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many texts from the <em>Qur&#8217;aan</em> and the <em>Sunnah</em> indicate that these first ten days of the month of <em>Dhul-Hijjah</em> are better than all the other days of the year, including the last ten days of <em>Ramadhaan</em>. Our <em>Salaf us Saalih</em>(righteous predecessors), at the head of them, the Prophet <em>(sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa salaam)</em> mentioned many of the virtues of these first ten days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Ibn ‘Abbaas</em> (may <strong>Allaah</strong> be pleased with him and his father) reported that the Prophet <em>(sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam)</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> &#8220;There are no days in which righteous deeds are more beloved to Allaah than these ten days.&#8221; The people asked, &#8220;Not even <em>jihaad</em> for the sake of Allaah?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Not even <em>jihaad</em> for the sake of Allaah, except in the case of a man who went out to fight giving himself and his wealth up for the cause, and came back with nothing.&#8221; </strong></span>[Reported by <em>Bukhaari</em>, 2/457]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him and his father) also reported that the Prophet <em>(sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam)</em> said: &#8220;There is no deed more precious in the sight of <strong>Allaah</strong>, nor greater in reward, than a good deed done during the ten days of Sacrifice.&#8221; He was asked, &#8220;Not even <em>jihaad</em> for the sake of <strong>Allaah</strong>?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Not even <em>jihaad</em> for the sake of <strong>Allaah</strong>, except in the case of a man who went out to fight giving himself and his wealth up for the cause, and came back with nothing.&#8221; [Reported by al-Daarimi, 1/357; its isnaad is hasan as stated in al-Irwaa’, 3/398]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are just two of the many evidences mentioned by our <em>Shaykh Fu&#8217;ad al-&#8216;Amri</em> <em>(hafidhahullaah) </em>in this highly beneficial reminder</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The one who intends to do a sacrifice should not cut his hair and nails</strong><br />
<strong> from the beginning of Dhul-Hijjah UNTIL the sacrifice is done. </strong></p>
<p>Shaykh Al-Albaanee, may Allah shower His Mercy upon him, states in our of his works:</p>
<p>The Messenger of Allah, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>‘When the new moon of Dhul-Hijjah appears and one of you wants to do the sacrifice, then he should abstain from (cutting) his hair and his nails<a href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-1Bf" target="_blank">.</a>’</em> </span></p>
<p>And in a narration:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>‘Then he should not take anything from his hair or from his nails until he sacrifices.’</em></span></p>
<p> – Mukhtasar Saheeh Muslim No<span style="color:#888888;"><a href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-1Bf" target="_blank"><span style="color:#888888;">.</span></a></span>1251 and other than it.</p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Al-Albaani</strong>, may Allah shower his Mercy upon Him, comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I say: And the apparent meaning of the hadeeth is the obligation to leave removing the hair and the nails for the one who has resolved to do the sacrifice until he sacrifices &#8230; and this is what Imaam Ahmad and other than him have said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, let those who are afflicted with the shaving of the beard pay attention to this, for indeed shaving it (the beard) for ‘Eed has in it three acts of disobedience:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First</strong>: The shaving in of itself, for indeed it is to become feminine and to resemble the disbelievers and to change the creation of Allah as I have explained it in my book Adaab-uz-Zifaaf Fis-Sunnatil-Mutahharah (6th Edition, page 118).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second</strong>: Beautifying (oneself) for the ‘Eed through the disobedience of Allah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Third</strong>: What this hadeeth has benefitted with from the forbidding of taking (from) the hair for the one who wants to sacrifice. And in reality, very few are those who are saved from these violations (of the religion), even some of the people of knowledge! We ask Allah for safety.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 style="text-align:justify;" align="Center"><span style="color:#993300;">Imam Al-Nawawi’s Riyad-us-Saliheen : Chapter 226</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">The Excellence of As-Saum (The Fast) during the first ten Days of Dhul-Hijjah</span></h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn `Abbas (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) said, “There are no days during which the righteous action is so pleasing to Allah than these days (i.e., the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah).” He was asked: “O Messenger of Allah, not even Jihad in the Cause of Allah?” He (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) replied, “Not even Jihad in the Cause of Allah, except in case one goes forth with his life and his property and does not return with either of it.” [Al-Bukhari].</p>
<h5><span style="color:#993300;">Imam Al-Nawawi’s Riyad-us-Saliheen : Chapter 227</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">The Excellence of Observing <em>Saum</em> on the Day of ‘Arafah, ‘Ashura’ and Tasu’a (i.e., 9th of Muharram)</span></h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Qatadah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) was asked about the observance of <em>Saum</em> (fasting) on the day of `Arafah. He said, “<strong>It is an expiation for the sins of the preceding year and the current year.</strong>” [Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:small;">The first ten days of<i> Dhul-Hijjah </i>are the best and most virtuous days of the year. They are the days in which Allaah the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; most loves the doing of good deeds. About this the Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, <span style="color:#008000;"><em>“The best days in the world are the ten days.”</em></span> [1]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:small;"><strong>Imaam Ibnul-Qayyim</strong> (d.751H) &#8211; <i> rahimahullaah</i> – said, “Indeed, its days are the most excellent of all the days with Allaah. And it has been confirmed in <i>Saheehul-Bukhaaree</i> (2/382), from Ibn ’Abbaas (<i>radiyallaahu ’anhumaa</i>) who said, that Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said,<em><span style="color:#008000;"> “There ore no days during which good deeds are more beloved to Allaah than these (ten) days.”</span></em> He was then asked, ‘Not even <i>jihaad</i> in the path of Allaah?’ So he replied, <em><span style="color:#008000;">“Not even jihaad in the path of Allaah, except for a person who goes out with his self and his wealth, and comes back with nothing.”</span></em> And it is these ten days that Allaah has taken an oath by in His Book, by His saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:small;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“<b>By the Dawn and by the Ten Nights.</b>”</span></em> [Sooratul-Fajr 89:1-2]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:small;">This is why it is recommended to increase in making <i>takbeer</i> (saying <i>Allaahu akbar</i>), <i>tahleel</i> (saying<i> Laa ilaaha illallaah</i>) and <i>tamheed</i> (saying<i> Alhamdulillaah</i>) during these days &#8230;”[2]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:small;">The Prophet (<i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>) said, <em><span style="color:#008000;">“There are no days that are greater with Allaah, and in which good deeds are more beloved to Him, than these ten days. So increase in making tasbeeh (saying Subhaanallaah), tamheed, tahleel and takbeer, during them.”</span></em>[3]</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Q 1: If a neighbor is a Kafir (non-Muslim), but he never disturbs me with regard to ‘Ibadah (worship); is it permissible to give him from the Ud-hiyah (sacrificial animal offered by non-pilgrims) and from the ‘Aqiqah (sacrifice for a newborn)? Respected Shaykh, we hope you will clarify this issue for us.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is permissible to give a Kafir from the meat of an Ud-hiyah or ‘Aqiqah, as a way of showing kindness to the neighbor and fulfilling our Islamic duty as neighbors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8211; One Udhiyah is sufficient on behalf of a man and the members of his household<br />
&#8211; Ud-hiyah offered by your father is not sufficient for you if you are living with your family in a separate house</p>
<p><a href="http://alifta.com/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Tree&amp;NodeID=1&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=10" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fatwas</a> &gt; <a href="http://alifta.com/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Tree&amp;NodeID=126&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=10" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dhul-Hijjah Fatwas</a> &gt; What is the ruling on Ud-hiyah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: I am married, praise be to Allah, and I have children. I live in a city other than the city in which my family lives, but on holidays I go to the city where my family is. On ‘Eid-ul-Adha (the Festival of the Sacrifice), my children and I came five days before the ‘Eid but we did not offer the Ud-hiyah (sacrificial animal offered by non-pilgrims) even though I am able to, praise be to Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Is it permissible for me to offer Ud-hiyah? Is my father’s Ud-hiyah valid on behalf of myself and my wife and children? What is the ruling on Ud-hiyah for the one who is financially able? Is it obligatory on the one who is not able? Is it permissible to take a loan in order to offer the Ud-hiyah? A.A.Sh. Rafha’ the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The Ud-hiyah is a Sunnah (supererogatory act of worship following the example of the Prophet), not Wajib (obligatory), and one sheep is sufficient on behalf of a man and the members of his household, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to sacrifice two-horned rams that were white speckled with black, every year; one on behalf of himself and the members of his household, and the other on behalf of those among his Ummah (nation based on one creed) who believe in the Oneness of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you, dear questioner, are living in a separate house, then the Ud-hiyah offered by your father on behalf of himself and the members of his household is not sufficient for you, because you are not living with them in the same house. It is prescribed for you to offer Ud-hiyah on behalf of yourself and your family. There is nothing wrong with a Muslim taking a loan to offer Ud-hiyah if he is able to repay it. May Allah grant us all success</p>

Is this correct or not?</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fasting on the day of Arafah is an expiation for two years. : </strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ninth day of Dhul-Hijjah is the day of ’Arafah, since it is on this day that the pilgrims gather at the mountain plain of ’Arafah, praying and supplicating to their Lord. It is mustahabb (highly recommended) for those who are not pilgrims to fast on this day, since the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) was asked about fasting on the day of ’Arafah, so he said, “It expiates the sins (Minor) of the past year and the coming year.” [Muslim (no. 1162)]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam at-Tirmidhee (d.275H) &#8211; rahimahullaah – said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The People of Knowledge consider it recommended to fast on the day of ’Arafah, except for those at ’Arafah.” [Muslim (no. 1348)]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allah frees slaves from the fire on Arafat more than any other day </strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, ‘There is no day on which Allaah frees people from the Fire more so than on the day of ’Arafah. He comes close to those (people standing on ’Arafah), and then He revels before His Angels saying, ‘What are these people seeking.” [Jaami’ut-Tirmidhee (3/377)]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Forgiveness of the Sins even if they are like the foam on the Sea </strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for you staying till the evening in Arafah, then Allaah descends to the sky of the Duniya and He boasts about you to the Angels, and says: ‘My slaves have come to Me, looking rough, from every deep valley hoping for My mercy, so if your sins were equivalent to the amount of sand or the drops of rain or like the foam on the sea I will forgive them. So go forth My slaves! Having forgiveness and for what or who you have interceded for.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by at-Tabarani in his book “al-Kabeer” and by al-Bazaar. Shaykh Al-Albani graded it Hassan. Taken from ‘Saheeh al-Targheeb wa Tarheeb’. Volume 2,Page 9-10, hadeeth no. 1112]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Source : <a title="Ahadith regarding the benefits and blessings of Hajj – Shaykh Al Albaani" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2014/10/03/ahadith-regarding-the-benefits-and-blessings-of-hajj-shaykh-al-albaani/">Ahadith regarding the benefits and blessings of Hajj</a> &#8211; <span class="style19"><span class="style18">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> It is the day on which the religion was perfected and Allaah’s Favour was completed. </strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Al-Saheehayn it was reported from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him) that a Jewish man said to him, “O Ameer al-Mu’mineen, there is an aayah in your Book which you recite; if it had come to us Jews, we would have taken that day as an ‘Eid (festival).” ‘Umar said, “Which aayah?” He said: “This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.” [al-Maa’idah 5:3 – interpretation of the meaning]. ‘Umar said, “We know on which day and in which place that was revealed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). It was when he was standing in ‘Arafaah on a Friday.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allaah expresses His pride to His angels </strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was reported from Ibn ‘Umar that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah expresses His pride to His angels at the time of ‘Ishaa’ on the Day of ‘Arafaah, about the people of ‘Arafaah. He says, ‘Look at My slaves who have come unkempt and dusty.’”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Ahmad and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The standing on ‘Arafaat is the hajj. </strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The standing on ‘Arafaat is the hajj. The crowds should remind you of the Day of Resurrection. Humble yourself to Allaah, manifest your ‘uboodiyyah to Him Alone through du’aa, sincere intention and strong determination to free yourself from the sins of the past and to build up a commitment to rush for doing what is good. Think of becoming a better person when you return. Rid yourself of false pride and showing off because it may ruin what you gain on this day.</p>
