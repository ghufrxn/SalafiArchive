<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Great Importance Given to the <em>’Aqeedah</em> in the Madinan Period</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  and his Companions migrated to al-Madeenah, and the Islamic state was established through the efforts of the <em>Muhaajirs</em> and the <em>Ansaar</em>, and upon the foundation of <em>tawheed</em>, then the greatest importance continued to be given to <em>tawheed</em>. The <em>Aayaat</em> of the Qur&#8217;aan continued to be sent down with it, and the directions and the orders of the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  revolved around it.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  did not suffice even with all this. Rather he used to take pledge of allegiance from the greater Companions, not to mention the others, upon it from time to time. Whenever the opportunity arose, he would take their pledge of allegiance upon it. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ إِذَا جَاءَكَ الْمُؤْمِنَاتُ يُبَايِعْنَكَ عَلَىٰ أَن لَّا يُشْرِكْنَ بِاللَّهِ شَيْئًا وَلَا يَسْرِقْنَ وَلَا يَزْنِينَ وَلَا يَقْتُلْنَ أَوْلَادَهُنَّ وَلَا يَأْتِينَ بِبُهْتَانٍ يَفْتَرِينَهُ بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِنَّ وَأَرْجُلِهِنَّ وَلَا يَعْصِينَكَ فِي مَعْرُوفٍ ۙ فَبَايِعْهُنَّ وَاسْتَغْفِرْ لَهُنَّ اللَّهَ ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<span style="color:#008000;">When the Believing women come to give you their pledge that they will not associate anything in worship with Allaah; nor steal; nor commit fornication; nor kill their children; nor attribute to their husbands children which are not theirs; nor disobey you, O Muhammad </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(</span><span style="color:#008000;">صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, in that which is good and commanded by Allaah; </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(and not wail over the dead)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, then accept their pledge and ask Allaah to forgive them. Indeed Allaah forgives those who repent to Him and is Most Merciful to them.</span>”</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]  </a>Soorah al-Mumtahinah (60):12</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though this <em>Aayah</em> is with regard to the women’s pledge, Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  also used to take pledge from the men upon its contents.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From ’Ubaadah ibn as-Saamit, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“Allaah’s Messenger (</em><em>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</em><em>) was in an assembly (of his Companions) and said, ‘Swear allegiance to me with the pledge that you will not associate anything in worship with Allaah, and that you will not steal, nor commit fornication, nor kill your children, (and upon the Aayah which was taken as a pledge from the women [60:12]). So whoever fulfills this pledge from you, then he will be rewarded by Allaah. And whoever falls into sin with any of that and is punished for it, then it is an expiation for it. And whoever falls into any of these sins and Allaah conceals his sin, then it is up to Allaah: if He wills He may forgive him, and if He wills He may punish him.’” </em><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also Ibn Katheer quotes a large number of <em>ahaadeeth</em> that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  used to take pledge from the women upon that which this <em>Aayah</em> contains.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> From these <em>ahaadeeth</em> is that of ’Aa’ishah; the <em>hadeeth </em>of Umayyah bint Ruqayqah;<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> the <em>hadeeth</em> of Umm ’Atiyyah;<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> the <em>hadeeth</em> of Salmaa bint Qays, one of the maternal aunts of the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) ;<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6)</a> and the <em>hadeeth </em>of Raa’itah bint Sufyaan al-Khuzaa’iyyah.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> Then he (i.e. Ibn Katheer) said, “<strong>And Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  used to take this pledge from the women repeatedly</strong>.” Then he quoted the <em>hadeeth</em> of Ibn ’Abbaas,<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> and other <em>ahaadeeth</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also used to take this pledge repeatedly from the men. This is indicated by the <em>hadeeth</em> of ’Ubaadah ibn as-Saamit which has preceded, and also by the <em>hadeeth</em> of ’Auf ibn Maalik al-Ashja’ee, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“We were with Allaah’s Messenger (</em><em>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</em><em>)  and numbered nine, eight or seven people, so he said, ‘Will you not give your pledge to Allaah’s Messenger?’ So we said, ‘We have already given you our pledge, O Messenger of Allaah!’ Then he said, ‘Will you not give your pledge to Allaah’s Messenger?’ So we stretched out our hands and said, ‘We will indeed give you our pledge, O Messenger of Allaah, but what will our pledge be?’ He said, ‘That you will worship Allaah and not worship anything else besides Him; the five obligatory Prayers; that you obey (and he said a word quietly); and that you do not ask the people for anything.’ So I have as a result seen some of those people, their whip would fall down from their hand (while riding) and he would not ask anyone to pick it up for him.” </em><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) He (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  used to send callers, teachers, judges and governors, to kings and tyrants, and to various areas, calling to <em>tawheed</em>. From Anas, <em>radiyallaahu ’anhu, </em>the servant of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) ,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Prophet of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  sent letters to Kisraa (Chosroes), and Caesar, and the Najaashee (Negus) and to every tyrant ruler calling them to Allaah. And this Negus was not the one whom the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  prayed Funeral Prayer for.”<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This point is shown very clearly by the text of his letter to the Caesar, and that his purpose was to call to <em>tawheed</em>. Its text is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“In the Name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Muhammad, the Slave of Allaah and His Messenger, to Hiraql, the Emperor of the Byzantines.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Peace and safety are for those who follow the Guidance. To proceed. I invite you with the call of Islaam. Accept Islaam and you will be safe, and Allaah will grant you a double reward. But if you turn your back upon it, then you will carry the burdens of the sins of your subjects.”<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said, “Whoever calls to guidance then there is for him a reward similar to the reward of those who follow him, nothing being reduced from their reward. And whoever calls to misguidance, then there is a burden of sin upon him similar to the sin of those who follow him, nothing being reduced from their sins.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O People of the Book, come to a word of justice between us, that we will single Allaah out with all worship and will not worship anything besides Him and disassociate ourselves from everything that is worshipped besides Him. Nor will we take one another as lords besides Allaah by obeying one another in that which involves disobedience to Allaah. So if they turn away, then say, ‘Bear witness that we are Muslims, submitting to Allaah and making our worship purely and sincerely for Him and not worshipping anything else besides Him.’”</strong><a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the letter reached the Caesar he sent for Aboo Sufyaan ibn Harb and some riders of Quraysh. They were at that time trading in the area of Palestine/Syria, and were within the time of the truce period agreed between Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  and the unbelievers of Quraysh. So they came to Caesar at Jerusalem and he asked Aboo Sufyaan a number of questions. From them was that he asked, “What does he (i.e. Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) ) command you?” Aboo Sufyaan said, “I replied, ‘He says, “<em>Worship Allaah alone and do not worship anything else besides Him and abandon the saying of your fathers. He orders prayer, truthfulness, chastity and joining ties of relationship</em>.”’”<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) Furthermore he used to organise armies to fight <em>Jihaad</em> in the path of Allaah in order to establish and raise high the word of <em>tawheed</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“He who fights in order that Allaah’s Word is the highest then he is the one who is fighting in the Path of Allaah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Buraydah ibn al-Husayyib, <em>radiyallaahu ’anhu</em>, who said, “When Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  appointed the chief of a raiding party or an army, he used to counsel him to have taqwaa of Allaah concerning himself and with regard to good treatment of the Muslims with him, and he said, ‘When you meet your enemy from the mushriks then call them to accept one of three things, whichever of them they agree to, then accept it and leave them alone:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) Invite them to accept Islaam. If they accept that then accept it from them, and leave them alone. Invite them in that case to leave their homes and to migrate to the land of the Muhaajirs&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) But if they refuse (to accept Islaam), then ask them to pay the <em>jizya</em> tax. If they agree to that then accept that from them and leave them alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(iii) But if they refuse then seek the aid of Allaah and fight them. And if you besiege a fortified place and they ask you to allow them to surrender upon the judgement of Allaah, then do not allow them to surrender upon that since you do not know what Allaah’s judgement concerning them is. Rather allow them to surrender in accordance with what you judge in the matter. Then decide as you wish concerning them.’”<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Like the <em>hadeeth</em> of Buraydah is the <em>hadeeth</em> of an-Nu’maan ibn Muqarrin al-Muzanee, <em>radiyallaahu</em> <em>’anhu, </em>which is indicated by Muslim, Aboo Daawood and Ibn Maajah, who all said, “’Alqamah said: I narrated it to Muqaatil ibn Hayyaan. He said: Muslim ibn Haysam narrated to me, from an-Nu&#8217;maan ibn Muqarrin from the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  with its like.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">(4) Furthermore he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  sent Mu’aadh to Yemen as a Governor, a judge and a teacher. Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said to him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“You are a going to a people from the People of the Book, so let the first thing you call them to be the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, (and in a narration: that they should single Allaah out with all worship), and I am the Messenger of Allaah. So if they obey you in that, then inform them that Allaah has made five Prayers obligatory upon them in each day and night. So if they obey you in that, then inform them that Allaah has obligated upon them a charity which is to be taken from their rich and given to their poor. If they obey you in that, then beware of taking the best parts of their wealth, and beware of the supplication of the oppressed, because there is no screen between it and Allaah.”</em><a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that he used to give this same advice to all the callers, governors and judges whom he sent out.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">(5) <em>Jihaad </em>was prescribed for the establishment of <em>tawheed</em> and to purify the earth from the scourge of <em>shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَاتِلُوهُمْ حَتَّىٰ لَا تَكُونَ فِتْنَةٌ وَيَكُونَ الدِّينُ لِلَّهِ ۖ فَإِنِ انتَهَوْا فَلَا عُدْوَانَ إِلَّا عَلَى الظَّالِمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Fight the <em>Mushriks</em> until there remains no worship of anything besides Allaah, and all worship is for Allaah alone and His religion is uppermost. So if they desist from <em>shirk</em> and enter into Islaam then let there be no transgression except those that worship others along with Allaah”</span> </strong><a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>  [Soorah al-Baqarah (2):193]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jareer (at-Tabaree),<em> rahimahullaah</em>, said in his <em>Tafseer</em> (2/194-195):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah, the Most High, says to His Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم),  Meaning: &#8220;so that there is no <em>shirk</em> with Allaah, and no one besides Him is worshipped; and worship of the idols, false gods and those set up as rivals is extinguished. And worship and obedience is for Allaah alone to the exclusion of idols and images&#8230; Qataadah said, ‘So that there is no <em>shirk</em>.’ He quotes his chain of narration with this explanation from Qataadah, Mujaahid, as-Suddee and Ibn &#8216;Abbaas. He said, ‘What is meant by <em>Deen </em>(religion) which Allaah mentions in this place is: Worship and obedience to Allaah in what He orders and forbids.’ He said, ‘With this meaning there occurs the saying of al-A’shee: He caused the (tribes of) ar-Ribaab to submit and become obedient when they hated obedience &#8211; Achieving it through continual fighting and attacks.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he quoted his chain of narration of ar-Rabee’ who said concerning,  Meaning: “Until none but Allaah is worshipped,” which is the meaning of <em>laa ilaaha illallaah</em> (none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah). That is what Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  fought for and called to.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Aboo Hurayrah, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“I have been ordered to fight the people until they say laa ilaaha illallaah (none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah). So whoever says: laa ilaaha illallaah, then his wealth and his person is safe from me, except due to any right of it, and his reckoning is with Allaah.”</em><a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also the Chief of the Believers &#8216;Umar, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>said to Aboo Bakr, the <em>Khaleefah</em> of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) , when he resolved to fight the apostates and also those with them who refused to hand over the <em>zakaat</em>, ’Umar, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>said, “How can you fight those people when Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said, ‘I have been ordered to fight the people until they testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, so whoever says this then his wealth and his person are safe from me except due to any right of it, and his reckoning is with Allaah.’” So Aboo Bakr, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>said, “By Allaah, I will fight those who seek to separate between the Prayer and the <em>zakaat</em>. Indeed the <em>Zakaat</em> is a right due upon wealth. By Allaah, were they to hold a single young goat from me which they used to pay to Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) , I would fight them for it.”<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Jaabir ibn ’Abdillaah, <em>radiyallaahu ’anhumaa, </em>who said that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“I have been ordered to fight the people until they say, ‘None has the right to be worshipped except Allaah.’ So when they say that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah then their blood and their property are safe from me except due to a right pertaining to it, and their reckoning is with Allaah.” </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he recited,<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَذَكِّرْ إِنَّمَا أَنتَ مُذَكِّرٌ  لَّسْتَ عَلَيْهِم بِمُصَيْطِرٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">Indeed We have only sent you, O Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم), as an admonisher to them. You are not to force them to believe against their will</span>.”  [Soorah al-Ghaashiyah (88):21-22] <a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>, <a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn &#8216;Umar, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhumaa, </em>who said that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“I have been ordered to fight the people until they bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah, and they establish the Prayer, and pay the zakaat. So if they do that then their blood and their wealth are safe from me except due to its right, and their reckoning is with Allaah.”</em><a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it may be noticed that the <em>ahaadeeth</em> of ’Umar, Aboo Bakr, Aboo Hurayrah and Jaabir are restricted to mentioning the matter of <em>tawheed</em> and do not mention the other matters. So perhaps the reason for this is the very great concern which the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  gave to this matter so that he would mention it to them time after time on its own, as an indication of its greatness and importance. Also because of the fact that he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  realised that they understood that all the other affairs of Islaam follow on from it, and are required by it and are from its rights, particularly the pillars of Islaam and <em>eemaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say, because of the fact that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  often used to mention only that which related to <em>‘aqeedah</em>, &#8216;Umar used this saying as an evidence. Then the reply of Aboo Bakr to support his stance, was to make a direct analogy between the <em>Zakaat</em> and the Prayer, “By Allaah, I will fight anyone who makes a difference between the Prayer and the <em>Zakaat</em>&#8230;” So if he knew the narration as it was reported by Ibn ’Umar he would have used that as a clear and decisive proof.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also if ’Umar knew of the narration as reported by his son he would not have raised any objection to the saying of Aboo Bakr. Then if those present at the time, included Aboo Hurayrah, knew the naration of Ibn ’Umar, then they would have mentioned it to the two <em>Shaykhs</em>.<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a> So perhaps the reason behind this was indeed as we have said, the great importance which the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  gave to <em>’aqeedah</em>, and his propogation of it, and the frequency with which he spoke about it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then also because the most prominent and most important aspect of the teachings which the Prophets conveyed from their Lord was <em>Tawheedul-Uloohiyyah</em> (singling out Allaah with all worship), and this was the greatest reason for strife between the Prophets and their enemies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore the most significant of the aspects of falsehood and misguidance, against which the Prophets (<em>’alayhimus-salaatu was-salaam</em>) fought, and which the <em>Mushriks</em> who denied the truth of their message furiously fought to defend, in every nation was: the worship of images and idols, and the building of tombs upon the graves of the pious and the Prophets, and veneration of them, and making offerings to them, and attachment of people’s hearts to them, both of the rulers and the ruled, an attachment of hope and fear, desiring and anticipating that they would intercede for them with Allaah, enabling the accomplishment of their wishes. This was indeed major <em>shirk</em> which will not be forgiven, so we must mention, along with that which we have already quoted whilst speaking about the methodology of the Prophets, particularly when we spoke concerning Ibraaheem, the <em>Imaam</em> of the Pious and the destroyer of the worthless idols, something about the full scale war which Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  waged against major <em>shirk</em> which was seen in his smashing the idols physically and by blocking up all the ways which Satan uses to lead his followers to worshipping them and taking them as rivals to Allaah, by using the terms ‘gods’ or <em>awliyaa</em>&#8216; (pious ones beloved to Allaah) or hiding beneath any of the misleading titles they use.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from this war which is clearly seen in the Qur&#8217;aan and was waged by the Messenger of the One Who sent the Qur&#8217;aan, is the saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَفَرَأَيْتُمُ اللَّاتَ وَالْعُزَّىٰ  وَمَنَاةَ الثَّالِثَةَ الْأُخْرَىٰ  أَلَكُمُ الذَّكَرُ وَلَهُ الْأُنثَىٰ  تِلْكَ إِذًا قِسْمَةٌ ضِيزَىٰ  إِنْ هِيَ إِلَّا أَسْمَاءٌ سَمَّيْتُمُوهَا أَنتُمْ وَآبَاؤُكُم مَّا أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ بِهَا مِن سُلْطَانٍ ۚ إِن يَتَّبِعُونَ إِلَّا الظَّنَّ وَمَا تَهْوَى الْأَنفُسُ ۖ وَلَقَدْ جَاءَهُم مِّن رَّبِّهِمُ الْهُدَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Have you seen, O <em>Mushriks</em>, (the idols:) <em>al-Laat</em>, <em>al-’Uzzaa, </em>and the other one <em>Manaat</em>, the third of them</strong></span>.<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> You prefer and love the male offspring for yourselves and then falsely attribute daughters, which is something you hate for yourselves, to Allaah. This is indeed an unjust division. Rather these idols are mere names which you <em>Mushriks</em> and your forefathers have invented. Allaah has sent down no proof for that. Rather they follow only conjecture and their own deisres, even though clear guidance has come to them from their Lord proving the futility of worshipping these idols and that worship is the right of Allaah alone.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24"><span style="color:#008000;">[24]</span></a><span style="color:#008000;"> </span>[Soorah an-Najm (53):19-23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a clear statement of contempt for the idols which they worshipped, and war against them. Also, Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ذَٰلِكَ وَمَن يُعَظِّمْ حُرُمَاتِ اللَّهِ فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّهُ عِندَ رَبِّهِ ۗ وَأُحِلَّتْ لَكُمُ الْأَنْعَامُ إِلَّا مَا يُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ ۖ فَاجْتَنِبُوا الرِّجْسَ مِنَ الْأَوْثَانِ وَاجْتَنِبُوا قَوْلَ الزُّورِ  حُنَفَاءَ لِلَّهِ غَيْرَ مُشْرِكِينَ بِهِ ۚ وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَكَأَنَّمَا خَرَّ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ فَتَخْطَفُهُ الطَّيْرُ أَوْ تَهْوِي بِهِ الرِّيحُ فِي مَكَانٍ سَحِيقٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“So shun the filth of worshipping idols and shun false speech. Worshipping Allaah alone in <em>tawheed</em> making worship purely for Him, and not worshipping anything besides Him. And whoever worships anything else along with Allaah, then he is like one who fell down from the sky and was ripped to pieces by the birds, or like one cast by the wind in a far distant place.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a> [Soorah al-Hajj (22):30-31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِنَّمَا الْخَمْرُ وَالْمَيْسِرُ وَالْأَنصَابُ وَالْأَزْلَامُ رِجْسٌ مِّنْ عَمَلِ الشَّيْطَانِ فَاجْتَنِبُوهُ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“O you who believe, intoxicants, gambling, stone altars erected for sacrifice and divining-arrows are an abomination from the handiwork of Satan. So shun all of that so that you may be successful.”</span> </strong><a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a> [ Soorah al-Maa’idah (5):90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from ’Amr ibn ’Abasah, <em>radiyallaahu ’anhu, </em>and his <em>hadeeth</em> has preceded, and in it there occurs, <em>“I said, ‘Did Allaah send you as a Messenger?’ He said, ‘Yes,’ I asked, ‘With what message did he send you?’ He replied, ‘That Allaah should be singled out and worshipped in tawheed, and that nothing should be worshipped besides Him, and to smash the idols and to join ties of relationship.’”</em><a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in the <em>hadeeth </em>of Ja’far which has preceded there occurs, “&#8230;until Allaah sent a Messenger to us from amongst us. We knew his lineage and his truthfulness and his chastity. He called us to single out Allaah in <em>tawheed</em> and to worship Him alone, and to renounce the stones and idols and whatever we and our fathers used to worship besides Him&#8230;”<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the <em>hadeeth </em>of Aboo Sufyaan and his conversation with Heraclius, the King of the Byzantines, there occurs, “He says, (i.e., the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) ), <em>‘Worship Allaah alone and do not worship anything along with Him, and renounce what the forefathers say&#8230;’”</em><a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the <em>hadeeth</em> of Aboo Umaamah, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>there occurs, <em>“Indeed Allaah sent me as a mercy for the worlds, and as a guide for the worlds, and my Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, ordered me to destroy all musical instruments and flutes, and idols and the cross, and such things from the days of Ignorance&#8230;”</em><a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the leaders of Quraysh went out of their minds in anger, unable to put up with the attack of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  against their idols, whether it was concerning the Qur&#8217;aan sent down to him, or his <em>da’wah</em> in secret, or his <em>da’wah</em> in the open. This was something about which there could be no indulgence, and it was something which had to be due to his true and sincere call.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn ’Abbaas, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhumaa,</em> who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“When Aboo Taalib became ill a group of Quraysh entered upon him, amongst them Aboo Jahl, and they said, ‘The son of your brother abuses our gods, and does such and such, and says such and such. So if only you were to send a message forbidding him.’ So he sent a message and the Prophet (</em><em>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</em><em> )   came and entered the house&#8230; Aboo Taalib said to him, ‘O son of my brother! Why is it that your people complain about you? They claim that you abuse their idols and say such and such?!’ They spoke a great deal against him, and Allaah’s Messenger (</em><em>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</em><em> )   spoke and said, ‘O Uncle! I only desire that they should say a single phrase which if they say it, then the Arabs will become obedient to them and the non-Arabs will pay the Jizyah tax to them.’ So they were very surprised at what he said and they said, ‘A single phrase? Yes, by your father, even ten.’ So they asked, ‘And what is it?’ Aboo Taalib said, ‘And which saying is it, O son of my brother?’ So he (</em><em>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</em><em> )   said, ‘None has the right to be worshipped except Allaah.’ So they stood up, shaking their clothes saying, ‘Does he declare that worship should be for a single God?! this is something bizarre.’”</em><a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from Jaabir, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Quraysh gathered together one day and said, ‘See who is the most knowledgeable of you with regard to sorcery, divining and poetry, then let him go to this man who splits our united body, causes schism between us and abuses our religion. So let him speak to him and see how best to reply to him.’ So they said, ‘We do not know anyone but ’Utbah ibn Rabee’ah.’ So they said, ‘Then it is to be you O Abul-Waleed.’ So ’Utbah went to him and said, ‘O Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) ! Are you better or ’Abdullaah?’<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a> Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  remained silent. ‘Are you better or ’Abdul-Muttalib?’<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a> Again Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  remained silent. So he said, ‘If you claim that they are better than you, then they certainly worshipped the idols which you abuse. If however you claim that you are better than them, then speak so that we may hear what you have to say. Indeed we have never seen a youngster who has boded evil for his people more so than yourself. You have split our unity and caused schism in our affair, and you have abused our religion and shamed us in front of the Arabs. It has spread amongst them that there is a sorceror within Quraysh, and a diviner within Quraysh. By Allaah we do not expect that we will have to wait for the time it takes a new-born to cry out before we will fight amongst oursleves with swords and wipe oursleves out. O man, if it is poverty that is your problem, then we will gather wealth for you until you will be the richest man of Quraysh. If it is that you have a need to marry, then choose whichever of the women of Quraysh you like and we will marry you ten of them.’ So Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said, ‘Have you finished?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ So Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">until he reached</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">حم  تَنزِيلٌ مِّنَ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ&#8230;.  فَإِنْ أَعْرَضُوا فَقُلْ أَنذَرْتُكُمْ صَاعِقَةً مِّثْلَ صَاعِقَةِ عَادٍ وَثَمُودَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“In the name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy. <em>Haa Meem</em>. This Qur&#8217;aan is the Revelation sent down by the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy &#8230;. So if these <em>mushriks</em> turn away from the proof which We have made clear to them, O Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  , then say, ‘I warn you of a terrible punishment like that which befell ’Aad and Thamood.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a>  [Soorah Fussilat (41):1-13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">’Utbah said, ‘Enough! Enough! Do you have nothing other than this?’ He said, ‘No.’ So he returned to Quraysh and they said, ‘What has occurred?’ He said, ‘I didn&#8217;t leave anything which I thought that you would wish to say except that I said it to him.’ They said, ‘Did he respond to you?’ He said, ‘No, by the one who caused the <em>Ka’bah</em> to be built, I did not understand anything which he said except that he warned you of a terrible punishment like that of ’Aad and Thamood.’ They said, ‘Woe to you, the man speaks to you in Arabic and you don&#8217;t understand what he says?!’ He said, ‘No, by Allaah, I did not understand anything that he said except for his mention of the terrible punishment.’”<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this war was fought with words and the soul, with biting attacks and belittlement and derision, by overcoming the falsehood and ignorance of the <em>Mushriks. </em>At the same time, establishing the proof against them so that whoever went to destruction did so aware of the clear proof, and those who lived did so upon the clear proof. So from the results of this war, and from the results of this clear declaration was that Allaah guided many of the Arabs from the Quraysh and from the other tribes, and from <em>Aws</em> and the <em>Khazraj</em>. Allaah granted them clear discernment and they realised the reality of <em>tawheed</em> and its status. They also knew the vileness of committing <em>shirk</em> with idols or anything else, and also, at the same time, its seriousness and evil consequences for the <em>Mushriks</em> in this world and the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these were the great and good fruits which came as a result of the <em>Jihaad</em> of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  and his Companions and their steadfastness in the field of true <em>da’wah</em> to Allaah, and their intensive striving against the idols and false objects of worship. Then when Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  took <em>tawheed</em> to a new practical level which was to physically annihilate, smash and eradicate the idols and purify the earth from them, being fully aware of their seriousness, since they are the primary source of danger for every generation of mankind since the dawn of history until the end of history, just as the leader of those upon the true and straight religion said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ رَبِّ اجْعَلْ هَٰذَا الْبَلَدَ آمِنًا وَاجْنُبْنِي وَبَنِيَّ أَن نَّعْبُدَ الْأَصْنَامَ رَبِّ إِنَّهُنَّ أَضْلَلْنَ كَثِيرًا مِّنَ النَّاسِ ۖ فَمَن تَبِعَنِي فَإِنَّهُ مِنِّي ۖ وَمَنْ عَصَانِي فَإِنَّكَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols, O my Lord, they have indeed caused the misguidance of many people.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a>  [Soorah Ibraaheem (14):35-36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore the greatest Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  resolved to carry out the task of purifying the earth from idols, and to level the graves since tombs are the partner of the idols in causing the misguidance of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From ’Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  entered Makkah and there were three hundred and sixty idols erected around the <em>Ka’bah</em>. So he began striking them with a stick which he had in his hand and was saying, ‘<em>The truth has arrived and falsehood has perished. The truth has arrived and falsehood cannot begin or return</em>.’”<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  prepared an attachment to go from al-Madeenah to the tribe of Khath’am to attack Dhul-Khalasah, which they did. From Jareer ibn ’Abdullaah, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said, “There was a house<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a> called Dhul-Khalasah, or the <em>Yemeni Ka’bah</em> or the <em>Shaamee Ka’bah</em>, and the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said to me, <em>‘Will you not relieve me of Dhul-Khulasah?’</em> So I set out with a hundred and fifty riders of the Ahmas tribe. So we broke it down and killed whomever we found there. Then I came to the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  and informed him, so he made supplication for blessing for us and for the tribe of Ahmas.”<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The wording used by al-Bukhaaree, Muslim and Ahmad is, <em>“Will you not relieve me of Dhul-Khalasah?”</em> See the wording used by the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) ?! It was as if the existence of idols deprived him of sleep and disturbed him, so that he could not settle or be at ease.<a href="#_ftn79" name="_ftnref79"></a></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref23" name="_ftn23">[23]</a> <strong>Translator’s Note:</strong> <em>Al-Laat</em> had its origin in a man of the tribe of <em>Thaqeef</em> who used to mix gruel for pilgrims in the times of ignorance near to a certain rock in <em>Taa’if</em>. Then after his death the people built a tomb around the rock, upon his grave. They then worshipped this and gave it the name <em>al-Laat</em> which they invented by twisting the name of Allaah. Allaah’s Messenger (*) sent al-Mugheerah ibn Shu’bah and Aboo Sufyaan to destroy it. They did so and in its place the mosque of Taa’if was built.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <em>al-’Uzzaa</em>, then it was in the form of a tree surrounded by a curtained building in a palm grove between Taa’if and Makkah. The Quraysh used to venerate it. An-Nasaa’ee reports in his <em>Tafseer</em> (2/357 no.567) that when Allaah’s Messenger (*) conquered Makkah he sent Khaalid ibn al-Waleed to it. He found that it was built around three trees, so he cut them down and destroyed the building. He then went to the Prophet (*) and informed him, but he said, “Return for you have done nothing.” So he returned and saw the keepers of the idol fleeing into the hills saying, “O <em>&#8216;Uzzaa</em>!” So Khaalid came and found a naked female with dishevelled hair, throwing dust upon her head. So he struck her with his sword and killed her, then he returned to the Prophet (*) and informed him. So he said, “That was <em>al-’Uzzaa.</em>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <em>Manaat</em> then it was situated at <em>Mushallal,</em> near to Qudayd, between Makkah and al-Madeenah. It was venerated by various tribes in the times of ignorance. Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (*) sent ’Alee to demolish it in the year of the Conquest of Makkah. Ibn Ishaaq said in his <em>Seerah</em>, “The Arabs took other structures besides the <em>Ka’bah</em>, buildings which they worshipped and venerated just as they honoured the <em>Ka’bah</em>. These shrines had keepers and guards, and offerings would be made to them just as with the <em>Ka’bah</em>. The people would also make <em>tawaaf</em> around them and make sacrifices there&#8230;” (<em>Tafseer Ibn Katheer</em> and <em>Tayseerul-’Azeezil-Hameed</em>, (p.177)).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The <em>Dawah</em> of Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The noblest of all the Prophets and the last of them, Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdullaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم). The one sent with the greatest, most complete and most comprehensive message. The one whom Allaah sent as a mercy for the worlds, and as a bringer of good tidings and a warner, and as a Caller to Allaah with His permission, and a shining light. He did not leave anything good except that he guided his <em>ummah</em> to it and pointed it out to them, nor anything evil except that he warned them against it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">So which of the fundamentals of Islaam did this exalted Prophet begin with? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">What was the starting point for his <em>da’wah</em>? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) began with what all the Prophets began with, and started where they started in their <em>da’wah</em>: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>calling to the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of <em>tawheed</em>, and calling for all worship to be made purely and sincerely for Allaah alone</strong></span>. He began with the testification, “None has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah,” (<em>Laa ilaaha illallaah Muhammadur Rasoolullaah</em>). Can it be imagined that he or any of the other Prophets would begin with anything but this great principle, the foundation of all the divine Messages?! Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) began with this fundamental principle, so the first thing which the people heard was, &#8216;Witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah.&#8217; So the proud and haughty said.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَجَعَلَ الْآلِهَةَ إِلَٰهًا وَاحِدًا ۖ إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَشَيْءٌ عُجَابٌ  &#8211; وَانطَلَقَ الْمَلَأُ مِنْهُمْ أَنِ امْشُوا وَاصْبِرُوا عَلَىٰ آلِهَتِكُمْ ۖ إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَشَيْءٌ يُرَادُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“The unbelievers said, ‘Has he made all that is to be worshipped a single God, who alone is to be called upon and hears all invocations. This is a very curious thing which we have not heard of.’ So the leaders amongst them went off saying to one another, ‘Continue in what you are upon and persist in worshipping your idols. He only says this to gain ascendancy over us.’”  </strong></span>[Soorah Saad (38):5-6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continued calling to this lofty principle and highest goal throughout the Meccan period of his Messengership, for thirteen years. He did not become weary or languid. He patiently bore all types of harm to propagate this principle, since no religious duties or pillars of Islaam were obligated upon him, except for the Prayer which was obligated in the tenth year of Prophethood, and apart from the excellent manners of keeping ties of relationship, truthfulness and chastity which he commanded his people with. However the core of his <em>da’wah</em> and the cause of dispute and opposition to him was that great fundamental principle. So Allaah charged this noble Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) with the particular duty of establishing this great principle. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّا أَنزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ الْكِتَابَ بِالْحَقِّ فَاعْبُدِ اللَّهَ مُخْلِصًا لَّهُ الدِّينَ  &#8211; أَلَا لِلَّهِ الدِّينُ الْخَالِصُ ۚ وَالَّذِينَ اتَّخَذُوا مِن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَاءَ مَا نَعْبُدُهُمْ إِلَّا لِيُقَرِّبُونَا إِلَى اللَّهِ زُلْفَىٰ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَهُمْ فِي مَا هُمْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Indeed We have sent down the Book to you, O Muhammad, with the truth, so worship Allaah alone making all religion purely and sincerely for Him. Indeed the religion that is free of all taint of <em>shirk</em> is alone what is acceptable to Allaah. As for those who take and invoke helpers and protectors besides Allaah, then they say, ‘We only worship them so that they should intercede for us and bring us nearer to Allaah.’ Indeed Allaah will establish judgement between them regarding the matters of religion about which they dispute.”</span>  [</strong>Soorah az-Zumar (39):2-3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ إِنِّي أُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَعْبُدَ اللَّهَ مُخْلِصًا لَّهُ الدِّينَ  &#8211; وَأُمِرْتُ لِأَنْ أَكُونَ أَوَّلَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ &#8211;  قُلْ إِنِّي أَخَافُ إِنْ عَصَيْتُ رَبِّي عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ &#8211; قُلِ اللَّهَ أَعْبُدُ مُخْلِصًا لَّهُ دِينِي</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Say, O Muhammad </strong>(صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, ‘Allaah has commanded that I should worship Him alone, purely and sincerely, not associating anything with Him, and I am commanded to be the first of this nation who submits to Him as a Muslim, making all worship purely for Him.’ Say, O Muhammad, ‘I fear should I disobey my Lord in this, the torment of a great Day.’ Say, ‘It is Allaah alone that I worship, making all of my worship purely and sincerely for Him, and not worshipping anything else besides Him.’”</span></strong>[Soorah az-Zumar (39):11-14]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ إِنَّ صَلَاتِي وَنُسُكِي وَمَحْيَايَ وَمَمَاتِي لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ &#8211; لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ ۖ وَبِذَٰلِكَ أُمِرْتُ وَأَنَا أَوَّلُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Say, O Muhammad </strong>(صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, ‘Indeed my Prayer, my sacrifice, my living and my dying are all purely and solely for Allaah, Lord of all the Worlds. There is no share of any of that for other than Him. That is what My Lord ordered me, and I am the first of this nation to submit to Allaah as a Muslim.’”</span></strong>[Soorah al-An’aam (6):162-163]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also commanded him to call all of the people to fulfil and implement this principle, and to proceed upon it. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اعْبُدُوا رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ وَالَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ &#8211; الَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الْأَرْضَ فِرَاشًا وَالسَّمَاءَ بِنَاءً وَأَنزَلَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَاءً فَأَخْرَجَ بِهِ مِنَ الثَّمَرَاتِ رِزْقًا لَّكُمْ ۖ فَلَا تَجْعَلُوا لِلَّهِ أَندَادًا وَأَنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“O Mankind, single out your Lord with worship; He who created you and all those who came before you so that you may be of those who seek to avoid Allaah’s punishment and anger; those whom Allaah is pleased with. He Who has made the earth a resting place for you and has made the sky a canopy, and sent down rain from the sky, and brought out with it crops and fruits from the earth as provision for you. So do not set up rivals with Allaah in your worship whilst you know that you have no Lord besides Him.”</span>  </strong>[Soorah al-Baqarah (2):21-22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِلَٰهُكُمْ إِلَٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ ۖ لَّا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الرَّحْمَٰنُ الرَّحِيمُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“The God Who alone has the right to be worshipped is a Single God. So do not worship anything besides Him, nor associate anything in worship with Him, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.”</span>  </strong>[Soorah al-Baqarah (2):163]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنِّي رَسُولُ اللَّهِ إِلَيْكُمْ جَمِيعًا الَّذِي لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۖ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ يُحْيِي وَيُمِيتُ ۖ فَآمِنُوا بِاللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ النَّبِيِّ الْأُمِّيِّ الَّذِي يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَكَلِمَاتِهِ وَاتَّبِعُوهُ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Say, O Muhammad </strong>(صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)<strong>, to all of the people, ‘I am the Messenger of Allaah to you all. Allaah, to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and everything therein. None has the right to be worshipped but Him. He Who alone gives life and death. So affirm true faith in Allaah and in His sole right to worship, and believe in His Messenger, the Unlettered Prophet </strong>(Muhammad صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> who believes in Allaah and His Words, and follow him, so that you may be rightly guided.’”</span></strong>[Soorah al-A’raaf (7):158]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Aayaat </em>in this regard are very many, and what we have quoted is an example showing the methodology of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   in calling to <em>tawheed</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then with regard to the<em> Sunnah</em>, there are many things clearly showing that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) began his <em>da’wah</em> with <em>tawheed</em> and completed it with it, and continued calling to it from the beginning to the end, throughout his (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) ’Amr ibn ’Abasah as-Sulamee, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“During the times of Ignorance I used hold that the people were upon error and futility, and they used to worship the idols, then I heard of a man in Makkah who received revelation. So I set out upon my riding beast and came to him. At that time he was in hiding due to oppression of his people. So I behaved in a way that enabled me to gain access to him in Makkah, which I did. So I said to him, ‘What are you?’ He replied, ‘I am a Prophet.’ So I said, ‘And what is a Prophet?’ He said, ‘Allaah has sent me as a Messenger.’ So I said, ‘And what is it that He has sent you with?’ He said, ‘I have been sent to order the joining of ties of relationship, to break the idols, so that Allaah is worshipped alone and nothing at all is associated in worship along with Him.’ So I said, ‘And who is with you upon this?’ He said, ‘A free man and a slave.’ He said, ‘And at that time Aboo Bakr and Bilaal were with him from those who believed in him&#8230;’“ </em></p>
<p>[Reported by Muslim (Eng. trans. 2/395 no.1812) and Ahmad in <em>al-Musand</em> (4/112)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) When ’Amr ibn al-’Aas and ’Abdullaah ibn Rabee’ah al-Makhzoomee went to an-Najaashee, the ruler of Abyssinia, to speak to him in order to incite him against the Muslims who had emigrated to Abyssinia, they said, ‘O king, some of our foolish youths have abandoned their religion and come to your land. They have split away from their own people and have not entered your religion. Rather they have come up with an innovated religion which is not known either to us or to you&#8230;’ So the Najaashee asked the Muslims, ‘What is this religion which you have split from your people and not entered my religion or the religion of any of these nations?!’ So Ja’far ibn Abee Taalib was the one who replied, and he said to him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O king, we were a people from the people of ignorance who worshipped idols, and we ate unslaughtered meat and committed foul acts, and we cut off ties of relationship, treated our neighbours in an evil manner and the strong amongst us used to devour the weak. So we were upon that until Allaah sent a Messenger to us from amongst us. We knew his lineage, his truthfulness, his trustworthiness and his chastity. <strong>So he called us to Allaah, that we should single Him out and worship Him alone and renounce everything which we and our fathers used to worship besides Him, all stones and idols</strong>; he commanded us to speak the truth and to fulfil trusts; to join ties of relationship; to live in a good manner with our neighbours; to avoid forbidden acts and shedding blood; and he forbade us from foul acts and from falsehood; and he forbade us from unlawfully devouring the wealth of orphans and falsely accusing chaste women. <strong>He ordered us to worship Allaah alone and not to worship anything along with Him&#8230;</strong>’ He said, ‘So he told him the affairs of Islaam,’ &#8216;So we attested to his truthfulness and believed him and followed him in that which he came with. So we worshipped Allaah alone, and did not worship anything else besides Him, and we made forbidden that which He forbade us, and declared lawful that which He allowed for us. So our people became enemies to us and tortured us and tormented us to turn back from our religion to the worship of idols, and so that we should allow the filthy actions which we used to allow. So when they oppressed us, treated us cruelly and made it unbearable for us, and came between us and our religion, then we left and came to your land, and we preferred you to others and wished to live in your company, and we hoped that we would not be oppressed while with you&#8230;’” [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) Also amongst the questions which Hirqal (Heraclius) asked Aboo Sufyaan, at the time of the peace of Hudaybiyyah, about Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) was that he asked Aboo Sufyaan, “What does he command you?” So Aboo Sufyaan replied, “He says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Worship Allaah alone and do not worship anything else along with Him, and abandon what your fathers say. And he orders Prayer, charity, chastity and the joining of ties of relationship.</strong>’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Reported by al-Bukhaaree (Eng. trans. 1/7/no. 6) and it is a long <em>hadeeth]</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these <em>ahaadeeth</em> clearly show us what the <em>da’wah</em> of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  was in both the Makkan and Madinan periods.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Reported by Imaam Ahmad in his <em>Musnad</em> (1/202) and (5/290). Ahmad said, “Ya’qoob (meaning Ibraaheem ibn Sa&#8217;d az-Zuhree) narrated to us (reliable): My father narrated to us, from Muhammad ibn Ishaaq: Muhammad ibn Muslim ibn ’Ubaydillaah ibn Shihaab narrated to me: from Aboo Bakr ibn ’Abdir-Rahmaan ibn al-Haarith ibn Hishaam al-Makhzoomee:from Umm Salamah bint Abee Umayyah (meaning the Mother of the Believers, <em>radiyallaahu ’anha</em>).” It is a chain of narration that is fully <em>saheeh</em>, except for Muhammad ibn Ishaaq, but he clearly states that he heard it directly and so his narration is <em>hasan</em> (good and acceptable).</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَا إِكْرَاهَ فِي الدِّينِ ۖ قَد تَّبَيَّنَ الرُّشْدُ مِنَ الْغَيِّ ۚ فَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِالطَّاغُوتِ وَيُؤْمِن بِاللَّهِ فَقَدِ اسْتَمْسَكَ بِالْعُرْوَةِ الْوُثْقَىٰ لَا انفِصَامَ لَهَا ۗ وَاللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>No-one is to be compelled to enter the Religion, true guidance has been made clear and distinct from falsehood.  So whoever rejects <em>at Taaghoot</em> and truly believes in Allaah, then he has grasped the firmest handhold that will never break. And Allaah is All Hearing, All Knowing. </strong></span>[2:256]<span style="color:#ff0000;"><sup>83</sup></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">83</span>]: <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Perfect and Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَا إِكْرَاهَ فِي الدِّينِ ۖ قَد تَّبَيَّنَ الرُّشْدُ مِنَ الْغَيِّ ۚ فَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِالطَّاغُوتِ وَيُؤْمِن بِاللَّهِ فَقَدِ اسْتَمْسَكَ بِالْعُرْوَةِ الْوُثْقَىٰ لَا انفِصَامَ لَهَا ۗ وَاللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>No one is to be compelled to enter the Religion, true guidance has been made clear and distinct from falsehood.  So whoever rejects at <em>Taaghoot</em> and truly believes in Allaah, then he has grasped the firmest handhold that will never break. And Allaah is All Hearing, All Seeing.</strong></span>[2:256]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>No one is to be compelled to enter the Religion…</strong><strong> : </strong>Meaning – no one is to be forced to enter into Islaam against his will, because entering into Islaam must occur as a result of being convinced and from believing in the heart. And no one is to be forced into it against his will – this is not possible because no one can act with regards to the hearts except Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. No one may force anyone to enter Islaam because we do not possess and own the hearts. Rather it is just Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, He is the One who owns them and acts with regards to them. However we should call to Islaam and encourage people upon it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We strive and fight in Allaah’s Cause against whoever disbelieves, for the spread of Islaam and to provide an opportunity to whoever wants to accept Islaam, and in order to subdue the enemies of Allaah. But as for guidance, then it is in the Hand of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. No one is to be forced upon eemaan and Islaam. Rather this is something which relates back to the person himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; قَد تَّبَيَّنَ الرُّشْدُ مِنَ الْغَيِّ &#8230;</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>…true guidance has been made clear and distinct from falsehood…</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Islaam, and all praise is for Allaah, does not contain anything which people have to be forced upon against their will. Rather all of it is beloved and desirable. Whereas kufr and shirk, all of it is evil and all of it is something detestable. So this has become clear from that. As <em>rushd</em> (guidance) – and it is the Truth – has become distinguished from <em>al-ghayy</em> – and it is falsehood. And a person has intellect and has the ability to think so that he can weigh and compare truth against falsehood. And his thinking, if it is sound and if it is free from desires and ulterior motives, then his sound thinking will guide him to acceptance of the truth without having to be forced. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>This is one saying</strong></span> with regards to the <em>aayah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the second saying</strong></span> is that this aayah came down with regard to the People of the Book; and that the People of the Book are not to be compelled to enter into Islaam. Rather if they want to remain upon their religion then they are to be left to do so with the condition that they hand over the <em>jizyah</em> to the Muslims and they (the People of the Book) are in a state of being humbled. And as for other than them from the disbelievers, then nothing will be accepted from them except Islaam or being killed because they have no religion; and idol worship is a false and futile religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">And the third saying</span></strong> is that this <em>aayah</em> was abrogated by the <em>aayah</em> commanding <em>jihaad</em>. So this was the case initially before <em>jihaad</em> was legislated, then <em>jihaad</em> was legislated and the <em>aayah</em> was abrogated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However the first (of the three sayings) is what is correct &#8211; that the <em>aayah</em> is not abrogated and that the religion cannot be entered into the hearts by force. Rather it can only enter through choice. However whoever does not accept the Religion, he will be dealt with in a manner that befits him, whether it be being killed or having the <em>jizyah</em> tax taken from him if he be from those regarding whom Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, has legislated that it be taken from.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; فَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِالطَّاغُوتِ وَيُؤْمِن بِاللَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So whoever rejects <em>at-Taaghoot</em> and truly believes in Allaah…</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>At-Taaghoot</em> – what is meant is all of the <em>Taaghoots</em> in worship, in following or in obedience because the word “<em>at-Taaghoot</em>” here is left general.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rejecting the <em>Taaghoot</em> was put before having <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah (in the <em>aayah</em>) because having <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah will not benefit except after rejection of the <em>Taaghoot</em>. So whoever believes in Allaah but does not reject the <em>Taaghoot</em>, then his eemaan will not benefit him. So the person who says that he is a believer and he prays and he fasts and gives the <em>Zakaat</em> and performs the <em>Hajj</em> and he performs the acts of obedience but he does not dissociate himself from <em>shirk</em> nor from the people of <em>shirk</em> and says, “<em>They are not my business</em>” – this person will not be counted as a Muslim because he has not rejected the <em>Taaghoot</em>. So there must be rejection of the <em>Taaghoot</em> and it is to reject the <em>Taaghoot</em> and to believe as creed in its (the <em>Taaghoot’s</em>) falsehood and to distance oneself from it and from its people – this is essential. So his <em>eemaan</em> will not be correct except after rejecting the <em>Taaghoot</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in the other <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِي كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولًا أَنِ اعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُوا الطَّاغُوتَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We sent a messenger to every nation commanding, “Worship Allaah alone and avoid the <em>Taaghoot</em>!” </strong></span>[16:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the worship of Allaah will not be correct except through avoiding the <em>Taaghoot</em>. Two opposites cannot come together; <em>eemaan</em> and <em>kufr</em> cannot come together in the heart. <em>Eemaan</em> and major <em>kufr</em> cannot come together in the heart. As for the lesser <em>kufr</em> then it can come together (with <em>eemaan</em>).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Proof is He the Most High’s saying:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَالْعَصْرِ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الْإِنسَانَ لَفِي خُسْرٍ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">إِلَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالْحَقِّ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالصَّبْرِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">By Time. Mankind is certainly in loss. Except for those who have <em>eemaan</em> (those who truly believe) and perform righteous deeds, and enjoin one another with the truth and enjoin one another with patience.</span> [103:1-3]</strong><sup style="text-align:justify;">11</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory that you learn these four matters in detail – is there any proof for what the Shaikh has said? That it is obligatory upon us to learn these four matters, and he has promised us that he will not say anything except with a proof, so where is the proof? The proof upon that is His saying, He the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Bismillaahirra<u>h</u>maanirra<u>h</u>eem</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">By Time. Mankind is certainly in loss. Except for those who have <em>eemaan</em> </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(those who truly believe)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> and perform righteous deeds, and enjoin one another with the truth and enjoin one another with patience.</span> </strong>[103:1-3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Except for those who have <em>eemaan</em>”, <strong>this is the first matter</strong>: knowledge, because <em>eemaan</em> cannot be except through knowledge, which is awareness of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, awareness of His Prophet and awareness of the religion of Islaam with the proofs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second matter: </strong>“And they perform the righteous deeds”, this is action upon the knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third matter: </strong>“And they enjoin each other with the truth”, this is calling to the knowledge and action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The fourth matter:</strong> “And they enjoin each other with patience”, upon harm in the path of calling to knowledge and action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying, He the One free of all imperfections:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَالْعَصْرِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">By Time.</span> </strong>[103:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The, “<em>Waw</em>”, is the <em>waw-ul-qasm</em> (the <em>‘waw’</em> of an oath). And <em>Al-‘A<u>s</u>r </em>is a noun upon which an oath is sworn and it is <em>majroor</em>, and the sign that it is <em>majroor</em> is that it has a <em>kasrah</em> upon it. And what is meant is Time and a time period.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, swears by a time period and by Time, and it is something created. And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, swears by whatever He wishes from the creation, but the creation may not swear an oath except by Allaah. And Allaah does not swear an oath except by something which has importance, and which contains a Sign from His Signs, He the Perfect and Most High. So this Time, contains a lesson and has importance, and therefore Allaah swore an oath by Time, and He swore by the night when it covers, and He swore an oath by the daytime brightness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for the creation, then he may not swear an oath except by Allaah. And it is not permissible for us to swear an oath by other than Allaah. He <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu’ alaihi wa sallam </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Whoever swears an oath by other than Allaah, then he has committed unbelief or he has committed shirk.”</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said:<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Whoever is going to swear an oath, then let him swear by Allaah or let him keep silent.”</strong><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah swears by whatever he wishes and he does not swear except by something which has importance and which contains a lesson, so what is the lesson here in this Time? The lessons are tremendous, the succession of the night and the day, and how they interchange and take from each other, this one taking from that one, and that one taking from this one, and they succeed each other in this amazing ordered manner which does not vary or alter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a proof for the Ability of Allaah the Perfect and Most High. And then, whatever occurs within this Time from events and catastrophies and calamities and from favours and blessings and good things, and whatever occurs within this Time, this is from the lessons. And likewise because night and day are an arena for righteous action to be performed in. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> .. وَهُوَ الَّذِي جَعَلَ اللَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَارَ خِلْفَةً </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He </strong>(Allaah)<strong> is the One who made the night and the day to follow each other in succession …</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning they follow each other in succession, this one follows on from this one.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> لِّمَنْ أَرَادَ أَن يَذَّكَّرَ أَوْ أَرَادَ شُكُورًا ..</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">… for whoever wants to be reminded of Allaah or whoever wants to give thanks for Allaah’s favours.</span> </strong>[25:62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in some of the recitations of this <em>aayah, </em>it occurs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">… for the one who wants to remember Allaah …</span> </strong>[25:62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the night and the day are a tremendous bounty to be earned for a person who utilizes them in obedience to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, and the arena for action is the night and the day, you have nothing else besides the night and the day, they are the arena for action and for good and pure earning for this world and the hereafter. So in the night and the day there are lessons and there are benefits, so therefore Allaah swore an oath by Time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is this oath sworn upon? It is His saying:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الْإِنسَانَ لَفِي خُسْرٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Mankind is certainly in loss.</span> </strong>[103:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It (Mankind) means all of the descendants of Aadam, He did not exclude anyone, neither the kings nor the leaders, nor the rich people nor the poor people, nor the free people nor the slaves, nor the males nor the females. So, “<em>Al-</em>”, in, “<em>Al-Insaan</em>”, is for <em>istighraaq</em> – to make the word all-inclusive. All of the descendants of Aadam are in loss, meaning they will be in loss and destruction if they waste this precious Time, and they utilize it in disobedience to Allaah and in doing that which will harm them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this Time which is very cheap with many people, time seems prolonged for them, they become weary and bored, and they say, “<span style="color:#800000;"><strong>We want to kill some time</strong></span>”. So they bring amusements, or they travel abroad to spend a holiday and just to spend some time somewhere, or they laugh and joke to use up time. So those people, they use it up and waste it – then it will be loss and regret upon them on the Day of Resurrection. And it could be the source of their true happiness, if only they took care of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So all of the descendants of Aadam are in loss and destruction, except for those who have the <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">four qualities</span></strong> which are: knowledge and action and calling to Allaah and having patience upon any harm which the person meets. So whoever has these four qualities will be saved from this loss.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And having <em>eemaan</em> in Allaah is not possible except through having knowledge, which is knowledge and awareness of Allaah.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"> وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they perform the righteous and correct deeds</span> </strong>[103:3]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning they perform the righteous deeds from the obligatory duties and the recommended duties. So they utilize their time in performing the righteous deeds in that which will benefit them in their religion and in their worldly life, for even worldly action contains good and can contain reward if it is done with the intention of using it as an aid upon obedience. So how about action for the hereafter. So what is important is that you do not waste the time, rather you use it in something which will be to your advantage and benefit you.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالْحَقِّ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they enjoin each other with the truth</span> </strong>[103:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They command the good and they forbid the evil and they call to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and they teach beneficial knowledge and they propagate knowledge and good amongst the people. They become callers to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"> وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالصَّبْرِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they enjoin each other with having patience.</span> </strong>[103:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They have patience upon whatever strikes them. <span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>abr</em></strong></span> in the language means <strong>restraining</strong>, and what is meant by it here is restraining oneself upon obedience to Allaah. And it is of three types:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first one is: </strong>Patience upon obedience to Allaah.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second one is: </strong>Patience in keeping away from those things which Allaah has forbidden.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third one is:</strong> Having patience with those things which Allaah has Pre-decreed to occur.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So the first:</strong> patience upon obedience to Allaah, because the person’s soul desires laziness and desires relaxation, so therefore a person must force it to have patience upon obedience and upon the prayer and upon fasting and upon <em>jihaad</em> in Allaah’s cause even though it may dislike these matters, he should cause it to have patience and he should restrain it on obedience to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And the second: </strong>patience in keeping away from those things Allaah has made forbidden. The soul desires forbidden things and desires. It inclines towards them and is attracted to them, so therefore the person must bind it and restrain it away from the forbidden things, and this requires patience, and it is not easy to prevent the soul from desires and forbidden things. Whoever does not have patience, then his soul will overcome him and incline towards forbidden things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third is: </strong>having patience with the painful things which Allaah has decreed, the calamities which strike a person, from the death of a close relative or loss of wealth or illness which befalls a person, he must have patience upon the pre-ordainment and pre-decree of Allaah and he should not become vexed and he should not become angry, rather he should restrain the tongue from wailing and forbidden lamenting and from displaying anger and he should withhold himself from vexation and he should withhold his limbs from striking the cheeks and from tearing the front-opening of the garments. This is patience upon calamities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for faults, then he should not have patience upon them, rather he should repent to Allaah and flee away from them. However, with regard to calamities which are not something which you yourself have done, rather they are from Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, He has decreed that they will occur to you as a test and a trial or as a punishment for you for sins which you have committed just as there occurs in His saying the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا أَصَابَكُم مِّن مُّصِيبَةٍ فَبِمَا كَسَبَتْ أَيْدِيكُمْ وَيَعْفُو عَن كَثِيرٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whatever calamity strikes you then it is on account of the sins which your hands have committed and Allaah pardons and does not punish, a great deal.</span> </strong>[42:30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a calamity strikes the Muslim in his self or in his wealth or in his children or his close relative or one of his brothers from the Muslims, then it is upon him to have patience and to await reward. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِينَ إِذَا أَصَابَتْهُم مُّصِيبَةٌ قَالُوا<span style="color:#008000;"> إِنَّا لِلَّهِ وَإِنَّا إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُونَ</span></span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أُولَٰئِكَ عَلَيْهِمْ صَلَوَاتٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ وَرَحْمَةٌ ۖ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُهْتَدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Those who, when a calamity strikes them they say, “Indeed we belong to Allaah and we will certainly be returning to Him”. Those people, upon them is praise from their Lord and mercy, and they are the ones who are guided.</span> [2:156-157]</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is patience, and from that is having patience upon harm which comes in calling to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic, for that is from the calamities. So it is upon you to have patience upon whatever you meet from harm upon the path of good. And do not turn away from doing good, because some people wish to do good, however, if something which he dislikes faces him he then says, “It is not obligatory upon me to enter myself into these matters”. Then he abandons teaching if he is a teacher, he abandons calling to Allaah, he abandons giving the <em>khu<u>t</u>bah</em> if he is a <em>kha<u>t</u>eeb</em> (one who gives the <em>khu<u>t</u>bah</em> in a mosque), he abandons leading the prayer in the mosque, he abandons commanding the good and forbidding the evil – this person has not had patience upon the harm which came to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if you are upon error, then it is upon you to turn back to the truth and to correctness, but if you are upon  something true and you have not erred, then it is upon you to have patience and to await and expect reward and to be aware and to feel that this is in the cause of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and that you will receive reward for it, and that you remember the harm which occurred to the Prophets <em>‘alaihimu<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam </em>and how they had patience and how they strove and fought in Allaah’s cause, until Allaah the Mighty and Majestic gave them victory.</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قَالَ الشَّافِعِيُّ رَحِمَهُ اللهُ:<span style="color:#808000;"> لَوْ مَا أَنْزَلَ اللهُ حُجَّةً عَلَى خَلْقِهِ إِلاَّ هَذِهِ السُّوْرَةَ لَكَفَتْهُمْ</span></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ash-Shaafi‘ee <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said: “<strong>If Allaah had not sent down any proof upon his creation except this <em>soorah</em>, then that would have sufficed for them</strong>.”<sup>12</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “Ash-Shaafi‘ee”: He is the Imaam Mu<u>h</u>ammad ibn Idrees Ash-Shaafi‘ee and Ash-Shaafi‘ee is an ascription to his great great grandfather who was called Shaafi‘, and he was from Quraish from Banul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib. He died in the year 204 H, and he was one of the four Imaams. And he said this saying, because Allaah has made clear in this <em>soorah</em> the reasons for wretchedness and the means for true happiness and success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the means for true happiness and success is that the person has these four characteristics: knowledge, and action, and calling, and having patience upon harm in the cause of Allaah the Most High. So Allaah’s proof is established upon His creation through this <em>soorah</em>. Allaah the Perfect says to them &#8211; I have made clear to you the means for true happiness in this short and brief <em>soorah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Qur’aan, all of it, and the Sunnah are details for these four matters. However, this <em>soorah</em> has made clear the means to true happiness and success in general terms, through it the proof has been established upon the creation, and the texts of the Qur’aan and the Sunnah give the details and clarify these four matters. And the speech of Ash-Shaafi‘ee does not mean that this <em>soorah</em> is sufficient for mankind, even if Allaah had not sent down anything else. But rather it has established the proof upon them, because Allaah has made clear in it the means to true happiness and the reasons for total wretchedness, so on the Day of Resurrection no-one can say, “I did not know the means to true happiness and I did not know the reasons leading to total wretchedness”, when he has read this brief and short <em>soorah</em>.</p>

<h3><strong>Calling to the Knowledge</strong></h3>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الثَّالِثَةُ: الدَّعْوَةُ إِلَيْهِ<sup> </sup><span style="font-size:10px;vertical-align:super;"> </span></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The third is calling to it.<sup>9</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>Calling to it</strong>”: meaning, it is not sufficient that a person learns knowledge and acts himself and does not call to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. Rather he must call and invite others so that he benefits himself and benefits others, and because this knowledge is something he is entrusted with, it is not your personal property which you can hoard away and withhold from the people, when the people are in need of it. So what is obligatory upon you is to convey it and to explain it and to call the people to good. This knowledge, which Allaah has given you the task of carrying, is not an endowment for your benefit alone, rather it is for you and for others besides you, so do not keep it to yourself and prevent the people from benefiting from it. Rather it is essential that you convey it and you must clarify it to the people. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِذْ أَخَذَ اللَّهُ مِيثَاقَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ لَتُبَيِّنُنَّهُ لِلنَّاسِ وَلَا تَكْتُمُونَهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And when Allaah took the solemn agreement from those who were given the scripture, you must make it clear to the people and not conceal it</span> </strong>[3:187]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a solemn agreement which Allaah took from the <em>‘ulemaa</em> (people of knowledge) that they would make clear to the people that which Allaah has taught them, in order that the good should spread, and to bring the people out from the depths of darkness into light, and this was the work of the Messengers and of those who followed them. He the Most High said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ هَٰذِهِ سَبِيلِي أَدْعُو إِلَى اللَّهِ ۚ عَلَىٰ بَصِيرَةٍ أَنَا وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَنِي ۖ وَسُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَمَا أَنَا مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say: “This is my way, I call to Allaah upon clear knowledge, I and those who follow me, and Perfect is Allaah and I am not from the people of <em>shirk</em> (those who associate others with Allaah).”</span> </strong>[12:108]<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the way of Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu’alaihiwasallam </em>and the way of his followers: knowledge, and action and calling to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. So whoever does not call, and he has the ability to call, and he has knowledge and he conceals it, then he will be given a bridle of fire on the Day of Resurrection as occurs in the <u>h</u>adeeth.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Aboo Daawood and At-Tirmidhee and Ibn Maajah from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Aboo Hurayrah who said: Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu’alaihiwasallam</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong> “Whoever is asked about knowledge and he conceals it, then Allaah will give him a bridle of fire on the Day of Resurrection”. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Albaanee declared this <u>h</u>adeeth <u>h</u>asan <u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Ibn Maajah reports a longer wording from Aboo Sa‘eed Al-Khudree … [declared very weak by Al-Albaanee].</p>
<hr />
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Having patience upon harm which is encountered whilst carrying this out.</strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong><span style="color:#993300;">الرَّابِعَةُ: الصَّبْرُ عَلَى الأَذَى فِيهِ<sup>  </sup></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><sup> </sup>The fourth is having patience upon any harm encountered whilst carrying it out.<sup>10</sup></strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, “<strong>Having patience upon any harm encountered whilst carrying it out</strong>”: it is known that whoever calls the people, and commands the good and forbids the evil, then he will be exposed to harm from the evil-doers, because many of the people do not want good, rather they want desires and forbidden things and false whims, so when someone comes who calls them to Allaah and who deters them away from their desires, then there will certainly be a reaction from them either in speech or in action. So what is obligatory upon whoever calls to Allaah and desires the Face of Allaah is that he should have patience upon the harm, and he should persist in calling to Allaah, and his example in that regard will be the Messengers <em>‘alaihimu<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em>, and the best of them and their seal is Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ’alaihi wasallam.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What did he encounter from the people, how much harm did he suffer in sayings and actions? They said he was a sorcerer and a liar, and they said he was a madman. They said those sayings about him which Allaah the Mighty and Majestic has mentioned in the Qur’aan. And they harmed him with physical harm, they threw stones at him until his heels ran with blood <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ’alaihi wasallam</em> when he called them to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. And they threw the after-birth of camels on his back whilst he was making prostration by the Ka‘bah, and they threatened to kill him and they tried to intimidate him, and in the battle of U<u>h</u>ud, there occurred to him and to his Companions that which occurred <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> – they broke his lateral incisor tooth and they wounded his head <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu ’alaihi wasallam</em> and he fell into a ditch, and he was the Prophet of Allaah – all of this was harm in calling to Allaah the Mighty and Majestic. However he had patience and he bore it and he was the most excellent one of the creation <em>‘alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em>. So therefore whoever carries out this call will certainly face harm in accordance with the level of his <em>eemaan</em> and his call, however it is upon him to have patience as long as he is upon the truth, then he should have patience and bear it, for he is in Allaah’s cause, and whatever harm befalls him then it will be reward from Allaah the Perfect and Most High, upon the scale of his good deeds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Moosaa, the one to whom Allaah spoke directly, the strong and trustworthy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We see that his call was directed to <em>tawheed</em> and carried the lights of guidance and wisdom. Moosaa was brought up and was raised in the palaces of the greatest tyrant who claimed divinity. He knew the various types of corruption, unbelief, tyranny, injustice and despotism from what he witnessed in the palaces. He saw things which it is difficult to imagine or think possible. He also saw the enslavement of his people, the Children of <em>Israa’eel</em>, and their humiliation, and their women taken as slaves, and the killing of their children, to such an extent that it surpassed any oppression known to mankind. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Pharaoh exalted himself haughtily in the land, and divided its people into castes. He enslaved a group of them (i.e., the Children of <em>Israa’eel</em>), killing their sons and letting their women live. He was indeed one of the corrupt evil-doers.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of Pharaoh were also people of <em>shirk</em> and idol-worship without a doubt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">So how did Moosaa begin? Was his call directed to correction of the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of this idolatrous nation? Or did it begin with a demand for the restoration of the rights of the Children of <em>Israa’eel</em>, and a struggle to gain rulership and authority from the hands of the tyrant, and at the head of them Pharaoh, who claimed divinity for himself?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The call of Moosaa was just like the call of his forefathers and brothers from the earlier Prophets. His Lord instructed him and inspired him with the principle of <em>tawheed</em>, and chose him to carry his revelation, and to establish worship of Him. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Has not the story of Moosaa come to you? When he saw a fire and said to his family, ‘Remain where you are for I have seen a fire. Perhaps I can bring a fire-brand from it or find someone who can show us the way.’ So when Moosaa came to the fire his Lord called him, ‘O Moosaa, I am your Lord. Remove your shoes, indeed you are in the purified valley of <em>Tuwaa</em>. I have chosen you as My Messenger, so listen to and heed what I reveal to you. Indeed I am Allaah. None has the right to be worshipped but Me. So worship Me and do not worship anything else besides Me, and establish Prayer for My remembrance. Indeed the Final Hour is certainly coming, which I keep hidden from all except Myself, in order to reward each soul according to its good or bad deeds.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this was the beginning of his Messengership; he was inspired and ordered with the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of <em>tawheed</em>. He was ordered to establish it in himself and to represent it in his life. Then he was entrusted with the duty of calling to this sublime principle and was sent by Allaah to the Pharaoh. Allaah furthermore explained to him the correct manner of giving <em>da’wah</em> and the wise way in which he was to face the Pharaoh. Allaah, the Most High, said:<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Go to Pharaoh who has transgressed all bounds in his haughtiness, pride, unbelief, and say, ‘Will you not purify yourself from the sin of unbelief and be obedient to your Lord? And that I guide you to the worship of your Lord, so that you may submit fearfully to Him and obey Him.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also supported him with his brother Haaroon in order for the proof to be established to the utmost, and He taught them to use gentleness and mildness in <em>da’wah</em> since that is the best way to attain the guidance of those whom Allaah wishes to guide:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Go both of you to Pharaoh, indeed he has transgressed beyond all bounds, and speak mildly with him that he might accept admonition and fear and be obedient to his Lord.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they carried out the order of their Lord and called him to Allaah, hoping for him to be guided and purified, so that he should be one of those who fear Allaah and fear and beware of the evil consequences of <em>shirk</em> and oppression. But he did not respond to this wise and composed call. So Moosaa manifested the great signs and clear proofs of his Prophethood and the truthfulness of his Messengership. But the despotic tyrant Pharaoh merely increased in his transgression and rejection of the truth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“But Pharaoh denied the signs which Moosaa came with and disobeyed his order for him to fear and obey his Lord. Then he turned away from what he ordered him (i.e., obedience to his Lord) and instead worked evil and corruption, and he gathered his people and his followers and said, ‘I am your lord, the most high.’ So Allaah seized him with punishment for his latter and his earlier saying.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Escalation of the Tyranny of the Pharaoh and how Moosaa and his People Faced it with Patient Perseverance and Forbearance</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“The chiefs of Pharaoh’s people said, ‘Will you leave Moosaa and his people to cause mischief in the land when they have abandoned worship of you and worship of your gods?’ He said, ‘We will kill their sons and let their women live, and will have full power over them.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what was the sin of Moosaa and his people in the view of these criminals? No crime except that they called to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and to remain firm upon it, and to disbelieve in Pharaoh and his idols. Then what was the response of Moosaa with respect to these disgraceful and outrageous transgressions which exceeded all bounds in its barbarity and ferocity?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His response was to remain firm upon correct belief, and to have patience and forbearance, and to seek the aid of Allaah in facing these calamities. Then he awaited the good outcome, and victory as a consequence and a good fruit of this remaining firm and this patient perseverance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Moosaa said to his people, ‘Seeks Allaah’s help and be patient, the earth is Allaah’s, He gives it as a heritage to whom He pleases from His servants. The final outcome is in favour of those who fear Allaah by avoiding disobedience of Him and doing what He orders.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then when no hope that the Pharaoh and his people would believe remained, and the suffering which the Children of <em>Israa’eel</em> were subjected to increased in severity, the sole request which Moosaa made to the Pharaoh was that he should allow the Children of <em>Israa’eel</em> the freedom to leave the land of Egypt and emigrate to wherever Allaah willed that they should go, in order to save them from the torment inflicted upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“So go to the Pharaoh, saying, ‘We are the Messengers sent by your Lord, to order you to free the Children of <em>Israa’eel</em>. So release them and cease tormenting them. Indeed we bring you a clear sign from your Lord, and peace and safety from Allaah’s punishment are for those who follow the guidance.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was a sublime call to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah containing light and wisdom. It was also accompanied by an eager desire for the guidance of those who were being called, and that they should be purified. It also contained a clear example of the utmost patience and forbearance in enduring great harm, and in facing tyranny and haughty oppression. It also shows the way to face the most difficult situations with wisdom and forbearance, whilst having the strongest hope in Allaah, that He will assist and grant victory to the Believers and destroy the unbelieving oppressors. Including clear lessons for those who make their call purely seeking the Face of Allaah and desire to rectify mankind and to turn to their Lord, and for them to be guided to His Straight Path.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Importance of <em>Tawheedul-Uloohiyyah<br />
</em>(Singling out Allaah with all Worship)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I will discuss <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah with regard to worship (<em>Tawheedul-Uloohiyyah) </em>and its importance because of two reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Firstly</span></strong>, that it is the most important part of the call of the Messengers presented to us in the Qur’aan, and because it was the reason for the continual struggle between them and their enemies, the proud and haughty, and the obstinate, in every nation. It has continued as the reason for conflict until this day, and perhaps it will continue as such until the Day of Resurrection, as a trial and test for the inheritors of the Messengers, and in order to raise their station.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Secondly</span></strong>, the most severe and dangerous deviation afflicting the Muslims in the east and the west is with regard to it, and this affects the majority of the ignorant amongst the Muslims and many of those who are educated and those who associate themselves with knowledge. So we will begin by presenting the calls of the Prophets in general, and then present the call of some of them in particular.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“We sent a Messenger to every nation ordering them that they should worship Allaah alone, obey Him and make their worship purely for Him, and that they should avoid everything worshipped besides Allaah. So from them there were those whom Allaah guided to His religion, and there were those who were unbelievers for whom misguidance was ordained. So travel through the land and see the destruction that befell those who denied the Messengers and disbelieved.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“We did not send any Messenger before you, O Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  , except that We revealed to him that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, so make all of your worship purely for Him.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, says after mentioning a number of stories of the Prophets, <em>alayhimus-salaatu was-salaam:</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“This religion of yours is a single religion, and I am your Lord, so worship Me alone.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“O Messengers, eat from the food which Allaah has made lawful, and do correct and righteous deeds. Indeed, I am fully aware of whatever you do. Indeed this religion of yours is a single religion, and I am your Lord so keep yourselves safe from My punishment by obeying Me.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Katheer said, “Mujaahid, Sa’eed ibn Jubayr, Qataadah and Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Zayd ibn Aslam said about the saying of Allaah, the Most High,  which means, <strong>‘Your religion is one.’</strong>”<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> Then the meaning of these two <em>Aayaat </em>occurs in the <em>Sunnah</em> in his (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   saying, <strong><em>“I am the closest of the people to &#8216;Eesaa ibn Maryam in this world and the Hereafter. The Prophets are brothers, their mothers are different, but their religion is one.”</em></strong><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also Allaah, the Most High, says about the Messengers who were firmest in determination (<em>oolul-&#8216;adham</em>), <em>alayhimus-salaatu was -salaam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Your Lord prescribed for you O people, the same religion which He prescribed for Nooh, and that which We revealed to you O Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> ), and which He prescribed for Ibraaheem, and Moosaa, and ’Eesaa, that you should establish the religion, acting upon what is prescribed, and not split into sects with regard to it. It is intolerable to the polytheists that you call them to sincerely worship Allaah alone and reject worship of all else besides Him. But Allaah chooses for His religion whomever He pleases and He guides those who turn to Him in repentance and obedience, to act in obedience to Him, and to follow the guidance with which He sent His Messenger.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the call of all the Prophets, and at the head of them the Messengers who were firmest in determination. So the Prophets who numbered <strong>one hundred and twenty four thousand</strong> <a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> followed a single methodology in their call, and began from a single starting point which is <em>tawheed</em>, the greatest issue and most important principle which they conveyed to all mankind, throughout the ages and despite their varying societies, lands and times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a proof that this is the single way which must be followed in calling the people to Allaah, and it is something laid down by Allaah to be followed by all of His Prophets and their true and sincere followers. It is not permissible to change or replace it, nor to turn away from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Examples From the Calls of Some of the Messengers</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, has informed us about some of the individuals from the greater Prophets, and how they faced their people. We see that all of them proceeded upon the universal way laid down for them by Allaah and they followed the methodology established for all of them by Allaah. Not a single one of them is at variance with it. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And We sent Nooh to his people saying, ‘I am a clear warner sent to you, that you should worship none besides Allaah. Indeed, if you do not make all your worship purely for Him I fear for you the torment of a painful Day.’ The chiefs of the disbelievers amongst his people said, ‘We see that you are but a man like ourselves and we do not see you followed except by the lowest of the people, in what is apparent to us. Nor do we see that you have any excellence over us, rather we think that you are a liar.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong style="color:#008000;">“And to ’Aad We sent Hood, saying, ‘O my people worship Allaah, making all of your worship purely for Him, since there is none besides Him having the right to be worshipped by you. Will you not fear your Lord?’ The leaders of those who disbelieved amongst his people said, ‘We see you upon error </strong><span style="color:#008000;">(due to your abandonment of our religion and worship of our gods)</span><strong style="color:#008000;"> and we think that you are a liar </strong><span style="color:#008000;">(in claiming to be a Messenger from the Lord of the Worlds).</span><strong style="color:#008000;">’ He said, ‘O my People, I am not upon error, I am indeed a Messenger sent by the Lord of the Worlds. I convey to you the Message of my Lord and am sincere in my advice and faithful to my trust. Do you wonder that Allaah should send admonition for you through a man from amongst you, warning you of Allaah’s punishment and to fear Him? And remember the blessings of Allaah upon you in that He made you successors to the people of Nooh </strong><span style="color:#008000;">(after drowning them for their unbelief and denial of their Messenger)</span><b style="color:#008000;">, and He increased you in height and size. So remember the </b><span style="color:#008000;"><b>favours</b></span><b style="color:#008000;"> bestowed upon you by Allaah, so that you may be successful.’ They said, ‘Do you come to us warning us of punishment from Allaah for that which we practise as religion, so that we should instead worship Allaah alone and forsake what our fathers used to worship? We will not do that, so bring us the punishment which you threaten us with if you are truthful.’ He said, ‘Allaah’s punishment and wrath have become unavoidable for you. Do you dispute with me about mere idols which you and your fathers have given names to, things which can neither bring harm nor benefit, and Allaah has given no proof or excuse for their worship? Then wait for Allaah’s judgement between us, I too shall wait.’ So We saved Hood and those with him through Our Mercy </b><span style="color:#008000;">(due to their eemaan and their worship of Allaah alone)</span><b style="color:#008000;">, and we annihilated those who rejected Our signs and were not Believers.”</b><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the call of the Messengers, all of them followed this methodology in their <em>da’wah</em> to Allaah: they called first to the <em>tawheed </em>of Allaah, and that He alone must be singled out with all worship. Then their people opposed them because of this, except those whom Allaah guided, facing them with mockery, charging them with being liars and seeking to ridicule them. As Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Many Prophets were sent to the earlier peoples, and no Prophet came to them except that the people met him with mockery.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing more severe and hurtful to lofty believing souls than accusations of falsehood, ridicule and mockery. These things are more hurtful to them than being struck with swords and imprisonment and punishment. This fact is mentioned by the Arab poet who said, “<strong>Being harmed by close relatives is more painful to the soul than being struck with a sharpened sword</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">’Aa’ishah, <em>radiyallaahu ’anhaa, </em>asked the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , <em>“Has there been a day more severe upon you than the Day of Uhud?” So he said, “Your tribe has troubled me greatly, and the most troublesome thing which I experienced from them was on the day of ’Aqabah when I presented myself to ’Abd Yaaleel ibn ’Abd Kulaal and he didn&#8217;t respond as I had hoped. So I returned overwhelmed with sorrow and did not recover until I reached Qarnuth-Tha’aalib.</em><a style="color:#333399;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a><em> I raised my head and saw a cloud shading me, then I looked and saw Jibreel in it, and he called me saying, ‘Allaah has heard what your people said to you and their reply, and Allaah has sent the Angel of the mountains to you, for you to order him to do whatever you wish.’ So the Angel of the mountains called me and greeted me with salaam and then said, ‘O Muhammad, Allaah has heard what your people said to you, and I am the Angel of the mountains, and my Lord has sent me to you for you to order me as you wish. So what do you wish?’ So Allaah’s Messenger (</em><em>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</em><em> )   said, “No, rather I hope that from their offspring will come those who will worship Allaah alone and not worship anything else besides Him.”</em></span><a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>hadeeth</em> clearly shows the <em>da’wah</em> of Allaah’s Messenger (ﷺ) and his perseverance in that, and his mildness with his people. See how he was patient with them and asked for them to be spared from destruction which would have wiped them out. He instead hoped for good from Allaah, and hoped that from their offspring would come those who worshipped Allaah alone, not worshipping anything besides Him. Indeed what a noble and lofty goal, which is not realized except by those who taste the blessing of <em>tawheed</em> and know its station.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The books of <em>Seerah</em><a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a> detail some of the answers given by those who mocked him and their scornful stance when he invited them to Islaam. They mention that he went to a number of the nobles and leaders of the tribe of Thaqeef, and they were three brothers, ’Abd Yaleel, Mas&#8217;ood and Habeeb&#8230; and he sat with them and called them to Allaah and asked them to support Islaam and stand with him against those of his people who opposed him. So one of them said, “If it is actually true that Allaah has sent you, then He is tearing down the covering of the Ka’bah.” The second said, “Could Allaah not find anyone to send but you?” The third said, “By Allaah, I will never speak with you. If you are truly a Messenger from Allaah as you claim, then you are more serious than to have me reply to your words, and if you are lying against Allaah then it is not proper that I should ever speak to you.” So Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   left having despaired of good from Thaqeef.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What we see from the <em>hadeeth</em> and the stroy is that mockery and scorn and harm caused by the foolish idolaters was more severe to the Prophets than any other trouble, even more so than the fierce battles in which lives are spent and the blood of their pure companions is shed. Indeed on the Day of Uhud more than seventy Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   were martyred.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a> Amongst them: Mus’ab ibn ’Umayr,<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a> and Hamzah ibn ’Abdil- Muttalib<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a> the paternal uncle of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , and Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   was injured in the face and his incisor was broken.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a> He also suffered along with his Companions at the hands of the hypocrites, and suffered great harm and hardship before that in Makkah, and at Badr and other battles. Yet despite all of this, the severest trouble which he faced was on the Day of Taa’if because of the mockery and contempt which he faced to such a degree that it is unbearable for pure souls. Furthermore Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   said, <em>“<strong>Those who suffered the severest trials are the Prophets, then those who are most like them, then those who are most like them after that.</strong>”</em><a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So those who are most like them, and then those who are next closest are those who proceed upon their methodology in calling to Allaah, and called to what they called to, i.e. to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and that He is to be singled out with all worship, and to rejection of all <em>shirk</em> (attribution of any form or part of worship to anyone besides Allaah). Such people will suffer similar harm and trials as suffered by the Prophets who are their example. It is because of this fact that you see many of the callers departing away from this difficult methodology, and this rugged path, since the caller who follows it will have to face opposition from his mother, his father, his brother, his friends and those whom he loves. He will be opposed by the society which will treat him as an enemy and seek to mock and harm him. So many callers divert their attention to other aspects of Islaam which do have their place, and are not denied by anyone who truly believes in Allaah, except that those aspects do not involve that difficulty and hardship and do not bring about mockery and harm particularly in Islamic societies. This is because the majority of the people of the <em>ummah</em> of Islaam are willing to gather around these type of callers, and they throw praise and honour upon them instead of mockery and harm, unless they pose a threat to the rulers and are a danger to their positions, in which case they suppress them brutally. For example political parties which oppose the rulers and threaten to dethrone them. In such a case the rulers will show no love to relatives or friends, Muslims or disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then in any case we say to those callers: no matter how much noise they make, and no matter how high they raise their voices in the name of Islaam, restrain yourselves because you have left the way prescribed by Allaah and His Straight Path, upon which the Prophets and their followers proceeded in calling to <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and to making the religion purely for Him. So no matter how much you speak and raise your voices in the name of Islaam, you are still deviating from the methodology of the Prophets which was laid down by Allaah. No matter how much effort you expend, and how much you manage to extend your <em>da’wah</em> and your own methodology, you are still preoccupying yourselves with the means to the exclusion of the goal. Then what use are the means<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a> if they merely harm the goal, and they themselves grow at its expense.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed woe to those callers who obstinately persist upon the methodologies which they themselves have innovated, those who fight against the methodology of the Prophets in calling to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah, beneath dazzling banners and slogans which captivate the simple minded and those ignorant of the methodology and way of the Prophets.</p>

From them was Mus’ab ibn ’Umayr who was killed on the day of Uhud and did not leave anything behind except a small striped sheet. When we covered his head with it his feet were uncovered, and when we covered his feet with it his head was uncovered. So the Prophet said, ‘Cover his head with it, and place idhkhir (a sweet smelling rush) upon his feet.’”</strong> (Reported by al- Bukhaaree (Eng. trans.5/281/no. 408), Muslim (Eng. trans. 2/446/no. 2050 ), Ahmad and an- Nasaa’ee.</p>

But Tirmidhee’s declaration of its direct authenticity is debatable, and it as if he took into account other witnesses for it, since there are other supporting narrations for it:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Yoosuf (عليه السلام)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The noble one, son of the noble one, son of the noble one.[1] About whom Allaah sent down a long <em>Soorah</em> relating his noble life to us, and its stages, from his childhood to his death, and how his circumstances changed, and the difficulties that he faced, and how he faced everything with the Strength of Prophethood and his patient perseverance, wisdom and mildness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yoosuf, <em>’alayhis-salaam, </em>saw the corrupt outlook of the Pharaohs in Egypt and their oppression, and he knew the beliefs of the nation amongst whom he lived. He knew the corruption of their beliefs and their idolatry, which led them to take idols and cattle as gods to worship besides Allaah. The stroy of this noble Prophet, <em>‘alayhis-salaam, </em>is long, and from it, we will examine the story of his imprisonment and his <em>da’wah</em> at that time. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And two young men entered the prison along with him. One of them said, ‘I saw in a dream that I was pressing grapes,’ and the other one said, ‘I saw in a dream that I was carrying bread upon my head and birds were eating from it.’ ‘Inform us of the interpretation of this for indeed we see that you are one of the doers of good.’ He said, ‘No food will come to you to eat except that I will inform you about it fully before it comes to you. This is from the knowledge which my Lord has taught me as I have remained free of the religion of a people who do not believe in the oneness of Allaah and who are disbelievers in the Hereafter. Rather I follow the religion of my fathers, Ibraaheem, Ishaaq and Ya&#8217;qoob. It is not fitting that we should worship anything else along with Allaah. This is from Allaah’s favour upon us and upon the people, yet most of the people do not give thanks for Allaah’s favours. O my two companions in the prison, is it better that you worship many different lords, or that you worship only Allaah, the One, Who subdues and has full power over everything? You do not worship besides Allaah except idols which you call gods, which you and your forefathers give names to, for which Allaah has sent down no authority. Authority is for Allaah alone. He ordered that you worship none but Him, that is the Straight and true religion, yet most of the people do not know (and are people of <em>shirk)</em>.’”</strong>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This noble Prophet, <em>’alayhis-salaam, </em>lived in their palaces and was therefore well aware of the corruption of their administration and their rulers. He experienced at first hand their plots, their oppression, their unjust persecution and imprisonment by them. Furthermore he lived amongst an idolatrous nation who worshipped idols, cattle and stars. So where was correction to begin? What was the starting point?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff9900;">Did he begin calling to Allaah, whilst he was wrongfully imprisoned along with others who were oppressed like him, by inciting them and rousing them against the despotic and tyrant rulers? This would be without a doubt a political response, and was an opportunity open to him. Or did he begin his call from the starting point adopted by his noble forefathers, and at the head of them Ibraaheem, the chosen and beloved Friend of Allaah and the <em>Imaam</em> of the call to <em>tawheed</em>; which was the starting point for all the Messengers of Allaah? There is no doubt that the single way of correction and rectification in every time and place is the way of calling to correct <em>‘aqeedah</em> and <em>tawheed</em> and that all worship should be made purely and sincerely for Allaah alone.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore Yoosuf began from this starting point, following his noble fathers, proud of their <em>‘aqeedah</em>, and deriding and exposing the foolishness of the idolaters and their practice of taking idols, cattle and stars as lords to be worshipped besides Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So after clearly explaining this, and openly calling to <em>tawheed</em> and to rejection of <em>shirk</em>, he emphasised his call and his argument by his saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Authority and command is for Allaah alone.”</strong>[3], [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he explained this authority and command to mean the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah, and that He alone is to be worshipped:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“&#8230;That is the Straight and true reigion, yet most of the people do not know (and are people of <em>shirk)</em>.”</strong>[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also Yoosuf, <em>’alayhis-salaam, </em>attained the highest position in this state[6] whilst calling to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and establishing the clear proofs for his call and his Prophethood. Allaah, the Most High, says, in explanation of this,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The king of Egypt said, ‘Bring him to me, I will make him my personal servant.’ So when he spoke to Yoosuf, he said, ‘Verily, this day you have with us a position of rank and full trust.’ He said, ‘Place me in charge of the storehouses and wealth of the land, indeed I will guard them faithfully and with full knowledge.’”</strong>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said, giving thanks to his Lord and Protector,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O my Lord, You have bestowed upon me something of dominion and have taught me the interpretation of dreams. O Originator and Creator of the heavens and the earth, You are my Lord and Protector in this world and the Hereafter. Cause me to die as a Muslim and join me with the righteous.”</strong>[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore Allaah says in explanation of his <em>da’wah</em>, upon the tongue of the Believer from the family of the Pharaoh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And Yoosuf came to you previously (before Moosaa) with clear signs yet you have not ceased doubting about what he came to you with. Until when he died you said, ‘Allaah will not send any Messenger after him.’ This is the state of those whom Allaah leads astray, those who are disbelievers in Him and doubt the truthfulness of the Messengers.”</strong>[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from the knowledge to be learned from the life-story of Yoosuf, <em>’alayhis-salaam, </em>which is presented to us in those noble <em>Aayaat</em> is that the call to <em>tawheed</em> is something very essential. Furthermore there is to be no leniency or relaxation in fighting against <em>shirk</em>, it is not permissible to keep silent about it, whatever the circumstances of the caller to Allaah; rather it is not permissible for any Muslim to ever accept it or be relaxed about it. So this shows the high station of <em>‘aqeedah</em>, and its importance with Allaah, and with His Prophets and His Messenger. It also shows the very great difference and the distance between it and the details of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible for the Muslim, particularly the caller, to take up any position which violates his <em>‘aqeedah</em> or is contrary to it, or that he is a fortune-teller, those who are <em>Mushriks</em>, or that he is a custodian of their idols. If he does any of this then he is one of the misguided <em>Mushriks.</em> With regard to the legislative aspect, if the Islamic state is established, it must apply the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> of Allaah, otherwise:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed then they are the ones guilty of unbelief.”</strong>[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The unbelief (<em>kufr</em>) here is explained in detail by the scholars of Islaam, from the Companions and others, that it may be major <em>Kufr</em>, when the person disdains the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> of Allaah and declares it lawful to judge by something else, and it may be lesser <em>Kufr</em> (i.e., that which does not take a person out of Islaam) when he does not declare it lawful to judge by other than it, but gives in to his desires and because of that judges by other than what Allaah sent down.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However when the Islamic state has not been established, then Allaah does not a burden a soul with more than it is capable of. So the Muslim may take up a position in a non-Muslim state with the condition that he establishes justice, and that he does not obey them ina matter which involves disobedience to Allaah, and does not judge by other than what Allaah sent down. This was what the Prophet of Allaah, Yoosuf, did. He took up a position as a deputy for a unbelieving king, and he did not judge according to his laws:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“He could not have taken and kept his brother according to the king’s law.”</strong>[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, he established justice between the subjects and called them to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah. So this contains a decisive reply to those who give little importance to the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of <em>Tahweed</em>. Those who gloss over and accomodate when it comes to the <em>shirk</em> which has filled the world, and they regard the callers to <em>tawheed</em> and the enemies of <em>shirk</em> with contempt and scorn. They turn up their noses and are too proud to ‘lower’ themselves to the level of the callers to <em>tawheed</em>, and they are very wily and astute concerning political affairs, but nothing is more burdensome and disagreeable to their hearing and their hearts than listening to or saying a word regarding <em>tawheed</em> or <em>shirk.</em> These types of callers have caused themselves to fall into a deep abyss, whilst they think that they have reached the highest peaks. Can a people ever prosper whose stance with regard to the call of the Prophets is like this, unless they sincerely repent to Allaah from what they are upon?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] As indicated in the <em>hadeeth</em> of Ibn ’Umar, <em>radiyallaahu ’anhumaa, </em>from the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) that he said, “<strong>The noble one, son of the noble one, son of the noble one: Yoosuf the son of Ya’qoob, the son of Ishaaq, the son of Ibraaheem, </strong><em><strong>’alayhis-salaam.</strong>” </em>Reported by al-Bukhaaree (Eng. trans. 4/390/596), and Ahmad in <em>al-Musnad</em> (2/96), and also the <em>hadeeth</em> of Aboo Hurairah, <em>radiyallaahu ’anhu, </em>that Allaah’s Messenger (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) was asked about the noblest of the people, so he said, <em>“Those most pious and obedient to Allaah.” They said, “It is not this that we are asking about.” He said, “Then the noblest of the people is Yoosuf, the Prophet of Allaah, son of the Prophet of Allaah, son of the Prophet of Allaah, son of the chosen and beloved Friend of Allaah.” They said, “It is not this that we are asking about.” He said, “Then is it about the origins of the Arabs that you ask? Then the people are of various origins. The best of them in the times of ignorance are the best of them in Islaam when they attain knowledge and understanding in the religion.”</em> Reported by al-Bukhaaree (Eng. trans. 4/390/597).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Soorah Yoosuf (12):36-40.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Soorah Yoosuf (12):40.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] This <em>Aayah</em> is one of the basic principles from the principles of <em>tawheed</em>, as Allaah has explained upon the tongue of Yoosuf, <em>’alayhis-salaam. </em>What is most unfortunate is that you see that many of the political reformers have explained it in a way that is far removed from its primary meaning, that all worship is to be made purely and sincerely for Allaah alone, and have instead explained it to have a political meaning, which is establishment of the state which they claim will establish Allaah’s <em>Sharee’ah</em> upon the earth as His deputies/vicegerents. Then they go beyond bounds in this direction till they cause the people to forget the principal meaning of the <em>Aayah</em>, and they understand nothing from it except this new meaning, and there is no action and no ability except by the will of Allaah. They do the same with all or most of the <em>Aayaat</em> of <em>tawheed</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Soorah Yoosuf (12):40.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah, <em>rahimahullaah, </em>said in <em>al-Hisbah</em> (p.7), “Likewise Yoosuf the truthful and honest, was a minister for the Pharaoh of Egypt, and he and his people were <em>mushriks</em>. So Yoosuf performed whatever justice and good he was able to and called them as far as possible to correct <em>eemaan</em>.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibraaheem</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Father of the Prophets and the Leader of those who worship Allaah alone, upon the true religion, Ibraaheem, the Chosen and Beloved Friend of Allaah (<em>Khaleelullaah</em>), who was such that Allaah ordered the best of the Messengers and the final Prophet, and his <em>ummah</em>, to emulate him, to take his call as an example, and to follow his way and methodolgy.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And remember when Ibraaheem said to his father Aazar, ‘Will you take idols for worship? Indeed I see that you and those who worship idols along with you are upon clear error.’ Likewise We showed Ibraaheem the heavens and the earth (and how they are a proof that the Creator alone should be worshipped), so that he should be one of those who have Faith with certainty. So when the night covered him with darkness he saw a star and said, (as an argument to show his people the error of worshipping anything besides Allaah), ‘This is (what you claim to be) my Lord?!’ Then when it set, he said, ‘I do not love that which passes away.’ Then when he saw the moon rising up he said, ‘This is (what you claim to be) my Lord?!’ Then when it set he said, ‘If my Lord did not keep me firm upon the guidance then I would surely be one of the misguided.’ Then when he saw the sun, he said, ‘This is (what you claim to be) my Lord?! This is greater than the others.’ Then when it set he said, ‘O my people, I am free from all that you associate as partners in worship with Allaah. Indeed I have turned my face in worship to Him who has created the heavens and the earth, making all worship purely for Him, and I am not from those who worship anything besides Allaah.’”</strong>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this was a fervent, vigorous and incessant call to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah, and to make all of religion purely for Him, and to the elimination and rejection of <em>shirk</em>. It begins with the family and extends to the nations, waging war upon <em>shirk</em> and the idols and shaking the very foundations of attribution of any worship to the stars. So the chosen and beloved Friend of Allaah proceeded upon the soundest way in debating and arguing in order to establish Allaah’s Proof and to refute <em>shirk</em> and to show its fallacy and reject the doubts used to support it. So his use of the word ‘idols’ shows contempt for their phoney and supposed gods, and an exposure of their foolishness. He observed the aforementioned celestial bodies one after the other, each one succeeded the previous one which set and became absent, in order to use their condition as a clear proof of the fallacy of their having any divinty or right to worship as his people claimed. Who was it who protected and guarded them and controlled their affairs and the affairs of the creation when they passed and set?! Therefore they must reject the false divinity and right to worship which they claimed for them and disbelieve in that. It was upon them to wash their hands of them and turn instead to their true God, He Who created and brought into existence the heavens and the earth. He Who does not pass away or depart. He Who knows all about their condition and is fully aware of all their movements and periods of rest. He Who protects and preserves them and controls their affairs. They were strong proofs extracted from the situation they experienced and the visible creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And recite to your people from the Book (the Qur’aan), O Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  , about Ibraaheem. He was one who was fully truthful and one sent as a Prophet by Allaah. When he said to his father, ‘Why do you worship that which cannot hear, nor see, nor benefit you, nor remove any harm from you at all?! O my father, Allaah has given me knowledge which has not come to you, so accept the sincere advice I give you, and I will show you the Straight Way, upon which you will not go astray. O my father, do not worship Satan (by obeying him in his call for you to worship the idols) &#8211; indeed Satan is one disobedient to the Most Merciful (Allaah). O my father, I fear for you, knowing that if you die upon attribution of partners to Allaah in worship, and upon worship of Satan, that Allaah’s punishment and torment will be upon you, and that you will merely be a companion of Satan in the Hell-fire.’ He replied, ‘Do you reject my gods, O Ibraaheem? If you do not cease abusing and reviling them I will certainly revile you. Go away from me if you wish to remain safe from me.’ Ibraaheem said, ‘But you are safe from me harming you, I will rather ask my Lord to guide you and forgive your sins. He has always been most Gracious and Kind to me. I shall keep away from you and all that you worship besides Allaah, and I will worship and invoke my Lord, making all of worship purely for Him. I hope that I shall not be one unblest in my worship and supplications.’ So when he separated himself from them and all that they worshipped besides Allaah, We gave him a family who were better than them, Ishaaq and Ya&#8217;qoob, and we made all of them Prophets, and we bestowed our mercy upon them all, and granted them renown and praise upon the tongues of the people.”</strong>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this was a fervent call to <em>tawheed</em>, established firmly upon knowledge, reason and intellect, and upon good and sound manners. Guiding the misguided to the Straight Path. It was opposed by blind bigotry and partisanship, based upon desires, ignorance, stubborness and obsinate pride: otherwise how could anyone worship and humble themselves to those who cannot hear, nor see, nor help them in any way?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the knowledge of <em>tawheed</em>, O reader, is that knowledge which all the Prophets were honoured with, and with it they assaulted falsehood, ignorance and shirk. So ignorance of this knowledge, the knowledge carried by the Prophets, which guides to the truth and saves from misguidance and shirk, ignorance of this is fatal and is a deadly poison which kills the intellect and the ability to think.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O my Father, Allaah has given me knowledge which has not come to you, accept the sincere advice which I give to you, and I will show you the Straight Way, upon which you will not go astray.”</strong>[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then after these robust efforts in <em>da’wah</em> expended by Ibraaheem in calling to Allaah, calling the family and the nation, establishing the irrefutable proofs upon his father and his people, after this he took this great call and confronted that haughty and tyrannical ruler who claimed divinity, he faced him with the full strength and bravery. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Do you not consider the one (Namrood) who, because Allaah had granted him an extended kingdom disputed with Ibraaheem about his Lord. Ibraaheem said to him, ‘It is my Lord (Allaah) Who gives life and death.’ He said, ‘I give life and cause death.’ Ibraaheem said, ‘Allaah causes the sun to rise from the east, so if you are truthful then cause it to rise from the west.’ So the unbeliever was confounded, and Allaah does not guide the unbelievers to find proof against the people of truth.”</strong>[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Ibraaheem called this tyrant and claimant to divinity to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah, and to <em>eemaan</em> in His Lordship. But he exceeded all bounds in his arrogance and haughtily refused to accept the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and to give up on his claims to Lordship. So Ibraaheem debated with him in this brilliant manner whose proof was clear. Ibraaheem said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“It is my Lord (Allaah) Who gives life and death.”</strong>[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the stupid tyrant replied that he too could give life and death &#8211; meaning that he killed whom he pleased and spared whom he pleased. This answer of his was merely a pretence and a means of fooling the ignorant, and was a way of avoiding the question, since what Ibraaheem referred to was the fact that his Lord created mankind, animals and plants and gave them life, and brought them into existence from nothing. Then He causes them to die with His Power, and that He gives the humans and animals death at the end of their appointed life-spans, due to visible causes which He shows and without visible causes. So when Ibraaheem saw that he tried to create a pretence to evade the issue, which might fool some of the ignorant and common folk, he then said, as a means of showing the futility of what his saying entailed, that if you are as you claim, then,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“‘Allaah causes the sun to rise from the east, so if you are truthful then cause it to rise from the west.’ So the unbeliever was confounded.”</strong>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the unbeliever was left confounded and at a loss for words. His argument was overthrown, he was silenced, struck dumb and falsehood was rendered futile as is always the case. So this contains a lesson for those who listen attentively and witness it, that the call to <em>tawheed</em> represents the peak of sincerity, wisdom and intelligence; it proceeds in the due and correct manner, and as Allaah has willed, not merely struggling for kingship, nor seeking to fight for leadership.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the goal of Ibraaheem had been to attain rulership and authority he would have taken a different methodology to this, and he would have found people who gathered around him and supported him. But Allaah refuses, and His Prophets and the pious callers from the true followers of the Prophets in every time and place, they all refuse except to follow the way of guidance and truth, and to clearly proclaim the truth and to establish the proof against the proud and obstinate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Ibraaheem established this great obligation in the best and most complete manner. He established the proof upon his father and his people, upon those who governed them and upon all of his nation. Then when he saw that they were persisting in their <em>shirk</em> and their unbelief and were established upon falsehood and misguidance, he resorted to censure and correction by means of the hand and use of strength. So where did his change and correction begin, and what was the correct and rightly guided means for correction of the dire situation which had beset his nation? Did he seek to overthrow the state because it was the root of all the evils and corruption and the source of <em>shirk</em> and misguidance?! How can that be denied when the ruler claimed lordship for himself and persisted in that claim? So why did Ibraaheem not consider a revolution against this unbelieving government, and at the head of it a tyrant who claimed divinity, and by so doing wipe out all the forms of corruption and <em>shirk</em>, and establish in its place the divinely-guided state headed by Ibraaheem, ’<em>alayhis-salaatu was-salaam</em>?! The answer is the Prophets were far removed from following any such way or even considering it, since this is the way of the oppressors, the ignorant and the foolish, those who seek after this world and strive for authority in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather the Prophets were callers to <em>tawheed</em> and pioneers guiding to the truth, and seeking to save the people from falsehood and <em>shirk</em>. So when they applied themselves to correction and changing the state of affairs, and they were the most knowledgeable and intelligent of the people, then they necessarily began with striking at the true sources of <em>shirk</em> and misguidance. This is what Ibraaheem, the mild, wise and rightly guided, the heroic and brave, did. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“We guided Ibraaheem to the truth at a young age before the time of Moosaa and Haaroon, and We knew that he was fitting for that and was a person of true and certain <em>eemaan</em> who would worship Allaah alone and not associate any partner with Him. When he said to his father and his people, ‘What are these idols which you worship and are devoted to?!’ They said, ‘We found our fathers worshipping them and have followed them in that.’ He said, ‘Both you and they in worshipping the idols are in clear error.’ They said, ‘Are you serious in your saying that you have come with the truth, or are you merely being frivolous?’ He said, ‘Rather, I bring you the truth. Your Lord, other than Whom none has the right to be worshipped, is the sole Lord and Creator of the heavens and the earth, He Who created you all, not any of the idols to which you are devoted. I am a witness to the fact that none but Him is deserving of your worship.’ Ibraaheem said in secret (but was overheard by a single man from his people), ‘By Allaah, I intend to destroy their idols when they go off to their festival.’ So he broke them to pieces except for the largest of them (upon which he tied the axe with which he had broken the others), so that they might take heed and abandon worship of their idols after witnessing their weakness and futility. The people said, ‘Who has done this to our gods?! Whoever has done it is certainly a criminal.’ Those who had heard the saying of Ibraaheem said, ‘We heard a youth speaking, he is called Ibraaheem.’ They said, ‘Bring him before the eyes of the people, that they may testify against him.’ They said, ‘Is it you who did this to our gods, O Ibraaheem?’ He said, ‘Rather this one, the largest of them did it. Ask the idols who had it done to them, if it is that they can speak.’ So they turned to themsleves and said, ‘You know that they are unable to speak.’ He said, ‘Then will you worship besides Allaah that which cannot benefit you at all, nor harm you. Woe to you and the idols which you worship besides Allaah. Have you no sense to see the futility of your worship of the idols?’ They said, ‘Burn him and aid your gods, if you do indeed wish to aid them and continue to worship them.’ We said, ‘O fire, be cool and safe for Ibraaheem.’ They wished to cause harm to him, but it was they whom We caused to be the losers.”</strong>[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah guided Ibraaheem to the truth knowing that he was fitting for that. This wise and rightly-guided Prophet faced corruptions in beliefs (<em>’aqeedah</em>) and corruption in rule and authority. A nation whose thinking was degenerate, people whose minds were astray, so that they worshipped idols in the form of pieces of wood, rocks and stars. They were also ruled by a corrupt and evil government lead by a tyrant who claimed divinity, yet the people submitted to his leadership. So where was Ibraaheem to begin his correction? Should he have begun by attacking the ruler, since for certain he had ruled by other than the revelaed Law of Allaah and ruled by the laws of ignorance. There is no doubt about that. He also openly claimed Lordship and the right to make and lay down the law. Or should he have begun with correction of beliefs (<em>‘aqeedah</em>). Correcting the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of the nation and the <em>‘aqeedah </em>of the government of ignorance?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur’aan informs us that this rightly-guided Prophet, the <em>Imaam</em> of the Prophets, began with correction of <em>‘aqeedah</em>, that is the call to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah, and to make all worship purely and sincerely for Him alone, and fighting and wiping out <em>shirk</em>, and demolishing its causes, and tearing it out from the roots. So that is what he did: he called them to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah, and to renounce the worship of everything besides Him. He argued with them about this matter and they argued with him. But he refuted them with powerful arguments and clear proofs, and he stripped them of everything they sought to use as a proof until they admitted their wrongdoing, misguidance, and their blind-following and stubborn and fatal acceptance of the ways of their forefathers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“They said, ‘We found our fathers worshipping them and have followed them in that.’”</strong>[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when Ibraaheem saw obstinate following of desires and intellects as hard as rock, he made a wise and brave plan to destroy their idols. He carried out this plan with full vigour, bravery and courage. Then this heroic act[10] incited the government and the nation against him, and they called him for judgement in public and laid down the charge before him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Is it you who did this to our gods, O Ibraaheem?”</strong>[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he responded to them in a mocking and sarcastic manner,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Rather this one, the largest of them did it. Ask the idols who had it done to them, if it is that they can speak.”</strong>[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this mocking reply was like a thunder-bolt striking their imbecilic minds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Then they relapsed and said, ‘You know that they are unable to speak.’”</strong>[13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when he had divested them of the weapon of argument, they resorted to using force, the weapon used by everyone lacking proof in every time and place,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“They said, ‘Burn him and aid your gods, if you do indeed wish to aid them and continue to worship them.’”</strong>[14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But Allaah saved His chosen and beloved friend, Ibraaheem, and He threw back the plot of the unbelievers upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“We said, ‘O fire, be cool and safe for Ibraaheem.’ They wished to cause harm to him, but it was they whom we caused to be the losers.”</strong>[15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the fact that Ibraaheem was saved from harm in that huge fire, which Allaah caused to become cool and safe for Ibraaheem, was a very great sign, indeed one of the greatest of Allaah’s signs proving his Prophet hood, his truthfulness, and the correctness of what he came with, i.e., <em>tawheed</em> and the declaration of the fultility of the <em>shirk</em> and misguidance which his people were upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah rewarded Ibraaheem, <em>’alayhis-salaam, </em>for this wise <em>da’wah</em>, and this outstanding <em>jihaad</em> and sacrifice,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“We saved Ibraaheem and Loot from their enemies and took them to the land which We have blessed for all the worlds. And We bestowed upon him Ishaaq (his son) and Ya&#8217;qoob (his grandson) as an extra favour upon him. And We made all of them those who acted in obedience to Allaah and avoided what He forbade. And We made them leaders to be followed, guiding the people according to Our orders and calling them to worship and obey Allaah. And We inspired in them the doing of those deeds which are good, and establishment of the Prayer, and payment of the <em>Zakaat</em>. And they were worshippers of Us alone.”</strong>[16]</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] As indicated by the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Then We revealed to you, O Muhammad (*), that you should follow the religion of Ibraaheem who was a Muslim upon the true religion and was not one of those who worshipped idols and associated partners with Allaah.”</strong> [Soorah an-Nahl (16):123].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Say, O Muhammad (*): Allaah has indeed spoken the Truth, so follow the religion of Ibraaheem who was upright, upon the religion of Islaam, and he did not make any share of his worship for any created being.”</strong> [Soorah Aal-’Imraan (3):95].</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] Soorah al-Ambiyaa (21):53.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] The great heroic action and the wise call to <em>tawheed</em> and to the elimination of <em>shirk</em>, is counted by many of the callers to correction these days as being an example of preoccupying onesself with minor and insignificant matters. And there is no action nor power except by the will of Allaah. Indeed it is not the eyes that are blind, but rather the hearts. They think that <em>da’wah</em> must begin with a call to the correction and rectification of rulership and government, not correction of <em>’aqeedah</em>. In this view Ibraaheem and all the other Prophets were in error with regard to the correct methodology of <em>da’wah</em>. (al-Fawzaan).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Nooh (عليه السلام)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nooh was the second father of all mankind, and the first of the Messengers (<em>Rusul</em>) to the people of the Earth. This great Prophet lived a very long life: he called his people for nine hundred and fifty years to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and to making all worship purely for Him. He did not become weary of this, nor lose interest. He called them night and day, in private and in the open. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Indeed We sent Nooh as a Messenger to his people ordering him to warn his people before a painful punishment should come to them. He said, ‘O my People, I am a plain and clear warner to you, that you should worship Allaah alone, avoid disobedience to Him and obey me. If you do so He will forgive you your sins and grant you respite until an appointed term. Indeed when the term decreed by Allaah comes it cannot be delayed, and if you knew you would submit to and obey your Lord.’ Nooh said, ‘O my Lord, I have called my people day and night to worship You alone and warned them of Your punishment but my calling them to the truth only results in them turning away from it.</strong>[1]<strong> Whenever I call them to worship You alone and to obey You, and to disassociate themselves from the worship of everything but You, so that You may forgive them, they thrust their fingers in their ears and cover themselves up with their garments, so as not to hear. Then they persist in their disbelief and arrogantly and obstinately refuse to follow and submit to the truth. Then I called them loudly and openly, and I called them individually and privately. I said to them, ‘Ask your Lord to forgive your sins and repent to your Lord from your unbelief and association of others in worship with Him, and make your worship sincerely and purely for Him, then He will forgive you, indeed He greatly forgives those who turn to Him in repentance and seek His forgiveness. He will then send you rain in abundance, and grant you increase in wealth and children, and provide you with gardens and rivers. What is wrong with you that you do not have awe and fear of Allaah, when it is He that created you in successive stages? Do you not see how Allaah has created the seven heavens one above the other, and has placed the moon therein as a light and has made the sun a lamp? Allaah it is who created you and brought you from the earth, and He it is who will return you to it, and then resurrect you from it. Allaah &#8211; it is Who spread out the earth for you, so that you may travel about upon wide roads.’’ Nooh said, ‘O my Lord, they have rejected my call and opposed it, and have instead followed the call of those whose wealth and children only increase them in error and take them further away from their Lord. Furthermore the leaders have plotted a mighty plot, and they have said, “Do not abandon your gods. Do not abandon <em>Wadd</em>, nor <em>Suwaa</em>, nor <em>Yaghooth</em>, nor <em>Ya&#8217;ooq</em>, nor <em>Nasr</em>.” Indeed many have gone astray due to the idols. O Allaah, grant no increase to the transgressors except in error.</strong>[2]<strong> Due to their sins they were drowned in the Flood and entered into the Fire, and they could find no one to save them from Allaah’s punishment.”</strong>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what did the <em>da’wah</em> of this noble Messenger comprise of, and Allaah has told us the summary of his noble <em>da’wah</em> which continued for nine hundred and fifty years?! Indeed it was an earnest and painstaking call to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and to make all worship purely for Him. It was a tireless effort and he used every possible means available to him to convince them of his call. He called them privately and individually, and he called them openly. He encouraged them and warned them, informing them of the promise of good for the obedient, and evil for the disobedient. He gave them practical and intellectual proofs, from themselves and their lives, and what they saw before them with regards to the heavens and the earth, and the clear signs and lessons contained in them. All of this failed to benefit them and did not cause them to accept. Rather they persisted in their disbelief and error, and they rejected all this obstinately and arrogantly. They persisted in their adherence to the idols and false and futile objects of worship. So the result of this persistence and obstinancy was destruction and annihilation in this world, and everlasting torment in the Hell-fire in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At this point we may ask: why did this great Prophet continue for such an extremely long period of time, expending huge efforts, untiringly and without languidness, calling to the starting point of <em>tawheed</em>?! Why did Allaah praise him so highly, and cause him to be remembered, and make him one of those Messengers who were the firmest of all in their determination (<em>oolul-&#8216;adhm</em>)? Does the call to <em>tawheed</em> deserve all this esteem? Is this methodology an establishment of this procedure for this noble Prophet in opposition to logic, wisdom and intellect? Or is it pure and certain wisdom, and what is demanded by correct logic and sound and perceptive intellect? Why did Allaah approve of following this methodology in <em>da’wah</em> for 950 years, and commend him, and cause his name and his story to endure, and impose it as a duty upon the greatest of the Messengers and the one having the greatest intellect of all the people, that he should take him as an example to follow in his <em>da’wah</em> and his perseverance?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The just answer, established upon intellect and wisdom, and upon understanding the status and position of Prophet hood, and having the greatest trust in it and giving it its due respect, is that the call to <em>tawheed</em> and striving to wipe out <em>shirk</em> and to purify the earth from it, does indeed deserve all of this. It is indeed wisdom itself and is demanded by natural inclination and intellect. It is furthermore, a binding obligation upon every caller to Allaah that they understand this methodology, this great and divinely inspired <em>da’wah</em> and great goal, and that they devote all their effort and energy to its attainment and its being propagated throughout all of Allaah’s earth. Furthermore that they work together, cooperate and unite, and sincerely attest to each others’ truthfulness. Just as the Messengers, the callers to <em>tawheed</em>, were: the earlier ones telling of the coming of the later ones and the later ones attesting to the truthfulness of the previous ones and promoting their call, and following the same way. It is also binding upon us to believe that if there was any other methodology better and more correct than this methodology, that Allaah would have chosen that for His Messengers and would have favoured them with it. So is it fitting for any Believer to turn away from it and choose a different methodology for himself, and to arrogantly seek to attack this divinely laid down methodology and its callers?!</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[1] At-Tabaree reports from Qataadah, “It has reached us that a man would take his son to Nooh and say to his son, ‘Beware of this man, don&#8217;t let him lead you astray, for I remember when I was your age, my father brought me to him and warned me against him just as I am warning you.’”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[2] This supplication of Nooh against them came after he was informed by Allaah that they were not going to be Believers, as explained by al-Baghawee.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following is excerpted from Appendix I of  the book : “The Methodology of the Prophets in Calling to Allaah – that is the way of wisdom and intelligence” – by Shaykh Rabee hafidhahullaah, translated by Dawud Burbank rahimahullah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Appendix I </strong>[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah alone, and may He send praises and blessings of peace upon the Messenger of Allaah, and upon his family and true followers, and his Companions and those who follow his way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed, I praise Allaah, with abundant, pure and blessed praise for every blessing which He has bestowed on me, and I give thanks to Him, the Most High, and praise and extol Him, and I cannot praise and extol Him as truly befits Him, and no-one can do so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then from the blessings which Allaah has bestowed on me is that He has enabled me, despite my weakness, to speak the truth openly according to my capability, whether in writing or face to face encounters, so I thank Him and praise Him with praise such as would fill the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them. I also ask that He grants me firmness upon that until I meet Him and that He is pleased with me. I further ask that He grants me increase in guidance to what is correct, and protection, and I do not forget, and all praise is for Allaah, that when my book, ‘The Methodology of the Prophets in Calling to Allaah &#8211; That is the Way of Wisdom and Intellect,’ was published it was accepted by the true Muslim youth in every place with joy and was greatly welcomed. This was because it made the call of the Prophets clear to them, until it became as clear as the sun in the middle of the day, and it removed confusion, distortions and the deception of some writers whose hearts were like those of devils in the form of humans those whose only concern is to gather the people around them and around their fraudulent slogans. It does not worry such people that this gathering of people should include the Raafidees (extreme <em>Shee’ah</em>), the hypocrites, the heretical <em>Khawaarij</em>,[2] the extreme Sufis who are guilty of apostasy, the ignorant and their like from the worshippers of the graves, or whichever of the wretched and unfortunate groups.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It does not worry them that this type of people rally together with them and rally to their slogans, despite the evil consequences of this in this world and the Hereafter. This is because they are as they were described by Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , <em>“Callers to the gates of Hell, whoever answers their call will be thrown into it,”</em> and because they are as the sincere, truthful and trustworthy Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   described them, <em>“Devils in the bodies of humans.”</em> If this is not the case then what is it that causes them, and those who follow their lead, to flee from and separate themselves from the clear and radiant way and methodology of the Prophets, which is made clear by the Qur&#8217;aan and shown to be their way and their methodology?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Tawheed</em> of Allaah with regard to this His names and attributes, <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah in His lordship, and <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah in His worship, and to disbelieve and reject everything that is worshipped besides Him &#8211; that is the pure religion. Allaah the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“We sent a Messenger to every nation, ordering them that they should worship Allaah alone, obey Him and make their worship purely for Him, and that they should avoid everything worshipped besides Allaah.”</strong>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“We did not send any Messenger before you, O Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  , except that We revealed to Him that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah &#8211; so make all of your worship purely for Allaah.”</strong>[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Study any of the other <em>da’wah</em>s of the sects and parties &#8211; other than the <em>Salafee</em>[5] <em>da’wah </em>&#8211; do you see this methodology or any trace of it in their schooling, their persons, or their <em>jamaa&#8217;aat</em>? Then show it to me if you are truthful. As for myself I do not find in these sects and parties except that they wage a fierce war against this methodology and its people. I do not see except belittlement and mockery of this methodology and its people. I do not see except hatred and enmity for this methodology and its people, and I do not see except warm greetings and respect from them for the deviant and misguided calls and their people. Indeed you will frequently see and hear the last of these from those who disguise themselves as <em>Salafees</em> but are in reality closer in relation to their enemies, and there are ties and relationships between them which are such as they are known only to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there are some who are passionately in love with the state of superstitions, innovations and misguidance who think- and evil are their thoughts, and evil is the lie which they invent- that Imake a separation between the religion and the State, and that I dispute about the importance of the subject of authority of sovereignty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“What a serious word it is that comes out of their mouths! What they say is nothing but a lie”</strong>[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this book displeased them and it made clear the falsity of their calls and their misrepresentation and distortion of Islaam and of the text concerning <em>tawheed </em>&#8211; particularly with regard to the <em>da’wah</em> of the Messengers, may Allaah’s praise and blessings of peace be upon them. The book did not join them in welcoming the state of the <em>Raafidee Shee&#8217;ahs</em>. Nor did it support them in seeking establishment of statelets founded upon the building of the tombs and upon the belief that the pious who have died know the Hidden and Unseen and have some control over the creation. Nor did it support them in seeking establishment of statelets based upon any such things as have preceded, nor in accepting the misguidance and <em>shirk</em> of secularism which seeks to disguise itself in the guise of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather the book, and all praise is for Allaah, made clear that the true and trustworthy <em>da’wah</em> is that which follows the methodology of the Prophets in calling to Allaah, and the state which is established upon this correct methodology &#8211; that is the Islamic state. Then despite the fact that the book was dealing with a particular topic &#8211; which was to explain the methodology of the Prophets in calling to Allaah &#8211; it still gave attention to mentioning the Islamic state which it mentioned repeatedly and emphasised a number of times. It even had a chapter headed: &#8220;The view of the scholars of Islaam concerning leadership (<em>al-Imaamah</em>) and their proofs of its obligation&#8221;. Then the scholars sayings about that were quoted and their proofs mentioned. However what angered the people of innovations and desires, and the callers to falsehood, is that I placed leadership and the state in the place given to them by Allaah and which was accepted by the scholars of Islaam. I did not support the people of innovation and desires in their abandonment of the methodology of the Prophets in calling to <em>tawheed</em>, and fighting <em>shirk</em>, innovations and the rest of the types of misguidance and deviation, and fighting idolatry and grave-worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nor did I support them in making leadership (<em>al-Imaamah</em>) the most important matter, and the most fundamental principle &#8211; which is something which has led people to rejection of the methodology of the Prophets and has lead them to fight against it. It has also led them to fling themselves into the arms of the <em>Raafidee Shee&#8217;ah</em>, and to having affection for them, and to allying themselves with them, defending them and to falsley adorning their ideology which is at war with Islaam, in opposition to the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em> and waging war against the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   and his pure wives and the rest of the Muslims and their scholars. Indeed it goes beyond that to the point that they declare these great people to be disbelievers and make the foulest attacks against them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I did not support them in this misguidance and this loathsome excess, so they disliked the book and thought evil about its author. So they said the falsehood which they said in order to turn the youth who thirst for the truth away from the irrefutable and clear truth in this book. This book which openly spoke the truth and placed both correct creed and belief (<em>‘aqeedah</em>) and the state in the place given to them by Allaah &#8211; without going beyond the bounds or falling short, and without distorting and deception. Then it is essential that I explain to the youth the distinction between the state (<em>ad-Dawlah</em>) and the dominion and sovereignty of Allaah (<em>al-Haakimiyyah</em>). As for the state, then it is a gathering of people who may be disbelievers, may be misguided deviants, or may be Believers. Then the people may be gathered under a rightly- guided <em>khilaafah</em>, or restricted kingships- which has been the case with the Islamic states after the rightly -guided <em>khilaafah</em>. So these individuals who form the Believing state are no more than the means to implement the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> of Allaah- the establishment of <em>jihaad</em>, the ordering of good and forbidding of evil, establishment of the Prescribed Punishments and retribution, and the protection of the <em>ummah</em> from the plots and aggression of the enemies against the lands of the Muslims and against their souls, their wealth and their honour. So the Muslims must establish a state to accomplish these great obligations &#8211; either : by giving the pledge of allegiance to a <em>khaleefah</em> whom all of the Muslims are united upon; or by the fact that an individual from the <em>ummah</em> gains ascendancy and has power, an army and authority &#8211; which means that the benefit of the <em>ummah</em> lies in accepting him as long as he proclaims Islaam, establishes the laws and the creed (<em>‘aqeedah</em>) and protects the <em>ummah</em> from its enemies and does whatever is required, the details of which are known and mentioned in the source works of Islaam; or by the fact that some individuals gain ascendancy over some areas as happened in the lands of Islaam after the weakening of the <em>khilaafah</em>, so overall benefit necessitated submitting to this situation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for dominion and sovereignty then these are attributes of Allaah and qualities particular to Him alone, as He, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Judgement and command is for Allaah alone, He ordered that you should worship none but Him. That is the true and straight religion.”</strong>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this authority and sovereignty is not denied except by one who is a disbeliever in Allaah and is severe in his enmity to Allaah, His Messenger and His Books. Indeed one who even denies Allaah’s authority in the slightest matter, not to mention with regard to fundamental matters, then he is a disbeliever in Allaah, outside the fold of Islaam if he knowingly denies that. As for the ignorant person, then he has excuse until the proof is established against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What I have said applies to the rulers, the ruled and to indivduals and groups (<em>Jamaa&#8217;aat</em>). This has been affirmed by the trustworthy scholars of Islaam, and from them Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah, <em>rahimahullaah,</em>[8] and his student Ibnul-Qayyim.[9] So whoever accepts and abides by this rule and authority in the fundamentals of the religion and its details, and in matters of creed and belief, and matters of worship, and dealings and political affairs, and economic affairs, and manners, and social affairs &#8211; then he is a Believer. But he who does not abide by it all or some of these then he is a disbeliever, whether he is an individual or a group, a ruler or one ruled, a caller or one called. Indeed I fear, by Allaah, for many of the sects, parties and individuals that they may fall into disbelief due to their not abiding by the rule and authority of Allaah with regard to the fundamentals of the religion, indeed with regard also to its details. I fear for many of them, against whom the proof has been established and to whom the truth has been made clear, yet still they persist in opposing the call to <em>tawheed</em> and oppose waging war against shirk and innovation, aswell as opposing its people and to cutting from them. Instead these people incite others against and warn against those who call with the call of the Prophets, and those who seek truly and sincerely to amend the affairs. After establishment of the proof against such a person he would fall into the abyss of disbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I call all of the <em>ummah</em> &#8211; its rulers and its ruled, its indivduals, sects, and parties, to all have true belief in the all-encompassing authority and sovereignty of Allaah which covers the fundamental matters of the religion and its details, and that they should fully abide by it with regard to the fundamental matters of the religion and its details. I also call the heads of the states, from those who abide generally by the rule and authority of Allaah, and yet are negligent in some areas of practice, I call them to abide by it totally and unrestrictedly in every field, in the matter of <em>‘aqeedah</em>, and worship, and dealings, and economics, and politics, and with regard to ordering good and forbidding evil, and that they should strive to fight against <em>shirk</em> and innovations, and against sins and against evil &#8211; particularly usury and the rest of the major sins which harm the <em>ummah</em> and its manners. Indeed Allaah prevents by means of the rulers those who are not prevented by the Qur’aan. They should be fully aware that Allaah will question them about every small and large matter which they are responsible for. <em>“Each of you is a guardian and is responsible for thoses whom he is in charge of.” </em>I also remind them of the saying of the Prophet, <em>“There is no ruler having authority over Muslim subjects who dies while he is decieving them except that Allaah has forbidden Paradise for him.”</em>[10] and his saying, <em>“There is no servant whom Allaah places in authority over some people, and he does not deal with them sincerely and honestly, except that he will not find the fragrance of Paradise.”</em>[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From sincerity to the <em>ummah</em> is that you encourage them to abide by the ruler of Allaah and His <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em>, by teaching them, directing them, encouraging and warning them, and by ordering the good and forbidding the evil, and by establishing prescribed punishment and using every means which will cause them to respect the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> of Allaah in <em>‘aqeedah</em>, worship, political affairs and manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also call the heads of state in Islamic lands who do not abide by the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> of Allaah that they should turn back to Allaah and respect His religion which is found in the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, and that they should cling to the creed and beliefs of this religion and its rulings, and to be proud of that &#8211; since therein lies honour and nobility. However total disgrace and humiliation comes from submission to laws laid down by the most despicable humans, the enemies of this <em>ummah</em> whether they are Jews, Christians, Magians or atheists. So I call such leaders to respect the feelings of the <em>ummah</em> of Islaam which has striven and fought and sacrificed millions of its sons for the achievement of a noble and lofty goal &#8211; which is that it should be ruled by Islaam, and Islaam alone is the religion of Allaah, the Creator of this creation, the Creator of mankind and <em>jinn</em> so that they should worship Him alone and submit to His revealed laws alone. They should abide by the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> of Allaah and impose it upon the <em>ummah</em> in creed and beliefs, in manners, in teaching and in Islamic curriculae which education and training are to be based upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also enjoin the scholars of the <em>ummah</em>, and its callers, and parties and groups that they should sincerely advise all of the <em>ummah</em>, its elders and its youth, its males and its females, and unite them upon the Book of Allaah, the <em>Sunnah</em> of his Messenger, and upon the methodology and understanding of the <em>Salalafu-Saalih</em> (the Pious Predecessors), the Companions, the <em>Taabieen</em> and those who followed them upon good, the <em>imaams</em> of guidance, the scholars of <em>fiqh</em>, the scholars of <em>hadeeth</em> and of <em>tafseer</em>, in creed and beliefs, in worship, in manners, in dealings, in economic affairs, and all the other affairs of Islaam and <em>eemaan</em>. Then they should fully comprehend the Sayings of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed then they are the ones guilty of unbelief.”</strong>[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed then they are the transgressors.”</strong>[13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed then they are the disobedient.”</strong>[14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They should understand that these Sayings of Allaah apply to all individuals, groups, rulers and subjects. So to restrict it to refer it to the rulers alone and not to the people of deviant sects and misguidance, those who do not judge by the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> of Allaah in their creed and beliefs, nor in their worship and their behaviour, then this is from ignorance, misguidance and foolishness, since Allaah sent these <em>Aayaat</em> down concerning the Jews at a time when they had not had any state or authority for centuries. He sent these <em>Aayaat</em> down concerning them at a time when He had imposed humiliation and lowliness upon them. I have explained the authority and sovereignty of Allaah in this broad and all-embracing sense in the book itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I should also not fail to draw attention to an error made by the author of <em>‘Meezaanul-I&#8217;tidaal litaqyeem Kitaabil-Mawridiz-Zallaal fir-Tanbeeh &#8216;alaa Akhtaa’iz Zilaal,’ </em>who is ’Isaam ibn Muhammad ibn Taahir al-Barqaawee, who attributed to me something which my tongue has never uttered and which I never believed, nor have I ever written such a thing. Furthermore I seek Allaah’s refuge from what he said, and I declare myself free before Allaah from it, and I ask Allaah to save me and all the Muslims from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Barqaawee said in a footnote (p.15) to his aforementioned book: “This also reminds me of what Shaykh Rabee&#8217; ibn Haadee al-Madkhalee, <em>hafizahullaahu ta&#8217;aalaa</em>, did in his book, <em>‘Manhajul-Anbiyaa fid-Da’wah illallaah&#8230;’ </em>when he criticised the view of al-Maududi, <em>rahimahullaah ta&#8217;aalaa</em>, about the importance of leadership (<em>imaamah</em>), <em>khilaafah</em>, and judging by that which Allaah sent down, since he also sought to use as evidence the saying of Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah about the position of the <em>imaamah</em> with the Raafidee (<em>Shee&#8217;ahs</em>). So he took up six pages in quoting the discussion of Shaykhul-Islaam with those <em>Raafidee</em> (<em>Shee&#8217;ahs</em>). However the numerous and great differences between the beliefs of the <em>Raafidees</em> concerning the <em>imaamah</em> and the infallibility of the <em>Imaams</em>, and the twelve <em>imaams</em> and so on, and between what al-Maududi and others call to, i.e. the necessity and importance of striving to return to judging by the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em>, through the <em>khilaafah</em>, and to establish a single ruler for the people of Islaam; the differences between these two are well known. Even if the words of Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah contain something which is fitting in this regard, yet most of it, if a just person were to examine it, is not fitting to this discussion, rather it applies to the matter of <em>imaamah</em> with the <em>Raafidee</em> (<em>Shee&#8217;ah</em>) with its well known details&#8230; so he should not have quoted it all&#8230; for fear of deception.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Barqaawee&#8217;s scales are unbalanced and he has not judged between myself and al-Maududi with justice, and perhaps he has forgotten the saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And weigh justly with the true balance.”</strong>[15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Woe to those who give short measure to others. Those who demand full measure from others, but when they give them in measure or weight then they give them less than their due. Do these people not think that they will be ressurected for reckoning on a formidable Day. The Day when all mankind will stand before the Lord of the Worlds.”</strong>[16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brother al-Barqaawee, I was debating the view of al-Maududi about the importance of the matter of leadership (<em>imaamah</em>), the <em>khilaafah</em> and judging by that which Allaah has sent down!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards the fact of their importance, then no Believer having a trace of <em>eemaan</em> would dispute that. But O brother you have failed to note the point of disagreement between myself and al-Maududi. I debated with the view of al-Maududi with regard to his going beyond the due limits about leadership to such an extent that no Muslim who has respect for Islaam could remain silent about this excess, and it was of such a level that even the misguided would not accept it, not to mention the people of <em>hadeeth</em> and the <em>Salafees</em>. Indeed very many scholars from his own land, from the <em>Salafees</em> and others have replied to him. Then this excess of his has travelled and has reached many Arab and Islamic lands, and it has fooled an overwhelming majority of authors and youth, which has led to great neglect of the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of <em>tawheed</em>, and even comtempt of it and of its people. It has also led people to treat <em>shirk</em> and innovation lightly and has caused al-Maududi and his like to ally themsleves with and to befriend the devotees of the graves and even the <em>Raafidees</em> (<em>Shee&#8217;ah</em>), and to gather these people under their banner, to treat them as brothers, to love and defend them and their beliefs and creed, and this is something which is a reality and is clear to everyone possessing intellect and religion. So since the matter has reached this frightful state, I replied to al-Maududi with regard to some of his excess in order to make the people in general aware, and also the people of the Arabian Peninsula, to which the followers of al-Maududi and their helpers direct their attention. So they seek to wipe away the <em>’aqeedah</em> of <em>tawheed</em>, and the <em>’aqeedah</em> of true and correct alliance and enmity (<em>al-Walaa wal-Baraa</em>). Do you think that my reply to al-Maududi was so unreasonable that you seek to defend his view with falsehood, and by forgetting to judge justly, to the point that you take my words to mean something which I did not say, and which they did not mean?! Listen to what al-Maududi says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The question of leadership is the most important matter in human life and its most fundamental principle.” Then try to defend this saying with clear and unequivocal texts from the Book of Allaah and the <em>Sunnah</em> of His Messenger, and the words of the Companions and the scholars of Islaam. If you have not seen this, then you must adjust your scales in order to establish justice, equity and fairness, and to abandon the excess which has led al-Maududi and his followers to scorn the call of the Prophets and the goal of their <em>da’wah</em>, and to turn the affairs upside down. Listen to his saying: “The true goal of the religion is to establish the system of the rightly guided and righteous leadership (<em>imaamah</em>).” So to him this is the true goal of the religion. So <em>tawheed</em>, and the Prayer, and<em> Zakaat</em>, and <em>jihaad</em> and other matters from the religion become only means to reach this goal in the view of al-Maududi. So produce the clear proofs from the Book of Allaah and the <em>Sunnah</em> of His Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , in place of al-Maududi, to support this and if you are unable then do not be too embarrassed to say, ‘This poor weak servant, Rabee’ ibn Haadee, has spoken the truth and has been sincere towards Islaam and the Muslims, and has put matters in their due place.’ Then listen to the saying of al-Maududi: “This is the purpose for which the Prayer, Fasting, the <em>Zakaat</em> and the <em>Hajj</em> have been made obligatory in Islaam. Then the fact that they are called acts of worship does not mean that they are themselves worship, rather its meaning is that they prepare mankind for the true and fundamental worship, and these are a training course which are essential for that.&#8217; He also says, &#8216;You think that standing facing the <em>Qiblah</em>, placing the right hand upon the justify, and <em>rukoo&#8217;</em> with your hands upon your knees, and prostration upon the ground, and reciting particular words, and these actions and movements are themselves worship; and you think that fasting from the start of <em>Ramadaan</em> until the start of <em>Shawwaal</em>, and going hungry and thirsty from morning until evening, you think that this is worship; and you think that reciting a number of <em>Aayaat</em> from the Qur&#8217;aan is worship; and you think that performing <em>Tawaaf</em> around the <em>Ka&#8217;bah</em> is worship. In summary you have called the manifestation of certain actions worship, and when a person performs these actions with their form and manners you think that he has worshipped Allaah&#8230; but the truth is that the worship which Allaah created you for, and which he ordered you to perform is something else.”[17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Are you pleased by this derisive manner about speaking about the great pillars of Islaam and those who worship in this way? These are not, in the view of al-Maududi, forms of worship for which man was created, rather the worship for which man was created and which they were ordered to fulfil is something else. O Barqaawee, do you take this as your religion before Allaah? That the forms of worship are only a training course which if applied will&#8230; etc. Is this something stated textually in the Qur’aan and the <em>Sunnah</em>, and which the Prophets came with and which was accepted by the best of the people of this <em>ummah</em>? If you agree with al-Maududi then bring the proofs to support his saying. Otherwise bite upon your knuckles in regret and grief for having deserted the truth and offended its people and helped falsehood. This, O my brother, was the subject of my debate with al-Maududi, and about which I quoted the words of Shaykhul-Islaam concerning the exceeding of the bounds by the <em>Raafidees</em> about leadership (imaamate). What I quoted from him was all relevant, not just a part of it as al-Barqaawee claimed. Then if you were correct, O Barqaawee, then why did you not explain what was relevant from the words of Shaykhul-Islaam and what was not? As for the claim of &#8216;infallibility&#8217; for the &#8216;twelve imaams,&#8217; then I did not attribute it to al-Maududi, nor did I debate about it with him, nor did I quote Shaykhul-Islaam’s words about it. So your words are totaly opposed to justice! As for your equity and justice which you set up for yourself in judging between Sayyid Qutb and ad-Duwaysh, then I do not know what you have done. Indeed you have totally failed to be just between myself and al-Maududi, and how would it have harmed you to speak the truth? Then as for the <em>khilaafah</em>, I do not know if you read what I wrote and quoted from the scholars of Islaam, or if you merely took the subject with the tips of your fingers with your eyes closed, thinking that justice and equity would be achieved that easily. So read this and that anew and speak the truth, supporting it with proof, not alarmism and agitation!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for judging by that which Allaah sent down, then how can you imagine that I would dispute about it with al-Maududi or anyone else, when it is something known necessarily in the religion, and not even the deviant and deviated sects dispute about it?! So I seek Allaah’s refuge from what the author of <em>‘al-Meezaan,’</em> attributed to me. Rather read again what I wrote concerning the authority and sovereignty of Allaah, and that it comprehends every part of the religion, and you will see the extent of the mistake of al-Barqaawee, may Allah guide him. Then finally the points of criticism of al-Maududi and his like are so many that this introduction is not the place for them. But in summary, he is one of those furthest from abiding by the authority and sovereignty of Allaah with regard to his <em>’aqeedah</em> and his <em>Fiqh</em>, and with regard to his stance on the <em>Sunnah</em> of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , and his stance with regard to the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , and with regard to their enemies the <em>Raafidee Shee&#8217;ah</em>. Indeed he and his followers have alliance and friendship with those <em>Raafidees</em>, they support them and they praise their <em>Taaghoot</em>, al-Khomeini and his students, the <em>Aayatur-Raafidiyyah</em>. So noble reader be aware of this, and judge the people according to the truth, and do not judge the truth according to its people, and beware of falling into the abyss of over-exaggerated respect for personalities so that it leads you to reject the truth, and to argue against its people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah guide and grant the <em>ummah</em> to loving the truth and its people. Indeed my Lord hears and responds to supplications.</p>

<p>[The following is the continuation of the article @ <em><a title="Permanent Link to The Call to Allah : Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/01/27/the-call-to-allah/">The Pillars which support the correct Da’wah</a></em> – Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">.. So whichever call is not <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/01/27/the-call-to-allah/"><strong>built upon these foundations</strong></a>, and whatever methodology is not from the methodology of the Messengers &#8211; then it will be frustrated and fail, and it will be toil without any benefit. The clearest proofs of this are those present day groups (<em>jamaa&#8217;aat</em>) which set out a methodology and programme for themselves and their <em>da’wah</em> which is different to the methodology of the Messengers. These groups have neglected the importance of <em>‘aqeedah</em> (correct belief and creed) &#8211; except for a very few of them &#8211; and instead call for the correction of side-issues. So one group calls for the correction of rule and politics, and demands establishment of the prescribed punishments, and that Islamic Law be applied in judging amongst the people, and this is indeed something very important, but it is not what is most important &#8211; <strong>since how can one seek to establish and apply Allaah’s Judgement upon the thief and the fornicator before seeking to establish and apply Allaah’s Judgement upon the <em>mushrik</em>, the one who attributes worship to others besides Allaah?! How can we demand that Allaah’s Judgement be applied to two men disputing about a sheep or a camel before demanding that Allaah’s Judgement be applied to those who worship idols and graves, and those who deny or hold heretical beliefs with regard to Allaah’s Names and Attributes, divesting them of their true meanings, or distorting them?! </strong>Are these people not greater criminals than those who fornicate, drink wine and steal?! Those are crimes against mankind, whereas <em>shirk</em> and denial of Allaah’s Names and Attributes are crimes against the Creator, the One free of all imperfections, and the right of the Creator has precedence over the rights of the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah says in his book, <em>al-Istiqaamah</em> (1/466): “<span style="color:#ff0000;">So these sins along with correct <em>tawheed </em>are better than corrupted <em>tawheed</em> in the absence of these sins</span>.”[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then another <em>jamaa&#8217;ah</em> affiliates itself with <em>da’wah</em>, except that its methodology is also at variance with the methodology of the Messengers. They give no importance to correct <em>‘aqeedah</em>, rather they give importance to worshipping and practising some <em>dhikr </em>(remembrance of Allaah) in the way of the <em>Sufis</em>.[2]They concentrate upon going out (<em>khurooj</em>) and touring the lands, and what is important to them is that they manage to attract the people to join them, without caring about their beliefs and creed (<em>‘aqeedah</em>). All of these are innovated ways, taking as their starting point matters which were justify until last in the call of the Messengers. This is just like the case of one who seeks to cure a body whose head has been cut off, since the place of <em>‘aqeedah</em> in the religion is like the head with regard to the body. So it is necessary for these groups to correct their concepts and understanding by referring back to the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em> in order to know the methodology of the Messengers in calling to Allaah. For indeed Allaah, the One free of all imperfections, informed that correct rule and sovereignty, which is the central part of the call of the former <em>Jamaa&#8217;ah</em> whom we mentioned, cannot be achieved except after correcting <em>‘aqeedah</em> such that all worship is for Allaah alone, and worship of everything else is abandoned. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Allaah has promised those who truly believe (have true <em>eemaan</em>) amongst you, and act in obedience to Allaah and His Messenger, that He will grant them rulership upon the earth just as He granted it to those before them, and that He will establish their religion for them, grant them authority to practise the religion which He chose for them and ordered. And He will certainly change their situation to one of security, after their fear, providing that they worship and obey Me, not associating anything else in worship with Me. Then whoever rejects this favour by disobedience to their Lord, then they are the rebellious transgressors.”</strong>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these people wish to establish the Islamic State before purifying the lands of idolatrous beliefs which take shape in the worship of the dead, and devotion to tombs, such as is no different to the worship of al-Laat, al-’Uzzaa and the third of them <em>Manaat</em>,[4] rather it is worse. So they are attempting that which is impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed establishment and application of the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> and the prescribed punishments; establishment of the Islamic State; avoidance of whatever is prohibited; and achievement of whatever is obligatory &#8211; all of these things are from the rights of <em>tawheed</em>, and matters which perfect it and follow on from it. So how can we give attention to that which is subsidiary whilst neglecting that which is of primary importance?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is my view that the fact that these groups are at variance with the methodology of the Messengers in calling to Allaah is a result of their ignorance of this methodology, and the ignorant person is not suitable to be a caller, since one of the most important conditions for <em>da’wah</em> is knowledge, as Allaah, the Most High, says about His Prophet,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Say, Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  , this is my way, I call to Allaah (i.e. to the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, alone, with no partner) upon certain knowledge &#8211; I, and those who follow me. I declare Allaah free and far removed from all that they associate as partners with Him, and I am free of those who worship anything else along with Him.”</strong>[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So one of the most important qualifications for a caller (<em>daa&#8217;ee</em>) is knowledge.[6] Then we see that these groups (<em>Jamaa&#8217;aat</em>) which attribute themselves to <em>da’wah</em> are at variance with each other. Each group lays down a programme different to the programme of the others and follows a different methodology to it. This is the inevitable consequence of contradicting the methodology of the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , since the way and methodology of the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   is a single way, containing no division, nor divergence, as Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Say, Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  , this is my way, I call to Allaah (i.e. to the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, alone, with no partner) upon certain knowledge &#8211; I, and those who follow me.”</strong>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the followers of the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   are upon this single way and are not divided and split. Rather those who contradict this way are the ones who divide amongst themselves, as Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“This is my Straight Path, so follow it, and do not follow any of the other paths, for they will split you and take you away from that way which He prescribed for you.”</strong>[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So because these groups (<em>Jamaa&#8217;aat</em>) are a threat to Islaam which may obstruct it, or prevent people from entering into it, then this is something which must be properly explained, and it must be made clear that this is something which is not from Islaam at all. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Those who divide up the true religion and break up into sects and parties, you, O Muhammad, have nothing to do with them.”</strong>[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So since explanation of this is obligatory and it is binding to make it clear, a group of scholars having sincere concern for Islaam and the required level of knowledge and research took on the task of indicating the mistakes of these groups and explaining where they are at variance in <em>da’wah</em> with the methodology of the Prophets, so that they may return to what is correct. Indeed the truth is that which the Muslim always seeks, and so that those who do not realise their errors may not be beguiled by them. So from these scholars who took on this great duty of acting upon the saying of the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , <em>“The religion is sincerity/sincere advice, the religion is sincerity/sincere advice, the religion is sincerity/sincere advice.” We said, “To whom, O Messenger of Allaah?” He said, “To Allaah, and to His Book, and to His Messenger, and to the rulers of the Muslims and their common folk,”</em> &#8211; from those who explained this matter and gave sincere advice about it is the noble Shaykh, Dr. Rabee’ ibn Haadee al-Madkhalee in his book entitled, &#8216;The Methodology of the Prophets in Calling to Allaah, That is the Way of Wisdom and Intelligence.&#8217; For he explains, may Allaah grant him success and reward him with good, the Methodology of the Messengers in calling to Allaah, as it is shown in the Book of Allaah and the <em>Sunnah </em>of His Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  . He presents the methodologies of the variant groups in the light of this in order to clearly show the difference between the methodology of the Messengers and these differing and contrasting methodologies which are at variance with it. He discusses these methodologies in the scholarly way and in a just way, whilst quoting examples and witnesses to what he says. So his book, and all praise and thanks are for Allaah, accomplishes the goal, and is fully sufficient for those who desire the truth, and is a proof upon those who are stubborn and obstinate in opposing what is correct.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we ask Allaah to reward him for his work, and to cause it to be of benefit, and may Allaah send praise and blessings of peace upon Muhammad, his family and true followers, and His Companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] The proof for this is the Saying of Allaah, the Most High, <strong>“Allaah does not forgive that partners should be set up with Him in worship, but He forgives whatever is lesser than that to whom He pleases.”</strong> [Soorah an-Nisaa (4):48]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] But some of those who claim to be callers to Islaam, if you were to ask them, “What is Islaam?” “What are the things which negate Islaam?” Then they would not be able to give a correct answer, so how can it be permissible for such a person to be a caller (<em>daa&#8217;ee</em>)?!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>.. So I am amazed at the situation of many callers today who see the manifestation of <em>shirk </em>in front of their eyes, yet it does not cause them any concern whatsoever and they do not give any attention to it. Indeed what is even worse is that they complain about those who criticise it and who feel pained by this evil state of affairs which remains from the days of ignorance.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">.. intellect, wisdom and the natural way therefore necessitates that the starting point is to wage war against the danger of <em>shirk</em>, and that the call of the Prophets and their followers should continue fighting it for as long as anything of it remains, or any form or manifestation of it continues. So if a nation is afflicted by matters damaging to its <em>‘aqeedah</em>, and <em>shirk</em> which destroys its <em>‘aqeedah</em>, and also is beset by economic and political problems, then where is wise treatment of the problems to begin?! As for the Prophets, then they did not begin except with applying their full efforts to treating problems facing <em>‘aqeedah</em>. Then beginning by seeking to treat the most dangerous problem is a matter about which all humans with intellect agree upon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So, for example, if a person with intellect saw a snake and an ant moving towards a person, then his intellect would lead him to hasten to repel or kill the snake due to the greater danger which it poses to a person. It is not possible that he would divert his attention to the ant, nor even to a thousand such ants. Also if a number of people possessing intellect saw that a fierce lion and a number of rats attacked them all at once, then they would all strive together to prevent the attack of the lion and they would forget all the rats, even if a group of frogs came with them. And if a group of travellers came to a point where they had no choice but to take one of two roads: the first passed by volcanoes which were emitting flames and fire, and flinging out rocks and boulders. Then the second road passed through areas of thorny bushes, and sun-baked ground and was subject to the heat of the sun. Then anyone with intellect would not choose except to take the second road.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So now let us think about the most severe problems and ills. I mean the problems in political affairs, social affairs and economic affairs, and the worst of these is corruption in matters relating to rulership and judgement. Then let us weigh this against corruption in matters of <em>‘aqeedah</em>. So are these two things equal in weight with Allaah and with the Prophets, or is it the case that one is more severe, dangerous and worse in its consequences?!! So in the scale of Allaah and the scale of the Prophets the most dangerous of these two, and the one which has the greater demand for attention throughout the ages, and with all the Messengers, is <em>shirk</em> and its manifestations, whose evil and corruption cannot be matched by any other evil no matter how great. So upon this we repeat and say, “<span style="color:#ff0000;">All of the Prophets began with correction of matters of <em>‘aqeedah</em>, and by waging war upon <em>shirk</em> and its manifestations</span>,” and this is what is demanded by wisdom and intellect and that is due to the following reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">Firstly</span>,</strong> that corruption relating to matters of the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of the people: <em>shirk</em>, false superstitions and beliefs, and the various types of misguidance, is thousands of times more dangerous than the corruption resulting from the corruption in rulership and other affairs. Indeed if we do not say and firmly believe this then we have without knowing it discredited and belittled the Messengers, and we seek Allaah’s refuge from misguidance. Indeed this corruption encompasses the ruler and the ruled. So the rulers themselves in every time and place, except for the Believers from them, humble themselves to the idols, false-gods and tombs. They construct them, protect them, worship them and present offerings to them. They firmly believe that they have some supernatural power over and above their own authority. So they hold that these things cause harm and benefit for them due to the unseen power and authority which they think they possess, or at the very least they think they can intercede with Allaah in order for their problems to be reduced. The clearest example of the submission of the rulers to the idols is the example of the despot who claimed divinity, the Pharaoh, who said, boasting:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“I am your Lord, the Most High.”</strong>[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“I know of no other god for you besides me.”</strong>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since the leaders of his people said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Will you leave Moosaa and his people to cause mischief in the land when they have abandoned worship of you and worship of your gods?”</strong>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also Namrood, the king of the Chaldeans who claimed lordship for himself. When Ibraaheem, <em>‘alayhis-salaam, </em>broke the idols, Namrood sought to burn Ibraaheem to take revenge for these idols, because they were the gods which he worshipped. Likewise the kings of India and Persia worship idols and worship fire. The kings of Rome in the past and the present-day rulers of Europe and America worship the cross and worship images. And how many of the past and present-day rulers of the Muslims are afflicted by the trial caused by the dead, so that they build tombs over them, and their hearts are attached to them in love, hope and fear. They fall into that which Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) feared for his <em>ummah</em> and which he warned against. So the seriousness and the soundness of the methodology will therefore be clear to you, and also the importance of the firm stance taken by the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) with regard to idols and tombs. Furthermore the wisdom of Ibraaheem will become clear to you, and the depth of his thinking and its extent when he made the enduring call which resounds in all corners and in every generation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And keep me and my sons far removed from worshipping the idols. O my Lord, they have caused the misguidance of many of the people. So whoever follows me in what I am upon (<em>eemaan</em> in Allaah, making worship purely for Allaah and disassociation from the worship of idols) then he is from my people (upon my way and religion), and whoever disobeys me, then indeed You are the Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.”</strong>[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So you see Ibraaheem, who was fully upon the truth and the right way, seeking Allaah’s refuge from the evils and danger of the idols, and not seeking His refuge from the evils and danger of the rulers, despite the level of their corruption and their danger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">Secondly</span>,</strong> the people were upon a single religion (Islaam), upon guidance, but then they diverged from it, so Allaah sent the Prophets as bringers of good tidings of reward for the obedient Believers, and warners of Allaah’s punishment for the disobedient unbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“We do not send Our Mesengers except with good news for the obedient that Paradise and success on the Day of Resurrection is the reward for obedience to Me, and with a warning for those who disobey and reject My commands that We will punish them, so that they may die aware of that. So whoever believes the Messengers and acts righteously in this world by following what they are upon then there will be no fear upon them when they meet their Lord, nor will they grieve about what they justify behind in the world.”</strong>[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Messengers who were sent with the good news of Allaah’s reward for those who obey Allaah, do as He commands and believe in His Messengers, and warners of Allaah’s punishment for those who disobey Allaah, contravene His commands and disbelieve in His Messengers, so that those who disbelieve in Allaah and worship others besides Him may have no excuse to avoid punishment after the sending of the Messengers.”</strong>[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Mesenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said, <em>“There is no one to whom granting excuse is more beloved than Allaah, therefore He sent the bringers of good-tidings and the warners.”</em>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“So are the Messengers charged with anything but to clearly convey the Message?”</strong>[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The Messenger’s duty is but to clearly convey the Message.”</strong>[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“So if you deny Our Messenger, O people, and reject his command for you to worship your Lord and to free yourselves from the worship of idols, then nations before you denied their Messengers who called them to the truth, so Allaah sent His punishment upon them and will do the same with you. The Messenger&#8217;s duty is but to clearly convey the Message.”</strong>[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this duty of warning and bringing good tidings and conveying the Message is a very exalted, sublime and lofty duty. It is enough in this regard that it was the duty of the Prophets and fully concorded with their lofty station, since it the hardest and the greatest task taken up by mankind. It was then taken up by their inheritors from the true and sincere callers who follow their methodolgy, therefore Allaah’s Mesenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said, <em>“The people who are most severely tried are the Prophets, then those most like them, then those most like them.”</em> We have also already mentioned the extent of the difficulties faced by the caller to <em>tawheed</em> and that others are unable to persevere in this sphere.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">Thirldy</span>,</strong> Allaah, the One free of all imperfections, and the Most High, did not start by commanding and making it a duty upon them, as is seen from the stories of their lives, that they should establish states and cause the downfall of others, and this is perfect wisdom since the call to establish a state attracts the seekers of this world, and those who seek after self-elevation and positions of power, and those who have personal goals and grudges, and aspirations and ambitions.[11] So these types of people quickly respond to the call to establish a state which they think will enable them to attain their goals, their desires and their ambitions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to the like of these considerations, and Allaah knows best, and due to other reasons known by Allaah, the Creator, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, the calls of the Prophets and their methodologies were far removed from using these flashy and attractive slogans or those which clearly appeal to short-term ambitions and desires. Rather they followed a methodology which is wise, unblemished and noble. It involves being tried and tested. So they are followed upon this way and believed in by every true and sincere person free of selfish ambitions and personal goals. Such a person does not desire through his <em>eemaan</em>, his <em>tawheed</em> and his obedience to Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) except Paradise and the Pleasure of his Lord. He does not fear except from His Anger and His severe punishment. Therefore they are only followed generally by the poor, the needy and the weak. Allaah, the Most High, says, quoting what the people of Nooh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“They said, ‘Are we to believe in you, O Nooh, and affirm what you call us to, when it is only the lowly people who follow you?’”</strong>[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said concerning the people of Saalih:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The heads of the people who haughtily rejected Faith said to those who they held to be lowly, to those who believed in and followed Saalih and what he came with, ‘Do you really know that Saalih is one sent by Allaah?’ They said, ‘We indeed attest and believe in the truth and guidance which Allaah has sent him with.’ The haughty ones said, ‘We deny and disbelieve that which you believe in.’”</strong>[13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also amongst the questions which Heraclius asked Aboo Sufyaan was, “Is it the noble of the people who follow him or the weak amongst them?” Aboo Sufyaan replied, “Rather it is the weak amongst them.” So Heraclius said, “I asked you ‘Is it the noble of the people who follow him or the weak amongst them,’ and you mentioned that it is the weak amongst them, and it is they who are the followers of the Mesengers.” So the call to establish a state is far far easier, and people respond more quickly to it since most people are seekers after this world and followers of desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also because of the reasons, the consequences and the difficulties in the way of the calls of the Messengers we find that they are not followed except by a small number of people. So Nooh remained, for nine hundred and fifty years,[14] calling to Allaah, yet despite this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“None but a few believed along with him.”</strong>[15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn &#8216;Abbaas, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhumaa, </em>who said, <em>“Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said, ‘The nations were presented before me, and I saw a Prophet and with him was a small group of people, and I saw a Prophet along with one man or two men, and a Prophet accompanied by nobody. Then I saw a huge crowd of people and I thought that they were my ummah. So it was said to me, “This is Moosaa and his people. But rather look to the horizon.” So I looked and saw a huge crowd, so it was said to me, “This is your ummah, and from them are seventy thousand who will enter Paradise without any reckoning.”’”</em>[16]<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Ibraaheem, the chosen and beloved Friend of Allaah, who refuted and silenced the <em>mushriks </em>with irrefutable and clear proofs. Allaah says regarding him and those who believed along with him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“So Loot belived in him and attested to the truth of what he came with, and Ibraaheem said, ‘Indeed I will emigrate (to the land of <em>Shaam</em>) for the sake of my Lord. Indeed He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.’”</strong>[17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to Loot and those who were saved from the punishment along with him, and perhaps they were his daughters alone:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“So We brought out those who were Believers from the town, and We did not find there except a single household of Muslims.”</strong>[18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But none of this diminishes the rank of the Prophets by the slightest degree, rather they are upon the highest rank and are the noblest and most distinguished of the people and the most honourable. They stand above all the people in manhood, bravery, excellence of language and eloquence, and in their clarity of explanation, their sincerity and sacrifice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They also established their duty of calling to <em>tawheed</em>, propagating the Message, giving the good tidings and the warnings, and they fulfilled this in the most complete manner. So the fact that they had few followers or some of them had no followers, is purely the fault of the nations which refused to accept the call since, in their view, they did not satisfy their lowly goals. Then it may be that they respond to his call, or a large number of them do so, and so they gain a state, as a goodly fruit due to their <em>eemaan</em>, their affirmation of what the Prophet came with, and their righteous actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They thus establish the obligation upon them of fighting <em>Jihaad</em> to raise up the Word of Allaah, and of following and applying the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> and the prescribed punishments and other matters prescrbed for them by Allaah. This is what happened with our Prophet Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) and his noble Companions. Allaah crowned their <em>eemaan</em>, their righteous actions, and their exemplary perseverance when facing the harm and oppression of the <em>mushriks</em>, by aiding them and making their <em>Deen</em> uppermost, and by establishing them upon the earth as Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Allaah has promised those who truly believe (have true <em>eemaan</em>) amongst you, and act in obedience to Allaah and His Messenger, that He will grant them rulership upon the earth just as He granted it to those before them, and that He will establish their religion for them grant them authority to practice the religion which He chose for them and ordered. And He will certainly change their situation to one of security, after their fear, providing that they worship and obey Me, not associating anything else in worship with Me.”</strong>[19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then sovereignty was offered to Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) in Makkah but he refused and he continued calling to <em>tawheed</em> and waging war against <em>shirk</em> and the idols. So when Quraysh became troubled by the call of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) they sent ’Utbah ibn Rabee’ah and he came to Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) and said, “O son of my brother, you know the excellence you hold amongst us with regard to your position in the tribe and your lineage, but you have brought a matter which is very serious for your people. Because of it you have split their united body, caused their youth to behave foolishly and you have abused their idols with it, and their religion. You have also declared their fore-fathers to be infidels because of it. So listen to me and I will offer you some things which you may consider, and hopefully some of them will be acceptable to you.” So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said, “Speak, O Abul-Waleed, I will listen.” He said, “O son of my brother, if what you desire by this matter that you have come with is wealth, then we will gather wealth for you from our wealth until you are one of the richest of us. <strong>And if you wish by it for high position, then we will give you such authority that we will not do anything without your approval, and if you wish by it for sovereignty, then we will make you sovereign over us.</strong> But if it is the case that what comes to you is a demon which you see and cannot get rid of, then we will seek after a medical cure for you and will expend our money until we can get you cured of it. Since a demon may take hold of a person until he is cured and relieved of it,” or as he said. Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) was listening to him, then he said, “Have you finished, O Abul-Waleed?” He said, “Yes.” He said, “Then listen to me.” He said, “I will do so.” He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“In the name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy. <em>Haa Meem</em>. This Qur&#8217;aan is the Revelation sent down by the Most Merciful, the Bestwoer of Mercy. A Book whose <em>Aayaat</em> are made clear, a recital in pure Arabic for those who know (the pure Arabic language), bringing them good tidings of Paradise if they believe in it and act upon it, and as a warning to those who disbelieve in it and do not act in obedience to Allaah, that they will receive punishment and dwell forever in Hell in the Hereafter. But most of them turn away haughtily and refuse to listen to it.”</strong>[20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) continued reciting it to him. When ’Utbah heard it he remained silent and sat with his hands behind his back, resting upon them and listening. So when Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) came to the <em>Aayah</em> of prostration in it he prostrated and then said, “You have heard what you have heard O Abul-Waleed, so now it is up to you&#8230;” So ’Utbah went back to Quraysh and when he sat with them they said, “What has happened with you, O Abul-Waleed?” He said, “What happened is that I heard the like of which, by Allaah, I have never heard. By Allaah, it is not sorcery, nor poetry, nor divining. O Quraysh, obey me and let the decision be mine. Leave the man and let him continue in what he is upon. Keep away from him since, by Allaah, his saying which I heard will come to have great importance. So if the (other) Arabs kill him, then you will be rid of him due to the action of others, and if he conquers the Arabs, then his sovereignty is your sovereignty, his power is your power and you will be the ones fortunate with regard to him.” They said, “By Allaah, he has performed magic upon you with his tongue, O Abul-Waleed.” He said, “This is my opinion with regard to him, you may do whatever you see fit.”[21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Ishaaq reports with his chain of narration to Ibn ’Abbaas that a group of Quraysh gathered and made an offer close to the offer made by ’Utbah and his saying to Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) . So he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) answered them by saying, “I am not afflicted by what you say. I have not come with that which I have come with seeking your wealth, nor seeking status above you, nor sovereignty over you, but rather Allaah has sent me as a Messenger to you, and has sent down a Book to me, and has ordered me to be a bringer of good tidings and a warner to you. So I have conveyed to you the revealed Messages from my Lord, and I have sincerely advised you. So if you accept what I have brought to you then you will have your share in this world and the Hereafter. But if you refuse to accept it from me then I will patiently await Allaah’s Order, until Allaah judges between me and you&#8230;”[22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) rejected the request of one of the tribes that they should be in charge of the affairs after his death, if the report is authentic. Ibn Ishaaq said that az-Zuhree narrated to me that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) came to Banoo ’Aamir ibn Sa’sa’ah and called them to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and presented himself to them. So a man from them called Bayharah ibn Firaas said, “By Allaah, if I were to take hold of this young man from Quraysh I would devour the Arabs with him,” then he said, “If we give you our pledge of allegiance upon your affair, then Allaah gives you victory over those who oppose you, then will we be in authority after you?” He said, “The affair is for Allaah, He places authority wherever He wills.” So he said to him, “Are we to risk our necks before the Arabs for you, then when Allaah grants you victory, authority will be for other than us?! We have no need of your affair.” So they rejected him.[23]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Fifth Provision: The Caller must destroy the obstacles that stand between him and the people</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Caller must destroy the obstacles that stand between him and the people. This is since many of our brothers who are Callers, when they see people committing some evil, their over-protectiveness and hatred for this evil causes them to not go to these people and advise them. This is an error and it is not from wisdom at all. Rather, wisdom mandates that you go to them and invite them (i.e. give them da’wah), that you convey to them the truth, inciting them and intimidating them (with the Qur’aan and the Sunnah). Do not say that these people are sinners and that I cannot walk amongst them. O Muslim Caller, if you can’t walk amongst these people and go to them to call them to Allaah, then who will take charge of them? Won’t one of those individuals take charge of them? Won’t people who have no knowledge take charge of them? This should never be. This is why the Caller must have patience. And doing this is part of the patience that we talked about previously that the Caller must have. He must have patience and hate these evils. However, he must break the barriers between him and the people, such that he is able to bring his da’wah (call) to those who are in need of it. But as for him being haughty, then this is in opposition to what the Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) used to do. As is well known, the Prophet would go to the polytheists in their gathering places and call them to Allaah. And it has been reported on the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) that he said: “<em><strong>Will not someone take me so that I may convey the words of my Lord, for indeed Quraish has prevented me from conveying the Words of my Lord</strong></em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the habit of our Prophet, our Imaam and our role model Muhammad <em>(sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>). So it is obligatory upon us to be like him when calling (Da’wah) to Allaah.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Never should a Da`y be rushing, violent, or unduly strict. Rather, he has to be patient, forbearing and kind while practicing Da`wah. To this effect, we have stated some evidence earlier. For example, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Invite (mankind, O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) to the Way of your Lord (i.e. Islâm) with wisdom (i.e. with the Divine Revelation and the Qur’ân) and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better.”</strong> [Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) also says: And by the Mercy of Allâh, you dealt with them gently. In the story of Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron), Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And speak to him mildly, perhaps he may accept admonition or fear (Allâh).”</strong>[Surah Ta­Ha, 20: 44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) is authentically reported to have said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O Allah, whoever gains control over some affairs of my people and is hard upon them, be hard upon him, and whoever gains control over some affairs of my people and is kind to them, be kind to him.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Muslim, Sahih, Book on rulership, no. 1828; and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 6, p. 93.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is obligatory for you, slaves of Allah, to be kind in your Da`wah, and not to be harsh with people. Do not make people turn away from Islam because of your harshness, ignorance or violent, harmful approach. It is thus obligatory for you to be forbearing, gentle, pleasant and lenient in speech so that your words may have an effect on the heart of your brother, or that it may have an effect on one toward whom your Da`wah is directed. As such, people will receive your Da`wah better, will be affected by it and will show appreciation. On the contrary, harshness causes disaffection, alienation, and division, not unity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Imam Allaama Shaykh Rabee bin Hadi al-Madkhali -hafidhullaah- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;We advise the Salafis to have harmony/solidarity and to adhere to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To have brotherhood upon what is contained in the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam of Aqeedah, worship and actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having brotherhood for the sake of Allaah Azza wa Jal and to have Eemaan in these principles and these foundations and to love each other for the sake of Allaah Azza wa Jal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">If a person makes a mistake whether it is a minor one or a major one, advice is given with wisdom and good admonition.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There are people who make a claim of Salafeeyah, they are hard and forceful with falsehood, with slander and oppression. They are harsh and hard when being harsh is not required and they have no wisdom whatsoever, nor mercy or any of these things!</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">With sadness some people accuse the established Salafis with this exaggeration! This is extreme oppression.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I swear by Allaah we wage war against this harshness, the harshness of the Khawarij, we criticize these people who are extreme and delve too deeply and also the harsh ones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We criticize those who water-down, belittle and wage war against the principles of Islaam who originate, derive and produce false, unintelligent principles and statements to protect the people of Bida.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We criticize this extremist and we call to the straight path and to that what the Salaf as-Salih were upon of beliefs, actions and manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are extremists in watering-down, belittling and warring against the principles of Islam and the others are extremists in declaring people innovators and making Takfeer of people, so both of these types deviate from the straight path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allaah ordered us to have moderation and justice and to be steadfast upon the straight path.&#8217;</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The following is posted from : <strong><a title="Magnificent Points of Advice for those who have turned to the Way of the Salaf – Ahmad Ash-Shihhee" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2014/10/01/magnificent-points-of-advice-for-those-who-have-turned-to-the-way-of-the-salaf-ahmad-ash-shihhee/">Magnificent Points of Advice for those who have turned to the Way of the Salaf </a></strong>– Abu ‘Abdillaah Ahmad bin Muhammad Ash-Shihhee. This book was read to Allaamaah Rabee’ al-Madkhalee who gave some good instructions regarding it.</p>
<p>AUTHOR: Abu ‘Abdillaah Ahmad bin Muhammad ash-Shihhee<br />
SOURCE: His book “Al-Wasaayah as-Saniyyah Lit-Taa’ibeena ilaas-Salafiyyah” (pg. 34-39)<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Second Advice: Seeking Knowledge is the Foundation for the Correctness of your Repentance</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So knowledge is the foundation for the correctness of your repentance. This is due to two reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: For the most part, the misconceptions (you had prior to your repentance) will remain attached to your heart and your mind. So if you do not correct it with beneficial knowledge, you will find yourself accompanied by these misconceptions in your statements, actions and circumstances. Rather, you will find them mixed into your Da’wah (calling to the Way of Allaah), as is the condition of many of those who have leaped from (just) making their repentance to (being active in) the field of Da’wah. So they have begun calling to the Salafee Da’wah, however this call is mixed with the Ikhwaanee misconceptions of gathering people together (regardless of Creed) or the Qutubee misconceptions of making takfeer (declaring Muslims disbelievers) or the Surooree misconceptions of partisanship (hizbiyyah)! So the image displayed is Salafiyyah, but the taste and the smell derived from it is something else!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, their call turns into a Salafiyyah, which consists of particular standards that can have their roots traced back to the misconceptions they had propr to their repentance, which still accompany them and which they have not yet corrected. So you find this person calling to leadership in Da’wah (i.e. that there should be one leader for organizing all the Da’wah in a land).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that one rejects some of the principles of the Salafee Da’wah, claiming that they cause the hearts to be hardened! Or that they cause the brotherly ties to be broken! And this one agrees with the Qutubee ideologies!</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And that one calls to Hizbiyyah (partisanship)!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And this one carries ideas of instigation and provocation (of the masses)!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And that one pitches the tent for gathering the people together (regardless of differences)!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">All of this is done using the name of Salafiyyah, so to Allaah we turn for help! Verily to Allaah we belong and to Him we will return.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: Or perhaps you are carried away by the strong current of a misconception, such that your path and road towards repenting to Salafiyyah has changed course. So now you have become confused on this road or you begin calling to it, thinking that it is the truth when it is in fact misguidance!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How many games do these individuals who claim to have knowledge and stand for Salafiyyah play with the youth who seek to repent to Allaah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is due to nothing else except for their lack of seeking knowledge and their lack of asking questions from the people of knowledge from Ahlus-Sunnah walJamaa’ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, O repentant brother, may Allaah grant you success, you must seek beneficial knowledge, because it is that which will correct your repentance and set your path straight. With knowledge, you will free yourself from the misconceptions and the dangers, and you will save yourself from the hunting nets and snares, by the Will and Permission of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the evidences that indicate the virtue of knowledge and those who possess it, then they are many and well known. I will mention from them, for the purpose of reminding:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allaah bears witness that there is none that has the right to be worshipped but He. And so do the angels, and those having knowledge. (He is always) maintaining His creation with Justice. None has the right to be worshipped but He, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise</strong></span>.” [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is only those who have knowledge amongst His slaves that fear Allaah</strong></span>.” [Surah Faatir: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><span style="color:#000000;">Allaah will raise in degree those of you who believe, and those who have been given knowledge.</span></strong>” [Surah Al-Mujaadilah: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah’s saying, reminding of the blessing He bestowed on His Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) due to what He sent down to him from the Book (Qur’aan) and the Hikmah (Sunnah) and protecting him from people misleading him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Had not the Grace of Allaah and His Mercy been upon you (O Muhammad), a party of them would certainly have made a decision to mislead you, but (in fact) they mislead none except their own selves, and no harm can they do to you in the least. Allaah has sent down to you the Book (Qur&#8217;aan) and the Hikmah (Sunnah), and taught you that which you knew not. And Ever Great is the Grace of Allaah unto you.</strong></span>” [Surah An-Nisaa: 113]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, O repentant brother, when you come to know the importance and virtue of knowledge, and the danger of neglecting it, then know that the first thing you should start with from the various branches of knowledge is:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE BALANCED APPROACH</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah – <i>rahimahullaah</i> – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“When dealing with the people of sin, one must not exceed the limits prescribed by the <i>Sharee’ah</i> – neither in hating, censuring, preventing, abandoning or chastising them. Rather, the one who does so should be told: Worry about your own self. No harm will come to you from those who are misled, if you are truly guided, as Allaah – the Mort High – said: <b>“And do not let your hatred of others swerve you away from doing justice. But be just! That is closer to taqwaa (piety).”</b> [Soorah al-Maa’idah 5:8]. And Allaah said: <b>“And fight in the way of Allaah those who fight you, but do not transgress the limits.”</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:190]. Indeed, many of those who command and forbid overstep the limits set by Allaah, either through <i>jahl</i> (ignorance) or <i>dhulm</i> (injustice). Thus, this issue (of justice) must be firmly maintained, whether it is in regards to censuring the unbelievers, the hypocrites, the sinners or the disobedient ones.” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He further said: “The one commanding the good or forbidding the evil should do so in the way prescribed by the <i>Sharee’ah</i>; with knowledge, gentleness and patience, and with good intentions, and by following a balanced approach. All of this enters into Allaah’s saying: <b>“O you who believe! Beware of your own selves. No harm will come to you from those who are misled, if you are truly guided.”</b> [Soorah al-Maa’idah 5:105) … There is in this <i>Aayah</i> (Verse) another meaning as well, which is that a person must turn towards that which will be of benefit to him, both in knowledge and action, and he must avoid what does not concern him – as the conveyer of the <i>Sharee’ah</i> (i.e. the Prophet <i>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said:<i> “From the perfection of a person’s Islaam is to leave alone that which doer not concern him.” </i>[4] This especially applies to a person delving into that which doer not concern him regarding someone’s religious or worldly affairs. Thus, such a person may speak out of envy or desire for position; or act either with deliberate oppression, or foolish scorn and sarcasm. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>How often does Shaytaan make such an act appear to be an art of commanding the good or prohibiting the evil, or jihaad in the path of Allaah, whereas it is actually an act of injustice and transgression!”</strong></span> [5]</p>

But as for him being in opposition to this, then his da’wah will fail. And if he does succeed, then his success will be minimal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So it is upon the Caller to abide by that which he is calling to from acts of worship or daily interactions or manners or methodology, so that his da’wah may be accepted and so that he won’t be from those who will be the first to be thrown into the Hellfire.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brothers: Indeed if we look at our conditions we will find in reality that we may call to something that we don’t implement ourselves. And this no doubt is a big defect, O Allaah, unless we deny ourselves from looking at what is better since for every place there is a saying. This is since a noble thing may be considered noble due to a number of things that make it superior. This is why the Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) would call to some characteristics, but at times he would preoccupy himself with things more important than them. At times he would fast to the point that it would be said that he wouldn’t stop fasting. And at times he would eat and drink to the point that it would be said that he would not fast.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brothers! I would like every Caller to abide by the characteristics that befit the Caller, so that he can be a true Caller and so that his statements can be closer to being accepted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Sixth Provision : The Caller’s heart must be open towards the one who opposes him</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Caller’s heart must be open towards the one who opposes him, especially if he knows that his opponent has a good intention and that he only opposes him in things that require that the proof be established to him. People must be flexible in these matters and not allow these differences to incite hatred and enmity. This is except for a man that opposes and stubbornly rejects, such that the truth is explained to him but yet he continues to persist upon his falsehood Such an individual must be dealt with according to how he deserves to be treated, such as calling people away from him and warning the people from him. This is since his enmity has manifested itself, such that the truth was made clear to him, yet he did not act on it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, there are some <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>subsidiary issues</strong></span>, which the people differ on. In reality, these are from the matters that Allaah allowed His servants to differ in. I mean issues that are not from the fundamental ones, which can cause a person that opposes in them to be considered a disbeliever. Rather, these (subsidiary) issues are from those that Allaah has permitted differing in for His servants, and for which He made the error committed in that regard to be allowable. The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>“When the (legal) judge makes a judgement, exerting himself (Ijtihaad), and he attains the truth, then he gets two rewards. And if he errs then he gets one reward.”</strong> So the Mujtahid does not leave from the fold of being rewarded at all – either he gets two rewards for being correct or one reward for being wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you don’t like others opposing you, then likewise, those same other people don’t like for others to oppose them. So just as you want people to accept your view (on an issue), then likewise, those who oppose you want the people to take their views also.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reference point during these times of dispute is what Allaah has explained in His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And whatever you differ in, then its final decision is with Allaah. Such is Allaah, my Lord, in whom I put my trust, and to Him I turn in repentance.”</strong> [Surah Ash-Shooraa: 10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O you who believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger, and those in authority amongst you. And if you differ in anything, then return it to Allaah and the Messenger, if you truly believe in Allaah and the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination.”</strong> [Surah An-Nisaa: 59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So everyone that is in disagreement and dispute with one another must return to these sources: The Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger. And it is not lawful for anyone to turn away from the words of Allaah and His Messenger in favor of someone else’s words, regardless of who he may be. So if the truth becomes manifest to you, it is an obligation upon you to throw the view of the one who opposes it against the wall. And you must not turn towards that individual, regardless of what position he holds in knowledge and religion. This is since humans make errors, whereas the words of Allaah and His Messenger are free from errors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">It saddens me to hear that there are some people that look hard into seeking the truth and arriving at it, but in spite of this we find them divided. Each one of them has a particular name and a particular description. And this in reality is a mistake</span></strong>. <strong><span style="color:#993300;">Allaah’s religion is one and the ummah of Islaam is one.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And indeed this ummah (nation) of yours is one ummah. And I am your Lord so be dutiful to Me.”</strong> [Surah Al-Mu’minoon: 52]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah said to His Prophet Muhammad;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily, those who split up their Religion and became sects, you have nothing to do with them in the least. Their affair is only with Allaah. Then He will inform them of what they used to do.”</strong> [Surah Al-An’aam: 159]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“He has ordained for you the same religion which He ordained for Nooh, and that which We have revealed to you (O Muhammad), and that which We ordained for Ibraaheem, Moosaa and ‘Eesaa saying: You should establish the religion and make no divisions in it. Intolerable to the polytheists is that which you call them to. Allaah chooses for Himself whom He wills, and guides unto Himself those who turn to Him in repentance and obedience.”</strong> [Surah Ash-Shooraa: 13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if these are Allaah’s instructions to us, then what is obligatory upon us is to accept these instructions, and gather together upon putting forth an issue and discussing it with one another, in order to bring about rectification not in order to criticize or take revenge. For indeed, any person that debates with someone else intending to give victory to his view and to debase his opponent’s view, or intending to critique and not to correct, then for the most part, they will come out with a result that is not pleasing to Allaah and His Messenger. So it is obligatory on us, in matters such as these, to be one ummah (nation).</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>I am not saying that no one errs – everyone either makes mistakes or is correct. Rather, I am talking about the way to correct this error. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The way to correct this error is not by me talking about him behind his back and accusing him. Rather, the way to correct this error is to gather with him and discuss it with him</span>. So if it becomes clear after this that this man will persist on his rejection of the truth, and that he will continue to remain upon the falsehood that he is on, then at this point I have the excuse and the right, rather I am obligated to expose his error, and to warn the people about his error. And this way, the affairs will be rectified. As for splitting up and creating parties, then no one is pleased with this except for someone that is an enemy to Islaam and the Muslims.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah to unite our hearts upon obedience to Him, and that He make us from those who seek judgement from Allaah and His Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam). And we ask Allaah to make our intentions sincere and that He clarify to us what is obscure from his Sharee’ah. Verily, He is the Most Magnanimous, Most Generous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allaah, Lord of the worlds, and may the peace and blessings be on our Prophet Muhammad, his family and all his Companions</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Third Provision: Wisdom</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Caller must invite to Allaah with wisdom. And how bitter is wisdom upon the one who doesn’t have it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Da’wah (the Call) to Allaah must occur with (1) wisdom, then with (2) fair admonition, then with (3) debating in the best of manners against someone that is not oppressive, then with (4) debating in not the best of manners against someone that is oppressive. So there are four levels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Call to the Way of your Lord with wisdom and fair admonition. And debate them in a way that is better. Verily, your Lord knows best who has gone astray from His path and He knows best those who are guided.”</strong> [Surah An-Nahl: 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And do not debate with the People of the Scripture (i.e. the Jews and the Christians) except in a manner that is best – except for those who are oppressive amongst them, and say (to them): ‘We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you. Our God and your God is One, and to Him we have submitted.’”</strong> [Surah Al-‘Ankaboot: 46]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Wisdom means: Treating affairs with accuracy and precision, rather it means placing matters in their due place. It is not from wisdom to rush things and expect people to change from the condition they are in to the condition that the Companions were upon overnight. And whoever expects this then he has a foolish mind, and he is far removed from wisdom. This is because the wisdom of Allaah is not like this.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What proves this is that Allaah sent the Qur’aan down to Muhammad, the Messenger of Allaah, in stages so that it may become firm and settled in the souls.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The prayer</strong> was made obligatory during the Mi’raaj, three years before the Hijrah. Some say it was a year and a half, and some hold that it was five. There is differing amongst the scholars about this. But in spite of this it was not made obligatory in the manner that it is performed today. When the prayer was first made obligatory, it used to be two rak’ahs for Dhuhr, ‘Asr, ‘Ishaa and Fajr. And the Maghrib prayer used to be three rak’aat, so that it could be the Witr (odd-number) for the day. But after the Hijrah and after the Prophet had spent thirteen years in Makkah, the prayer of the resident was increased, and so it became four rak’aat for Dhuhr, ‘Asr and ‘Ishaa. And Fajr remained the way it was (i.e. two rak’aat) because the recitation of the Qur’aan is prolonged in it. And Maghrib stayed the same because it was the Witr of the day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, <strong>Zakaat</strong> was made obligatory in the second year after Hijrah. Or (some say) it was made obligatory in Makkah, but that it was not assigned its final estimate in terms of its dividend and obligation. And the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) did not send out envoys to collect the Zakaat until the ninth year after Hijrah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the development of Zakaat progressed in three stages:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. In Makkah: “But pay its due (i.e. Zakaat) on the day of its harvest.” [Surah Al-An’aam: 141] However, its obligation was not clarified nor the amount that was mandated to give for that obligation. This matter was left entrusted to the people.<br />
2. In the second year after Hijrah, Zakaat was clarified with its rightful dividends.<br />
3. And in the ninth year after Hijrah, the Prophet started to send envoys to the people of yields and profits to collect Zakaat from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So look at the careful consideration that was given to the conditions of the people with regard to Allaah’s legislation. And He is the best of judges.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same goes for fasting, as there was a stage-by-stage development with regard to its legislation. What was first made obligatory, was that a person had a choice between fasting or feeding a needy person. Then fasting was prescribed specifically, and feeding needy people was only allowed for those who weren’t able to fast for numerous consecutive days.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Therefore I say that wisdom denounces that the world change over in one night. There must be endurance and tolerance. Accept from your brother whom you are calling what he has from truth for today, and proceed with him step by step until he is able to eventually free himself from falsehood. And this is so that you may see that people are not of equal standing. So there is a difference between one is ignorant and one who stubbornly rejects.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps it is proper that I now mention some examples of the Da’wah of Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The First Example:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Bedouin man once entered the masjid, while the Prophet was sitting down with his Companions. The Bedouin man then urinated in one area of the masjid, so the people reprimanded him, meaning they scolded him angrily using harsh words. However, the Prophet, who was the one whom Allaah gave wisdom, forbade them from this. So when the man had finished urinating, the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) ordered that a bucket of water be thrown over his urine. So the harm was removed and Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) called the Bedouin to him, saying to him: “<strong>Indeed it is not proper to have any harmful object or filth in these masaajid. They are only for prayer and the reciting of the Qur’aan</strong>.” Or it is as he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said. So the Bedouin’s heart opened up to this kind treatment. This is why I have seen some of the scholars quote this Bedouin man as saying: “<strong>O Allaah, have mercy on me and Muhammad and do not have mercy on anyone else besides us</strong>.” This was because the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) treated him in such an excellent manner. But as for the Companions, they rushed to remove this evil act, without having properly weighed the condition of this man, who was (obviously) ignorant. [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Second Example:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One time Mu’awiyah bin Al-Hakam, may Allaah be pleased with him, came while the Prophet was leading the people in prayer. So one man sneezed and said: “AlHamdulillaah.” <span style="color:#808080;">(<strong>Note</strong>:) If one of you sneezes while in prayer then he should say AlHamdulillaah, regardless of whether he is in the standing position or the bowing position or in prostration</span>. This man (in prayer) said “Al-Hamdulillaah, so Mu’awiyah responded: “YarhamukAllaah.” But this is considered speaking and it invalidates the prayer. So the people began to stare and look at him. So Mu’awiyah said: “May my mother be bereaved of me.” This means for the mother to be lost. This is a statement that is said but for which it’s meaning is not intended. Then Mu’awiyah continued to pray. After he finished praying, the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) called him. Mu’awiyah said: “By Allaah, I did not see a teacher better at instructing than him.” May Allaah send His peace and blessings on him. He said: “By Allaah, he was not harsh with me nor did he scold me, he only said: ‘Speaking to people is not correct while in the prayer. It is only for tasbeeh (saying SubhaanAllaah), takbeer (saying Allaahu Akbar) and reciting of the Qur’aan.’” Or it is as he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said.[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) even said it to Mu’aadh bin Jabal when he told him: “Shall I not inform you of what controls all of that?” He (i.e. Mu’aadh) said: “Of course O Messenger of Allaah.” He (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Restrain this on yourself.” And he took hold of his tongue, saying: “Restrain this.” So Mu’aadh said: “Will we be held accountable for what we say with it?” He (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “May your mother be bereaved of you O Mu’aadh. What else will cause the people to be dragged on their faces – or he said on their noses – into the Hellfire except for the harvests of their tongues.” Look at the da’wah that is beloved to the souls, which people accept and by which the hearts become open.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We derive from the Fiqh point of benefits of this hadeeth that: Whoever speaks while in prayer, while not knowing that speaking invalidates the prayer, his prayer is still valid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Third Example:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and said: “O Messenger of Allaah, I am ruined!” So he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) asked: “And what caused you to be ruined?” He said: “<strong>I had intercourse with my wife during Ramadaan while I was fasting</strong>.” So the Messenger of Allaah ordered him to free a slave, but he said: “I cannot find one (i.e. unable).” Then he commanded him to fast two consecutive months, but he said; “I am not able to.” Then he commanded him to feed sixty needy people, but he said: “I am not able to.” At this the man sat down. So the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) brought some dates to him saying: “Take this and give it away in charity.” But the man became desirous of the Prophet’s generosity, which was the greatness of kindness shown towards creation. This was since the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) was indeed the most generous of people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the man said: “Am I to give this to someone poorer than myself O Messenger of Allaah? By Allaah there is no family poorer than mine between the two lava plains of Madeenah?” At this, the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) laughed to the point that his molar teeth became visible. This was because this man had come in fear, saying: “I am ruined” but yet he left successful. So the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) then said: “Feed your family with it.” So the man left peaceful, prosperous</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and joyful with this religion of Islaam and with this ease from the first Caller to this religion of Islaam, may the peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him. [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fourth Example:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let us now look at how the Prophet dealt with one who had committed a sin. The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) once saw a man that had a gold ring on his finger. So the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) seized the ring from him with his noble hand and threw it on the ground. And he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Would any of you intentionally tale a coal of fire and place it on his hand?” So the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) did not treat him the way he treated the people in the first examples. Rather, he snatched it from his hand and threw it at the floor. So when the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) left, it was said to the man: “Take your ring and benefit from it (i.e. by selling it).” The man said: “By Allaah, I will never take a ring that the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) threw away.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaahu Akbar! This was the magnificent way the Companions would execute the Commandments of Allaah and His Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So what is important is that the Caller to Allaah must invite with wisdom, because the one who is ignorant is not like the one who has knowledge. And the one who rejects is not like the one who readily accepts. So for every place there is a saying and for every position there is a condition.</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: <strong><span style="color:#993300;">Among the qualifications necessary for a Da`y is that he should have patience, kindness, and gentleness with forbearing temperament as the prophets (peace be upon them) were.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Never should a Da`y be rushing, violent, or unduly strict. Rather, he has to be patient, forbearing and kind while practicing Da`wah. To this effect, we have stated some evidence earlier. For example, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Invite (mankind, O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) to the Way of your Lord (i.e. Islâm) with wisdom (i.e. with the Divine Revelation and the Qur’ân) and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) also says: And by the Mercy of Allâh, you dealt with them gently. In the story of Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron), Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And speak to him mildly, perhaps he may accept admonition or fear (Allâh).&#8221;</strong> [Surah Ta­Ha, 20: 44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) is authentically reported to have said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O Allah, whoever gains control over some affairs of my people and is hard upon them, be hard upon him, and whoever gains control over some affairs of my people and is kind to them, be kind to him.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Muslim, Sahih, Book on rulership, no. 1828; and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 6, p. 93.]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">So, it is obligatory for you, slaves of Allah, to be kind in your Da`wah, and not to be harsh with people. Do not make people turn away from Islam because of your harshness, ignorance or violent, harmful approach. It is thus obligatory for you to be forbearing, gentle, pleasant and lenient in speech so that your words may have an effect on the heart of your brother, or that it may have an effect on one toward whom your Da`wah is directed. As such, people will receive your Da`wah better, will be affected by it and will show appreciation. On the contrary, harshness causes disaffection, alienation, and division, not unity.</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>An Excellent Example</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we have in the Messenger of Allaah <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> and in all the Prophets of Allaah a good example.  The Messenger was commanded to take those Prophets before him as an example and to follow their guidance and we have been commanded to follow the guidance of the Messenger of Allaah <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, and take him as an example:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong>Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a good example to follow forhe who hopes in (the Meeting with) Allaah and the Last Day and remembers Allaah much</strong>. &gt;&gt; [al-Ahzab: 21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This good example is complete in every matter which Muhammad <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> came with<em>;</em> so, he is an example in his <em>‘<strong>Aqeedah</strong></em>, so we believe in that which he believed in; an example in his <strong>worship</strong>, so we worship Allaah making the religion sincerely for Him, following that which the noble Messenger –<em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam – </em>came with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is an example in great manners which perhaps many of the callers to Allaah <em>– Tabaraka wa Ta’ala –</em> and many of the youth have lost, much of it having been forgotten and some of the youth have forgotten it too.  Indeed Allaah has praised His Messenger – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam –</em> with eloquent praise and He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong>And verily, you are on an exalted standard of character</strong> &gt;&gt; [Qalam: 4]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So the caller to Allaah, the student of knowledge, the instructor and the guide all need to take the Messenger of Allaah <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> as an example in their <em>‘Aqeedah</em>, <em>Manhaj</em> and manners.  So if these matters are combined in the caller to Allaah or they are nearly complete then this <em>Dawa’</em> will be successful <em>– InshAllaah –</em> and the caller to Allaah will have presented it in the most beautiful and best form <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the caller to Allaah is deficient in the matters of his <em>Dawa’</em>, being deficient in having noble manners-from which is having patience, wisdom, gentleness, softness and other things which are important, which the <em>Dawa’</em> of the Messengers <em>–alayhim Sallat wa Sallam-</em> requires.  Then this is an apparent deficiency in his <em>Dawa’</em>.  So it is upon him to ensure he manifests those matters completely.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Perhaps many of the people are negligent of this! And this harms the <em>Dawa’</em> of Salafiyyah and harms its people.  Since if these manners are neglected and the<em>Dawa’</em> is presented to the people in a way that they dislike and is made unpleasant and detestable by having harshness, severity and recklessness – and the likes of these things – then this is an obstacle to the <em>Dawa’</em> and to it being accepted.  Since these matters are even disliked in the affairs of the <em>Duniya</em> let alone in the matters of the <em>Deen</em>.</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is necessary for the student of knowledge to follow a path of righteous good manners in giving <em>Dawa’</em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Advice to the Salafiyyoon</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brothers, use <strong>beneficial knowledge</strong> and <strong>solid proof</strong> and <strong>beneficial wisdom</strong> in your <em>Dawa’</em>. You should have all the noble and <strong>beautiful manners</strong> encouraged by the Book and the Messenger of guidance; indeed they are causes for victory and causes for success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You have to believe that the Companions did not spread Islaam or enter it into the hearts except with their <strong>wisdom</strong> and their <strong>knowledge</strong> more so than with their swords.  However, whoever enters into Islaam under the sword might not be firm, but whoever enters Islaam by way of knowledge, proof and evidence then this is what makes his Eemaan firm by Allaah’s permission and His assistance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is upon you to have these good methods and also to be serious about knowledge.  You have to be serious about <em>Dawa’</em> to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now – O brothers – I advise you with two issues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: Brotherhood between all of <em>Ahl -ul-Sunnah</em>; So O you Salafees, disseminate the soul of love and brotherhood between yourselves.  Put into effect what the Messenger of Allaah <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> informed us of regarding the believers: ‘Like a building, some of its parts supporting others.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that they are: ‘<strong>Like a single body if one limb complains then the rest of the body suffers with fever and insomnia</strong>.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is how you should be O brothers: distance yourselves from the causes of splitting, I swear by Allaah indeed it is a dangerous evil and a disastrous disease.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: distance yourselves from the causes which lead to enmity, hatred, splitting up and dissension.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Keep away from these things; because this has become predominant nowadays at the hands of people, about whom only Allaah knows their condition and intent.  It has become predominant and has torn apart the youth in this country – whether in the university or other than it – or in the other parts of the <em>Duniya</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why?! Because those who are not from its people – neither in knowledge nor in understanding – entered into the arena of giving <em>Dawa’</em> to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is possible that the enemies could have entered someone into the midst of the<em>Salafeeyeen</em> to tear them apart and split them up, and this issue is not unlikely, rather it can truly happen <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Strive to have brotherhood.  If any dissension has occurred between you, then both parties should make themselves forget what is past and start with a clean slate now.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say to the brothers: whoever falls short it is not allowed to debase him, nor destroy the one who is deficient.  Whoever makes a mistake amongst us we do not destroy him. <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em> – but we cure him with gentleness, wisdom and face him with love and friendship and all the rest of the righteous manners, along with the correct <em>Dawa’</em> until he repents.  And if there remains a weakness in him then we are not hasty with him, or otherwise, I swear by Allaah no one will remain, no one will remain!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are some people now who chase after the Salafis so much so that they reached the scholars and called them those who water things down <em>(Mumaya’een)</em>!! There is hardly any scholar in the arena of <em>Dawa’</em> today except that he has been falsely attacked with this claim about him!  Of course this is the way of the Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen and the way of <em>Ahl-ul-Bida’</em> since, from the weapons of the <em>Ahl ul-Bid</em>a’ is that they begin by overthrowing the scholars, rather it is the Jewish Masonic way: that if you wanted to discredit an idea, then discredit their scholars or their personalities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So keep away from this rotten legacy and have respect for the scholars.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: There are those who say that the Kuffâr (disbelievers) are our brothers in humanity and not in the religion. Is this true?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân</strong>: It is not sufficient with the humanity. One does not speak like that in order to please them or to gain their sympathies. One does not speak like that. One says that they are our enemies and not that they are our brothers in humanity. One says that they are our enemies. What is the benefit of a human fraternity if they are our enemies in the religion? What does it benefit? Pharaoh was also a human. Right? Was he also our brother? We do not say that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/a-look-at-anasheeds-dr-saleh-as-saleh.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>Download PDF Here</strong></a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful, I begin to write:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In pre-Islamic and early Islamic history, anasheeds involved wholesome poems (about battle victories, wisdoms, courage, etc) chanted in an un-orchestrated fashion without the accompaniment of musical instruments, except for the duff (similar to tambourine but without bells or cymbals) which was legally permitted for women on special occasions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the 2nd century after Hijrah, chanting of du&#8217;aa, remembrances, crept into the ummah by the innovations of the <strong>mystic Sufis</strong> who, in turn, took it from the Christians. It was then called <strong>at-Taghbeer</strong>. All of these forms were denounced by the early scholars of Islam, including Imaam ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee, Ibn Taymmeyah, Ibnul Qayyim, Ibn Katheer, Ibn Rajab, and many others.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sufis centered most of their methodology of worship on congregational <strong>Taraaneem</strong> (singing by way of trilling, or quavering and prolonging the voice with a musical sound), resembling the Christians in their churches. Then the Sufis began to introduce <strong>physical movements</strong> during remembrances and du’aa close to those practiced by the Jews. Rarely do you witness a Sufi &#8220;<strong>Hadrah</strong> [2]&#8221; without these innovated practices.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nowadays, the matter is not limited to the Sufi adepts. Many Muslim parties (groups) have innovated special bands for the emotional arousing of their followers and for the &#8220;ummah&#8221; at large! Much of what is being practiced with these anasheed does not escape, at least, one of the following observations:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Involving more and more people, especially children, keeping them busy with what could be, least to say, of a lesser benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Anasheed are accompanied with musical toning and chanting (Eastern and Western beats) in the name of &#8220;culture&#8221; and &#8220;tradition.&#8221; This is becoming more and more apparent, with bands competing in their selection of words and beats.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Remembrances of Allah are introduced in these anasheed in ways clearly resembling the intoning and chanting of the Christians in their churches.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The congregational chanting and singing that takes place resembles to a great extent that which goes on in the circles of the mystic Sufis in their singing circles. Former &#8220;stars&#8221; are being more involved with the mystic Sufi ways through so-called &#8220;Islamic anasheed.&#8221; Some bands sing the infamous Shirk poem known as &#8220;Burdah,&#8221; which involves shirk levels of exaggeration in the status of the Prophet Muhammad (sall Allaahu alayhi wa sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Luring the children to sing, especially the young girls, imitating the base of the infamous Muslim and Non-Muslim singers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. Replacing the Qur‘aan with the so-called anasheed in the Da’wah to the young, claiming that they don’t respond to the Qur‘anic texts, therefore, legitimizing their use. The same is done with the Sunnah, eventually turning people away from what constitutes the true life for the believers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. In many of these singing circles, musical instruments and intoning are gradually taking hold, something known to be forbidden in Islam, except for the duff for women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. The emergence of so-called professional singing groups performing at weddings, parties, schools and the like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. Development of so called more advanced ways of video singing as a modern way of contemplating and reflecting on the creation of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. Allowing taking pictures of young girls during different presentations of songs in itself is a fitnah (affliction and trial) and an opposition to the Sahree’ah. Some make movies and records of these young girls singing on special occasions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. Many things that are untrue are presented in these songs through acting, or through exaggeration in praise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. If you examine many of these songs, you will find a lot of them focusing on the Tawheed of Lordship only, something even the Mushriks confess to (i.e. matters pertaining to the signs of Allah in the creation, His running of the affairs, Him being in full authority and the like).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. Transgression against the Sharee’ah in the form of acting roles. You see a child taking the role of Salah, saying, &#8220;I am the Salah, and these are my merits!&#8221; Another takes the role of Fasting and so on. Worst of all those who claim to represent the Qur’aan. Yet we know that the Qur‘aan is the uncreated Speech of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. Assuming in some cases the movements and walks of some of the losers from the known male and female singers. Imagine when this is done while chanting the remembrances of Allah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15. Calling these anasheed Islamic itself is a transgression, especially when they call it an &#8220;art&#8221; and a means of education and nourishment for the Da&#8217;wah! &#8220;This is an innovation in Deen, and this from the deen of the innovators of the Sufis.&#8221; [3] The companions chanted poetry of wisdom, courage, generosity and of maroo&#8217;ah (describing good character), and not in congregations. They chanted poetry sometimes while working or during night travel. None of them claimed this &#8220;Islamic.&#8221; Rather, everything takes its own particular ruling, whether it is innovated, allowable, recommended, obligated, disliked or forbidden. Therefore, that which may be allowable of it we don’t call &#8220;Islamic&#8221; because if it is called so, people would think it to be from the Deen. And to label any matter as Islamic, requires textual proofs.4 In fact, Sh. Al-Albani (rahimahullaah) referred to them as &#8220;<strong>Sufi singing</strong>&#8220;, and a similar conclusion was reached by Sh. &#8216;Abdul &#8216;Aziz Aal Ash-Shaikh, the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, as well as by Sh. Bakr Abu Zayeed and Sh. &#8216;Abdul &#8216;Aziz Ar-Raajhi and other scholars (may Allah preserve them all). [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The following question was raised to our Skaykh Muhammed Ibn Saaleh al-‘Uthaimeen (Rahimuhullaah):</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“What is the ruling concerning the anasheeds? Is it permissible for the Caller to Allah to listen to &#8220;Islamic anasheed&#8221;?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Shaykh responded</strong>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“In the past, I listened in the past to these Islamic anasheed and there was nothing therein which shuns away. After listening to them recently, I found them to be rhythmic with delectation and entertaining, like the songs accompanied with musical instruments. Accordingly, I don’t see that it is permissible for people to listen to them. However, if they come natural without musical accompaniment and without delectation or entertainment, then there is no harm in listening to them. Still, however, it is conditional that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) the person does not make this a habit listening to them all the time, and<br />
(ii) make not that which benefits and admonishes the heart restricted to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because if he makes of this a habit, he will abandon that which is more important. Moreover, in doing so he will relinquish the greatest admonition and it is that which came in the Book of Allah and in the Sunnah of Allah&#8217;s Messenger. But if he listens to them sometimes, or if takes them as a means of help on his journey while driving his care in the wilderness, then there is no harm in that.&#8221; [6]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he was asked, <span style="color:#993300;">“Is it permissible for the man to chant the Islamic anasheed and is it permissible that the duff, which is the tambourine without any of these bells attached to it, is it permissible to use the duff with the chanting and is the chanting or the anasheed permissible in other than the Eed and other than the festivals?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The answer</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Bismillaahir Rahmaanir Raheem, In the Name of Allah The Most Beneficent, The Most Merciful”, then he returned the greeting to the person who asked the Question, and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Islamic anasheed is an innovated chanting innovated by the Sufis. Therefore, one should turn away from it and resort to the admonitions from the Qur‘aan and Sunnah, unless it is used in the battlefields to help as a motivation for Jihaad in the cause of Allah, the Most High, then this is good, however, if it accompanied with the duff, then it would be far away from the truth.” [7]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, on several occasions, he (rahimahullaah) directed the people to give the best of attention to the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah, since they are the greatest admonitions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A special warning concerning the infamous <strong>Burdah poem of Al-Busiri</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is plain shirk because it exaggerates the Prophet (sall Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) giving him attributes of divinity, as if he knows the unseen and what is written in the preserved tablet. So much of this, unfortunately, is spread throughout the Muslim world and particularly in Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia. Think about it. Moreover, they have musical groups in these countries only specialized to sing these poems, especially the &#8220;Burdah&#8221;. In some recent forms, it is &#8220;recited by Khalid Belrhouzi featuring Yusuf Islam (yes!) This is an ad on the net carrying the title: Burdah (audio tape) Khalid Belrhouzi and Yusuf Islam (Arabic + English) [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is stated in this poem, among other things, that ‘And of your knowledge is the knowledge of the pen and the preserved tablet’! The &#8220;pen” refers to the pen which Allah ? commanded it saying: &#8220;Write! It said, &#8216;What should I write, my Rabb (Lord)? Allah said: Write the record of all preordained matter until the commencement of the Hour.&#8221; [9] According to this poet, the Prophet (sall Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) knows what the pen already wrote and what is written in the preserved tablet. We seek refuge in Allah from these fabrications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) to guide us all to the truth and to make us accept and yield to it.</p>

[2] Hadrah: Presence. Used by the Sufis in its general meaning, “Being in the presence of Allah.” In the school of mystic Ibn ‘Arabi, however, there are “Five Divine Presences,” a metaphysical doctrine of the degrees of reality of which there are different versions. This concept is influenced by the Neo-Platonist chain of “Stages or Orders of Being.” [See Mu’jam Al-Mustalahaat As-Sufiyyah by Al-Hafnee, p. 237 and Shorter Encyclopedia of Islam, p. 125, edited by H.A.R. Gibb and J.H. Kramers, 4th impression, 1995. Published by E.J. Brill, Leiden, The Netherlands.] The Mureed is informed that the Hadrah is the start, then the Mukaashafah (Mystic spiritual revelation regarding the Truth [Allah] and the Ghayb (unseen). Through this stage, things will be manifested as if he sees them by his eyes). The next state is the Mushaahadah (Witnessing of the Truth). Sufi singing, clapping, and swaying accompanied by drum beats is part of the &#8220;ritual&#8221;! Some of the mystics also claim the actual attendance of the Prophet (?) in their circles!<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: Is it a correct method to call towards Islâm through funny lectures so that the youths can assimilate and like the call (Da’wah) and the straight path?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân</strong>: Religious matters should not be mixed with these factors. The religious matters are serious, determined, and elucidative. They should not be mixed with comedies and entertainment. This has been introduced by some people who wrongfully deem themselves to be callers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The messenger (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) did not call the people by way of these matters. He recited the Qur’ân unto them. He called them, ordered them and forbade them. He did not offer them comedies and similar tasteless matters that are used these days by those who subscribe to the Da’wah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[53] <strong>Question</strong>: What is the ruling on the <strong>nasheeds (songs)</strong> that are circulating amongst many of the youth and which they call &#8220;<strong>Islaamic nasheeds</strong>?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If these nasheeds possess Islaamic meanings, and there aren&#8217;t any stringed or <strong>musical instruments</strong> accompanying them, such as the Duff, the drum and its types, then there is no problem with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, an important condition to its permissibility must be clarified. And it is that they must be free of anything that <strong>opposes the Religion</strong>, such as going to extremes and its sorts. Also, there is another condition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is that it must not be taken as a <strong>(habitual) practice</strong>. This is since it turns those who (constantly) listen to it away from reciting the Qur&#8217;aan, which the authentic Sunnah of the Prophet encourages.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, it turns them away from seeking <strong>beneficial knowledge</strong> and calling towards Allaah (i.e. da&#8217;wah), the One free of all defects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for using the duff with the nasheed, then it is permissible for the women when it occurs (solely) amongst them, apart from the men. And it is permissible during the time of &#8216;Eed and marriage only.</p>
<p>[Al-Asaalah, Issue #2]</p>
<p>[62] <strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Many of the Muslim youth exchange and pass around tapes that have songs (nasheeds) on them, which they call Islaamic. What is the correct opinion on this matter?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: If these songs (nasheeds) are void of <strong>stringed and musical instruments</strong>, then generally I say that there is no harm in them on the condition that they are free from things that are in opposition to the Religion, such as asking for help from other than Allaah (<strong>Istighaathah</strong>) and seeking a way of getting close to Allaah (<strong>tawassul</strong>) through the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also it is not permissible to take them as part of the Religion for this would turn the Muslim youth away from reciting the Book of their Lord and reflecting on it. And that is what Allaah&#8217;s Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, urged us with in many authentic ahaadeeth, such as his saying: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">Recite the Qur&#8217;aan and chant it (i.e. recite it in a nice melodious manner), before there comes a people that will rush through it and not take their time with it. So chant it (nicely).</span>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whoever reflects on the condition of the Companions, will find that they did not have the likes of these songs (nasheeds) in their lives, for they were men of realities and not men of entertainment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[40] <strong>Question</strong>: What is the best way for women to give da&#8217;wah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: I say to the women: “<span style="color:#008000;"><em>Remain in your homes</em></span>.” [Surah Ahzaab: 33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And you should not concern yourselves with da&#8217;wah. I reject the use of the word &#8220;da&#8217;wah&#8221; amongst the male youth by them making it seem like they are from the people of da&#8217;wah – as if the word da&#8217;wah has become the fashion of modern times. So every individual that knows something about the Religion becomes a Da&#8217;ee (caller to Islaam)! And this matter did not stop with the male youth until it was carried over to the female youth and housewives. And in many instances, they have begun to turn away from fulfilling the obligations of their households and their husbands and their children, turning away from these obligations towards something that is not obligatory upon them, such as establishing the da&#8217;wah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The general rule concerning the woman is that she is to stay in her home. And it has not been legislated for her to leave it unless she has a dire need. This is based on the statement of the Prophet,sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam: &#8220;And (praying in) their homes is better for them&#8221;, i.e. than the (congregational) prayer in the masjid.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Today we see a prevalent phenomenon amongst the women in that they go out often to the masjids in order to pray the congregational prayer, not to mention the Jumu&#8217;ah prayer. In spite of this, their homes are better for them – unless there is a masjid in which the Imaam is a scholar who teaches those attending some aspects from the sciences of the Religion. So in this case, the woman could go out to pray in the masjid in order to listen to the knowledge. There is nothing preventing her from that. As for the woman preoccupying herself with the da&#8217;wah (!), then let her sit in her home and read from the books that her husband or brother or other male relatives provide for her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, there is nothing preventing her from setting a day in which she calls the women to come to her house or she goes out to attend the house of one of them. That is better than a group of women going out (to her). One woman going out to a group of women is better for them than all of them going out to her. As for her moving about and traveling, perhaps traveling without a mahram, and she justifies that by claiming that she went out for the purpose of da&#8217;wah, then these are from the presentday innovations. And I do not specify the women only with that, rather, even some of the male youth speak excessively about the da&#8217;wah and yet they have very little knowledge.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth: Morals and etiquette of the Da`ys to Allah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The morals and qualities necessary for a Da`y (caller to Islam) are highlighted by Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) in many occurrences in the Qur&#8217;an.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>First: Devotedness.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory for a Da`y to be so devoted to Allah that he neither intends to show off, nor wants a good reputation or praise from people. Rather, he should only call to Allah to please Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم): &#8220;This is my way; I invite unto Allâh (i.e. to the Oneness of Allâh &#8211; Islâmic Monotheism).&#8221; </strong>[Surah Yusuf, 12: 108]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And who is better in speech than he who [says: “My Lord is Allâh (believes in His Oneness)&#8221;</strong> [Surah Fussilat, 41: 33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, you have to be devoted to Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He). It is the most important virtue and the greatest quality that has to characterize your way of Da`wah (call to Islam), i.e. seeking Allah and the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Second: Knowledge.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Invite people to Allah with firm knowledge. You should not be unaware of or ignorant about what you call people to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم): &#8220;This is my way; I invite unto Allâh (i.e. to the Oneness of Allâh &#8211; Islâmic Monotheism) with sure knowledge.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Yusuf, 12: 108]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowledge is a necessary obligation. You should not call people while you are ignorant nor talk about a topic you are unaware of. An ignorant person destroys and never constructs, spoils and never reforms. You, servants of Allah, have to fear Allah and never say anything about Him without knowledge. Likewise, you should never preach something unless you have sure knowledge and insight into what Allah and His Messenger (peace be upon him) said about it. Sure knowledge is indispensible and essential for a seeker of knowledge or a Da`y to be fully conversant with and have a deep knowledge of all the aspects of what he calls people to. He must also be sure of the proofs that substantiate his topic. Once he is sure of the truth of his points, he should then call people to them, regardless of whether it is a call to do something or to abandon something, i.e. an act of obedience to Allah and His Messenger or an act forbidden by Allah and His Messenger (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The call should be based on sure knowledge and insight.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: <strong><span style="color:#993300;">Among the qualifications necessary for a Da`y is that he should have patience, kindness, and gentleness with forbearing temperament as the prophets (peace be upon them) were.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Never should a Da`y be rushing, violent, or unduly strict. Rather, he has to be patient, forbearing and kind while practicing Da`wah. To this effect, we have stated some evidence earlier. For example, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Invite (mankind, O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) to the Way of your Lord (i.e. Islâm) with wisdom (i.e. with the Divine Revelation and the Qur’ân) and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) also says: And by the Mercy of Allâh, you dealt with them gently. In the story of Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron), Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And speak to him mildly, perhaps he may accept admonition or fear (Allâh).&#8221;</strong> [Surah Ta­Ha, 20: 44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) is authentically reported to have said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O Allah, whoever gains control over some affairs of my people and is hard upon them, be hard upon him, and whoever gains control over some affairs of my people and is kind to them, be kind to him.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Muslim, Sahih, Book on rulership, no. 1828; and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 6, p. 93.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is obligatory for you, slaves of Allah, to be kind in your Da`wah, and not to be harsh with people. Do not make people turn away from Islam because of your harshness, ignorance or violent, harmful approach. It is thus obligatory for you to be forbearing, gentle, pleasant and lenient in speech so that your words may have an effect on the heart of your brother, or that it may have an effect on one toward whom your Da`wah is directed. As such, people will receive your Da`wah better, will be affected by it and will show appreciation. On the contrary, harshness causes disaffection, alienation, and division, not unity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Among the necessary etiquettes and attributes a Da`y should or even must have is to act upon what he is calling people to. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He should be a good example for those whom he invites to Allah &#8211; that is, he should not call people to something which he himself does not do, or call people to abandon something that he himself does. This is the behavior of the losers &#8211; we seek Allah&#8217;s Refuge from this. But the winning believers call to the truth, act upon it, practicing it actively and vividly and never do what they forbid people to do. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O you who believe! Why do you say that which you do not do? Most hateful it is with Allâh that you say that which you do not do.&#8221;</strong>[Surah Al-Saff, 61: 2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Exalted be He) also saysrebuking the Jews for enjoining righteousness while forgetting to practice it themselves:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Enjoin you Al-Birr (piety and righteousness and each and every act of obedience to Allâh) on the people and you forget (to practise it) yourselves, while you recite the Scripture [the Taurât (Torah)]! Have you then no sense?&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) is authentically reported to have said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>On the Day of Resurrection, a man will be brought and thrown in Hellfire. His intestines will then pour forth and he will revolve around them like a donkey revolves around a millstone. The people of Hell would gather around him and say, &#8216;O so and so, what happened to you? Did you not use to command us to adhere to righteousness and forbid us to do wrong?&#8217; He will say, &#8216;Yes. But I used to enjoin righteousness but I did not practice it myself and I used to forbid wrong but I committed it.&#8217;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Al-Bukhari, Sahih, Book on the beginning of creation, no. 3267; Muslim, Sahih, Book on asceticism and heart-softening narrations, no. 2989; and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 5, p. 207.&#8217;)]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This will be the case with whoever calls to Allah, enjoins good and prohibits evil while his words are contrary to his actions &#8211; we seek Allah&#8217;s Refuge from this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, from among the most important and greatest attributes a Da`y has to be characterized by is to act upon that which he calls people to and not to do things that he prohibits.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Da`y should have excellent behavior, good reputation, patience, persistence, sincerity and diligence in guiding people to goodness and keeping them away from falsehood. He should supplicate to Allah to guide the people whom he invites. He should supplicate for the people he invites to Allah, such as by saying, &#8220;May Allah guide you and open up your heart to accept the truth.&#8221; Thus, you should call and guide him, forbear his misbehavior and even supplicate to Allah to guide him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On hearing people saying about the tribe of Daws that they disobeyed, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O Allah, guide Daws and bring them (to Islam).&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Al-Bukhari, Sahih, Jihad and military expeditions, no. 2937; Muslim, Sahih, Book on merits of the Companions, no. 2524; and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 2, p. 243.&#8217;)]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, you should supplicate to Allah for those you call to truth so that Allah may guide them and open up their hearts to the truth. You should show patience and persistence and do not lose hope. Moreover, you should say only that which is good and never rebuke or say bad words that might cause people to turn away from truth. However, if someone commits aggression and injustice, they will be given different treatment. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And argue not with the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), unless it be in (a way) that is better (with good words and in good manner, inviting them to Islâmic Monotheism with His Verses), except with such of them as do wrong&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-`Ankabut, 29: 46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the one who commits injustice through opposing the Da`wah with evil and enmity is to be dealt with in a different manner. If possible, such a person should be imprisoned or receive similar disciplinary punishment, which depends on the kind of injustice he commits. But as long as he causes no harm, you should be patient,seeking Allah&#8217;s Reward, and to argue with him in ways that are best. Anyway, if such a person causes you any personal harm, it is to be endured with patience as did Allah&#8217;s messengers and those who followed them in piety and righteousness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) to grant us all the power to practice Da`wah in the best manner. May He reform our hearts and actions and grant us understanding of and holding fast to Islam. May Allah also make us among those who are guided, who guide others, are righteous and teach others righteousness. Surely He (Glorified and Exalted be He) is the most Supreme, the Most Noble. May Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings be upon His Slave, Messenger and Prophet Muhammad, his family, Companions and all those who follow him in goodness until the Day of Judgment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AUTHOR: Shaikh Rabee&#8217; bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Excerpt from the forthcoming Al-Ibaanah Publication &#8220;The Methodology of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah in Criticizing Individuals, Books and Groups&#8221;, may Allaah facilitate it!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a chapter from the book <b>“<i>Manhaj Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah fee Naqd-ir-Rijaal wal-Kutubi wat-Tawaa’if</i>”</b> (The Methodology of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah in Criticizing Individuals, Books and Groups) written by Shaikh Rabee’ Al-Madkhalee. This book has been highly praised and recommended by the scholars, and has become a classical work in its own time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this book, Shaikh Rabee’ Al-Madkhalee clarifies the correct methodology of Ahlus-Sunnah with regard to criticizing, explaining its foundations and principles and relying on the various statements of the Salaf (predecessors) to support his points. The book is primarily geared towards refuting a false concept that has crept into the Muslims’ ideologies and slogans in recent times, which is the principle of Muwaazanah. This principle dictates that when someone criticizes a person, book or group, he is obligated to also mention the good qualities of that person, book or group along with his criticism. By doing this one would be creating a balance and thus applying “fairness”, hence the term Muwaazanah, which means to make a balance, which in this case means a balance between the good and the bad aspects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this specific chapter of the book, Shaikh Rabee’ brings many quotes from the Salaf showing that it was from their methodology to warn against innovators and their books without requiring themselves to mention their positive aspects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Ibn Al-Jawzee said: ‘Abul-Wafaa ‘Alee bin ‘Aqeel, the Fiqh scholar, said: ‘Our Shaikh Abul-Fadl Al-Hamdhaanee said: The innovators in Islaam and those who fabricate <i>ahaadeeth </i>are worse than the disbelievers. This is since the disbelievers attempt to corrupt the Religion from the outside, whereas these individuals attempt to corrupt it from the inside. They take the likeness of the inhabitants of a land, who strive to corrupt its condition (from the inside), while the disbelievers take the likeness of raiders laying siege to the land from the outside. So it is the ones on the inside who open the doors of the land’s surrounding barrier (and let the besiegers in). These types (of people) are more dangerous to Islaam than those who don&#8217;t ascribe themselves to it.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I say: Today, the opponents of the Sunnah and Tawheed are capitalizing on the pamphlets and cassettes of some individuals that ascribe themselves to the Sunnah and Tawheed, which defame the true scholars and callers of the Sunnah and Tawheed. Rather, what is worse in terms of danger and affliction is that these pamphlets and tapes have influenced many of the children of Tawheed and Sunnah, so that now they launch their arrows of disparagement and oppressive accusations towards the scholars of Tawheed and Sunnah, those who carry their banner and those who defend their sanctity. What is worse than this in terms of misfortune and grief, is that they attach themselves and join forces with the people of innovation and misguidance in their campaign of launching poisonous missiles at them, which the enemies of the Sunnah and Tawheed have been preparing as the ultimate attack to finish off the last remnants of the Sunnah and Tawheed.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Ibn Al-Qayyim said: ‘The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) once saw a book in the hand of ‘Umar (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) that he had transcribed from the Torah, and which caused him to be amazed at how much it conformed to the Qur’aan. So the face of the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) became very angry to the point that ‘Umar went over to a fire and threw it in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how would it be if the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) saw what was written after him from the books that oppose and contradict what is in the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah?! And we ask Allaah to aid us!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) commanded everyone that recorded anything from him apart from the Qur’aan to erase what they had written down. However, afterward, he allowed his Sunnah to be written, but did not grant permission for anything besides that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So all of these books that contain opposition in them to the Sunnah, have no permission to be written. Rather, they only have permission to be erased and destroyed, for there is not anything more harmful to the ummah than these books. The Companions (of the Prophet) burned all the copies of the <i>mus-haf </i>that contradicted the <i>mus-haf </i>of ‘Uthmaan (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) out of fear that differing would spread amongst the ummah. So how would it be if they were to see the books of today that cause disunity and division amongst the ummah…!?’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is the rightly guided methodology, which all of the Salafee youth are obligated to know – it is the methodology indicated in the Qur’aan and the Sunnah, and which the best of this ummah – its scholars of Hadeeth and Fiqh &#8211; followed. One of the conditions for implementing this methodology is that the one criticizing must do that for the sake of Allaah and out of sincerity to Allaah and His Book and in order to preserve Allaah’s Religion and what it encompasses from beliefs, laws and acts of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the severely unfortunate matters is that the people of falsehood and innovation have succeeded in deceiving many of the smart and intelligent students of knowledge, not to mention others, by making them believe that it is not permissible to talk about (i.e. criticize) those active in the field of Da’wah (calling). They mean by this, those who call to innovation and misguidance! By doing this, they intend to broaden the field (of Da’wah) so that they can spread their destructive deceptions! And they hope that with this they will be able to put an end to the Call to Tawheed, Sunnah and the Methodology of the Salaf As-Saalih!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the offshoots of this deceitful way of thinking are those conditions that some of the children of Tawheed have put forth, such as: When criticizing the people of innovation – or those whom they label “callers” – one is obligated to mention their good qualities alongside their bad qualities&#8230;”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Imaam Zayn-ud-Deen Ibn Rajab Al-Hanbalee<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a complete translation of the classical treatise <b><i>“Al-Farq baynan-Naseeha wat-Ta’yeer”</i></b><i></i>[The Difference between Advising and Condemning] of Imaam Ibn Rajab Al-Hanbalee, may Allaah have mercy on him. The source used for this translation was the Daar ‘Ammaar publication.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this treatise, Imaam Ibn Rajab discusses some of the manners and etiquettes of differing amongst Ahlus-Sunnah, explaining the distinction between advising and condemning. This is since these two things are often confused for one another. So the author goes into depth explaining the characteristics of sincere advice and condemnation. This treatise also lays down some guidelines for Ahlus-Sunnah in their criticisms and refutations. It should be noted, as the author states, that this treatise only applies to Ahlus-Sunnah, and as for the innovators and people of desires, then these guidelines do not apply to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In recent times, Shaikh Rabee’ Al-Madkhalee has provided an explanation for some of the important points covered in this book in a two-part lecture which was later transcribed and can be downloaded for free from his website <a href="http://www.rabee.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.rabee.net</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Therefore, refuting weak (erroneous) opinions and clarifying the truth with regard to what opposes it, based upon sound evidences, is not from what these scholars detested. Rather, it was from that which they loved and for which they commended and praised those who did it. So it does not enter into the realm of backbiting at all. But suppose there is someone that hates to have his error, which contradicts the Sunnah, exposed. In this case, there is no consideration given to his hatred for that, because hating to manifest the truth &#8211; if it is in opposition to the opinion of a man &#8211; is not from those matters that are praiseworthy. Rather it is an obligation on the Muslim to love that the truth be made manifest and that the Muslims (in general) are aware of it, regardless of whether it is in conformity or in opposition to his (personal) view.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Therefore, these characteristics are the characteristics of the Jews and the hypocrites. And it is that someone outwardly displays a saying or an action, while presenting an image in which he appears to be upon good. Yet his intention in doing that is to accomplish an evil goal. So he is praised for what good he has made manifest outwardly, while accomplishing by it, the evil goal he has kept hidden inwardly. And he basks in the praise he receives for that which he has outwardly portrayed as being good, which is in fact evil on the inside, and he is happy that his evil hidden objective has been achieved. So his benefit is perfected for him and his scheme is carried out effectively by this deception!!”</p>

<p><strong>About the Book: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a small booklet titled <strong>Zaad ad-Daa&#8217;iyah IlaaAllaah (Provisions for the Caller to Allaah)</strong> by Imam Muhammad bin Saalih Al-Uthaimeen, may Allaah have mercy on him. The original source for this booklet was a lecture he gave that was later transcribed and printed. This booklet can be downloaded for free on-line at the Imaam&#8217;s website <a href="http://www.binothaimeen.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.binothaimeen.com</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this book, Imaam Ibn Uthaimeen expounds on six characteristics that everyone who takes on the task of da&#8217;wah must have. These characteristics are provisions that every Caller must equip and prepare himself with before embarking on dawah. Therefore we stress that this treatise be taken as a required reading for all those who are involved in da&#8217;wah activities, especially in the English speaking lands of the West.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah to make this e-book a beneficial source of knowledge and a reminder to our brothers and sisters who are active in calling to Allaah.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this treatise, the author dispels many of the false claims and accusations that are spread and circulated about Imaam Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdil-Wahhaab died 1206H] by using the Imaam&#8217;s own testimony from statements he made in his writings. The author brings seven of the most popular misconceptions that surround Imaam Ibn Abdil-Wahhaab and his da&#8217;wah and refutes them through the words of the Imaam, as has been recorded in his writings and collected by reliable sources into compilations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By doing this we clearly see the Imaam&#8217;s position with regard to these fundamental issues based on his own testimony and not having to rely on someone else&#8217;s explanation in his defense. We hope that through this treatise, those who have doubt about Imaam Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdil-Wahhaab and his call, can gain clarity about the true state of affairs and not listen to the lies and slander of his opponents who seek and strive to discredit the tremendous efforts of this great reformer.</p>

<p><strong>Read the Book Below:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">INTRODUCTION</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For many years and long decades now, there has been much talk and debate going on about Shaikh Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab (rahimahullaah) and his da’wah between those who agree and those who disagree, and those who accuse him and those who defend him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But anyone who looks at the words of those who oppose the Shaikh, those who attach all kinds of accusations to him, will find that their words are void of any proof. This is since there can’t be found any basis for what they claim either in his statements or in his books. Rather, they are just allegations mentioned by those in the past and repeated by those in later times, nothing more.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I think a fair and just person would only agree that the best and most correct way to find out the truth about him would be by returning to and taking from the main source (i.e. the Shaikh himself).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the books of the Shaikh are present and his words are preserved. And by looking into them, one can find out the truth or falsehood of what is being spread about him. And as for the claims that are void of evidences then they are just a mirage and not real.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In these following pages, I will present brief excerpts from the speech of Shaikh Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab, using quotes from him, which I relied on from the trustworthy books that have collected all of his statements. And I have not added anything to them except for arranging them in order.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These quotes consist of responses from the Shaikh himself against the most popular accusations that his opponents launch against him, in which he asserts the opposite of what they claim. I am certain that, by Allaah’s Guidance, these responses will suffice in clarifying the truth to those who seek it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who reject the Shaikh and oppose his Da’wah, those who spend their time spreading falsehood and circulating lies, then I say to them: Lie against your own selves for indeed the truth is clear and indeed the Religion of Allaah is victorious, and the sun shines bright, one cannot cover it with his hands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So here is the speech of the Shaikh, which disproves these claims and refutes all of your accusations. So if you have some speech from him that contradicts it then bring it out in the open and do not conceal it. And if you can’t do this, and you will not be able to do it, then I counsel you with one piece of advice: That you stand up for Allaah, free from every vain desire or bigotry, and ask Him sincerely to show you the truth and to guide you to it. Then reflect on what this man said – did he bring forth something better than the Speech of Allaah and the speech of His Messenger?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then reflect a second time: Is there any other way to salvation than speaking the truth and believing in the truth? So if the truth becomes clear to you, then return to your guidance and go back to the truth, for that is better than lingering upon falsehood. And to Allaah return all the affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">THE REALITY OF THE DA’WAH OF SHAIKH MUHAMMAD BIN ‘ABDIL-WAHHAAB</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is proper to begin this discussion by relaying some brief words from Shaikh Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab, may Allaah have mercy on him, in which he explains the reality of what he was calling to, far removed from the dark clouds of propaganda that his opponents have placed as an obstacle between many people and that Da’wah. He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I say, and to Allaah belongs the Praise and the Blessing, and all might is by Him, that my Lord has guided me to a Straight Path, an upright religion, the pure monotheistic way of Ibraaheem, and he wasn’t from the polytheists. And I, all praise be to Allaah, do not call to a madh-hab (way) of Sufism or (a madh-hab) of a Fiqh scholar or a speaker or one of the Imaams that they magnify.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the contrary, I call to Allaah alone and with no partner. And I call to the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger, which he advised the first part of his ummah and the last part of it to abide by. And I hope that I will not reject the truth if it comes to me. In fact, I call on Allaah, His angels and all of His creation to bear witness that if one of you brings one word of truth to me that I should accept it immediately and throw against the wall everything that opposes it, from the statements of my Imaams, with the exception of Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) for indeed he doesn’t speak anything but the truth.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/37-38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And I, all praise be to Allaah, am a follower (muttabi’) and not an innovator (mubtadi’).” [Mu’allafaat ash-Shaikh Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab: 5/36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The correct representation of the affair is that I say: No one should be supplicated to except Allaah, alone and with no partner, as Allaah says in His Book: ‘So do not call unto anyone along with Allaah.’ [Surah Al-Jinn: 18] And He said about the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Say: It is not in my power to cause you harm or to bring you to the Right Path.’ [Surah Al-Jinn: 21] So this is the Speech of Allaah, which the Messenger of Allaah mentioned to us and counseled us with. And this is what stands between me and you, for if he mentioned something besides this, then it is a lie and a slander.” [Ad-Durar as- Saniyyah: 1/90-91]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">THE FIRST ISSUE: THE SHAIKH’S BELIEF WITH REGARD TO THE PROPHET</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh is charged by his enemies with terrible accusations related to his belief concerning the Prophet. These accusations are as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First: That he didn’t believe he was the last of the Prophets. This is what is claimed (!), but yet all the books of the Shaikh are filled with a refutation of this misconception and they testify that this claim is a lie. Some examples are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I believe that our Prophet Muhammad (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) is the seal (last) of the prophets and messengers. And the Eemaan (Faith) of a servant (person) is not valid unless he believes in his messengership and bears witness to his prophethood.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So the most prosperous of creatures and those who will have the greatest blessing and highest level are those who are foremost in following him (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and in conforming with him in knowledge and action.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 2/21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second: That he violates the right of the Prophet and doesn’t give him the position he deserves. In order to find out the reality of this claim, I will quote some of his statements in which he clearly asserts what his belief is with regard to the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Because Allaah wanted His Tawheed to be supreme and His Religion to be completed and because He wanted His Word to be the highest and the Word of the disbelievers to be the lowest, He sent Muhammad (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), the last of the prophets and the loved one of the Lord of creation. So he did not cease to be known throughout every generation, being mentioned in the Torah of Moosaa and the Gospel of ‘Eesaa, until Allaah brought forth that pearl from between the tribes of Kinaanah and Zahra.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he brought him out during a period of time that was void of messengers, and guided him to the most upright of paths. So he had signs and indicators that proved his prophethood before he was even sent forth (with the message), which amazed the people of his time. And Allaah brought him up in a good manner. That’s why he was the noblest, the best mannered, the nicest neighbor, the most lenient and the most truthful in speech amongst his people. This was such that his people would call him ‘Al-Ameen’ (The Trustworthy One), because of what Allaah gave him from righteous conditions and praiseworthy characteristics.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 2/19, 90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“He is the chief of the intercessors, possessor of the most praiseworthy station, and Aadam as well as those besides him will be under his banner.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/86]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The first of the messengers was Nooh, and the last and most virtuous of them was Muhammad.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/143]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“He clarified with the most profound of clarifications (i.e. the Religion) and he completed and finalized it. He was the most sincere of creatures towards the servants of Allaah, and he was compassionate and merciful to the believers. He conveyed the message and fulfilled the trust, and he made true Jihaad in the Cause of Allaah. And he worshipped Allaah until certainty (i.e. death) reached him.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 2/21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, he (rahimahullaah) mentioned that one of the benefits derived from the Prophet’s statement: “None of you truly believes until I become more beloved to him than his father, his son, and all of mankind” is the obligation of loving him above loving one’s self, family and wealth. [Kitaab at-Tawheed: 108]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Third: They claim that he rejected the Prophet’s intercession. The Shaikh responds to this misconception by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“They claim that we reject the Prophet’s intercession. Far removed is Allaah from imperfections, this is a great slander. Rather, we bear witness before Allaah that the Messenger of Allaah is the intercessor and possessor of the praiseworthy station. We ask Allaah, the Most Generous, Lord of the Mighty Throne, that He allow him to intercede for us and that he resurrect us under his banner.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/63-64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“No one rejects the Prophet’s intercession except for the people of innovation and misguidance. However, the intercession will not occur unless permission is granted first (by Allaah) and He is pleased with it, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And no one will intercede except for he whom He is pleased with.’ [Surah Al- Anbiyaa: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Who is it that will intercede in His presence except by His permission.’ [Surah Al-Baqarah: 255]” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh explains the reason why this false claim was spread about him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“These people, when I mentioned to them what Allaah and His Messenger, as well as the scholars from all the groups, stated about the obligation of making the worship solely for Allaah and the prohibition of resembling the People of the Scripture who came before us in the aspect of taking their priests and rabbis as lords besides Allaah, they said to us: ‘You have degraded the status of the prophets, righteous people and the awliyaa (friends of Allaah)!’” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 2/50]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">THE SECOND ISSUE: THE PROPHET’S HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the many accusations directed at the Shaikh is that he didn’t love the members of the Prophet’s Household and that he violated their rights. The response to this is that what is claimed is in contradiction to the true state of affairs. In fact, he, may Allaah have mercy on him, fully acknowledged the right that they had of being loved and honored, and he abided by it. In fact, he would even rebuke those who didn’t abide by this, as he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah has obligated certain rights for the members of the household of Allaah’s Messenger, which they have over the people. So it is not permissible for a Muslim to abandon their rights thinking that to be part of Tawheed. Rather this is from extremism. The only thing we reject is honoring them for the sake of the (false) claim that they have the right to be worshipped, as well as honoring those who claim this.” [Mu’allafaat ash-Shaikh: 5/284]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever reflects on the life and history of the Shaikh will realize the truthfulness of what he stated here. It is enough to know that the Shaikh named six of his seven children with names from the Prophet’s Household, may Allaah be pleased with them: ‘Alee, ‘Abdullaah, Husayn, Hasan, Ibraaheem and Faatimah. This is a clear proof of the great love and respect he had for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">THE THIRD ISSUE: THE WONDROUS OCCURRENCES OF THE AWLIYAA</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people spread around that Shaikh Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab denied the extraordinary occurrences (karaamaat) of the awliyaa (close friends of Allaah). What disproves this false claim is that the Shaikh has clearly affirmed in several places of his Creed the opposite of what is spread around about him concerning this issue. An example of this is the statements he makes in some of his speech in which he explains his belief and creed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And I affirm the karaamaat (wondrous occurrences) of the awliyaa.” [Ad-Durar As- Saniyyah: 1/32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I wonder how the Shaikh can be accused of such a claim when he is the one who described those who deny the wondrous occurrences of the awliyaa as people of innovation and misguidance, when he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And no one rejects the wondrous occurrences of the awliyaa except for the people of innovation and misguidance.” [Ad-Durar As-Saniyyah: 1/32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>THE FOURTH ISSUE: TAKFEER</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the greatest of misconceptions that are spread about the Shaikh and his followers is that they declare the general masses of Muslims to be disbelievers (i.e. takfeer), and that they claim that marrying them is not valid except for those who are part of them or those who join their group.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh has refuted this misconception in numerous places, amongst them are: “The statement that we declare the Muslims to be disbelievers generally is from the lies of the enemies who wish to prevent people from this Religion. So we say: ‘Glorified and far removed are You (O Allaah), this is a tremendous slander!’ [Surah An-Noor: 16]” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/100]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“They have ascribed to us various lies, and so the fitnah has increased. Amongst these lies are: Spreading slander, which any sane person would be shy to transmit, not to mention be fooled by. An example of this is what you have mentioned that I deem all people to be disbelievers except for those who follow me, and that I claim that marrying them is not valid! How strange that such a notion could enter into the mind of a sane person! Would a Muslim say such a thing?! I absolve myself before Allaah from this claim, which only emanates from one with deficient intellect and no understanding. So may Allaah curse the people of evil and false objectives.” [Ad- Durar As-Saniyyah: 1/80]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The person I deem to be a disbeliever is the one who knows the Religion of the Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), but then after coming to know it, turns to reviling it and forbidding the people from it and making enmity with those who adhere to it. This is the person that I declare to be a disbeliever. And the majority of the ummah (i.e. Muslims), all praise be to Allaah, are not like this.” [Ad-Durar As-Saniyyah: 1/73]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>THE FIFTH ISSUE: THE WAY OF THE KHAWAARIJ </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are some people who accuse the Shaikh of being upon the beliefs of the Khawaarij, those who declare Muslims disbelievers because of sins. The response to this from the words of the Shaikh is as follows: He, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “I do not testify for any of the Muslims that he is in Paradise or the Hellfire except for those who Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) testified it for. However, I wish well for the good-doer and I fear for the evildoer. And I do not deem anyone amongst the Muslims to be a disbeliever due to a sin, nor do I extract him from the fold of Islaam.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>THE SIXTH ISSUE: TAJSEEM</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is also spread about the Shaikh is that he was a mujassim, i.e. that he likened Allaah’s attributes to the creation’s attributes.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh has mentioned his belief concerning this aspect, and he is far removed from the lies his opponents accuse him of. He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“From the Belief (Eemaan) in Allaah, is that one believes in what Allaah has described Himself with in His Book and upon the tongue of His Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), without committing tahreef (distortion) or ta’teel (denial). Rather, he must believe that there is nothing equal to Allaah and that he is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer. So he must not negate what Allaah described Himself with, nor should he distort the words from their true state, nor should he deny His Names and Attributes, nor should he say how Allaah’s Attributes are or resemble them to the creation’s attributes. This is because Allaah has no equals or rivals or similars, nor can He be compared to His creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Allaah is the most knowledgeable about Himself and about others, and He is the most truthful in words and the best in speech. So He has removed Himself from what His opponents from the people who commit takyeef and tamtheel have described Him with, and from what those who commit tahreef and ta’teel have negated from Him, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Far removed is your Lord, the Lord of Glory and Might, from what they ascribe to Him, and peace be on the Messengers. And all praise belongs to Allah, Lord of all that is created.’ [Surah As-Saafaat: 180-182]” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/29] “It is well known that ta’teel is the opposite of tajseem, and those who commit this (ta’teel) are enemies of those who commit that (tajseem). The truth lies in between these two (extremes).” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 3/11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">THE SEVENTH ISSUE: OPPOSING THE SCHOLARS</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people say that Shaikh Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab opposed the rest of the scholars in what he called to, not turning to their statements or relying on their books. Rather, he introduced something new and brought forth a fifth madh-hab. The best person to clarify the reality of this issue is the Shaikh himself. He (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“We are blind followers of the Book and the Sunnah and the righteous predecessors of this ummah, as well as what is relied on from the opinions of the four Imaams: Abu Haneefah An-Nu’maan bin Thaabit, Maalik bin Anas, Muhammad bin Idrees and Ahmad bin Hanbal, may Allaah have mercy on all of them.” [Mu’allafaat ash-Shaikh: 5/96]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So if you hear that I have issued a ruling on something that does not conform with the unanimous agreement of the scholars, then reject my opinion.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“If you claim that the scholars are upon something different than what I am upon, then here are their books present.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 2/58]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I challenge the follower of Abu Haneefah with the opinions of the old Hanafee scholars and also the followers of Maalik, Shaafi’ee and Hanbal with the opinions of the previous scholars of each madh-hab, who are relied upon.” [Ad-Durar as- Saniyyah: 1/82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“In summary, the thing that I forbid is when one believes that someone other than Allaah can do things that it is not possible for anyone to do except Allaah. So if I said something to this effect from myself, then accuse me of that, or in a book you find, which doesn’t adhere to this, then accuse me with that also. Or if I quoted it from the people of my madh-hab, then accuse me of that. But if I stated it based on the Command of Allaah and His Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and based on what the scholars in every madh-hab have unanimously agreed on, then it is not appropriate for a person who believes in Allaah and the Last Day to reject it due to the people of his time or the people of his country or because most of the people in his time reject it.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/76]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To conclude this discussion, we present two pieces of advice from the Shaikh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First: For those who strive against this da’wah and its followers, conspiring against it and attaching all kinds of accusations and falsehoods to it, the Shaikh says to these people:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I remind those who oppose me that the obligation upon the people is to follow what the Prophet counseled his ummah with (i.e. the Sunnah). And I say to them: The books are with you. Look in them and do not take any of my speech. However, when you come to know the words of Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) that are in your books then follow it even though most of the people oppose it…Do not (unconditionally) obey me or anyone else except for the command of Allaah’s Messenger, which is found in your books. And know that nothing can save you except for following Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam). This worldly life is temporary and it is not proper for someone with common sense to be forgetful about Paradise and Hell.” [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/89-90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I call those who oppose me to four things: Either the Book of Allaah or the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger or to the Ijmaa’ (consensus) of the scholars. And if he refuses this then I call him to a mubaahalah.” [2] [Ad-Durar as-Saniyyah: 1/55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second: To those who are confused about this matter, the Shaikh says: “You must constantly supplicate to Allaah and humble yourself before Him, especially during the times in which the invocations are answered, such as: the last part of the night, the last portion of the prayer and after the Adhaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And you must also use the supplications reported in the texts, especially the one that has been reported in the Saheeh, that he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) would say: ‘O Allaah, Lord of Jibraa’eel, Mikaa’eel and Israa’eel, Originator of the heavens and the earth, All-Knower of the Hidden and the Apparent, You will judge between Your servants in those matters which they differed on. Guide me in that which is differed on from the truth, by Your Will. Verily, You guide whom You will to a Straight Path.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You must be persistent in saying this supplication before the One who answers the call of the distressed when he calls, and the One who guided Ibraaheem to oppose all of the people. And say: ‘O teacher of Ibraaheem, teach me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if you find difficulty in opposing the people, then reflect on Allaah’s statement: ‘Then we placed you upon a Legislation from Our Command, so follow it, and do not follow the vain desires of those who know not. Verily, they can avail you nothing before Allaah.’ [Surah Al-Jaathiyah: 18-19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And if you obey most of those on the earth, they will mislead you far away from Allaah’s Path.’ [Surah Al-An’aam: 116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And reflect on the Prophet’s words found in the Saheeh: ‘Islaam began strange and it will return to being strange as it began’ and his (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) statement: ‘Verily Allaah will not snatch away knowledge…’ and his statement: ‘Stick to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly guided Khaleefahs who come after me’ and his statement: ‘And beware of newly invented matters, for indeed every innovation is a misguidance.’” [Ad-Durar As-Saniyyah: 1/42-43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And if it becomes clear to you that this is the truth in which there is no doubt, and that it is an obligation to spread it amongst the people and to teach it to the women and men, then may Allaah have mercy on the one fulfills his duty, repents to Allaah and acknowledges this to himself, for indeed a person who repents from a sin is like one who has no sin at all. May Allaah guide us and you and our brothers to that which He loves and is pleased with, and peace be on you.” [Ad-Durar As-Saniyyah: 2/43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah send His peace and blessings on His slave and messenger, our prophet and loved one, Muhammad, as well as His family and all of his Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s Note: Tajseem comes from the word jism (body), and it literally means to make something into a body. This is the term applied when someone gives anthropomorphic (i.e. human-like) qualities to Allaah, by saying His hand is like my hand, and His seeing is like my seeing, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Translator’s Note: A Mubaahalah is when two people who are in opposition to one another come together to invoke Allaah’s curses on the one who is lying and upon falsehood between the two disputants.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Shaikh Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi’ee<br />
SOURCE: Tuhfat-ul-Mujeeb ‘alaa As’ilat-il-Haadir wal-Ghareeb (pg. 143-147) [Original source is a tape “Questions from England” recorded in Ramadaan 13, 1416H]<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Question:</b> There is a group amongst us (in Britain) called Muntadaa Al-Markaz Al-Islaamee. They are connected with Muhammad Suroor and they sell his books and interact with him. And they have a tazkiyah (approval/recommendation) from Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez Ibn Baaz and Shaikh Ibn ‘Uthaimeen that encourages cooperating with them and being connected to them. So what is your advice to Al-Muntadaa Al-Islaamee and what is your advice to the Salafees who cooperate and work with them in Da’wah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer:</b> My advice to them is that they return to the condition they were upon when they were spreading the Qur’aan and Sunnah in their magazine “Al-Bayaan” and in their magazine “As-Sunnah”. We were extremely pleased with the magazine “As-Sunnah” and likewise with the magazine “Al-Bayaan”. But then the reality became clear – that they were in fact Hizbees (partisans), who called people away from the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I advise them to not clash with the Muslim rulers. This partisanship (<i>hizbiyyah</i>) has caused divisions within the unity of the callers to Allaah from among the Ahlus-Sunnah in Yemen, and in the lands of the Haramayn, Najd and in Sudan and in Egypt, as well as in many of the Muslim countries.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They call people to not have any concern for knowledge. There used to be a group of students that was studying with us, then they attached themselves to these people, and all of sudden they started to have contempt for their brothers (other students) and for us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Studying the Qur’aan and the Sunnah to them is like a seashell (i.e. it is hollow and empty). And performing worship in the masjid to them is also like a seashell. And these are the masaajid, about which the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“If one of you makes wudoo (ablution) and he does it well, then he goes out to the masjid – nothing brings him out except the prayer, he does not take one step except that Allaah raises him one level due to it and one sin gets erased from him. So when he prays, the angels do not stop sending their prayers upon him, as long as he is in prayer, saying: ‘O Allaah, bless him, O Allaah, have mercy on him.’ And none of you ceases to be in prayer while he is waiting for the (next) prayer.” </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I say: If Shaikh Ibn Baaz and Shaikh Ibn ‘Uthaimeen gave <i>tazkiyah</i> (approval) to Al-Muntadaa before the Gulf Crisis, then they are both excused from that, because even we ourselves praised the magazine “Al-Bayaan” a lot, and we called people to cooperate in working with them. And if they gave their <i>tazkiyah</i> after the Gulf Crisis – and I don’t think that is so – then they are both considered to be in error. So I say to the two Shaikhs: These people have split the Muslims here in Yemen and they have turned to attacking and showing enmity to the Ahlus-Sunnah. Rather, their harm has become great – and I do not say that their harm is greater than that of the Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen – for they are only like scraps as compared to the Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen. And they are the ones who transgress against many of the masaajid of Ahlus-Sunnah, amongst which is a masjid in ‘Aden, the masjid of the people in Buraiqah, which Shaikh Ahmad Ibn ‘Uthmaan is the Imaam of…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if these two Shaikhs issued a <i>tazkiyah</i> (religious approval), then they should take it back, just as I took mine back when their affair became clear to me during the Gulf Crisis, and when their enmity became apparent to me in Yemen. And from their heads is ‘Abdul-Majeed Ar-Reemee, Muhammad Al-Baydaanee and ‘Abdullaah Ibn Faysal Al-Ahdal. They have begun mocking and ridiculing their brothers. And if you were to read the Qasaa’id (poetic verses) of ‘Abdul-Majeed you would have found them according to the Sunnah, but now they have diluted and melted away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I advise the mashaayikh to recant form their approvals (<i>tazkiyaat</i>), for Allaah says in His Noble Book: <b>“And do not argue on behalf of those who deceive themselves. Verily, Allaah does not like anyone who is a betrayer, sinner.” </b>[Surah An-Nisaa: 107]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says: <b>“Have you not seen those who claim sanctity for themselves (i.e. given themselves <i>tazkiyahs</i>). Nay, but Allah sanctifies whom He wills. And they will not be dealt with unjustly, even equal to the extent of a <i>fateel</i> (small thread).” </b>[Surah An-Nisaa: 49]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says in His Glorious Book: <b>“So do not purify (give <i>tazkiyah</i> to) yourselves, He knows best who has Taqwaa.” </b>[Surah An-Najm: 13?]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they use this <i>tazkiyah</i> (approval) for the purpose of deceiving the people, so it is not acceptable if it is used for this time, because it has become clear from them that they attack Shaikh Al-Albaanee and that they criticize Shaikh Ibn Baaz, when he issued a fatwa allowing the treaty with the Jews during the Gulf Crisis. And they rejoice at this so that they can chase the people away from the scholars, because no one has remained with them! So they say: “We have no choice for these people, except to attack their scholars, because we (ourselves) are scholars.” And if their Shaikh opposes them he suddenly becomes from the Takfeeri group!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They invited Abu Suhaib, who was Syrian, to teach amongst them. So after he taught amongst them for as long as Allaah willed, they said: “We feel that the fruits of your teaching should be repaid to you, so pick any land and we will give you the proper permits. So he responded: “The lands belong to Allaah and do not belong to you. Cut off the salary you pay me because I don’t want it.” Then the students remained with him and all praise be to Allaah not one student was produced from them. Even though they are troublemakers, still by Allaah’s Grace, they have no effect. So I advise the Salafi brothers to stay far away from these Hizbees (partisans), because they are not looking for anything except to build the membership of their party.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if ‘Aqeel Al-Muqtaree comes to you, or Muhammad Al-Mahdee or other than these two, and the people say: “This is a scholar from the scholars of Yemen”, then do not host him or allow him entry. And do not attend his lectures, because he only goes touring around for the sake of collecting dollars!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And one brother who came from America informed me that they were touring through America, giving lectures, and they would say: <b>“The one who supports an orphan and me are like this!”</b>[1] So a man from the crowd stood up – and he was looking for aid for Bosnia and Herzog – and said: “The one who supports the orphan is the one who feeds him not the one who begs.” So they began to dispute with one another all because of the worldly matters (Duniyaa)!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When worldly aspirations enter into the Da’wah, it’s blessing diminishes, as Allaah says: <b>“Does not the sincere worship belong to Allaah?” </b>[Surah Az-Zumar: 3] And He says: <b>“And they were not commanded except to worship Allaah, making their worship (Religion) sincerely to Him (alone).” </b>[Surah Al-Bayyinah: 5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for their magazine of begging, which we call “Al-Furqah” (causing divisions) Magazine, and which they call “Al-Furqaan” (The Criterion), then I challenge them to bring any of its issues which doesn’t have begging in it. And I challenge Muhammad al-Mahdee to bring forth a student of knowledge that can be studied under. Rather, you find that he has transformed ‘Abdullaah Ibn Ghaalib, Muhammad Al-Baydaanee and many others, for they used to be students of knowledge here (in Yemen), but then he deluded them and misled them!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I forgot to mention Muhammad Al-Hadeeyah who came charging from Sudan to Riyadh, then to Jeddah, then to Qatar and then to Abu Dhabi, then to Dubai, all for the purpose of building a masjid for the Sufis!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I advise you to stay far away from these individuals! And perhaps someone may say: “So then who should we study under?” So my response is: I hold that it is an obligation on our noble brothers in the lands of the Haramayn and Najd to send to their brothers some people (to teach them) who are not Hizbees (partisans). And it is an obligation on us also, to send to our brothers in England some of our students who can be studied under, even if they stay for three or five months.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore I say: It is an obligation to turn our attention to the Qur’aan and the Sunnah. As for the lectures of the innovators, then you will see them stampeding and ramming (like wild beats) in their lectures, but then when they finish, they say: “We have a project for establishing an educational center.” And this educational center is in the district of Daleel.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I advise the brothers – may Allaah preserve them – to request from Shaikh Ibn Baaz – may Allaah preserve him – that he send to them someone that can teach them. And I advise my brothers here (in Yemen), that one of them should go to (them) and stay for three months, then return and someone else go. This does not fall into the realm of advice only; rather I consider it to be an obligation. But I don’t mean that a brother should arrive at England and then they waste his time by traveling around or that he doesn’t find students who want to seek knowledge from him. So they must learn some Arabic, ‘Aqeedah (Creed), Islamic Fiqh and Hadeeth of the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Shaikh Rabee&#8217; bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee<br />
SOURCE: Manhaj Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah fee Naqd-ir-Rijaal wal-Kutub wat-Tawaa&#8217;if<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Verily, all praise is for Allaah. We praise Him, we seek His assistance and we ask Him for His forgiveness. And we seek refuge in Him from the evils of our souls and from the evils of our actions. Whosoever Allaah guides, there is none that can lead him astray. And whosoever is lead astray, there is no guide for Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I bear witness that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah &#8211; alone and with no partner. And I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Allaah sent Muhammad with the Guidance and the Religion of Truth, in order that it can gain supremacy over all religions, even though the disbelievers may hate it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah commanded His Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) to establish the call (da&#8217;wah) to Him with wisdom, fair admonition and arguing that is done in the best manner. Likewise He commanded him to openly declare the truth, as He says: <b>“So proclaim openly that which you have been commanded, and turn away from the polytheists.”</b> [Surah Al-Hijr: 94]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He commanded him to wage Jihaad against the polytheists, disbelievers and hypocrites, by way of the Qur&#8217;aan, the sword and the spear, to the point that there would remain no more fitnah and the Religion would all be purely for Allaah alone. And so that the word of the disbelievers can become the lowest (in the land) and so that word of Allaah can be the highest.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) rose to fulfill this great obligation of professing the truth and performing Jihaad for the sake of Allaah &#8211; the way it should be performed – up until the day he died.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then his (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) rightly-guided Khaleefahs continued upon his methodology after him &#8211; and so they waged Jihaad against those Muslims who apostated in the Arab peninsula (after the Prophet&#8217;s death). This was such that they brought this crucial movement of apostasy to an end. Then they carried the banner of Jihaad to all parts of the world and Allaah gave them victory over the strongest forces of kufr (disbelief) at that time – the Persians, the Romans and others. And so this brought to reality Allaah&#8217;s promise:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allaah has promised those among you who believe and do good deeds, that He will certainly grant them ascendancy in the land as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the ability to practice the Religion, which He has chosen for them. And He will place in exchange of their fear a sense of security (provided), that they worship Me and do not ascribe any partners to Me. And whoever disbelieves afterward, then those are the evildoers.&#8221;</b> [Surah An-Noor: 55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Commander of the Believers, &#8216;Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) – the ingenious one through whom Allaah gave glory to Islaam – served as a preventive barrier and a closed door in the face of fitan (trials), corruption and evil. So the heretics and fire-worshippers (Majoos) conspired against him and eventually carried out their plot by murdering him. So he went back to his Lord as a martyr, after having filled the earth with justice, Eemaan and light. But that firm and solid door (which he had established) fell apart after his death and so the various forms of fitnah entered and penetrated into the ranks of the Muslims during the time of the noble Khaleefah &#8216;Uthmaan Ibn &#8216;Affaan (radyAllaahu ‘anhu). And it grew worse and worse to the point that it led to the death of this Khaleefah. So he too, went back to his Lord as a martyr that was wronged.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a result of these afflictions, there transpired that which occurred between the fourth righteous Khaleefah &#8216;Alee (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) and Mu&#8217;awiyah Ibn Abee Sufyaan (radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa). However, they were both mujtahids in that matter &#8211; so the one who was correct earned two rewards, while the one who erred was given one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there came to pass the fitnah of the people of innovation from the Khawaarij – those whom the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) described, concerning their excessiveness in worship, as:<b> &#8220;They will shoot out from the Religion just as the arrow shoots out from the (hunted) prey.&#8221; </b>And he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) described them as: <b>&#8220;The worst of mankind and creatures.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said:<b> &#8220;They are the worst of those below the surface of the heaven&#8221; and &#8220;Kill them wherever you find them, for indeed, he who kills them will have a great reward with Allaah.&#8221;</b> [Agreed Upon]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As well as that which holds the greatest warning to those who call towards being close and having sympathy for the innovators – in that they are worse, more vile and possess more dangerous plots and schemes (than the innovators do). That was why ‘Alee (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) killed these individuals as he was commanded to by the Messenger of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there appeared the fitnah of the ideologies of the Raafidah and the Zanaadiqah. And ‘Alee (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) did not see anything more fitting to cure the hearts of the believers other than to burn them in fire. And he received aid from those noble Companions who took part in this campaign.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is what the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) and his righteous Companions prescribed for us from firmness and determination when dealing with innovators and heretics.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then as time passed on and the best of generations came to an end, the innovations grew worse, their domains widened and their sects became many. Thus it became a reality what the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) informed us of and warned us about, when he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“You will follow the ways of those who came before you inch by inch and cubit by cubit, such that if they were to enter into the hole of a lizard, you would surely follow after them.” We said: “O Messenger of Allaah! Do you mean the Jews and the Christians?” He said: “Who else?”</b> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when he said:<br />
<b>“The Jews divided into seventy-one sects and the Christians divided into seventy-two sects. And my ummah will divide into seventy-three sects. All of them will be in the Hellfire except one.” They said: “Which one is it, O Messenger of Allaah?” He said: “The one that adheres to that which I and my Companions are upon.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another wording, he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“It is the Jamaa’ah.”</b> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars of Islaam such as Ibn Al-Mubaarak, Yazeed Ibn Haaroon, Ibn Al-Madeenee, Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, Al-Bukhaaree, Al-Khateeb Al-Baghdaadee, Ibn Taimiyyah and Ibn Rajab have interpreted this saved and victorious sect as being Ahl-ul-Hadeeth and those who adhere to their methodology. Many of these interpretations of theirs occur when mentioning the Prophet’s (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) saying: <b>“There will not cease to be a group from my ummah triumphant upon the truth. Those who abandon them will not be able to harm them nor will those who oppose them, until Allaah’s order (promise) comes to pass and they are upon that (condition).”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this group did not cease to exist ever since the time when the calamities originated and the desires created divisions within the ummah, resulting in the number (seventy-three) mentioned above. This group did not cease to be upon Allaah’s command, calling others towards the truth and spreading the sciences brought down from the prophethood. Nor did they desist from safeguarding and protecting the Religion. Nor did they refrain from refuting the schemes of the conspirators, the false claims of the liars and the distortions of the ignorant. Neither the abuse and plotting of the schemers nor the evil planning of the conspirators was able to prevent them from doing that. And the difficulties that they experienced did not increase them, except in further confirming the truth and displaying strength in the face of falsehood. Such was the case during the times of Imaam Ahmad and &#8216;Abdul-Ghanee Al-Maqdisee and during the time of Ibn Taimiyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah paved the way for the da’wah of the Imaam, the reformer, Shaikh Muhammad Ibn ‘Abd-il-Wahhaab in the Arab peninsula – the site of revelation and the place of the Message. But this only came after the darkness of ignorance, misguidance and disorder had reigned over it for generations. So he raised the banner of Tawheed and held high the flags of Islaam. And due to his efforts and the efforts of his brothers from the people of Tawheed and the Sunnah, a state based upon Tawheed and the Sunnah was established. But the ongoing battles between them and the people of falsehood continued and progressed to a standstill, until the state of Tawheed and the Sunnah finally became settled and its foundations firmly rooted at the hands of the king ‘Abd-ul-‘Azeez and his Muslim brothers, who were sincere warriors and truthful scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And thus the light of Tawheed and Eemaan spread throughout the world, removing the darknesses of Shirk and innovation from here and there. This came about by way of the distribution of the books of the Salaf As-Saalih (righteous predecessors), such as those on the subjects of Hadeeth, Tafseer and Tawheed, and especially those of Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah and Ibn Al-Qayyim. It came about by way of the founding of schools of various grade levels, beginning with elementary schools and continuing onto universities and institutes of higher and specialized studies. This was in connection with the centers of da’wah that were spread out both inside (Saudi Arabia) and outside of it, in order to carry the message of Tawheed and the Sunnah. As well as all those other things which took sleep away from the opponents of Truth and Tawheed from amongst the secularists, Jews, Christians, communists and deviant innovators such as those who form into sects, parties and movements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the most dangerous of these (above) categories and the ones who produced the worst consequences were the people of innovation – the spiteful ones that are filled with hatred. This is since by their plotting, scheming and their camouflaging of themselves behind the cover of the Sunnah, they were able to penetrate every barrier. Thus they managed to pour into every crack from these schools, universities and masaajid. And they were able to create a group that carried their ideologies, whether all of it or some of it, and whether intentionally or unintentionally.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this group – which they had trained and prepared according to the way they saw fit – began to form movements calling the people towards these ideologies in the universities, schools and elsewhere. And they upheld it by becoming active in this place and in that place. And these were crucial and significant times in which the da’wah (call) to Allaah had a great need for enthusiastic and active individuals that would raise its flag with firmness and conviction, fighting the armies of falsehood, schemes and plots and thus turning them back upon their heels in disgrace</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So then using the name of Salafiyyah and the names of justice and fairness, this group was able to present the innovators – those who waged war against the people of Sunnah and Tawheed in their own land – as ones who were oppressed. And they corrupted the minds and the beliefs of many of the youth, distorting the image of the Salafi Manhaj and its adherents in the eyes of the youth. Then the figureheads within this group began calling towards a “new methodology” with regard to criticizing methodologies, ideologies, books and individuals – and they claimed that this was the methodology that was just and fair. So many of he youth and those who wrote in their favor began to think that such was the correct way. Rather, they even claimed that it was the methodology of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah! And this spread and circulated in the writings of some of those who ascribed themselves to the Salaf. And it had an effect on many of the youth, such that they accepted it and clung onto it, thinking that it was the truth and that it was just. And then unfortunately, that began to become deeply rooted in their hearts and they did not realize that this was a way of thinking that was foreign to Islaam and Muslims. This view crept into them from their enemies in the same manner that other (deviant) ideologies had crept into Islaamic societies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The effects of this methodology became clearly apparent in the conversations, debates, writings and attitudes of many of the youths and teachers. So this methodology began to take firm root in the people’s hearts. And from its evil consequences was that it weakened the principle of Al-Walaa wal-Baraa (loyalty and disassociation) to Allaah and for the sake of Allaah, and to the methodology of Allaah and those who adhere to it – those whom it is obligatory to love and to be loyal to for the sake of Allaah. Instead there became manifest the loyalty, love and esteem for the callers, books, ideologies and methodologies that were all far from the Salafi Manhaj, and for their people and not its people. Rather, that became the main avenue used in fighting against the Salafi Manhaj. And they changed it with strong determination so that it (the manhaj) would be replaced from its original form, halting its progression in its tracks after its departure had already taken place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This (new) methodology had a great influence upon writers who we once thought were from the best of the Salafis and from the virtuous characters, personages and figures. We ask Allaah to grant them the ability to tread the way and methodology of their righteous predecessors in regards to calling to the clear methodology of the Salaf, the dedicated education of the youth that are upon it and implanting love for it and its followers whether they are dead or alive, and to follow their example and strengthen themselves by affiliating themselves to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, this methodology, of which it is claimed that it is balanced and fair, has had a great influence upon the youth whom we used to and still have not stopped having hope in, that they will take a hold of the Salafi Manhaj with resoluteness and carry its banner with firmness, calling to it with vigor and sacrificing for its sake every expensive and cheap thing from wealth, status, activities and actions that they have. But unfortunately the state of current affairs is not this way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why the hearts indeed tremble with fear for them, that these methodologies should mix in with them and they adopt them, and that their (evil) banners mix with theirs and they adopt them. And there is nothing after the truth except falsehood. So they will display to them that everyone is upon truth or that they are all brothers coming from one origin. And it is possible that they will take some of these (ideas) as a substitute for the true Salafi Manhaj and that they will prefer that banner over its banner, since it is very glamorous, loud and radiant. And this is even if this (methodology) is empty and void of any principles of Islaam and blind in the subject of clinging onto the Qur’aan and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This methodology we have been indicating has many other signs, which I do not see fit to mention here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I hope that Allaah grants me success in presenting the (true) Islaamic Salafi Manhaj with regard to criticizing individuals, groups, books and calls, based upon the texts of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah, and the texts indicating the position the Muslim scholars took and the behavior they implemented in the books of Al-Jarh wat-Ta&#8217;deel and in the books of Sunnah and Islamic beliefs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I undertook this project motivated by my love for this believing youth, whom I consider – by Allaah – to be the greatest of treasures in this life. And we would ransom our souls and livelihoods for them. And we strictly watch over their proper procession upon the ways and paths of this life. So if their souls, minds and hearts yearn for the home of their first love,[3] then that is from what Allaah loves and is pleased with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>“Place your heart wherever you wish from your desires<br />
For the true love is only for the first loved one<br />
How many homes on the earth is the young man’s heart attached to<br />
Yet his longing will always be for his first (original) home.”</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if some of them refuse, insisting to be upon indecisiveness, confusion, inconsistencies and shakiness, then know that the hearts are between the two fingers of the Most Merciful &#8211; He changes it however He wills.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And to Allaah belongs the Command of what came before and what will come after.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Shaikh Rabee&#8217; bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee<br />
SOURCE: His book &#8220;<i>Manhaj Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah fee Naqd ar-Rijaal wal Kutub wat-Tawaa&#8217;if</i>&#8221; (pg. 33-43 of 3rd Edition)<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are guidelines, which define those whom we are required to respect and honor from among mankind, such that it is not permissible to harm their honor. And they define those whom it is permissible to speak about and criticize, rather, whom it is obligatory to criticize at the time of necessity and benefit, without having to mention their good qualities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>· Those whom we are obligated to honor</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>First: The Messengers and Prophets, may Allaah&#8217;s peace and blessings be upon all of them</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has related to us their stories, showing their striving and perseverance, while He has repudiated those who denied and opposed them. And He commanded the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) as well as his ummah to follow their example.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Second: The Companions, may Allaah be pleased with them</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing that the Muslim ummah should feel towards them except love and respect. Allaah has praised them highly in His Book. And He spoke about their high rank, their efforts and the sacrifices they made with their wealth and their lives in the Cause of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) praised them highly, both on an individual and a group level. This is such that the scholars of Islaam devoted special and close attention to their merits and qualities, writing many books concerning their virtues and special characteristics.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) forbade us from insulting them, saying: <b>&#8220;Do not revile my Companions. For I swear by the One in whose hand my soul is in, if one of you were to give in charity the likes of mount Uhud in gold, it would not equal a mudd (handful using 2 hands) of one of them nor even half of it.&#8221;</b> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah are well aware of their position and status, and so they guard it with the strictest form of guarding. And they forbid others from speaking vainly about what occurred of dispute between &#8216;Alee (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) and Mu&#8217;awiyah (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) and those who supported them from the rest of the Companions. Rather, they assert for them the reward that is given to the <i>mujtahids</i>. And they ruled that all those who spoke about them – or even about one of them – were upon deviance, misguidance and heresy.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Third: Those who followed them in goodness</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This includes those who reached the (time of the) Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) and were guided by their guidance, such as the seven scholars of Fiqh of Madeenah and those who followed their way in the rest of the towns. Then after them, are the scholars of Hadeeth, Fiqh and Tafseer – those who strove upon the way of the righteous Companions and Successors. And it includes those who followed their methodology with regard to Creed, holding tightly onto the Book and the Sunnah, avoiding innovations, vain desires and its adherents, and defending the truth and its adherents, up until this day of ours and after it, until Allaah&#8217;s promise comes about.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are the ones whom the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) was referring to when he said: <b>&#8220;There will not cease to be a group from my ummah, triumphant upon the truth. Those who abandon them will not be able to harm them nor will those who oppose them, until the order (promise) of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, comes.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are better known as Ahl-ul-hadeeth, as has been agreed upon by the Imaams of Islaam and the scholars of guidance. And no one opposes them in regard to what they have agreed on except those from the people of vain desires, ignorance and misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad, Al-Haakim and Ibn Al-Qayyim have indeed accused those who criticize them of being heretics. And those who spoke vilely about them (the scholars) have been repudiated severely by Ibn Qutaybah, Ar-Raamaharzamee, Al-Khateeb (Al-Baghdaadee) and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is no doubt that no one speaks against them except for those whom Allaah has led astray and blinded. So if one of these (scholars) errs in an issue from the issues in which Ijtihaad is allowed, it must be clarified but not in the manner of condemning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said with regard to these (scholars):<br />
“So whoever is known to have (the ability to perform) the allowable Ijtihaad, then it is not permissible for him to be mentioned in a manner of condemnation or blame, because Allaah has forgiven him of his error. Instead, it is an obligation due to what he possesses of Eemaan and Taqwaa to show loyalty and love to him, and to fulfill what Allaah has mandated from his rights, such as praising him, making du’aa (supplication) for him, and so on.” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>· Those whom it is permissible to criticize, disparage and warn the people against their harm:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>First: The People of Innovation</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible – rather obligatory – to speak about the people of innovation and warn against them and their fabrications, whether individually or as groups and whether they are absent or present. They include those among the Khawaarij, the Rawaafid, the Jahmiyyah, the Murji&#8217;ah, the Karaamiyyah and the people of Rhetoric – those whose knowledge of <i>Kalaam</i> (rhetoric) has brought them to corrupted and deviant beliefs,[3] such as the rejection of all or some of Allaah&#8217;s Attributes. [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is an obligation to warn against these types of people, their books and their misguided ways. And how great in number they are!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, the same applies to those who follow their methodology from the sects [and groups] of our time, such as those who separate themselves away from the people of Tawheed and Sunnah, oppose them and remain far away from their aspects of the methodology. In fact, they wage war against these aspects of the methodology and chase others away from it and its adherents (i.e. the scholars). The likes of these individuals are followed by those who support and defend them. And these followers of theirs mention their good qualities and praise them for it, praising their personalities and leaders. And they have preferred their (innovated) methodologies over the methodology of the people of Tawheed, the Sunnah and the Jamaa&#8217;ah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Second: Reporters of Hadeeth and Witnesses, if they are deemed Unreliable</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible to criticize these people according to the consensus of the Muslims. Rather, it is an obligation. This has been mentioned and related by An-Nawawee and Ibn Taimiyyah, may Allaah have mercy on both of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. So if the scholars of the science of al-Jarh wat-Ta&#8217;deel all agree upon criticizing a narrator, accusing him of lying or making gross mistakes. Or they say: &#8220;His hadeeth are to be rejected&#8221;, &#8220;He has baseless (weak) hadeeth&#8221; or what resembles that, then it is permitted for everyone doing research or quoting to quote or report that. And it is not required of him – in the least – to mention that person&#8217;s good qualities, not to mention doing research on all of his good qualities and then mentioning them!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. As for the narrators of which there is differing as to whether or not they are reliable or unreliable, or the narrators who were innovators, then:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The First Type:</b> To list the mention of that narrator&#8217;s criticism first and accept it without considering the sayings of those who declared him reliable would be abandoning something from the Religion and from what has been established on the leader of the Messengers (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>). And this is a great injustice and a negligence of something that is part of the Religion, which we are obligated to preserve. And it is a trust that falls on the neck of the scholars (i.e. it is their duty). So in this case, for the benefit of the Religion and for preserving it, and for the sake of giving a general benefit to the Muslims, we must seek to verify the reality of the matter. And we must weigh between the sayings of the scholars of Jarh wa-Ta’deel, taking that which is more established, whether it is from the criticism (<i>jarh</i>) or the approval (ta&#8217;deel).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this is for the purpose of bringing about this beneficial good, not because it is an obligation to make a balance for the condition of that individual who has been declared unreliable (between his good and bad qualities)! So if it is established that he is in fact unreliable after having done the research, it is permitted to relate his unreliability without mentioning this balancing (between those who criticized him and those who approved of him). And no scholar said that (mentioning) this (balancing) was obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the innovator, then if we are in the position of warning against the innovations, then we warn against him, mentioning his innovation only. And it is not an obligation on us to mention any of his good qualities. And if we are in the subject of narrating reports, then it is an obligation to mention his trustworthiness and honesty, if he was in fact trustworthy and honest, for the purpose of benefiting, attaining and preserving the narration. Not for any other purpose, such as the obligation of making a balance (<i>muwaazanah</i>) between his good and bad qualities, as some people claim! So it is not required on us to mention his generosity or his knowledge or his courage or his efforts and good manners, as well as all those other things that have no relation to the subject of narrating.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There were some among the Salaf who would reject the reports of the people of innovation and those who were accused (of weakness, lying).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) said: <b>&#8220;There was once a time in which when a man would say: &#8216;Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said…&#8217; our eyes would hasten to him and our ears would open wide (to listen) to him. But when the difficulties and disgrace befell the people, we did not take from the people except, for that which we knew.&#8221;</b> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Ibn Sireen said: <b>&#8220;The people never used to ask about the isnaad (chain of narration). But when the fitnah (afflictions) occurred, they began to say: &#8216;Name your men to us.&#8217; So the Ahl-us-Sunnah would be looked upon and their hadeeth would be accepted. And the people of innovation would be looked upon and their hadeeth would not be accepted.&#8221;</b> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The words of Ibn &#8216;Abbaas and Ibn Sireen indicate that this was the general view of the Salaf at the time, during the days of the last of the Companions and their Successors (Taabi&#8217;een) after them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps this existed in them due to their awareness of being in no need of the narrations of innovators. So they took this firm and solid stance against them. But when those who came after them were obliged to take the reports of the truthful ones among the innovators, they accepted it from them, only under certain conditions and stipulations, which consisted of taking the sound from it, while rejecting the crooked and corrupt aspects from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Abu Ishaaq Ibraaheem Ibn Ya&#8217;qoob Al-Jawzjaanee (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said: &#8220;Among them was he who deviated from the truth, yet still possessed an honest tongue. And his hadeeth would be widespread amongst the people since he was forsaken for his innovation but trusted with his narration. So concerning these individuals, I see no other alternative but to take from their hadeeth that which is (already) known, so long as his innovation does not become strengthened because of that.&#8221; [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>· Third: Those whom it is permissible to backbite:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nawawee (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said: &#8220;Chapter: What is permissible from backbiting:<br />
Know that backbiting is permissible for a legitimate and legislated reason, of which the allowance for doing it (the backbiting) would not be possible without it. And they are six reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First: Oppression</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second: Seeking help for changing an evil and returning a sinner to what is correct.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Third: When seeking a legal ruling</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fourth: Warning and advising the Muslims against an evil. This is in several perspectives, one of which is: Criticizing those who have been declared unreliable in narration and testimony. This is permissible according to the unanimous agreement of the Muslims. Rather it becomes obligatory for necessity&#8217;s sake…&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is up to the point where he said:<br />
&#8220;One last case is when one sees a student frequenting an innovator or a deviant, seeking to attain knowledge from him, and he fear that the student may be affected by that. Then it is upon him to advise him of the condition of that innovator, providing that his intention only be for the sake of advising…&#8221; [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His complete words will be mentioned later in its due place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>I say: So you see that he did not make it a condition for one to mention the good qualities of the person who is being warned against. And he did not say that it was an obligation to make a balance (between good and bad qualities) as those people make it an obligation, holding that if one abandons doing this balancing then it goes against the trust and it shuns equity and justice!</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said: &#8220;Someone once said to Ahmad Ibn Hanbal: ‘It is becoming difficult upon me to say, This person is such and such, and that person is such and such (i.e. criticizing them).&#8217; So he (Ahmad) said: &#8216;If you were to remain silent and I were to remain silent, then when will the ignorant person know the authentic from the weak?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>And since advising is obligatory with regard to (bringing) beneficial good in the Religion, specific and general:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such as is the case when reporters of Hadeeth have made mistakes or lied, as Yahyaa Ibn Sa&#8217;eed said: “I asked Maalik, Ath-Thawree, Laith Ibn Sa&#8217;ad – I think – and Al-Awzaa&#8217;ee about a man that was accused with regard to hadeeth, so they all said: ‘Convey (expose) his affair.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And such as is the case when the leaders of innovation from those who voiced sayings contrary to the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah and who performed worship contrary to that of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Then indeed, clarifying their condition and warning the ummah against them is an obligation based on the unanimous agreement of the Muslims.</b> This is such that it was once said to Ahmad Ibn Hanbal: “Is a man that fasts, prays and makes &#8216;Itikaaf more beloved to you or one that speaks out against the people of innovation?” So he (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said: “If he fasts, prays and performs &#8216;Itikaaf then that is only for himself, but if he speaks out against the innovators then indeed this is for all of the Muslims. And this is better.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh-ul-Islaam, Ibn Taimiyyah, said:<br />
“So he has explained that the benefit of (doing) this is general for all of the Muslims with regard to their Religion. And it is from the types of Jihaad that is done in the Way of Allaah. This is since cleansing Allaah&#8217;s way, His Religion, methodologies and legislation, and repelling the transgression of these individuals and having enmity against them is a collective obligation (<i>fard kifaayah</i>), according to the consensus of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if it were not for those whom Allaah placed to repel the harm of these individuals, the Religion would have indeed been corrupted. And the corruption experienced from these individuals is greater than the corruption experienced from being conquered by the enemies (of Islaam) during war.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For indeed, when these (enemies) conquered (the Muslim lands), they did not corrupt the hearts (of the Muslims) and what they contained from Religion, except for what came afterward. But as for these individuals, then they corrupt the hearts from the very start.” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he has lengthier words on this subject, which will be mentioned later.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the true methodology of the Salaf, not just a claim. And it is that methodology, which was followed by Ibn Taimiyyah and others from the sincere and honest Mujaahideen. And no criticism of a critic ever rebuked them, because they did this for the sake of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So where is it that making this kind of balancing (between good and bad qualities) must be a condition?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And where is the obligation for mentioning a person’s good qualities (when criticizing him), which we hear so often repeated unjustly in defense of those callers to misguidance?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather you have seen that Ibn Taimiyyah held that it was an obligation to refute the people of vain desires. And that it was from the different types of Jihaad in the Way of Allaah, since it is a way of cleansing His Religion, methodologies and legislation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Sayings of the Imaams concerning the People of Innovation and (Hadeeth) Narrators:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the scholars of Islaam have indeed spoken out against the people of innovation and the (weak) reporters. And they did not indicate in the least towards the obligation of making it a condition to create this type of balancing (between good and bad qualities). They authored books on the subject of al-Jarh wat-Ta&#8217;deel and books in support of the Sunnah and in refutation of the people of innovation and in criticizing them. And they wrote books on the defects (of hadeeth) and books on the fabricated ahaadeeth. They did not make it an obligation to make this type of balancing (<i>Muwaazanah</i>) at all. In fact, they even wrote books specifically with just Jarh (discrediting of reporters) in them, and limiting them to mentioning only those (narrators) that were declared unreliable or those who were spoken about with criticism. So they did not place this principle (of<i>Muwaazanah</i>) as a condition at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus Imaam Al-Bukhaaree – who was who he was with regard to possessing authority, religious characteristics, good manners and piety – wrote two books on weak narrators and he named them &#8220;<i>Al-Kabeer</i>&#8221; and &#8220;<i>As-Sagheer</i>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And An-Nasaa&#8217;ee wrote a book about the weak and rejected narrators called <i>ad-Du&#8217;afaa wal-Matrookeen</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-&#8216;Aqeelee wrote a book on weak narrators, which is known as <i>ad-Du&#8217;afaa</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Adiyy authored a book, <i>al-Kaamil</i>, about those who were criticized.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hibbaan wrote a book specifically about those who were declared unreliable called <i>al-Majrooheen</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Daaraqutnee and Ibn Ma&#8217;een have numerous books in which they answer questions concerning weak narrators and rejected reporters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haakim wrote a book called <i>ad-Du&#8217;afaa</i> (Weak Narrators), which is a chapter from his (bigger book) <i>al-Madkhal</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Nu&#8217;aim and Ibn Al-Jawzee wrote on this subject also.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Adh-Dhahabee wrote three books on those who were declared unreliable and those who were criticized, which are <i>al-Meezaan, al-Mughnee and Deewaan ad-Du&#8217;afaa</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr authored <i>Lisaan al-Meezaan</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, the books on al-Jarh wat-Ta&#8217;deel are filled with the discrediting of those who were declared unreliable (<i>majrooheen</i>), especially the books of Imaam Yahyaa Ibn Ma&#8217;een. So they did not make it a condition that this <i>Muwaaznah</i> (mentioning good and bad qualities) must be employed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Indeed, this methodology, which makes this <i>Muwaaznah</i> a condition, is indeed from that which results in: The discrediting returning back to the (past) scholars of Islaam, and their falling into the web of being accused with injustice and treachery (i.e. since they did not mention the good deeds of those whom they criticized). We seek Allaah&#8217;s refuge from a methodology that produces such kinds of consequences.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here, it is appropriate to mention some examples of the criticism of the Imaams (scholars) on some people, in which they just mentioned the criticism without showing any consideration to what they had from good qualities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Imaam Ahmad, may Allaah have mercy on him:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Al-Marwadhee (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said: &#8220;Abu &#8216;Abdillaah (Ahmad Ibn Hanbal) once mentioned Haarith al-Muhaasibee and said: &#8216;Haarith is the source of all this affliction – meaning the innovations of the views of Jahm. There is no calamity except for Haarith.'&#8221; [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Habeeb Ibn Abee Hilaal: Ahmad said of him: &#8220;He is rejected.&#8221; [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Habeeb Ibn Jahdar: Ahmad declared him a liar. [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Al-Hasan Ibn Dhakwaan: Ahmad said of him: &#8220;His ahaadeeth are forged&#8221; and in one report, he said: &#8220;He is of no significance.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Khaalid Ibn Yazeed Ibn &#8216;Abd-ir-Rahmaan Al-Hamdaanee: Ahmad said: &#8220;He is nothing.&#8221; [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Imaam Al-Bukhaaree, may Allaah have mercy on him:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. He said: &#8220;Jisr bin Farqad: Yahyaa Ibn ad-Darees and others reported about him that: &#8216;He is of no significance.'&#8221; [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Khaalid bin Iyaas al-Qurshee al-&#8216;Adawee al-Madanee: &#8220;He is nothing.&#8221; [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Dawood Ibn al-Muhbir: &#8220;His hadeeth are rejected.&#8221; [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Dawood Ibn &#8216;Ataa Abu Sulaimaan al-Madanee: &#8220;His hadeeth are rejected. Ahmad said: &#8216;I saw him and he was nothing.'&#8221; [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Imaam An-Nasaa&#8217;ee, may Allaah have mercy on him:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Ibraaheem Ibn &#8216;Uthmaan Abu Shyibah: &#8220;His hadeeth are rejected and he was from Koofah.&#8221; [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Ibraaheem Ibn Al-Hakam Ibn Abaan: &#8220;His hadeeth are rejected. He was from &#8216;Adan.&#8221; [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Ibraaheem Ibn Khatheem: &#8220;His hadeeth are rejected. He was from Baghdaad.&#8221; [20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Ibraaheem Ibn Yazeed Al-Khoozee: &#8220;His hadeeth are rejected. He was from &#8216;Adan.&#8221; [21]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: There are some Muslim sisters from Al-Mujamma`ah in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia who say in their question: When we try to stop the spread of Namimah (tale-bearing) and Ghibah (backbiting) among people, those whom we advise may insult and become mad at us. Are we sinful for making them angry, especially if they are parents? Should we prevent them or forget about matters that are not related to us? Please, advise!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>A: </b>Enjoining right and forbidding wrong are <strong>of the most important acts of worship</strong>, as Allah (Glorified be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 71" target="_blank" name="Thebelievers,menandwomen,are"></a><span style="color:#008000;">The believers, men and women, are Auliyâ’ (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people) Al-Ma‘rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm orders one to do), and forbid (people) from Al-Munkar (i.e. polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islâm has forbidden) </span>(<span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#222222;">Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 71)</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allah (Glorified be He) explains in this Ayah that enjoining right and forbidding wrong are of the <strong>qualities of the believing men and women</strong> where Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-&#096;Imran, 3: 110" target="_blank" name="You[truebelieversinIsl%C3%A2mic"></a><span style="color:#008000;">You [true believers in Islâmic Monotheism, and real followers of Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) and his Sunnah] are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind; you enjoin Al-Ma‘rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm has ordained) and forbid Al-Munkar (polytheism, disbelief and all that Islâm has forbidden), and you believe in Allâh</span>. (<span style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-`Imran, 3: 110)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="color:blue;" name="Whoever,amongyou,seessomething"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="24179" class="tip"></span><span style="color:#008000;">Whoever, among you, sees something abominable should rectify it with his hand; and if he has not strength enough to do it, then he should do it with his tongue; and if he has not strength enough to do it, (even) then he should (abhor it) from his heart, and that is the least of Faith</span>.</span> Related by Muslim in his Sahih (book of authentic Hadiths).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Ayahs and Hadiths on the obligation of enjoining right and forbidding wrong that rebuke those who neglect this duty. It is obligatory upon you and upon every believing man and woman to enjoin right and forbid wrong, <strong>even if those whom you invite become angry or insult you</strong>. Indeed, <strong>observing patience is obligatory</strong> as the Prophets (peace be upon them) and their followers did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) addressed His Prophet (peace be upon him) saying: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Ahqaf, 46: 35" target="_blank" name="Thereforebepatient(OMuhammad"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Therefore be patient (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) as did the Messengers of strong will .<span style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-Ahqaf, 46: 35</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> </span>Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Anfal, 8: 46" target="_blank" name="AndobeyAll%C3%A2handHisMessenger,"></a><span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;and be patient. Surely, Allâh is with those who are As-Sâbirûn (the patient)</span>. <span style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-Anfal, 8: 46</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) says about<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Luqman Al-Hakim (Luqman the wise) </span>that he said to his son: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Luqman, 31: 17" target="_blank" name="Omyson!Aqim-As-Sal%C3%A2t(perform"></a>&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">O my son! Aqim-As-Salât (perform As-Salât), enjoin (on people) Al-Ma‘rûf &#8211; (Islâmic Monotheism and all that is good), and forbid (people) from Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief in the Oneness of Allâh, polytheism of all kinds and all that is evil and bad), and bear with patience whatever befalls you</span>.<span style="color:#008000;">Verily, these are some of the important commandments (ordered by Allâh with no exemption). (<span style="color:#222222;">Surah Luqman, 31: 17)</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No doubt, reforming the society and preserving its integrity are achieved by following the instructions of Allah and then by enjoining right and forbidding wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The neglect of enjoining right and forbidding wrong is one of the greatest reasons for corrupting the society, tearing it apart, and exposing it to general punishment</span>. It is authentically reported from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) that he said: <a style="color:blue;" name="Ifactsofdisobediencearedone"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="24301" class="tip"></span><span style="color:#008000;">If acts of disobedience are done among people and they do not change them, Allah will soon punish them all.</span></span><span style="color:#008000;"> </span>(<span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#222222;">Al-Tirmidhy, Sunan, Book on trials, no. 2168; and Ibn Majah, Sunan, Book on trials, no. 4005.&#8217;)</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) warned His servants against following the example of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> the Children of Israel </span>in His saying: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5: 78" target="_blank" name="ThoseamongtheChildrenofIsrael"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Those among the Children of Israel who disbelieved were cursed by the tongue of Dâwûd (David) and ‘Isâ (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary). That was because they disobeyed (Allâh and the Messengers) and were ever transgressing beyond bounds. <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5: 79" target="_blank" name="Theyusednottoforbidoneanother"></a>They used not to forbid one another from Al-Munkar (wrong, evil-doing, sins, polytheism, disbelief) which they committed. Vile indeed was what they used to do</span>. (<span style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-Ma&#8217;idah, 5: 78-79)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah to guide all Muslims, rulers and subjects, to do this duty in the best form, to reform their conditions, and protect all people from the causes of His wrath. He is the All-Hearer, the All-Respondent.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah, Lord of all the Worlds, who ordered us to follow His Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  and to call to His Way, and may Allaah send praises and blessings of peace upon our Prophet Muhammad, and upon his family, his Companions, and those who truly follow them until the Day of Judgement. To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Calling to Allaah (<em>ad-Dawah ilallaah</em>) is the way of the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  and his followers, as Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ هَٰذِهِ سَبِيلِي أَدْعُو إِلَى اللَّهِ ۚ عَلَىٰ بَصِيرَةٍ أَنَا وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَنِي ۖ وَسُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَمَا أَنَا مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Say, Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</span><span style="color:#008000;"> ) , this is my way, I call to Allaah </span><span style="color:#008000;">(i.e. to the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, alone, with no partner) </span><span style="color:#008000;">upon certain knowledge &#8211; I, and those who follow me. I declare Allaah free and far removed from all that they associate as partners with Him, and I am free of those who worship anything else along with Him.” </span>[Soorah Yoosuf (12):108]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed calling to Allaah was the mission of all the Messengers and their followers, in order to bring the people out from darkness and into light, from unbelief (<em>kufr</em>) to true Faith (<em>eemaan</em>), from <em>shirk </em><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> to <em>tawheed </em><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>, and from the Fire to Paradise. This call to Allaah rests upon firm pillars, and is established upon foundations which are absolutely essential. If any of these are missing the <em>da’wah</em> will not be correct and will not produce the desired results &#8211; no matter how much effort is expended and time wasted &#8211; and this is the reality which we witness with regard to many of the present day calls which are not supported by those pillars and built upon those foundations. These pillars which support the correct <em>da’wah</em> are clearly shown in the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, and can be summarized as follows:</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>01.Knowledge of that which one calls to:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since the ignorant person is not suitable to be a caller (<em>daa&#8217;ee</em>). Allaah, the Most High, said to His Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  :</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ هَٰذِهِ سَبِيلِي أَدْعُو إِلَى اللَّهِ ۚ عَلَىٰ بَصِيرَةٍ أَنَا وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَنِي</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Say, O Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ), this is my way: I call to Allaah (to the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, alone, having no partner) upon certain knowledge (<em>baseerah</em>). I, and those who follow me.” </span>[Soorah Yoosuf (12):108]</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4"></a><em style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Baseerah&#8217;</em><span style="text-align:justify;"> is knowledge. So the caller is certain to face those who are scholars of misguidance, those who will attack him with doubts and futile arguments in order to rebut the truth. Allaah, the Most High, says,</span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَجَادِلْهُم بِالَّتِي هِيَ أَحْسَنُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And argue with them in a way that is better.” </span>[Soorah an-Nahl (16):125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said to Mu’aadh, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu</em>, <em>&#8220;You are going to a people from the People of the Book.&#8221;</em> So if the caller is not armed with sufficient knowledge for him to face every doubt and contend with every opponent, then he will be defeated in the first encounter, and will be halted at the beginning of the way.</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>02.Acting in accordance with that which he calls to:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So that he will be a good example &#8211; his actions attesting to his words, and leaving no excuse for the opponents of the Truth. Allaah, the Most High, said about His Prophet Shu&#8217;ayb that he said to his people:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا أُرِيدُ أَنْ أُخَالِفَكُمْ إِلَىٰ مَا أَنْهَاكُمْ عَنْهُ ۚ إِنْ أُرِيدُ إِلَّا الْإِصْلَاحَ مَا اسْتَطَعْتُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“I do not wish to forbid you from something and then do it myself. Rather I only wish to rectify you as far as I am able.” </span>[Soorah Hood (11):88]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, said to His Prophet Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  :</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ إِنَّ صَلَاتِي وَنُسُكِي وَمَحْيَايَ وَمَمَاتِي لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ &#8211; لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ ۖ وَبِذَٰلِكَ أُمِرْتُ وَأَنَا أَوَّلُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Say, O Muhammad, indeed my Prayer, my sacrifice, my living and my dying are all purely and solely for Allaah, Lord of all the Worlds. There is no share in any of that for other than Him. That is what my Lord ordered me, and I am the first of this nation to submit to Allaah as a Muslim.” </span>[Soorah al-An’aam (6):162-163]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ قَوْلًا مِّمَّن دَعَا إِلَى اللَّهِ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Who is better in speech than one who calls the people to Allaah and does righteous deeds?”<br />
</span>[Soorah Fussilat (41):33]<span style="color:#008000;"><br />
</span></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>03.Purity Of intention (<em>al-ikhlaas</em>):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such that the call is made purely and sincerely to seek the Face of Allaah (and seeking His Reward) &#8211; not for show, or repute, or status, or leadership, nor desiring worldly goals &#8211; since if any of these goals adulterate it, the call will not be for Allaah, rather it would then be a call for oneself or for the attainment of the worldly goal &#8211; as Allaah informs that His Prophets said to their people:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لَّا أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ أَجْرًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“I do not ask you for any reward for conveying this Qur&#8217;aan.”</span> [Soorah al-An’aam (6):90]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> لَا أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ مَالًا ۖ إِنْ أَجْرِيَ إِلَّا عَلَى اللَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“I do not ask you for any wealth for my admonition.” </span>[Soorah Hood (11):29]</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>04.Beginning with what is of primary importance, then with that which comes next in importance, and so on: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So firstly he calls to the correction of <em>‘aqeedah</em> (belief and creed) &#8211; by ordering that all worship is made for Allaah, and <em>shirk</em> is forbidden. Then ordering the establishment of the Prayer, and the payment of the <em>Zakah</em>, and that the obligatory duties are carried out and that forbidden things are avoided. This was the procedure followed by all of the Messengers, as Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“We sent a Messenger to every nation, ordering them that they should worship Allaah alone, obey Him and make their worship purely for Him, and that they should avoid everything worshipped besides Allaah.” </span>[Soorah an-Nahl (16):36]</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref11" name="_ftn11"></a><span style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“We did not send any Messenger before you, O Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , except that We revealed to Him that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah &#8211; so make all of your worship purely for Allaah.”</span>  [ Soorah al-Ambiyaa (21):25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore when the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   sent Mu&#8217;aadh to Yemen he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   said to him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;Indeed you are going to a people from the People of the Book &#8211; so let the first thing that you call them to be the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah. So if they accept that then inform them that Allaah has obligated five Prayers upon them in each day and night&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The best example of giving <em>da’wah</em> is to be found in the method of the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   &#8211; it is the most perfect and complete methodology &#8211; in that he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   remained in Makkah for thirteen years, calling the people to <em>tawheed</em> and forbidding them from shirk, before (he ordered) them with Prayer, <em>Zakaat</em>, Fasting and <em>Hajj</em>, and before he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   forbade them from usury, fornication, theft and murder.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>05.Patient perseverance in facing difficulties encountered in calling to Allaah, and in facing harm from the people:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For the path of <em>da’wah</em> is not strewn with roses, rather it is covered with hardships and hazards. The best example of this is the case of the Messengers, may Allaah’s Praises and Blessings of peace be upon them all, with regard to the harm and the mockery which they suffered from their people. As Allaah, the Most High, said to His Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Indeed Messengers were mocked before you, but those who mocked them were overtaken by the punishment which they made light of.” </span>[Soorah al-An’aam (6):10]</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref13" name="_ftn13"></a><span style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Indeed Messengers were also denied before you, but they bore these denials with patient perseverance, and they suffered harm until Our help came to them.”</span> [Soorah al-An’aam (6):34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise the followers of the Prophets are met with the same harm and hardship in proportion to their effort in calling to Allaah, following the example of those noble Messengers &#8211; may Allaah’s praises and purest blessings of peace be upon them.</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>06. The caller must be a person of good manners: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He must use wisdom in his call, since this will be an important reason for the acceptance of his call. Just as Allaah ordered His two noble Prophets, Moosa and Haaroon, that this was the manner in which they were to face the worst unbeliever upon the earth &#8211; Fir&#8217;awn (Pharaoh) &#8211; who claimed Lordship for himself. Allaah, the One free of all imperfections, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And speak mildly to him that he might accept admonition or fear and obey Allaah.”  </span>[Soorah Taa Haa (20):44]</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref15" name="_ftn15"></a><span style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, said to Moosa, </span><em style="text-align:justify;">‘alayhis-salaatu was-salaam</em><span style="text-align:justify;">:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Go to Fir&#8217;awn (Pharaoh) who has transgressed all bounds in his haughtiness, pride and disbelief, and say, ‘Will you not purify yourself from the sin of disbelief and be obedient to your Lord, so that you may submit fearfully to Him and obey Him?’” </span>[Soorah an-Naazi’aat (79):17-19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, said, concerning His Prophet Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“By the Mercy of Allaah you behaved with gentleness to them and had you been severe and harsh-hearted they would have left you and departed.” </span>[Soorah Aal-’Imraan (3):159]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Indeed you, O Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , are on an exalted standard of character.” </span>[Soorah al-Qalam (68): 4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“O Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , call mankind to the way prescribed by your Lord (i.e. Islaam) with the Revelation sent down to you (the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>), and admonish them with the examples and warnings which Allaah has provided in His Book, and argue with them in a way that is better.” </span>[Soorah an-Nahl (16):125]</p>
<hr />
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>07.The caller must remain firm in his expectation and hope for good:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He should not despair of the effectiveness of his call, or about the guidance of his people. Nor should he despair about the aid and the help of Allaah, even if a long time passes, and again he has the best example in this matter in the Messengers of Allaah. So the Prophet of Allaah, Nooh, <em>‘alayhis-salaatu was-salaam</em>, remained amongst his people for nine hundred and fifty years, calling them to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also when the harm and the hurt of the unbelievers became severe against the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , and the angel of the mountains came to him (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   asking if he wanted him to crush them between the two mountains, he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   replied, <em>&#8220;No, I wish to have patience with them, hopefully Allaah will produce from their offspring those who will worship Allaah alone, not giving any partner to Him.&#8221;</em>  [Reported by Bukhaaree (Eng. trans. 4/300 no.454) and Muslim (Eng. trans. 3/987 no.4425)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the caller lacks this attribute he will halt at the start of the path and feel discouraged and frustrated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The following is taken from the Book <strong>&#8216;Words of Advice Regarding Da&#8217;wah&#8217;</strong> from Shaykh &#8216;Abdul &#8216;Azeez ibn &#8216;Abdullaah ibn Baaz, compiled by Ziyaad ibn Muhammad as-Sa&#8217;doon</span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;The youth in any nation are the backbone which form the element of movement and vitality in society. They have the energy to bring about effective results&#8230;Usually a nation is never revived except due to the awareness and continuous enthusiasm of the youth. However, <strong>over-enthusiasm of the youth must be guided through the wisdom of the old</strong>. The youth must contemplate and look into the experiences of the old, they shouldn&#8217;t leave one for the other, but rather must preserve both of these qualities&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;<strong>The leaders and the scholars</strong> should exert efforts to enlighten and direct the population of Muslims and combat the efforts of the enemies of Islaam, by retaliating with their own efforts&#8230;The Muslim Ummah is an Ummah that has been entrusted with this religion and has the responsibility of conveying it. If we are careful to arm our boys and girls in Islamic societies, with knowledge, understanding and comprehension of Islamic Jurisprudence and accustom them to apply these things from a small age, then we will not fear, by the permission of Allaah, the Most High, as long as they continue holding onto the deen of Allaah, glorifying it, following its laws, and fighting that which contradicts it. And indeed their enemies will fear them&#8230;There are many verses in the Qur&#8217;aan which convey this message. The most important factor for us in fighting against the efforts of our enemies is <strong>raising and preparing a generation that knows the reality of Islaam</strong>. This can be achieved through guidance, taking care of the house and family, the method of educating them, the media and improvement of the society&#8230;In addition to this is the role of steering and guiding which needs to be taken by the Muslim leadership, persevering in beneficial work and continually reminding the people that which will benefit them and make the belief within them grow and flourish&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have read and heard in the news much about our Muslim brothers in communities where the majority of the population is non-Muslim. They are under authorities which impose restrictions on them, in practicing their religion and establishing their rites of worship, in order to distance them from their religion through compulsion and in other ways. We ask Allaah to firmly establish these Muslim minorities, and indeed all the Muslims upon Islaam and keep them safe from the plots of the enemies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that they are in a seriously vulnerable situation. Because of this situation, these <strong>Islamic minorities need all the help, co-operation and assistance</strong>, from the political sphere and this is specially from the Islamic governments from the Arab world as well as others that have special concern for Islaam. They have relations with these nations through sending delegates, dispatching messages and urging their embassies to act, or any other similar methods that will help their brothers in these regions. This will raise the morale of the minorities and make the (oppressing) nations realize that these minorities have brothers from the same faith, who are concerned about their situation and who follow their news. If Allaah, the Most High wills, the injustice and oppression will then be lifted from the Muslims when these oppressing nations and others begin to realize that behind the minority of Muslims is a nation which feels their pain and is interested in their affairs. As a result they will give into their requests and will raise their hand from oppressing them, especially when the majority of these nations need Islamic countries for their economic and other affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that the minority of Muslims everywhere are in urgent need of moral support and material help and resources to build mosques and schools that will help them in their Islamic work&#8230;So therefore it is obligatory upon every Muslim to help in accordance to his ability&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally I advise my Muslim brothers and sisters in Islaam, to have taqwa (fear) of Allaah in all matters and to be firmly established on His deen. They should fear Him wherever they are and be heedful of Him. They should take account of themselves, and be careful not to leave what Allaah has made obligatory upon them, nor to commit a sin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I advise them to <strong>co-operate upon Birr and Taqwa</strong> and to be sincere to each other and advise each other with truth and patience wherever they are. I also advise them to gain a deep and good understanding of the deen and attend circles of knowledge and question the scholars&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah to make those in charge of the Muslims and their leaders, upright and honest and to guide everyone to the straight path. I ask Him to make their leaders and their aides successful, and all their people to rule by the Islamic laws and rulings. And to be ruled by them, to be firmly established upon them, and to advise each other upon them, and to beware of and forbid that which contradicts them&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allaah, the Most High, and peace and blessings upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and his Companions.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The following is taken from &#8216;Al-Ibaanah&#8217; magazine (Vol 1, No.2, pp.7-8), being a translation of Ad-Da&#8217;wah Ilallaah wa Akhlaaqud-Du&#8217;aat (pp.37-43) by Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez bin Baaz:</span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory upon the da&#8217;ee (caller) to have <strong>ikhlaas</strong> (sincerity and purity of intentions and actions) for Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; <strong>neither desiring to show-off, nor desiring reputation, nor desiring the praises and the accolades of the people</strong>. Rather, the da&#8217;ee should only call to Allaah, seeking the Face of Allaah&#8230;and this is the most important etiquette and the greatest quality&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;call the people to Allaah upon <strong>&#8216;ilm (knowledge)</strong>, and not ignorance&#8230;so beware of calling to Allaah based upon ignorance, and beware of speaking without due knowledge. Indeed, ignorance destroys, it does not build; and it causes corruption, not reformation and correction&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the akhlaaq that it is necessary to have &#8211; O da&#8217;ee &#8211; is to be <strong>mild and forbearing</strong> in your da&#8217;wah, and being gentle and patient in it, as were all the Messengers &#8216;alayhimus-salaatu was-salaam. <strong>Beware of being hasty, harsh</strong> and strict in your da&#8217;wah, rather be patient, mild and gentle&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not turn the people away from the Deen due to your harshness, ignorance, or other such behavior. On the contrary, be mild, forbearing and patient; and be soft and pleasant in speech, so your words may have an effect upon the heart of your brother, or that it may have an effect upon the one you are addressing the call to. Then the people will better appreciate your call and invitation. So undue strictness causes people to become distant, not close; and it causes separation, not unity. Therefore, it is a must to be gentle, as the Messenger &#8216;alayhis-salaatu was-salaam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">Indeed gentleness does not enter into anything except it beautifies it, nor is it removed from anything except that it disfigures it</span>.&#8221; [Muslim 12/212].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he &#8216;alayhis-salaatu was-salaam also said:</p>
<p> &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">Whosoever is prevented from gentleness, is actually prevented from all good and excellence</span>.&#8221; [Muslim 16/145].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the necessary &#8211; or rather obligatory &#8211; etiquettes and qualities that a da&#8217;ee must possess is <strong>acting in accordance to what he is calling to</strong>, and being a righteous example of what is being called to. He should not call to do something and then not do it himself, nor call to leave something, whilst engaging in it himself. This is the condition of the losers &#8211; we seek Allaah&#8217;s refuge in this!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;the daa&#8217;ee should have an <strong>excellent character and praiseworthy conduct</strong>, <strong>being patient</strong> and inviting to patience. The daa&#8217;ee should be <strong>sincere in his da&#8217;wah</strong> and strive in spreading goodness to the people and keeping them away from falsehood. At the same time the daa&#8217;ee should <strong>supplicate for the guidance of others</strong>, saying: &#8220;O Allaah! Guide him, and grant him the ability to accept the truth.&#8221; So from the excellent manners of the da&#8217;ee is supplicating, guiding and being patient with the harms that come with this da&#8217;wah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet &#8216;alayhis-salaatu was-salaam was informed that the tribe of Daws had become disobedient he said:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;O Allaah! Guide Daws and bring them.&#8221;</span> [Bukhaaree 6/105]. So the daa&#8217;ee should&#8230;not despair, nor feel hopeless, nor say anything except good. He should not be harsh and strict, nor should he say a word which may cause aversion to the truth. However, if anyone commits aggression and oppression, then a different treatment is to be afforded to such people&#8230;if possible such a person should be imprisoned, or something similar to that &#8211; depending upon the nature of his opposition to the da&#8217;wah. However, as long as he causes no harm, then it is upon you to be patient and self-evaluating and to debate with him in ways that are best. If any personal harm was caused by such a person, then such harm should be borne with patience &#8211; as did the Messengers and those who followed them in goodness and righteousness, patiently bear such harms.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah to grant us all the well-being and the ability to convey this da&#8217;wah in a wise manner, that He corrects our hearts and our actions, and that He grants to us the understanding of the Deen and firmness upon it &#8211; making us of those who are guided and guiding others, righteous and teaching others righteousness. Indeed He is the Most Majestic, the Supreme, the Most Generous.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Saalih al-Uthaymeen<br />
Source: Al-Istiqaamah Magazine , Issue No.5 &#8211; Ramadân 1417H / January 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed all praise is for Allaah. We praise Him, we seek His help and we seek forgiveness from Him. And we seek refuge in Allaah from the evils within our own souls and our evil actions. Whomsoever Allaah guide, then none can misguide him; and whomsoever Allaah leaves to stray, then none can guide him aright. Indeed it is Allaah who sent His Messenger Muhammad <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> with the Guidance and the Religion of Truth, and he conveyed this Message, fulfilled his trust, fought <i>Jihaad</i> as it should be fought, and he did not die except that he left his Ummah (nation) upon a clear path, its night is like its day, and no one deviates from it except that he is destroyed. And may Allaah extol and send blessings of peace upon His Messenger Muhammad, and upon his Family, his Companions, and those who follow them in goodness. Then to proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So on this night, Sunday the 27th of Rabee&#8217;ul-Awwal 1417H &#8211; which corresponds to the 10th of August 1996CE &#8211; I am pleased to have this opportunity to say a few words to you. I hope that Allaah would bless them and that He would also bless our brothers in England; who have traveled from various places in order to here these few words on the telephone, for which they will receive &#8211; with the help of Allaah &#8211; that promise which has been mentioned by the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> when he said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever treads a path to seek knowledge, then Allaah would make easy for him a path to Paradise.&#8221;</i>1 So I ask from my brothers to accept these <i>wasaayah</i> (legacies and sincere advices) which I hope would be of benefit to them:-</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>THE FIRST LEGACY</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I advise you to have the <i>taqwaa</i> of Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; both in private and public. And <i>taqwaa</i> means that a person should stand firm upon the obedience of Allaah, doing what Allaah ordered him to do, and abandoning what He prohibited him from, starting with establishing the <i>Salaah</i> (Prayer) in their fixed and stated times, and in congregation, for those who are obliged to do so. Along with the five daily Prayers, you should also pray the <i>rawaatib</i> (stressed and recommended Prayers) which are connected to the five daily Prayers &#8211; and they are four <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> before the <i>Dhuhr</i> Prayer and two after it. Two <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> after the <i>Maghrib</i> Prayer. Two <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> after the <i>&#8216;Ishaa</i> Prayer. And two <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> before the <i>Fajr</i> Prayer. The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;There is no Muslim who Prays twelve optional rak&#8217;ahs from the non-obligatory Prayer every day, except that Allaah will build for him a house in Paradise.&#8221;</i>2 Likewise, you should pay the Zakaah; which is an obligatory amount taken from your wealth and given to the poor and the needy. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said to his Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Take charity from their wealth in order to purify them and to sanctify them by it.&#8221;</b> [Soorah a-Tawbah 9:103].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said to Mu&#8217;aadh ibn Jabal, when he was sending him to Yemen: <i>&#8220;And inform them that Allaah has obligated upon them to give charity from their wealth, to be taken from the rich and given to the poor.&#8221;</i>3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, one should fast in the month of Ramadaan, because Allaah has prescribed it for this Ummah, and one should make the <i>Hajj</i> (Pilgramage) and the <i>&#8216;Umrah</i> (Lesser Pilgramage) for whosoever has the ability to do so. These are the pillars of Islaam, after the first pillar which is the <i>Shahaadatain</i> (the two testimonies); to testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and to testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>THE SECOND LEGACY</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I advise my brothers that they should unify their ranks, and that they should be like a single body seeking to establish the Religion of Allaah, as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allaah has prescribed for you the same Religion which He prescribed to Noah, and that which We revealed to the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, and that which We prescribed to Ibraaheem, Moses and Jesus <i>&#8216;alayhimus-salaam</i>, saying: That you should establish the Religion by doing that which you were commanded with, and that you should not make any divisions in it.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ash-Shooraa 42:13].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus it becomes very clear that what is required from us &#8211; as it was required from the Prophets who were foremost in resolve &#8211; is to establish the Religion and not to make any divisions therein. So our Lord &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; ordered us to establish the Religion and not to make any divisions in it. O my brothers! Unite your ranks, and do not differ, since Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And do not dispute with each other, unless you loose courage and your power departs, but be patient. For indeed Allaah is with those who are patient.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Anfaal 8:46].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not label each other as being deviant, nor label each other as being sinners. If you see in any of your brothers that which is objectionable, then go to them and debate with them about this, until your word is unified, and thus cause the Ummah to remain united. None of you should try to slander his brother, since this will cause a great deal of enmity and hatred. Likewise, none of you should declare his Muslim brother to be a disbeliever, innovator or a sinner &#8211; since this is not from the nature of a Muslim.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>THE THIRD LEGACY</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also advise you &#8211; O brothers &#8211; to do those actions which will be the cause of love and affection to develop between you. Many people do not truly understand the Religion of Islaam. Indeed many people think that the Religion of Islaam includes certain bad traits &#8211; even though Islaam in reality objects to them &#8211; because some Muslims portray a false image of Islaam. Rather, the Religion of Islaam is a Religion of truthfulness, righteousness and justice. It is a Religion which calls for reconciling people. It is also a Religion which wages war against all bad actions and characteristics; such as lying, cheating, deception and transgressing upon others. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed Allaah enjoins upon you justice, kindness and the giving of good to relatives and near ones, and He prohibits you from all shameful and evil deeds, oppression and transgression. He admonishes you, in order that you may take heed and be reminded. And fulfil the Covenant of Allaah when you have made it, and do not break your oaths after you have confirmed them, and indeed you have appointed Allaah as your Guarantor. Indeed Allaah knows all what you do.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nahl 16:90-91].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O my brothers, <i>da&#8217;wah</i> (calling to Islaam) is to be done by your actions, as you are commanded to do it with your speech However, <i>da&#8217;wah</i> through actions will be more effective than <i>da&#8217;wah</i> which is merely done with speech. So I say again, that those who practice Islaam in a wrong manner, they will create a false understanding of Islaam in people&#8217;s view. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; has said about those who invite to what is correct, but do not practice themselves:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;O you who believe! Why do you say that which you do not do. It is most hateful to Allaah that you say that which you do not do.&#8221;</b> [Soorah as-Saff 61:2-3].</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>THE FOURTH LEGACY</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I advise you all to safeguard your time and to occupy yourselves in that which is beneficial. You should know that time is more precious than wealth, as Allaah &#8211; the Most Blessed, the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Until when death comes to him, he says: O my Lord! Give me respite so that I may then do righteous actions.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:333].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Time is such that when it departs it does not return, whereas wealth, when it departs, then it is possible to replace it. So time is of the utmost importance. This is why I advise you to safeguard your time, and to occupy yourselves in that which benefits. Keep away from <i>qeela wa qaal</i> (gossiping) &#8211; that so and so said such and such about this and that person &#8211; because the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said in an authentic narration: <i>&#8220;Indeed Allaah hates qeela wa qaal (gossip mongering), asking too many questions, and wasting one&#8217;s wealth.&#8221;</i>4 Unfortunately, many of the youths &#8211; after returning to the correct path, and uniting their hearts and unifying their word &#8211; have become disunited and fragmented into many factions, and this is due to the whisperings of Shaytaan amongst them and the disuniting of their word. So I advise the brothers to utilise your time in beneficial matters, and to keep away from <i>qeela wa qaal</i>. Indeed, time is like a sword; either you strike it, or it will strike you!</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>THE FIFTH LEGACY</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Call to Allaah with mildness, forebearance, and intending to rectify matters &#8211; not with harshness, nor intending to cause divisions. This is because Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said to His Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Call mankind to the way prescribed by your Lord, with wisdom, and admonish them with the examples and warnings that Allaah has provided in His Book, and argue with them in a way that is better.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nahl 16:125].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;By the mercy of Allaah you behaved with gentleness towards them. Had you been severe or harsh-hearted they would have left you and departed. So pass over their faults, and ask Allaah to forgive them, and consult them in the affairs.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aali-&#8216;Imraan 3:159].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, it is obligatory for the Believer to follow the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> in this, and to be mild and forebearing in calling to Allaah &#8211; the Most Blessed, the Most High &#8211; since it is authentically established from the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa aalihi wa sallam</i> that he said: <i>&#8220;Indeed Allaah is gentle and loves gentleness, and He gives due to gentleness that which He does not give due to harshness.&#8221;</i>5</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>THE SIXTH LEGACY</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Striving hard in acquiring knowledge, since that is the reason why you have left your cities and homes, and have left your family and friends. So it is upon you all to strive hard in gaining knowledge, and to study deeply &#8211; not merely to take an exam, rather it is for the knowledge itself. So strive hard in seeking knowledge. Finally, I ask Allaah that He enables us to utilise our time in a beneficial way, according to what Allaah &#8211; the Most Blessed, the Most High &#8211; has made us responsible for.</p>

<td style="text-align:justify;">The Da&#8217;wah Sharee&#8217;ah [1] has its basis in the Book and the Sunnah, and its starting point is love for Allaah and desire for His Jannah (Paradise) and fear of His (Hell)Fire, and the way which the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and his Companions (radiAllaahu anhuma) were upon. Its end result is with Allaah, <em>&#8220;Verily, you do not guide those whom you love, but Allaah guides whomever He wills.&#8221;</em> [2]</td>
<td style="text-align:justify;">The da&#8217;wah Siyaasiyyah (the political da&#8217;wah) [3] has its basis in politics, its starting point is ideological, and its means are the party and the organization and the jamaa&#8217;ah, and its end result is planned and designed.</td>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah as-Siyaasiyyah seeks to struggle for the promotion of parties (ahzaab) in the Muslim country to secure for itself a seat amongst the ranks of the [other] parties of the state. And they read the saying of Al-Haqq [Allaah], the Exalted: &#8220;And be not like those who divided and differed among themselves after the clear proofs had come to them.

<td style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah as-Siyaasiyyah is concerned with the achievement of appeasing the people through success in elections, and then exerting pressure on the government to meet their partisan demands, the most important of which is their reaching power (in the government)</td>

<td style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah ash-Sharee&#8217;ah looks to the Muslim for what is apparent, and that verily he is from among the Muslims, and you address him with the name of Islaam.</td>
<td style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah as-Siyaasiyyah looks to the Muslim for what is of benefit to the party (hizb) and the organization, so perhaps this is often the cause of their saying: &#8220;so and so is a secularist&#8221;, &#8220;so and so is a liberal&#8221;, &#8220;un-islaamic&#8221; , and so on.</td>

<td style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah ash-Sharee&#8217;ah, its leaders are the `Ulamaa ar-Rabbaaniyoon [7] recognized for their leadership and protection [of the Ummah], like : al-`Allaamah Muhammad Naasiruddeen al-Albaanee, al-`Allaamah `Abdul-`Azeez bin Baaz and al-`Allaamah Muhammad bin Saalih al-&#8216;Uthaymeen ? may Allaah have mercy upon them all -, so verily from them was an effect on hearts of the common Muslims and the students of knowledge.</td>
<td style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah as-Siyaasiyyah, its leaders are the politicians. They have no connection to knowledge, and they don&#8217;t have an effect on the hearts of the common Muslims, verily their effect is on the members of the Hizb (party) and the organization only.</td>

<td style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah ash-Sharee&#8217;ah calls them to believe and work in the da&#8217;wah to earn Allaah&#8217;s Pleasure, and not on the basis of gaining status and prestige.</td>
<td style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah as-Siyaasiyyah, some of its call is their making an affiliation to the hizb (party) a means to achievement, so it is their means for obtaining position and status.</td>

<td style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah ash-Sharee&#8217;ah, its callers spend from their own wealth, as embodied in the saying of the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wasallam) &#8220;And do not ask the people for anything&#8221; [8], and by that they are also in agreement with the Prophets (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wasallam) saying: &#8220;The upper hand is better than the lower hand.&#8221; [9]</td>
<td style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah as-Siyaasiyyah , its collection boxes and bank allotments and asking of the people is their constant, inseparable characteristic. Indeed it is from their most apparent traits. And they believe that these financial resources are a mainstay of their da&#8217;wah and their activities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:justify;">The people of Ad-Da&#8217;wah ash-Sharee&#8217;ah, their manhaj (methodology) is clear for them, so there is no secrecy and no covertness, so they are &#8220;upon al-Baydaa&#8217; (a clear proof), its night is like its day (in clarity).&#8221; [10]</td>
<td style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah as-Siyaasiyyah, their manhaj is secrecy and obscurity, and devoid of clarity in those matters that it is obligatory to make clear.</td>

<td style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah ash-Sharee&#8217;ah derives the steps of islaah (rectification) through the legislative texts [i.e. the Qur&#8217;aan and authentic Sunnah], and even if this rectification wasn&#8217;t achieved, so verily he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wasallam) said: &#8221; And a Prophet will come and there will not be anyone with him&#8221; [11]- meaning a Prophet from among the Prophets of Allaah will come on Yawm al-Qiyaamah (the Day of Resurrection) and not one person believed in him, and he didn&#8217;t change the condition of any one from the individuals of his society which he was sent amongst, so this Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wasallam) called to rectification, and no one from his people answered him.</td>
<td style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah as-Siyaasiyyah derives the steps of islaah through achievement of forming the political decision, and through &#8220;the aim justifies the means&#8221;.</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah ash-Sharee&#8217;ah, its flags and signs are known by their scholastic efforts through exerting themselves to spread the correct `Aqeedah and the Sunnah.</td>
<td style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah as-Siyaasiyyah, its flags and signs are manifest and known by the virtues of the Jamaa&#8217;ah and the Hizb and its wealth and its influence, so if you go back in your memory through history, you know that its leaders who were well known, they didn&#8217;t reach the position which they reached except through the Jamaa&#8217;ah, the Hizb, and its wealth. I will give you an example to make clear the difference between the true flags of al-Haqq (the truth) and other than them:So al-`Allaamah Naasiruddeen al-Albaanee, verily love of him is fixed firmly in the hearts of al-`Aalaameen, and his leadership in `uloomud-Deen (the sciences of the Religion) is firmly established through his strength and steadfastness in sharee&#8217; (legislated) knowledge. And there was no charity to publish his books, and no committee to pay for his expenses, no organization to sponsor his residency visa, and no hizb which promotes his efforts, nor media to publish his essays and show his pictures. On the contrary, his establishment in knowledge was his sign, so he was able to face the nations and the people with his knowledge and understanding, without any organization or leader, and no support except through the Tawfeeq of Allaah. Therefore it was his knowledge which made his leadership a duty upon him in all areas. Noble reader, the saying goes:&#8221;And with its opposite, things are made known.&#8221;</td>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] [TN]: The Da&#8217;wah of the political groups and parties and the political activists, like Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen, Jam&#8217;iyyah Ihyaa&#8217; at-Turaath, and other than them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Soorah Aal-`Imraan (3):103<br />
[5] Soorah Aali-`Imraan (3):105<br />
[6] Sooratul-Mu&#8217; minoon (23):53</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] [TN]: Those scholars known for their cultivating the people upon the correct belief, methodology and understanding of the Deen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] Saheeh Muslim (1043) and others from `Awf ibn Maalik. Saheeh. See Saheeh al-Jaami (2646)<br />
[9] Saheeh al-Bukhaaree (1472) and Saheeh Muslim (1033, 1035, 1036).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[TN]: The narrations that show that the way of Ahlus-Sunnah is not asking the people for their filth (their sadaqaat) are many and clear. So those who ascribe themselves to the way of the Salaf and want to call to the Haqq, they do not establish their da&#8217;wah upon asking for the peoples money. Rather they establish their da&#8217;wah upon hard work and spending upon their da&#8217;wah from their own pockets. And Shaykh Ahmad as-Subay&#8217;ee explains, you will not find even one athar (narration) from the Companions, nor the Taabi&#8217;een, nor the Atbaa&#8217;ut-Taabi&#8217; een, nor those who followed after them where they stood up in the masjid to ask the people for their sadaqaat ý not one! And if this had been their way and their guidance, they would have done it. And from those matters which distinguish the Da&#8217;watus-Salafiyyah from all the other da&#8217;waat is that we take the understanding of the Book and the Sunnah from these aathaar (narrations) from the Salaf of this Ummah, contrary to the political groups and parties.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] Ahmad (4/126), Ibn Maajah (43), and al-Haakim (1/96). Al-`Allamah al-Albaanee declared it Saheeh in Saheeh al-Jaami&#8217; (4369).<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Transcription of the above Audio</strong> :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then we travelled to &#8216;Kassala&#8217; in Sudan.<br />
It was Maasha Allaah.<br />
We did Da&#8217;wah there.<br />
Alhamdolilah.<br />
We talked and Allaah benefited the people there.<br />
It is a small town, so we visited all of the Masaajid there.<br />
They said :<br />
&#8220;There is only one masjid that we have not visited yet.<br />
And it is upon the Tijaanee methodology.<br />
And it is a Masjid that we have never been able to enter.&#8221;<br />
Because they are very stubborn.<br />
I said :<br />
&#8220;We will go there and ask permission.<br />
If they permit us to speak, we will speak.<br />
If they do not permit us to speak, we will leave.<br />
And that is up to Allaah.<br />
We did not come here with force.&#8221;<br />
So we went there and the Imaam led the prayer.<br />
After the prayer, I gave him salaam.<br />
[And said to him] :<br />
&#8220;Do you mind if I give a small talk to these brothers?&#8221;<br />
So he said : &#8220;Go ahead.&#8221;<br />
So I spoke, may Allaah bless you, and I called to Allaah.<br />
And I called to Tawheed and I called to the Sunnah and so on.<br />
And at the same time I refuted the mistakes.<br />
And the misguided beliefs that were present.</p>
<p>Until I reached the hadeeth of A&#8217;isha where she said:<br />
&#8220;3 things, if anyone were to tell them to you, Tthen he has lied upon Allaah a great lie.<br />
Whoever tells you that Muhammad has seen his Lord has lied a great lie upon Allaah.<br />
And whoever says that Muhammad, knows the future, has lied a great lie against Allaah.<br />
And whoever claims that Muhammad did not relate the whole religion to the people has lied against Allaah a great lie.<br />
[Bukhaaree and Muslim]</p>
<p>So he got up and said :<br />
&#8220;By Allaah, Muhammad saw his Lord with his own two eyes that are on his head.&#8221;<br />
So I said to him :<br />
&#8220;May Allaah reward you with good.<br />
As for A&#8217;isha, [radiAllaahu anhaa], she is the most knowledgeable of his affairs.<br />
And she said that he did not see his Lord.<br />
And By Allaah, if he had seen his Lord he would have told her.&#8221;<br />
He kept on talking, so I said to him :<br />
&#8220;Wait until I have finished what I have to say.<br />
And then you can ask whatever you like.<br />
That which I know, I will answer.<br />
That which I do not know, I will tell you : Allah knows best.&#8221;<br />
I left him and I continued speaking.<br />
And I was not really sure if he stayed or if he left.<br />
Slowly I heard one of the men in the crowd saying :<br />
&#8220;By Allaah, what this &#8216;Zuul&#8217; is saying is the truth&#8221;<br />
Zuul means man, in Sudan.<br />
Slowly he said :<br />
&#8220;By Allaah, what this man is saying is the Truth&#8221;<br />
I used : &#8220;Allaah said&#8230;.&#8221; and &#8220;The Messenger of Allaah said&#8230;.&#8221;<br />
May Allaah bless you.<br />
Then the athaan of Isha was called and I finished my speech.<br />
Then the Iqaamah was called.<br />
And the people started pushing me to lead the prayer.<br />
So I said :<br />
&#8220;Never, never. The Imaam should lead the prayer.&#8221;<br />
They said :<br />
&#8220;By Allaah, you lead the prayer!&#8221;<br />
So I said &#8220;OK&#8221; and I led the prayer.<br />
After the prayer, the youth from Ansar us-Sunnah and myself left the masjid.<br />
And I asked :<br />
&#8220;Where is the Imaam?&#8221;<br />
They said &#8220;They kicked him out!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Who kicked him out!?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;His own Jamaa&#8217;ah kicked him out!&#8221;<br />
By Allaah, this is what happened!<br />
But if one was to come to them with this foolishness and insult them, meaning the Tijaaniyyah, the Burhaaniyyah and so forth, If one was to say this, who would accept it!?<br />
But if you came to them with wisdom and kindness.<br />
May Allaah bless you.<br />
Allaah benefited them!<br />
Allaah benefited them with this!<br />
So O brothers, use beneficial knowledge.<br />
And strong irrefutable evidences.<br />
And beneficial wisdom in your Da&#8217;wah.<br />
And it is upon you to have all of the beautiful manners that the Book Of Allaah and the Prophet of Guidance encouraged[Sallallaahu Alaihi Wa sallam]<br />
Because they are the tools of Victory.<br />
And they are the tools of Success.<br />
And believe me when I say that the Sahaabah did not spread Islaam and have it enter into the hearts of the people, except with Wisdom and their character, more then with the sword.<br />
Because the one enters Islam by sword will probably not remain steadfast.<br />
The one who entered Islaam by way of knowledge and evidence&#8230;.He is the one who will have strong faith.<br />
So it is upon you to follow these good ways.<br />
And it is upon you to be serious about knowledge.<br />
As it is upon you to be serious about giving Da&#8217;wah to Allaah.<span style="color:#000099;"><span style="font-size:large;"><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms, sans-serif;"><span style="color:#888888;"><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Responsibility in Knowledge and Da’wah</strong></span></span></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Alî b. Abî Tâlib</strong> – Allah be pleased with him – said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Narrate to people what they can understand; do you want Allah and His Messenger to be disbelieved?</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Quoted by Al-Bukhârî, Al-Sahîh, Chapter about a person preferring some people with certain knowledge to the exclusion of others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Ibn Hajr said in Fath Al-Bârî,</strong> “[In this narration] there is evidence that ambiguous knowledge should not be mentioned amongst the general public.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Shaykh Muhammad b. Sâlih Al-‘Uthaymîn </strong>– Allah have mercy on him – explained this very important and often misunderstood point beautifully. After mentioning the narration of ‘Alî, he states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is therefore an aspect of wisdom in da’wah (calling others to Allah) that you should not surprise people with things they are not able to comprehend. Rather, you should call them in stages, bit by bit until their minds settle…”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He goes on to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“[The statement of ‘Alî] ‘Do you want Allah and His Messenger to be disbelieved?’ is a rhetorical question, posed as a criticism of such behavior. It means: by narrating to people things they cannot understand do you want Allah and His Messenger to be disbelieved? This is because in such cases when you say, “Allah said, and His Messenger said” they will say you have lied if their minds cannot comprehend what you are saying. Here, they are not disbelieving Allah and His Messenger, but they are disbelieving you because of this speech that you have attributed to Allah and His Messenger. Thus they will end up disbelieving Allah and His Messenger – not directly – but by way of the one who transmits this knowledge (i.e. you).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now if it is said: Should we stop telling people things they cannot understand even if they need to know? The answer is: no, we do not leave this knowledge altogether, but we should tell them in a way that they will be able to understand. This is done by telling them stage by stage, bit by bit until they can accept the speech we want them to know and they can feel comfortable with it. We do not abandon knowledge that people cannot understand and just say ‘this is something they will reject or dislike so we will not speak about it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same is the case with acting upon a Sunnah that people are not used to and which they might find objectionable. We should act by this Sunnah, but only after informing people about it, such that they will be able to accept it and feel comfortable about it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We learn from this narration (of ‘Alî) that it is important to employ wisdom in calling to Allah, and that it is incumbent upon anyone who calls to Allah to consider the level of understanding of those he is inviting, and that he should put everyone in their proper place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Majmû’ Fatâwâ Ibn ‘Uthaymîn Vol.10 p140.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Bismillaah Al-Hamdulillaah wa salatu wa salaamu &#8216;ala rasulullaah<br />
Amma-ba&#8217;d</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Call is to Correct What People Have Corrupted<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>, by Shaykh Muhammad al-Anjaree (hafidhahullaah Ta&#8217;aala)</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">[The following are notes &#8211; not verbatim &#8211; from this highly beneficial Scholarly Lesson and Advice]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">After beginning with the name of Allaah, and praising Allaah, and asking Allaah to send His peace and security upon the noblest of His Messengers, our Prophet Muhammad, then Shaikh Al-Anjaree greeted the Muslims with the greeting of Islaam &#8211; as-salamu &#8216;alaykum wa rahmatullaahi wa baarakatu &#8211; before beginning:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Allaah said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:x-large;color:#000000;">كُنْتُمْ خَيْرَ أُمَّةٍ أُخْرِجَتْ لِلنَّاسِ تَأْمُرُونَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَتَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ الْمُنكَرِ وَتُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>You [true believers in Tawheed, and real followers of Prophet Muhammad, and his Sunnah] are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind; you enjoin Al-Ma&#8217;roof (Tawheed and all that Islaam has ordained) and forbid Al-Munkar (polytheism, disbelief and all that Islaam has forbidden), and you believe in Allaah&#8230;</strong> (Aali &#8216;Imran, ayah 110)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Allaah, Ta&#8217;aala, said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:x-large;color:#000000;">وَلْتَكُنْ مِنْكُمْ أُمَّة ٌ يَدْعُونَ إِلَى الْخَيْرِ وَيَأْمُرُونَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ وَأُوْلَائِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Let there arise out of you a group of people inviting to all that is good (Islaam), enjoining Al-Ma&#8217;roof (Tawheed and all that Islaam orders one to do) and forbidding Al-Munkar (polytheism and disbelief and all that Islaam has forbidden). And it is they who are the successful.</strong> (Aali &#8216;Imran, ayah 104)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Allaah, Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;aala, has made the goodness of this nation in its commanding of the good and forbidding of the evil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Commanding the good means commanding with the Religion, with Tawheed &#8211; that Allaah be singled out with worship &#8211; and the correct Manhaj and the Sunnah. And forbidding the evil means that they forbid Shirk, Bid&#8217;ah, and sins, and whatever is contrary to this Religion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">So the good comes about with enjoining of the good and forbidding the evil. And this is what Allaah, Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;aala, commanded us with. So this Ummah is commanded to enjoin the good, and this was the duty carried out by the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and the Sahaba (radiallaahu Ta&#8217;aala &#8216;anhum), who called to good and called to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The Sahaaba called to good, and they likewise forbade all evil, all that the Religion prohibits, such as Shirk, Bid&#8217;ah, and the rest of the evil &#8211; everything that runs contrary to this Deen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The flag-bearers, banner-carriers of the Sunnah are the carriers of this Religion, and they are those who command with the Sunnah and forbid Bid&#8217;ah, and the sahaaba (radiallaahu Ta&#8217;aala &#8216;anhum) carried out this role and were the carriers of this banner, and this is clear from their narrations.*</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">It is reported that Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (radiallaahu &#8216;anhumma) said: <strong>&#8220;By Allaah, I do not think that anyone will be more pleased with my death than Shaytaan.&#8221;</strong> It was said, &#8220;How is that?&#8221; He replied, <strong>&#8220;An innovation is invented in the East or the West, and a man brings it to me. When it reaches me, I crush it with the Sunnah.&#8221; </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">They [the Sahaaba] called to revival of the Sunnah, and from forbidding evil is to demolish innovations (heresies).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">So when it reached &#8216;Umar ibn al-Khattab (radiallaahu &#8216;anhu) that Sabeegh ibn &#8216;Asl had come up with some tafseer of the Qur`an off the top of his head, from Soorat an-Nazi&#8217;at, &#8216;Umar told him: <strong>If you were <em>MuHaliqqa</em> (bold-headed, like the Khawaarij), I would have cut off your neck.</strong> Meaning (he would have done that) to preserve the religion, the Sunnah, the methodology of Prophethood. This was their eager concern.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Ordering the good &#8211; the Sunnah &#8211; and forbidding evil &#8211; bid&#8217;ah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) described these people of truth, these people of strangeness in his saying: <strong>Glad tidings is for the strangers. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">He was asked: Who are the strangers? He (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>They are a righteous people amongst many evil people. Those who disobey them will be more than those who obey them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">So these are the strangers. The sahaba (radiallaahu &#8216;anhum) were like this. As was indicated by the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) in his saying: <strong>Islaam began as strange, and it will return strange as it began. So glad tidings to the strangers.</strong> [Saheeh Muslim, no. 145] He was asked: Who are the strangers? He (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>They are a righteous people amongst many evil people. Those who disobey them will be more than those who obey them. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Obey them in what?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Meaning those who obey them in their call to the Sunnah and clarifying the truth and seeking to kill off &#8211; refute &#8211; bid&#8217;ah and falsehood.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>Whoever revives a Sunnah from my Sunnah, and the people act upon it, then for him will be the reward for all those who act on it.</strong> [Ibn Majah]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">This is the Sunni who commands the Sunnah &#8211; commands the good &#8211; and forbids the evil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Whoever revives a Sunnah &#8211; from the Prophet&#8217;s Manhaj, his path &#8211; and calls to the Sunnah, and the people act on it, so he receives the reward of all those who act on it without their reward reducing. This Sunni is the one who enjoins the good and forbids the evil. And this is a bounty from Allaah, Who bestows this upon whomever He wishes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">And opposite to this: <strong>Whoever calls to bid&#8217;ah, he will incur the sin of all those who act on it, without their sins reducing.</strong> So therefore, it is a right upon the people of the Sunnah &#8211; callers to the truth &#8211; to carry out this role, and call to the Sunnah, and strive to uproot innovation (heresies).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The true person of the Sunnah strives to uproot bid&#8217;ah. A person truly upon the Sunnah calls to the revival of the Sunnah. A person of bid&#8217;ah calls to revival of bid&#8217;ah. The Sunni encourages people upon the Sunnah and upon crushing bid&#8217;ah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">It has been reported that the Mesenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said about the strangers: <strong>They will be a people who rectify what the people have corrupted from my Sunnah after me.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Imam at-Tirmidhi said it is hasan-saheeh. [Although some scholars of hadeeth have said it is not authentic,] the meaning of this is correct. The strangers are those who rectify what people have corrupted from the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) after his passing. So, this is the description of the strangers, that they rectify what the people have corrupted. <em>Fasad</em> (corruption) comes about as a result of bid&#8217;ah &#8211; no doubt. Bid&#8217;ah results in corruption &#8211; no doubt!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">A person upon the Sunnah calls to the Sunnah, and seeks to benefit the people with what is beneficial in their beliefs, sayings, actions, and methodologies, and strives to rectify what people have corrupted.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">So these are <em>Al-Ghuraabah</em> (the strangers). They are the people of the Sunnah, those who revive the Sunnah of the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and who revive the Prophet&#8217;s Methdology, and bring back to life what has been killed from his Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Because in the hadeeth, the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>Whoever revives a Sunnah from my Sunnah.</strong>.. This being the opposite of killing off a Sunnah.** Then the Sunni comes and he revives it, brings it back to life (after learning it, he practices it, becomes firm upon it, and teaches it to others). This is their role.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">And this is why Imam Ahmad (rahimahullaah Ta&#8217;aala) said about them (those who call to the Sunnah and its revival) in the introduction of his book <strong><em>Ar-Rad &#8216;alal Jahmiyyah</em></strong> (The Refutation upon the Jahmiyyah):</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;<strong>All praise is for Allaah, Who leaves a group after the Messengers from amongst the people of knowledge who negate the changes, distortions of those who go to the extreme. And the changes of those who are ignorant. [This group] is those who call people from misguidance to guidance, and are patient upon harm. How many are they who have gone astray whom they helped bring back to guidance? How many are those [whose eeman] have been killed by Iblees whom they have helped give life to again? How beautiful is their effect upon the people, and how ugly and vile is the effect of the people upon them?</strong>&#8220;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Imam Ahmad described these callers to the Sunnah by saying about them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>How beautiful is their effect upon the people, and how ugly and vile is the effect of the people upon them?  </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">How ugly is the effect of those who raise the banner of bid&#8217;ah upon the people of the Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The people of the Sunnah are the strangers, those who repel the false distortions, the false tafseer, and refute the changes. The strangers correctly interpret and understand the Qur`an and Sunnah, and the Names and Attributes of Allaah.</strong> <strong>Those who carry this duty are the Awliyya` of Allaah, the beloved and obedient servants of Allaah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah Ta&#8217;aala) said: &#8220;<strong>Those who establish the duty of preserving what was inherited from the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) &#8211; and safeguard it from any addition or deletion &#8211; <span style="font-size:medium;">are from the greatest of the awliyya` of Allaah</span>; they are of the beloved servants of Allaah and His party.</strong>&#8220;</span></p>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif;color:#000000;">Pay attention to what Ibn Taymeeyah said: &#8220;<strong>Those who establish the duty of preserving what was inherited from the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) &#8211; and safeguard it from any addition or deletion &#8211; <span style="font-size:medium;">are from the greatest of the awliyya` of Allaah</span>; they are of the beloved servants of Allaah and His party.</strong>&#8220;</span></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">So this is the duty and role of Ahlus-Sunnah, who revive what Ahlul-Bid&#8217;ah have killed off.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">If a Sunni is asked: what do you call to?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">He [the Sunni] says: I call to the religion of the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) &#8211; reviving it and reviving the Prophet&#8217;s Sunnah &#8211; and to crushing Bid&#8217;ah so as to make the truth clear from innovations (bid&#8217;ah), distortions and false interpretations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Allaah, The Most High, consoled His Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam):</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:x-large;color:#000000;">وَلَقَدْ كُذِّبَتْ رُسُل ٌ مِنْ قَبْلِكَ فَصَبَرُوا عَلَى مَا كُذِّبُو</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Verily, (many) Messengers were denied before you (O Muhammad), but with patience they bore the denial&#8230;</strong> (Al-An&#8217;aam, ayah 34)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">This shows us that this path that the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and his companioions proceeded upon is a path that requires patience. So, oh person who carries the banner of the Sunnah, you need to remember this and that you are a stranger.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">You will have to bear harm, just as Imam Ahmad (rahimahullaah) said: <strong>How beautiful is their effect upon the people, and how ugly and vile is the effect of the people upon them?  </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The person upon this path needs sabr. <em>The people need from you that you have sabr.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Imam Ibnul Qayyim (rahimahullaah) said: &#8220;<strong>Whoever proceeds upon the Straight Path that the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and his companions were upon, let him make himself get used to trouble from the ignoramuses and Ahlul-Bid&#8217;ah, such as them belittling him, attacking him, warning against him</strong>.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">This is the path of the <em>ghuraba</em>, the strangers, Ahlus-Sunnah, those who want to revive what the people kill off from the Manhaj of Ahlus-Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">So you need to have <em>sabr</em> upon that. You will receive attacks from Ahlul Bid&#8217;ah, which is normal that it will happen, just as Imam Ahmad, Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibnul Qayyim (rahimahumullaah) said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>Ahead of you there lie days of patience, during which being patient will be like grasping a hot coal&#8230; </strong>***</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Meaning the one who clings to the Sunnah, the methodology of the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and his companions (radiallaahu &#8216;anhum).</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 4: Has the gradual communication of the Islamic legislation ended by the completion of delivering the Message? Is it permissible for a Da`y (caller to Islam) to tell a new Muslim about the commands and the prohibitions of Islam gradually, so that they are not shocked?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is permissible to convey the Message of Islam to others gradually, acting upon the Hadith of Mu`adh when he was sent by the Prophet (peace be upon him) to Yemen. The Six Hadith Compilers (Al-Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhy, Al-Nasa&#8217;y, and Ibn Majah) reported from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) told Mu`adh ibn Jabal when he sent him to Yemen: You are going to people of a (Divine) Book. So when you come to them call them to testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. If they obey you in that, inform them that Allah has enjoined on them five Salahs (to be offered) in every day and night. If they obey you in that, inform them that Allah has enjoined on them Sadaqah (obligatory charity) to be taken from the rich among them and given to the poor among them. If they obey you in that, beware (not to take as obligatory charity) their precious property! And fear the supplication of a wronged person, for there is no barrier between them and Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Islamic legislation, it has come to an end by the death of the Prophet (peace be upon him), as Allah (Exalted be He) says: This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islâm as your religion.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q: What is the ruling on reading the Bible?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The Divine Books revealed before the Qur&#8217;an now include many distortions, alterations, and omissions, as Allah says in the Qur&#8217;an.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is not permissible for Muslims to read any of these Books, unless they have deep-rooted knowledge of the Din (religion) and want to explain the distortions and inconsistencies in these books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://www.alifta.com/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Page&amp;PageID=970&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=7" target="blank" rel="nofollow">Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta&#8217; </a><br />
`Abdul-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz ,`Abdul-Razzaq `Afify , `Abdullah ibn Ghudayyan , `Abdullah ibn Qa`ud</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q: What is the ruling on a Muslim who reads the Bible or swears by it?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is not permissible for a Muslim to read the Bible as it has almost entirely undergone interpolation. Even the parts of the Bible that have undergone no interpolation are needless as the Qur&#8217;an replaces them. This ruling is not applicable to scholars who need to read it in order to refute the claims of the People of the Book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible either to swear by the Bible in its present form as it has undergone partial interpolation and distortion, and thus cannot be the words of Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Excerpt from <a href="http://www.alifta.com/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Page&amp;PageID=9911&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.alifta.com/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Page&amp;PageID=9911&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=7</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ruling on Reading the Tawrah and the Injil by Shaykh Ibn Baz rahimahullah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q &#8211; Is it permissible for me as a Muslim to leaf through the Injil (Gospel) and read in it, just to have a look, and not for any other purpose? Does believing in the Divine Books mean believing in their being revealed by Allah or believing in their content? Please enlighten me, may Allah enlighten you!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Every Muslim should believe that these books: the Tawrah (Torah), the Injil (Gospel), and the Zabur (Psalms), were revealed by Allah, and that Allah revealed them to His Prophets. Included in these Books were: commands, prohibitions, admonitions, warnings, stories of ancient events, information on Paradise and Hell, and other matters. However, Muslims should not use these books as they have been distorted and altered, and they should not own copies of them, or read in them. They pose a danger in that they may lead Muslims to deny a truth or believe in a falsehood, because they have been distorted, altered, and falsified by the Jews, the Christians and others; whereas Allah has made us stand in no need of them, by the great Book He revealed: the Noble Qurýan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) saw a portion of the Tawrah in the hands of &#8220;Umar, so he became angry and said: Are you confused about it, O Ibn Al-Khattab? By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, I brought it to you white and pure. And he added, &#8221;By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, if Musa (Moses) were alive, he could not but follow me. &#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We just want to advise you, and others, not to take anything from the Tawrah, the Injil, and the Zabur, not to acquire copies of them, and not to read in them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, if you have any of them, bury or burn it, because the truth that was in them has been given, instead, in the Qurýan; they are now so mixed with changes and distortions, which are all condemned and false. Therefore, the believer must be on his guard against this, and beware of reading these books for they may lead to belief in a falsehood or denial of a truth. To be safe, it is better to just dispose of these books, either by burying or burning them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowledgeable Muslim scholars are permitted to look at these books to refute the allegations of the opponents of Islam from among the Jews and the Christians. This was what the Prophet (peace be upon him) did when the Jews denied that stoning of adulterers was the punishment prescribed in the Tawrah, so he asked for a copy of the Tawrah until they finally acknowledged it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason for this is that the scholars, who are knowledgeable about the Shariýah (Islamic law), may need to read the Tawrah, the Injil, and the Zabur for the sake of Islam, to refute allegations from the opponents of Allah and show the merits of the Qurýan and the truth and guidance it contains. As for ordinary people, they do not need to do this. So, if they have any of these books, they should bury them in a pure place or burn them to avoid misleading anyone through them.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q: Is it permissible for Muslims to  read the Injil (Gospel) to know how far it is distorted?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is not permissible for a believer to read the Tawrah (Torah) and Injil, even though they were distorted and changed and Allah (may He be Glorified) has given Muslims what is best, which is the Noble Qur&#8217;an that has been preserved from any change or distortion. Moreover, the Shari`ah (Islamic law) has abrogated all other earlier laws, and it is the perfect, the greatest, and the most useful to the Servants of Allah. Allah (may He be Exalted) states:Surah Al-Ma&#8217;idah, 5: 3 This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islým as your religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (may He be Glorified) addressed His Prophet (peace be upon him) stating:Surah Al-Jathiyah, 45: 18 Then We have put you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) on a (plain) way of (Our) commandment [like the one which We commanded Our Messengers before you (i.e. legal ways and laws of the Islýmic Monotheism)]. So follow you that (Islýmic Monotheism and its laws), and follow not the desires of those who know not. (Tafsir At-Tabarý). It was authentically reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he saw `Umar ibn Al-Khattab holding some pages of the Tawrah. He, thus, became angry and said: Are you doubtful regarding it (Islam) O Ibn Al-Khattab? By Him in Whose Hand is my life, I have brought it to you plain and pure&#8230; By Him in Whose Hand is my life, if Musa (Moses) was alive he would have followed me. (Related by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad (Hadith compilation)).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We, thus, advise you to increase your recitation of the Qur&#8217;an, take care of it, and act according to its teachings, for it will definitely suffice you from reading the earlier books revealed by Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">“Jihâd (striving) against the soul has four stages:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: To strive in learning guidance and the religion of truth, without which there will be no success. Indeed, there can be no true happiness, nor any delight in this world and in the Herefater, except through it.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: Striving to act upon what has been learnt, since knowledge without action will not benefit, rather it will cause harm.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly</strong>: Striving to invite others towards it and to teach those who do not know, otherwise he may be considered from those who hide what Allâh has revealed of guidance and clear explanation. Such knowledge will neither benefit, nor save a person from the punishment of Allâh.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourthly</strong>: Striving to be patient and persevering against those who oppose this <em> da’wah</em> (call) to Allâh and those who seek to cause harm &#8211; patiently bearing all these hardships for the sake of Allâh.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">When these four stages are completed then such a person is considered to be amongst the<strong><em> Rabbâniyyûn</em></strong>. The <em>Salaf</em> were agreed that a Scholar does not deserve the title of <em>Rabbânî</em> until he recognises and knows the truth, acts upon it, and teaches it to others. So whosoever has knowledge, acts upon it, and teaches this knowledge to others, is considered from the <em>Rabbâniyyûn</em>.” [<em>Zâdul-Ma’âd fi Hadî Khayril-’Ibâd</em> (pp.9-11)]</p>
