<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 40 : Point 64</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> that when children are afflicted by anything in the life of this world then they feel pain. And that is mentioned because Bakr ibn ukht `Abdul Waa<u>h</u>id said &#8220;<em>they do not feel pain</em>&#8221; and he lied.</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F378718403&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/when-children-are-afflicted-by-anything-in-the-life-of-this-world-then-they-feel-pain" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This matter is mentioned on account of those who say that children do not feel any pain. And he mentioned this to refute this man and this man it is said that he was from the <em>Khawaarij </em>also<em>. </em>And the <em>Khawaarij</em> have even more surprising things than these worthless sayings on account of their ignorance and on account of their pretence to knowledge. When a child suffers something, he screams and he cries and he calls out for help and this is a proof that he indeed feels pain and this is something witnessed and felt. However, this man has strange sayings and from them is this issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Al <u>H</u>aafi<u>z</u> ibn <u>H</u>ajar said in Lisaan ul-Meezaan: &#8220;Bakr ibn ukht `Abdul Waa<u>h</u>id ibn Zayd al-Ba<u>s</u>ree al-Zaahid&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was mentioned by Ibn <u>H</u>azm in <em>Al-Milal W’al Ni<u>h</u>al</em> as being one of the <strong><em>Khawaarij</em> </strong>that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993366;">“With regard to every sin, even a small sin, even a slight lie which a person told as a joke that the person who does it is a <em>kaafir</em> (disbeliever), a <em>mushrik</em> (one who associates partners with Allaah) from the People of the Hellfire except that if he is from the people who fought at Badr then he will be a <em>kaafir</em>, a <em>mushrik</em> but he is from the People of Paradise”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his student `Abdullaah ibn `Eesaa used to say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993366;">“The insane person and the children and the animals never ever feel any pain on account of every ailment or anything else because Allaah never oppresses anything even by the extent of a tiniest ant.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qutaybah (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) quoted this matter of pain from Bakr himself. From his foul sayings is that, “Whoever steals anything even to the amount of a mustard seed will remain in the Hellfire forever along with the disbelievers” and Ibn Qutaybah refuted this at length.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>[The following article has been extracted from Al-Ibaanah e-Book :<br />
<a title="Your Flesh and Blood : The Rights of Children : Shaikh Muhammad Baazmool" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/01/27/fleshblood/">Your Flesh and Blood : The Rights of Children</a> – Shaikh Muhammad Baazmool ]</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Know that children are a source of trials (<i>fitnah</i>).</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p>وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّمَا أَمْوَالُكُمْ وَأَوْلَادُكُمْ فِتْنَةٌ وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ عِندَهُ أَجْرٌ عَظِيمٌ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“And know that your possessions and your children are but a trial and that surely, with </b><b>Allaah is a mighty reward.” </b>[Surah Al-Anfaal 8: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>It is stated in <i>Adwaa-ul-Bayaan</i>: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah ordered the people in this noble ayah to be aware that their properties and children are a trial for them by which they will be tested. Will your wealth and your children be a cause for you to fall into that which Allaah is displeased with?! Elsewhere (in the Qur’aan), He adds to this saying that wives are also a trial just like wealth and children, thus ordering the individual to beware of them putting him into that which Allaah is not pleased with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then He orders the individual – if he should see something he dislikes from these enemies who are the closest and most special of people to him, i.e. his children and wives – to forgive them, pardon them and not hold them accountable. So he should beware of them firstly and then pardon them if some thing should occur from them. This is found in His statement in Surah At-Taghaabun:</p>
<p>يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِنَّ مِنْ أَزْوَاجِكُمْ وَأَوْلَادِكُمْ عَدُوًّا لَّكُمْ فَاحْذَرُوهُمْ ۚ وَإِن تَعْفُوا وَتَصْفَحُوا وَتَغْفِرُوا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ &#8211; 64:14</p>
<p>إِنَّمَا أَمْوَالُكُمْ وَأَوْلَادُكُمْ فِتْنَةٌ ۚ وَاللَّهُ عِندَهُ أَجْرٌ عَظِيمٌ &#8211; 64:15</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>‘O you who believe, verily among your wives and your children are enemies for you, so </b><b>beware of them. But if you pardon (them) and overlook and forgive (their faults), then </b><b>verily, Allaah is All-Forgiving, Most-Merciful. Your wealth and your children are only a </b><b>trial, whereas Allaah – with Him is a great reward.’ </b>[Surah At-Taghaabun 64: 14-15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then asserts somewhere else (in the Qur’aan) that it is forbidden for the believers to let their wealth and children divert them from His Remembrance, stating that whoever let’s this happen is a loser who has been duped out of his shares. The ayah being referred to is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تُلْهِكُمْ أَمْوَالُكُمْ وَلَا أَوْلَادُكُمْ عَن ذِكْرِ اللَّهِ ۚ وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذَٰلِكَ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْخَاسِرُونَ &#8211; 63:9</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>‘O you who believe, let not your properties or your children divert you from the </b><b>Remembrance of Allaah. And whosoever does that, they are the losers.’ </b>[Surah AlMunaafiqoon 63: 9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word <b>‘fitnah’</b>, as mentioned in these verses, means a trial and a test. This is one of the many meanings this word possesses in the Qur’aan.” [28]</p>
<p>~~</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Neither the wife nor the children of an individual will pick up the burden of his shortcomings and deficiencies on his behalf. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">لَن تَنفَعَكُمْ أَرْحَامُكُمْ وَلَا أَوْلَادُكُمْ ۚ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ يَفْصِلُ بَيْنَكُمْ ۚ وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ بَصِيرٌ &#8211; 60:3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“Neither your relatives nor your children will be of avail to you on the Day of </b><b>Resurrection. He will judge between you. And Allaah is All-Seer of what you do.” </b>[Surah Al-Mumtahanah 60: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So children are a source of <i>fitnah </i>– they are a trial and a test. Allaah will test us by them. So we should fear Allaah with regard to them and give them the proper rights that they deserve. Or should we forfeit these rights, when Allaah will ask us about them?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan (rahimahullah) reported: ‘Ubaidullaah bin Ziyad went to visit Ma’qil bin Yassaar while he was suffering from the illness that he eventually died from. So Ma’qil said: “I will indeed narrate a hadeeth to you that I heard from Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) . I heard the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>‘There is no servant whom Allaah has granted responsibility over a group of </b><b>people, then fails to look after them in an honest manner, except that he will not </b><b>experience the fragrance of Paradise.’</b>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration of this hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“There is no servant whom Allaah has granted </b><b>responsibility over a group of people, then dies on the day that he dies whilst in a state </b><b>of deceiving his people, except that Allaah makes Paradise forbidden for him.” [</b>29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Children are a source for causing one to divert away from the Remembrance of Allaah. At times, they may even lead you to disobey Him. In these cases, they are an enemy that you should beware of!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) has instructed us how to expiate this <i>fitnah</i>. Hudhaifah ( رضي الله عنه ) reported: “We were sitting one day with ‘Umar ( رضي الله عنه ) when he asked us: ‘Which one of you memorized the words of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) concerning trials?’ I replied: ‘I did, just as he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said it.’ He said: ‘You are quick to respond!!’ I said:‘<b>A man’s trials with regard to his </b><b>family, his wealth, his children and his neighbor are expiated by prayer, fasting, charity, </b><b>and commanding (good) and forbidding (evil).’</b>” [30]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Question 23</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Question: </b>Should children below the age of fifteen be ordered to fast as in the case with prayer?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer: </b>Yes, children who have not yet reached the age of puberty should be ordered to fast if they are able to do it. This is what the Companions would do with their children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars have stated that a guardian should order whichever youth he possesses guardianship over to fast so that they could practice it and become attached to it, and so that the foundations of Islaam could become instilled in their souls to the point that it becomes like second-nature to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, they are not required to fast if doing so will be difficult on them or bring harm to them. I would like to point out here an issue that some fathers or mothers do, and that is preventing their children from fasting, in direct opposition to what the Companions used to do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They claim that they are preventing their children from fasting out of mercy and compassion for them. But the reality is that mercy for one’s children is in ordering them to practice the rites of Islaam and to grow accustomed and attached to them. This without a doubt is from the best and most complete forms of raising and cultivating one’s children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is authentically reported that the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“Verily a man is a guardian for the members of his household and he will be questioned as to his flock.”</b> [Reported by Al-Bukhaaree (no. 2409) and Muslim (no. 1829)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That which is required for guardians with respect to those whom Allaah has given them authority over, such as family members and youth, is that they fear Allaah with regard to them and order them with what they were commanded to order them, such as implementing the rites of Islaam.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Question 7</strong>: <strong>The ruling on working and studying in the lands of disbelief</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“Is residing in the lands of disbelief for work and study from the exceptions to this?”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regards to working and gathering money, the discussion about the danger of the Muslim staying in the land of disbelief has already preceded, so it is upon the Muslim to strive to save himself, and protect his deen and guard himself against the tribulations, for that, by Allaah, is better than the dunyaa and what is in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, it is upon the Muslim to strive to remain in the lands of Islaam, even if the income there is small. Rather, it is upon him to rely on Allaah, and think good of Allaah, and ask Allaah to bless that which He provides him, for indeed blessing is from Allaah. How many people, their incomes are limited, however, they are at ease, and in a state of peacefulness, and happiness and blessing, while on the contrary, how many people have gone to the lands of disbelief to gather money and to compete with the people of the dunyaa in their dunyaa, then you find them in a state of loss and need, even if they possess millions, and build buildings, and buy fancy cars. You find them in a state of misery and unhappiness. This is the norm for the one who strives to compete for dunyaa, that he (will) be in a state of grief, and sorrow, and fatigue, and misery and distress.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Maajah has transmitted the hadeeth of Zaid Ibn Thaabit on the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Whoever has the dunyaa be his main concern, Allaah will make his affair fall apart, and He will put poverty before his eyes, and only that which has been written for him from the dunyaa will come to him, and whoever has the next life as his determination, Allaah will put together for him his affair, and He will put wealth in his heart, and the dunyaa will be forced to come to him.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hadeeth is saheeh, and we benefit from this hadeeth that Allaah (Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala) punishes he who strives to obtain dunyaa and gather it even if it costs him his deen. Allaah makes his affair fall apart, and puts Him in disarray and in fear of want and poverty despite the fact that he works morning and evening, and toils night and day. Some of them neglect the rights of his wife and children, rather, he is also negligent in his forms of worship and religious obligations, and at the same time, the only provision from the dunyaa that will come to him is that which Allaah has decreed for him, not what he himself wants.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>مَّن كَانَ يُرِيدُ الْعَاجِلَةَ عَجَّلْنَا لَهُ فِيهَا مَا نَشَاءُ لِمَن نُّرِيدُ ثُمَّ جَعَلْنَا لَهُ جَهَنَّمَ يَصْلَاهَا مَذْمُومًا مَّدْحُورًا</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Whoever wishes for the quick-passing (transitory enjoyment of this world), We readily grant him what We will for whom We like. Then, afterwards, We have appointed for him Hell, he will burn therein disgraced and rejected, (far away from Allaah’s Mercy).”</strong> </span>&#8211; Al-Israa (17):18</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he will only get from the dunyaa, that which Allaah wants and wills for him, not what that person wants, and decides, and desires and wishes for. So it is upon the slave to strive to obey Allaah and His Messenger, and stay away from the tribulations, and occupy himself with worship, and exert himself wholeheartedly for Allaah, for verily if he does that, then Allaah (Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala) will bless him in his provision, and He will put satisfaction in his heart, and if not, if he does contrary to that, then let him expect the opposite of that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haakim has transmitted with a saheeh chain on Ma’qil Ibn Yasaar on the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Your Lord (Tabarak Wa Ta’ala) says: ‘O son of Adam, devote yourself to worshipping Me, I will fill your heart with wealth (satisfaction), and I will fill your hands with provision. O son of Adam, don’t move away from Me, (if you do so) I will fill your heart with poverty, and I will fill your hands with work.’”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So every Muslim must beware of subjecting his deen to tribulation because of some limited amount of money that he gathers. A group of the people of knowledge has mentioned that remaining in the lands of the disbelievers for the purpose of working is from those things which are forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for going to the lands of disbelief to study, it has preceded that from the conditions for the one residing over there is that he is able to perform his deen, and openly perform it, and also that he feel safe for his deen and for himself, and this, in reality, is not being fulfilled with most of the students.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In studying with them there is great danger for the deen and character of the students, while most of the students are negligent when it comes to learning their deen, and they have weakness in differentiating between good and bad, and between that which is beneficial and that which is harmful, and between right and wrong, and between misguidance and guidance and between that which is meager and that which is stout, so over there they are prey for the enemies of Islaam because they are under the supervision of the disbelievers, and under the instruction and education of the disbelievers, so what do we expect after that?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, in most cases the student looks up to his teacher and respects him, and his heart leans toward him, and when that happens he copies his ideas and follows him in his character and his behavior, thus he does not return to his country except that he has abandoned his deen. It is rare that the student over there escapes sins, and disobedient acts, and the different types of abominations and sins and disobedience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a very important point that the Muslims must be aware of, and those who want to go over there must beware of. Is it perceivable that there exists education in those lands far free from having acts forbidden by the Islamic legislation like intermingling (of men and women) and other things?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So due to this, it is upon the Muslim to strive to study in the land of Islaam so he can feel safe in the lands of Islaam for his deen and his character. Also, there exists in the lands of Islaam different types of studies which suffices having to go to the lands of the disbelievers, although we point out that the places of education that contain acts forbidden by the Islamic legislation, like intermingling and other things, it is not permissible to enroll in them, whether they are in the land of disbelief or in the land of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">If someone were to say, “What if the field of study is something that is needed, and it does not exist in the lands of Islaam, is it permissible to go to the lands of disbelief?”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer: this is not permissible, going to their lands, even if the type of knowledge is something needed and it does not exist in the lands of the Muslims because in that there is danger for the students as you have heard, and also, if we were to refrain from studying this matter that the Muslims need, is straying from the truth going to occur because of that? Or is the worst that will occur is deprivation and some extra effort, contrary to the Muslims need for knowledge of the Islamic legislation and the beneficial knowledge, for verily if they were to leave that, straying from the truth would befall them as the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) has informed of as is mentioned in the two Saheehs from the hadeeth of ‘Abdullaah Ibn ‘Amr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Verily, Allaah does not seize the knowledge by snatching it from the breasts of men, rather He seizes the knowledge by the death of the Scholars, then when He doesn’t let a Scholar remain, the people will take ignorant people as their leaders, so they will be asked, and they will give legal verdicts without knowledge, so they will go astray and they will lead others astray.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus if the knowledge of the legislation does not exist, then straying and misguidance occurs in the Muslim societies. As for the knowledge of worldly affairs, the worst that could happen to them is some extra effort, although, as we have mentioned, the types of knowledge which the Muslims need exist in the lands of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, look at the evil consequences that have occurred in the ranks of the Muslims because of them sending their children to go study with the disbelievers, and that could be because of a legal opinion of some of the people of knowledge, however, look at the tremendous evils. What have the Muslims benefited from their children going to the lands of disbelief? If we were to look at the evil consequences we would find them to be many and tremendous.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Would it be disbelief to study at a kaafir school (i.e. public school system in Canada), knowing that we live in a kaafir country, and that we also need an education? This is in addition to the fact that these schools have free-mixing environments where the women do not cover properly. And if studying at these schools is not permissible, is there any exception for those who wish to study at these schools so as to attain some certificate or degree so as to facilitate their plans for hijrah?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ans</strong>: First of all, any of the schools which contain <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>free mixing environments and intermingling of the genders</strong></span>, then attendance in these schools and studying in them is not allowable for whatever reason. And if the schools are free of free mixing and intermingling, then it is allowable to study in this schools if what is being taught does not contain <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>ideology of kufr or systems of kufr</strong></span>. And if it does not contain what promotes kufr, nor does it call to it. So if a Muslim was to study for example engineering, be that of planes or cars or computers (or other than them), and all these being from the inventions of mankind, in order that he may benefit himself and benefit the Muslims, then this is allowable and it is desired that the Muslims may benefit from this type of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is upon the Muslims to cooperate upon righteousness and fearing of Allaah (subhaana wa ta’laa). Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Help you one another in Al Birr and AtTaqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety.&#8221;</strong> (Al-Ma&#8217;idah 5:2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So studying in schools which are free from intermingling of men and women, then this is allowable as long as it is free from those things which are muharram (not allowable) in the deen. And also with the condition that what is being studied does not contain disbelief in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the shaykh mentioned the order of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) to Zayd bin Thaabit to study the language of the Jews. And Zayd bin Thaabit (radiyAllaahu anhu) went on and mentioned that he had mastered the language of the Jews in fifteen days. And this was of benefit to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم), as Zayd bin Thaabit was able to translate the letter of the Jews for the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and also write to them. And Shaykh Ahmed mentioned that the language was studied so that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and the Muslims may be safe from the planning and the plotting of the Jews.</p>

<p><strong>Dr Murtaza bin Bakhsh حفظه الله:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever Allah -the Most High- chooses to guide, that individual is successful in this world and the hereafter. The majority (of the people) say, with regards to their children&#8217;s future:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Make my child a doctor.’ ’O Allah, make my child and engineer.’ ’0 Allah, make my child wealthy. &#8216;Make (my child) a businessman.’ The best du&#8217;aa you can make for your children, if you are going to make one is: ’<strong>O Allah, guide my children</strong>!’ This is the best of supplications!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In our society today, and in (this) nation of Muslims, there is no shortage of doctors, there is no shortage of engineers, nor is there a shortage of businessmen. If there is a shortage, then it is of rightly guided Muslims, individuals of Taqwa who withhold from that which is forbidden. How will this deficiency be fulfilled? I am not saying that you shouldn’t become doctors. Or that you shouldn’t guide your children to becoming doctors or to being engineers, this is not what I am saying. I am saying make them good Muslims (upon) Taqwa who withhold from that which is forbidden first, then a doctor, then an engineer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You will not be able to rid this society, this nation of corruption. Our situation will not change until we change ourselves. The five daily prayers have not changed us! The month of Ramadaan has not changed us! So when will we change?!!</p>

Translated by Abu Afnaan Muhammad &#8216;Abdullah حفظه الله<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcription of the Video </strong>:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What are the recommended Sunnah actions upon the birth of a newborn?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Muqbil bin Hadee Al-Waadi&#8217;ee:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The recommended sunnah actions: Rather what is obligatory is the &#8216;Aqeeqah as the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) stated: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Every child is mortgaged with his &#8216;Aqeeqah. &#8216;And the &#8216;Aqeeqah is two sheep for a boy and one sheep for a girl&#8221;</span></strong>. That is one affair, the other affair is selecting a good name; meaning naming him with a pleasant name as Imam Muslim narrated in his Sahih from Abdillah ibn Umar that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The most beloved names to Allah are ’Abdulah and ’Abdur Rahman&#8221;</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Beware beware! From naming your newborn with the names of the kufaar like George or the names of oppressors like Saddam, Ma&#8217;mar al Qadhafi or Hafidh Asad. So beware of naming it with these names. Also, naming the newborn Jamal is permissible. However, if what is desired from this is naming after Jamal Abdul Nasir -May Allah not have mercy upon him- then no. What is important is to choose a good name.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After that, also choosing a righteous wet nurse as the child is influenced by the woman who breastfeeds him. Also, beware beware of breastfeeding from an imbecilic woman or from a crazy woman or a woman suffering from a nervous condition as all of these affect the child, wallahul musta&#8217;aan</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>FIRST</strong>: To Completely Prevent Pregnancy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is not permissible because:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">(a) it will diminish the Islamic population and this is against the objective of Sharee&#8217;aa which aims at increasing the population of Muslims.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">(b) the woman is unable to guarantee against the death of her existing children and thus she may die without having any children.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>SECOND</strong>: To Temporarily Prevent Pregnancy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This applies if the woman had many pregnancies and this is beginning to weaken her. If she wants to regulate her pregnancy so as to have it once every two years, then given the approval of her husband, it is permissible for her to use contraceptives as long as their use does not harm her. The Sahabah used to perform <strong>Coitus Interrupts</strong> [59] and they were not prevented (i.e., by the Prophet-صلى الله عليه و سلم). This method involves regular sexual intercourse with the wife except at the time of ejaculation, the husband pulls out and ejaculates outside the private part of the woman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[59] Narrated Jabir: &#8220;we used to practice Coitus Interrupts during the life of time of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم)&#8221;. Collected by Al-Bukhari in his in Saheeh (Arabic-English) V.7, P.102</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân:</strong> No, it is not allowed with Isbâl. A child should be raised in accordance with the Sunnah. One should not let it practice Isbâl.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, may He be Blessed and Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-3-38.png" alt="" width="484" height="41" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;This is the time when Zakariya invoked his Lord, saying: <strong>&#8216;O my Lord! Grant me from You, a good offspring. You are indeed the All-Hearer of invocations.</strong>&#8216;&#8221;</span> [Surah Aali &#8216;Imraan: 38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says quoting Zakariya:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-19-5.png" alt="" width="437" height="37" /><br />
<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-19-6.png" alt="" width="484" height="41" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;<strong>And verily, I fear my relatives after me, since my wife is barren. So give me from Yourself a walee (righteous worshipper) who will inherit me and inherit the posterity of Ya&#8217;qoob. And make him, my Lord, one with whom You are well-pleased.</strong>”</span> [Surah Maryam: 5-6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ash-Shanqeetee said in Adwaa-ul-Bayaan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allaah&#8217;s statement in this noble verse: &#8216;So give me from Yourself a walee&#8217; – what is meant by the word walee here is a son specifically and not any other type of walee (righteous person). This is based on proof found in Allaah&#8217;s saying while relating the same story: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;This is the time when Zakariya invoked his Lord, saying: &#8216;O my Lord! Grant me from You, a good offspring. You are indeed the All-Hearer of invocation.</span>&#8221; [Surah Aali &#8216;Imraan: 38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also indicates that what is meant (by the word walee, i.e. righteous person) here is a child by His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-21-89.png" alt="" width="484" height="41" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And remember Zakariya when he cried to his Lord: &#8216;O my Lord, leave me not single! You are the best of the inheritors.&#8221;&#8217;</span> [Surah Al-Anbiyaa: 89] &#8216;Leave me not single&#8217; means: &#8216;Alone and without a child.&#8217;”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[End of Ash-Shanqeetee&#8217;s words] [Adwaa-ul-Bayaan (3/365)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is for this reason that from amongst the supplications of the believers – &#8220;those from whom We shall accept the best of their deeds and overlook their evil deeds, they shall be among the dwellers of Paradise – a promise of truth, which they have been promised” – is that which Allaah has mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-46-15.png" alt="" width="466" height="105" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;My Lord! Grant me the power and ability that I may be grateful for Your Favour which You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents, and that I may do righteous good deeds, such as please You, and make my offspring good. Truly, I have turned to You in repentance, and truly I am one of the Muslims.”</span> [Surah Al-Ahqaaf: 15]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[48] <strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling concerning putting limitations to the amount of offspring one has?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The person that limits his offspring without having a legitimate reason for doing so, I hold him to be <strong>foolish</strong> if not a disbeliever in the Qadaa and the Qadar (Divine Execution and Preordainment) of Allaah. This is since the individual that limits his progeny to only three children, for example, and he has reached the age of fifty (!), the thought of death does not even cross his mind, or that some violent storm should come and take the lives of his three children, thus leaving him till the end of his life as if he were barren and without offspring. Therefore, those that put limits to the amount of children they have, they do not reflect upon the things that every Muslim reflects on. And it is Al-Qadar (Preordainment), which befalls the people in the way that He wants, not in the way that they want. So this practice that is done in current times, is a severe negligence and a clear deprivation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Asaalah, Issue #2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[49] <strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Does the ruling on birth control differ from that of family limitation (of offspring)? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: Birth control has some detail to it. Therefore, I say that this thing, which has come to be known as &#8220;birth control&#8221; is from that which the Muslims of today are being tested by in the lands of Islaam. However, there are cases from it, which must be referred back to the motive behind it. An example of this is when the motive for this birth control is based on a prescription from Muslim doctors who are advising the couple towards this so-called &#8220;birth control&#8221; to safeguard the health of the woman who has departed from her natural state due to her having delivered many children! So if a skilled Muslim doctor issues these instructions as a form of advice, then that becomes a legitimate excuse for (the allowance of) this birth control.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an example in which birth control is permissible. As for an example that is contrary to this one, then it is such as when the motive behind it is due to poverty (!) or because of bills, which is always on the minds of the disbelievers!! So you can see one of them say: &#8220;My wife and I are two. And I have two children!! And the fifth member of them is their dog!! So this monthly pay that we receive is just enough for us (to pay our bills), and that&#8217;s all [five]!&#8221; This is not permissible in Islaam because this motive emanates from the logic of the Days of Ignorance, which we were warned to avoid and stay away from. Such is found in Allaah&#8217;s saying: &#8220;And do not kill your children for fear of poverty. We will provide you with sustenance as well as them.&#8221; [Surah Al-Ana’aam: 151]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is especially the case since the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Muslims believe that the child comes with his sustenance (already) with him</strong></span>. This is because, before it comes out into this world, its sustenance is ordained for it while it is in the womb of its mother, as has been clarified to us in the Noble Sunnah. So this example of birth control, with this motive, is not permissible at all. As for the baseless and false reasons that some people have used to justify and allow it, then they have no place in the Religion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Some of our Muslim brethren hold birthday parties for themselves and their children, what is the ruling on such festivals? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The basic principle regarding acts of <strong>Ibadah</strong> (worship) is that they are <strong>Tawqifiy</strong> (bound by a religious text and not amenable to personal opinion), and as such, no one is allowed to worship Allah in a way other than which He ordained, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) said in the Sahih (authentic) Hadith:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Anyone who introduces anything into this matter of ours (Islam) that is not part of it will have it rejected. </span></em>[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (peace be upon him) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Anyone who does an action which is not in accordance with this matter of ours (Islam) will have it rejected. </span></em>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Birthday parties are an act of Bid&#8217;ah (innovation in religion) that should not be done for any person, regardless of their rank or role in life. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most honorable of all creation and the best of all Messengers (peace be upon them), i.e. Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdullah (peace be upon him) was never reported to have held a festival for the day he was born, or even instructed his Ummah (nation based on one creed) to celebrate it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, the best of this Ummah after its Prophet (peace be upon him) are the Rightly-Guided Caliphs and the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet), but none of them is reported to have made a festival for the Prophet&#8217;s birthday, or for any of them (may Allah be pleased with them), and all goodness is to be found in following their pathand patterning oneself after the teachings of the Prophet (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, such Bid`ah pave the way to<strong> imitate the Jews, Christians and other Kafirs</strong> (non-Muslims) in terms of their newly invented festivals. Allah is the One sought for help!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Q: Is it permissible for a boy to sleep with his mother and his sister if he has reached the age of puberty?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is not permissible for boys who have reached the <strong>age of puberty or ten years of age</strong> to sleep with their mothers or their sisters in the same bed, out of protection of honors, to keep away from Fitnah (temptation) and block the means leading to sin. The Prophet (peace be upon him) asked us to separate the beds of boys and girls when they reach the age of ten in his saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;">Command your children to offer Salah (Prayer) when they become seven years old; beat them for (neglecting) it when they become ten years old; and arrange their beds (to sleep) separately.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Abu Dawud, Sunan, Book on Salah, no. 495; and Ahmad, Musnad, vol. 2, p. 187.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who have not reached the age of puberty yet, they are asked to take permission when entering the rooms three times when people put on light clothes and `Awrah (parts of the body that must be covered in public) most probably could be revealed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;">O you who believe! Let your slaves and slave-girls, and those among you who have not come to the age of puberty ask your permission (before they come to your presence) on three occasions: before Fajr (morning) Salât (prayer), and while you put off your clothes for the noonday (rest), and after the ‘Ishâ’ (late-night) Salât (prayer). (These) three times are of privacy for you; other than these times there is no sin on you or on them to move about, attending to each other. Thus Allâh makes clear the Ayât (the Verses of this Qur’ân, showing proofs for the legal aspects of permission for visits) to you. And Allâh is All-Knowing, All-Wise. <span style="color:#666699;"> [Surah Al-Nur, 24: 58]</span></span></p>
<p>Those who have reached the age of puberty are required to take permission at all times.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;">And when the children among you come to puberty, then let them (also) ask for permission, as those senior to them (in age). Thus Allâh makes clear His Ayât (Commandments and legal obligations) for you. And Allâh is All-Knowing, All-Wise. <span style="color:#666699;">[Surah Al-Nur, 24: 59]</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All this is for the purpose of keeping away Fitnah, protecting honors and eliminating the means leading to evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for boys who are less than ten years old, it is permissible for them to sleep with their mothers and sisters in their beds, as they need care and to remove hardship. However, if there is no fear of Fitnah, it is permissible for them to sleep in the same room, even if they are adults, but each one on a separate bed.<br />
May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 12: A man has many children and lives with his family in a small room that hardly accommodates them. What should he do in order not to contradict the order of the Messenger of Allah that children should be separated in beds at certain age?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Having separate beds for children is Wajib (obligatory) according to one&#8217;s ability. The Muslim should strive hard to fulfill that. Allah (Exalted be He) said, So keep your duty to Allâh and fear Him as much as you can The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, When I command you to do anything, do of it as much as you possibly can.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">Compiled &amp; Translated  by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn Abbas who said the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> used to seek refuge for al-Hassan and al-Hussein, he would say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">‫أعوذ بكلمات الله التامة من كل شيطان وهامة ، ومن كل عين لامة</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I seek refuge for you two with Allaah’s perfect words from every Shaytaan (devil) and poisonous creature and every evil eye.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said that this is how Ibrahim used to seek refuge for Ishaaq and Ismaeel.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari &amp; Tirmidhi with the extra wording, authenticated by Albaani]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>An Explanation:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul Ulaa AbdurRahmaan al-Mubarakfooree <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Allaah’s words’:     ‘It has been said that they are the Qur’aan and it has also been said they are Allaah’s names.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Perfect’:               ‘Al-Jazari said: ‘Indeed Allaah’s speech has been described as being Perfect, because it is not permissible for any of His speech to have deficiency or fault like there is in the speech of people.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It has been said that the meaning of ‘Perfect’ here is that it benefits the one seeking refuge with these ‘Perfect words’, and protect him from illnesses and this would be sufficient for him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Poisonous creature’:        ‘Every type of creature that kills with poison. And it is possible that it could mean any crawling animal even if it does not kill, like insects.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Evil eye’:              ‘From every evil type of affliction from the eye.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Tuhfahtul Ahawadhi’ an explanation of Sunan at-Tirmidhi]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>How to Seek Refuge from the Evil Eye for Children</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">By the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’  </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani <em>-Rahimullaah-</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani was asked over the phone:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Phone rings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh:       yes!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Caller:                  <em>Aslaamu alaykum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh:       <em>Wa alaykum as-Salaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Caller:         O Shaykh regarding ‘I seek refuge for you two with Allaah’s perfect words from every Shaytaan (devil) and poisonous creature and every evil eye.’ Is this said three consecutive times or just once?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh:       No, it is mentioned once, however if it appears to the one saying this <em>Dua’</em>that he needs to repeat it without specifying three times, then there is no problem with that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Caller:         and should he place his hand on the head of the one sought refuge for?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh:       Yes, yes!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Caller:         Even in congregation, if it is a group of children together, how can he place his hand upon all of them?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh:       He should place his two hands on two of the children, then repeat this on the rest of the children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Caller:         Right hand and left hand, with both hands?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh:       Yes, yes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Caller:                  Regarding the hadeeth that the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">would not sleep until he recited <em>Soorah</em> Mulk, al – Isra, Zumar, and Sajdah, is this when he lies down on his bed at night, or before he lies down?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh:       What is important is that he recites before he falls asleep, whether it is whilst he is sitting or lying then it is up to him’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808000;">The Messenger’s <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> Supplication For Anas <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu<br />
</em>Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ </span><br />
<span style="color:#808000;">By the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’  </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani</span><br />
<span style="color:#808000;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">140 – From Qatada who said: I heard Anas saying: I heard Umm Sulaym who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O Messenger of Allaah! Make <em>Dua</em>’ to Allaah for Anas’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said: <strong>‘O Allaah increase his wealth and offspring and bless him in what you have provided for him.’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Bukhari and Tirmidhi</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">141-  From Thaabit, from Anas bin Malik that the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> came to Umm Haraam and she brought him some dates and margarine but the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Return this to its container and the other to its jug, since I am fasting.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he stood and led us in a two <em>Rakah </em>optional prayer and Umm Haraam and Umm Sulaym stood behind us.  He made me stand on his right hand side – and according to Thaabit – Anas continued: He led us in an optional prayer on a mat. When he finished his prayer, Umm Sulaym said: I have a specific request, make <em>Dua</em>’ to Allaah for your young servant Anas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> never left anything of good from the<em>Duniya </em>and the Hereafter except that he supplicated it for me, then he <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>O Allaah increase his wealth and offspring and bless it for him.’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘My daughter informed me that I had been provided with some ninety odd offspring from my loins. There was not a man from amongst the Ansaar who had more wealth than me, then Anas said: ‘O Thaabit, I do not own any gold or silver except for my ring.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Abu Dawood, I say that this <em>Isnaad</em> is Saheeh upon the conditions of Muslim. It is also collected by Ahmad &amp; Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the narration of Ahmad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Then the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> supplicated for Umm Sulaym and her family.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the narrator mentions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Anas mentioned that his eldest daughter Ameenah informed him that there were more than one hundred and twenty from his offspring buried when Hajjaj appeared.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Albaani said: that this <em>Isnad</em> of three narrators is authentic upon the conditions of Bukhari &amp; Muslim.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Albaani Commented:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘From the benefits of the hadeeth and its <em>Fiqh</em>:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many benefits in this hadeeth, I will mention some of them briefly, except where detail is necessary:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- That supplicating for increase in wealth and offspring is something which is legislated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari has a chapter heading for this hadeeth: ‘Chapter: Supplicating for blessings in having lots of wealth and offspring.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- And that wealth and offspring are a blessing and goodness if Allaah -Tabaraka wa Ta’ala is obeyed in respect to them. How misguided is the one who tries to limit how many children they have, using so many different means, like birth control or regulating it, let alone aborting the foetus and for the most insignificant reasons, and obtaining <em>Fatawa</em> to make their actions permissible! !</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- Allaah answered the <em>Dua’</em> of His Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> for Anas, and it became reality, until he became the one with the most wealth and offspring from amongst the Ansar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- That it is allowed for the one fasting an optional fast, when he visits a person and food is presented to him that he does not have to break his fast, but he supplicates for the host with goodness. And from the chapters of Bukhari: ‘Chapter whoever visits a people and does not break his fast with them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5- That if a man is led in prayer by another man, he should stand on the right of the one leading the prayer.  What is evident is that he stands right next to him, not forward nor just behind him, because if anything like this ever occurred then the narrator would have narrated it, especially since the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> repeatedly led individual companions in prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a hadeeth of Ibn Abbas regarding this in Saheeh Bukhari and Muslim, and Bukhari brought a chapter heading for the hadeeth of Ibn Abbas, and Muslim brought it from Jabir. The chapter which Bukhari mentions is: ‘Chapter: if there are two people praying then one stands <strong>equal next </strong>to the one leading the prayer.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafidh said in ‘al-Fath’ (2/160):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Regarding the saying of Bukhari: ‘equal’ means that he does not stand forward from the Imam and nor just behind him, it is as if the compiler (Bukhari) indicates to what occurs in some of the narrations from Ibn Abbas with the wording: <strong>‘So I stood next to him’</strong> and that apparently means equal to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And AbdurRazzaq narrates from Ibn Juraij  who said: I said to ‘Atta:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘A man prays along with another man, where should he stand?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘On his right hand side.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I asked: ‘Does he stand equal to him so that he is in line with him and one is not ahead of the other?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘Yes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked: ‘Do you like it that they stand equal so there is no gap between them?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘Yes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In ‘al-Muwatta’ from Abdullaah bin Utbah bin Mas’ood who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I entered upon Umar bin al-Khattab during the morning before <em>Dhur</em> and I found him in<em>Ruku</em> (bowing in the prayer) I stood in prayer behind him, but he brought me forward until he placed me next to him on his right side.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Albaani) say: This Athar in ‘al-Muwatta’ with an authentic chain from Umar <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em>, along with the previously mentioned Ahadeeth are strong proof of the previously mentioned issue of standing equally in the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the saying that it is recommended that the single person following the Imam should stand slightly behind the Imam, as is mentioned by some of the <em>Madhahib</em>(schools of thought), with some of them elaborating about this issue – along with there being no evidence for it from the Sunnah likewise, it also opposes what is apparent from these Ahadeeth, and this narration of Umar, and the previously mentioned statement of ‘Atta and he is the Imam, the noble <em>Taba’ee</em> (Follower of the Companions) Ibn Abee Rabah and likewise it opposes the other statements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is more befitting for the Believer to leave those statements of the <em>Madhahib</em> (schools of thought) to their founders, believing that they are rewarded for it, because they endeavoured and formulated an opinion intending the truth, and it is upon the believer to follow what is established in the Sunnah, since indeed the best guidance is the guidance of the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ vol.1 hadeeth no. 219  p.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His Praise and Blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his  companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken From the <em>Fatawaa</em> of our Shaykh, <em>Allaama, Mufti</em> of the Kingdom of Saudi ArabiaAbdul Azeez bin Abdullaah Bin Baz<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> said: ‘Whoever had three daughters and was patient with them, gave them drink and clothed them then they will be a screen for him from the Fire.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Will this screen from the Fire be just for their father alone or does the mother have a share in this?  I have -all praise be to Allaah – three daughters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hadeeth is general for the father and the mother due to the Messenger’s saying: ‘Whoever has two daughters and is good to them then they will be a covering for him from the Fire.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise if he had sisters, aunts or similar to them and he is good to them then indeed we hope for Paradise for him due to that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when he is good to them he is deserving of a great reward, it will screen him from the Fire and it will come between him and the Fire due to his good deed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is specific to the Muslims.  If a Muslim performs these good actions desiring the Face of Allaah, then he has attained a means for his salvation    from the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Being saved from the Fire and entering into Paradise has many routes, so it is necessary for a believer to increase in them.  Islaam itself is a single foundation and it is the fundamental reason for entering Paradise and being rescued from the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are deeds which, if a Muslim performs them, he enters Paradise due to them and is saved from the Fire, such as the one who has been given daughters or sisters and is good to them, then they will be a screen for him from the Fire.  Similarly, whoever had three of his offspring, who had not reached the age of accountability, die then they will be a screen for him from the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Companions asked: ‘O Messenger of Allaah what about two daughters?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘Even two,’ and they did not ask him about one daughter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is authentically reported on the authority of the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> that he said: Allaah <em>&#8211; Azza wa Jal-</em> said, ‘For My believing slave who, if I take his close friend from the people of the<em>Duniya</em> and then he performs righteous actions, there is no reward except Paradise.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah <em>–Subhanahu wa Ta’ala-</em> explained that for His believing slave whose close friend He takes- i.e. His beloved – from the people of the <em>Duniya</em>, who is then patient and performs good deeds,He has no reward other than Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So even if one of our offspring enters this hadeeth and Allaah takes possession of him and takes him to Himself, then if that person’s father, mother or both of them are patient and they perform good deeds then they will have Paradise, and that is great excellence from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, a husband, wife, the rest of the relatives and friends, if they are patient and perform good deeds then they enter this hadeeth provided that they are safe from that which could, perhaps, cause them to die on any of the major sins.  We ask Allaah for safety.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>This is an excerpt from an upcoming e-book entitled &#8220;Your Flesh and Blood &#8211; The Rights of Children&#8221; by Shaikh Muhammad &#8216;Umar Baazmool, may Allaah facilitate it.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Chapter Five:<br />
How do we Fulfill the Rights of our Flesh and Blood?</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I will mention here some examples of this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1. Choosing a good name for him:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof for this is the fact that it is authentically reported on the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) that he would change vile names and that he would encourage (his followers) to choose good names (for themselves and their children).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Umar (<i>radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</i>) reported that the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“Indeed the most beloved of your names to Allaah are: ‘Abdullaah and ‘Abdur-Rahmaan.”</b> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Aqeel bin Shabeeb reported from Abu Wahab Al-Jushamee – one of the Companions – that the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“Name yourselves with the names of the prophets. And the most beloved of names to Allaah are: ‘Abdullaah and ‘Abdur-Rahmaan while the most truthful of them are: Al-Haarith and Hammaam. And the vilest of them are Harb and Murrah.”</b> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>2. Holding an ‘Aqeeqah for him:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Muhammad bin Sireen: Salmaan bin ‘Aamir Ad-Dabbee narrated to us, saying: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) say: <b>“The ‘Aqeeqah is to be offered for the (newborn) boy. So spill blood on his behalf (i.e. offer a sacrifice) and remove the harm from him.”</b> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>3. Breastfeeding him:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is one of the initial rights that a child gets after birth. The noble Qur’aan has affirmed it and defined the maximum time-frame for it, saying: <b>“The mothers shall give suck to their children for two whole years (that is) for those (parents) who desire to complete the term of suckling.”</b>[Surah Al-Baqarah: 233]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>4. Paying his expenses:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says: <b>“But the father of the child shall bear the cost of the mother’s food and clothing on a reasonable basis. No person shall have a burden laid on him greater than he can bear.”</b> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 233]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says: <b>“And kill not your children because of poverty. We provide sustenance for you and for them.”</b> [Surah Al-An’aam: 151]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says: <b>“And kill not your children for fear of poverty. We shall provide for them as well as for you. Surely, the killing of them is a great sin.”</b> [Surah Al-Israa: 31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if it were not for the fact that spending on them was an obligation, they would not have any fear of poverty. However, Allaah affirmed that and shows them that He is the One who provides for them and their offspring.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Az-Zuhree said: Abu Idrees ‘Aa’idhullaah bin ‘Abdillaah informed me that ‘Ubaadah bin As-Saamit (<i>radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</i>) – who was present at the Battle of Badr and who was one of the chiefs on the night of ‘Aqabah – reported that the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said while a group of his Companions were around him: <b>“Give me the pledge that you will not worship anything along with Allaah, that you will not steal, that you will not commit illegal intercourse, that you will not kill your children, that you will not bring forth a slander which you fabricate between your hands and legs (i.e. by making illegal children belong to their husbands), and that you are not disobedient with respect to (implanting) good. Whoever amongst you fulfills his pledge will be rewarded by Allaah. And whoever indulges in any of these sins and is then punished for it in this worldly life, the punishment will serve as expiation for him. And whoever indulges in any of these sins and then Allaah conceals it for him, the matter is with Allaah – if He wishes, He will pardon him and if He wishes, He will punish him.”</b> ‘Ubaadah bin As-Saamit (<i>radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</i>) said: “So we gave him the pledge of allegiance upon these conditions.” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also mentioned previously the report in which the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said:<b>“It is sufficient sin for a man that he neglects those whom he supports.”</b> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hishaam narrated: My father reported to me from ‘Aa’ishah that Hind bint ‘Utbah said: “O Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>), Abu Sufyaan is a very miserly man and he doesn’t give me what suffices myself and my child, except for what I take from him without him knowing!” He (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“Take what suffices you and your child in goodness.”</b> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas bin Maalik (<i>radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</i>) reported that the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“Whoever supports two girls until they reach the age of puberty will come on the Day of Judgement – him and I.”</b> And he (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) interlaced his fingers. [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>5. Being fair when giving out gifts:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Aamir narrated: I heard An-Nu’maan bin Basheer say while he was on the mimbar: “My father once gave me a gift but ‘Amra bint Rawaahah (i.e. my mother) said she would not agree to it unless he made Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) a witness to it. So my father went to Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) and said: ‘I have given a gift to my son from ‘Amra bint Rawaahah, but she ordered me to make you witness it O Messenger of Allaah.’ He (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) asked him: <b>‘Did you give the rest of your children a similar gift?’</b>He said: ‘No.’ So Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>‘Then fear Allaah and be fair towards all of your children.’</b> So my father went back and took back his gift.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>6. Commanding them to pray and being patient with them upon that:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is based on Allaah’s statement: <b>“And enjoin prayer on your family and be patient in offering it. We do not ask you for any provision, (rather) We provide for you, and the good end is for those with Taqwaa.”</b> [Surah TaHa: 132]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Amr bin Shu’aib reported from his father who reported from his grandfather that the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“Order your children to pray when they are seven years old and beat them to it (if they refuse) when they are ten. And separate them in their beds.”</b> [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>7. Beware of supplicating against them:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Ubaadah bin As-Saamit (<i>radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</i>) reported from Jaabir bin ‘Abdillaah (<i>radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</i>) that the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“Do not supplicate against your own selves. Do not supplicate against your children. And do not supplicate against your wealth. Do not correspond with Allaah on an hour in which He is asked something and thus grants it.”</b> [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>8. The Order to Restrain Children during the Hours in which the Jinn spread out:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jaabir (<i>radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</i>) reported that the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“When night falls, restrain your children, for indeed the devils spread out at that time. So when an hour has passed from the evening, you may then release them. And close your door and mention Allaah’s Name. Turn off your light and mention Allaah’s Name. Cover your containers and mention Allaah’s Name – even if you put something across it.”</b> [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>9. Inciting them to keep good company and warning them about bad companions:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Moosaa (<i>radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</i>) reported that the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“The example of a righteous companion and an evil companion is like that of a seller of musk and a blacksmith. From the first, you would either buy musk or enjoy its good smell while a blacksmith would either burn your home or your clothes or you would experience a foul smell from him.”</b> [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>10. Being merciful and compassionate towards them:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Urwah bin Az-Zubair reported from ‘Aa’ishah (<i>radyAllaahu &#8216;anhaa</i>), the wife of the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>), who narrated to him, saying: “A woman with two children came to me to beg but nothing could be found in my possession except one date, so I gave it to her. The woman took it and divided it between her two daughters. She then got up and left. When the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) came in, I told him what had happened. So he said: <b>‘Whoever is put in charge of some affair of these daughters and is good to them, they will act as a shield for him from the Fire.’</b>” [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Az-Zuhree reported: Abu Salamah bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan narrated to us that Abu Hurairah (<i>radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</i>) said: “The Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) once kissed Al-Hasan bin ‘Alee while Al-Aqra’ bin Haabis At-Tameemee was sitting next to him, so Al-Aqra’ said: ‘I have ten children and I have not kissed any of them.’ The Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) cast a look on him and said: <b>‘Whoever is not merciful (to others) will not be treated mercifully.’</b>” [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Aa’ishah, may Allaah be pleased with her, reported that once a Bedouin man came to the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) and said: “You people kiss children but we don’t kiss them.” So the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“I cannot put mercy in your heart after Allaah has taken it away from it.”</b> [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sulaymaan Maalik bin Al-Huwairith reported: “We came to the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) when we were young men around the same age and stayed with him for twenty nights. He (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) then thought that we missed our families so he asked us whom we left behind to look after them, and we told him. He was compassionate and merciful and said to us: <b>‘Go back to your families and teach them and command them (with good). And pray as you have seen me praying. And when the time for prayer comes in, one of you should make the Adhaan for all of you, and the eldest amongst you should lead the prayer.’</b>” [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>11. Serving as good role-models for them:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A child’s guardians should behave in accordance with their responsibility due to the generality of the afore-mentioned hadeeth: <b>‘All of you are shepherds and each one of you is responsible over his flock.’</b>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>12. Teaching them the aspects of the Religion that they are required to learn:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas bin Maalik (<i>radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</i>) reported that the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“Seeking knowledge is obligatory upon every Muslim.”</b> [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This goes along with a warning against children traveling abroad even for educational purposes until they first fortify themselves with religious knowledge and a righteous wife.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Shaikh Muhammad Amaan Al-Jaamee<br />
SOURCE: Sharh Shuroot as-Salaat (pg. 7)<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A child that is below the age of seven does not yet comprehend. This is why we were commanded to order our children to pray when they turn seven since before this age they do not possess the adequate level of comprehension. So the point at which he begins to comprehend things is the age of seven. After reaching this age, a child must be ordered to pray. This is based on the statement of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>): <b>&#8220;Order your children to pray at seven (years of age), and beat them to it (if they fail to comply) at ten. And separate them in their beds.&#8221;</b>These are Islamic etiquettes that we are required to follow, and included amongst them is: Commanding the children to pray at the age of seven.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ordering them to pray doesn&#8217;t mean that you just tell your child &#8220;Pray&#8221; and that&#8217;s it. The understanding that we derive from this command of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) of ordering our children to pray is that we should teach them <i>how</i> to pray. And if this is not so, then the act of you telling your child who is playing by the door: &#8220;Go to the masjid and pray&#8221; when you have not taught him how to purify himself or how to perform the prayer, does not remove the responsibility from your shoulders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You have only fulfilled your responsibility when you have taught him how to purify himself and then you tell him “Go pray.” In this circumstance, you have complied.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many people are inconsiderate when they bring to the masjid their children – aged seven or less – who are not in a state of purity and have no understanding of how to pray, and then place them in a row of prayer. This row is considered disconnected due to this child standing in it since he is not praying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following statement of the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) applies to people who this:<b>“Whoever connects the row, then Allaah will connect him, and whoever cuts off the row, then Allaah cut him off.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You bring a child who does not comprehend the prayer to the masjid and put him to stand in the first row next to you behind the Imaam while the people remain silent out of courtesy. This child is not in prayer. Perhaps he may not even be in a state of purity, i.e. he may have impurities in his body! This is since you took him from the front of the house before teaching him how to purify himself and how to pray. This is incorrect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is mandatory that you teach him at home how to purify himself and how to pray. Then you should teach him where to stand in the masjid. He should not stand in the front row. Rather, he should stand in the row where all the children are lined up. If a group of people congregate for prayer and they consist of two rows, then the children should stand in the second row, i.e. the last row, after the row of men. This is what the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) instructed us to do. So we must abide by these etiquettes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then when the child reaches ten years of age, and non-compliance and rebelliousness (against this order) arises in him, he should be hit for the purpose of disciplining and intimidating him until he prays and safeguards all of his prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Children should be separated in their beds at this age also, i.e. each child must sleep by himself (in his own bed). This is the etiquette of Islaam.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[From an upcoming Al-Ibaanah publication: <b>&#8220;Raising Children in Light of the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah&#8221;</b> by &#8216;Abdus-Salaam As-Sulaymaan. The book was introduced and commended by Shaikh Saalih Al-Fawzaan.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>5. Choosing a School:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The father should strive to carefully choose a good school for his child, thus selecting the one that is of the finest quality and not necessarily the one that is closest to him. He should also ask those involved in the field of teaching and educating, who are sincere and honest, as to which of the schools is the best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">School has a deep impact on a student since it is there that he spends a quarter of his day – which is in fact the best time of the day. In the school he learns and is educated, and that is the place where he finds friends and companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So based on this, the father must keep a close connection with the school by going to visit it, staying in contact with it by phone and asking about the state of his son or daughter. He should be concerned with asking about his child’s character, behavior and friends before asking about his grades.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He should also follow up on his child’s educational development and studies, and check his notes and homework and be aware of the remarks the teacher makes to his child’s work so that he may correct it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So your concern with your child’s studies and your solid relationship with his school, his teachers, his schoolwork, and his levels of education is a good that will assist in his well-being and learning, by the will of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>6. Choosing a Friend:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the things in which there is no doubt is that a friend has a profound effect on an individual – whether positive or negative. Sufficient to clarify this point is the statement of the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) when he said: <b>“The example of the righteous companion and the evil companion is like that of a seller of musk and a blacksmith.”</b> [Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) also said: <b>“A man is upon the religion of his close friend, so let each of you look into whom he takes as a close friend.” </b>[Reported by Abu Dawood]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, O father, it is incumbent upon you to look for a good friend and a sincere companion for your child before he chooses one on his own, for he may choose the wrong ones and then grow attached to them, after which it will be hard for you to separate them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many accounts, too numerous to be recorded, in which children were raised in good environments and in conservative households but ended up mixing with bad companions on the pretext that they were going on a trip or an outing with them or using the excuse that they wanted to play with them or have fun with them or study with them. And the end result of this was that they had a negative effect on them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In these days it is extremely difficult for a father to raise his child in exclusion of friends. Trials and temptations constantly surround the youth from all directions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bad friends can either be people who are engulfed in their desires or in misconceptions. If they are those who are given into whims and desires, they will lead your child towards mischief and a digression from good character. As for those who follow misconceptions, they will lead your child towards innovations and opposing the guidance of the pious predecessors (<i>Salaf as-Saalih</i>). Perhaps he may even fall into the acts of declaring Muslims disbelievers and innovators. This particularly applies to the members of those methodologies that are foreign to this country (i.e. Saudi Arabia), as has occurred to some of our youth, may Allaah guide them and return them back to the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In conclusion, I ask Allaah to rectify for all of us our intentions and offspring, and that He forgive our parents, granting them the best of rewards on our behalf. I ask Allaah to assist us in being dutiful to them during their lives as well as after their deaths.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also ask Allaah to aid us in raising our children upon the Qur’aan and the Sunnah and to make them righteous offspring and an enjoyment to our eyes in this life by, through their uprightness, and after death, through their righteous deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May the peace and praises of Allaah be upon our prophet Muhammad.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1773.</b>  An-Nu`man bin Bashir (May Allah be pleased with them) said: My father took me to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and said to him: &#8220;I have gifted one of my slaves to this son of mine.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Have you given such gift to every son of yours?</span>&#8221; He replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; Thereupon he said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Take this gift back</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">     Another narration is: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Be mindful of your obligation to Allah and do justice in respect of your children.</span>&#8221; My father came back and revoked his gift.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">     Another narration is: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) asked, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Have you other children besides this one?</span>&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) asked, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Have you awarded a gift like this to all of them</span>.&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">I am not going to bear witness to this act of injustice</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">    Another narration is: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) asked, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do you not except goodness from all of them as you except from him?</span>&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, of course.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Then don&#8217;t do this (i.e., do not give a gift to one son only)</span>.&#8221;<br />

Chapter 164<br />
Superiority of one who is Bereaved of his Infants</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>952.</b> Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Any Muslim who loses three children before they reach the age of maturity, will be granted Jannah by Allah, the Exalted, out of His Mercy for them.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>953.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;A Muslim whose three children die (in infancy) will not be touched by the Fire (of Hell) except for the fulfillment of Allah&#8217;s Oath.&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Allah&#8217;s Oath here refers to His Ayah:<span style="color:#ff0000;"> &#8220;There is not one of you but will cross over it (Hell).&#8221;</span> (19:71) And the crossing will be across the `Bridge&#8217; set over the Hell.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>954.</b> Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: A woman came to the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Only men benefit from your talks, so please fix a day for us, to teach us the knowledge which Allah has taught you<span style="color:#008000;">.</span>&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) fixed a day and directed them to assemble. When they gathered, the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) went to them and taught them what Allah had taught him. He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) then said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Any woman of you whose three children die (in infancy) they will be a guard for her against Fire (of Hell).&#8221;</span> One of the women asked: &#8220;What if she loses two?&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Even two.&#8221;</span><br />

Urging one&#8217;s kith and kin to Obey Allah and refrain from evils</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;And enjoin Salat (the prayer) on your family, and be patient in offering them (i.e., the Salat).&#8221;</b></span><b> (20:132)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell), whose fuel is men and stones.&#8221;</b></span><b> (66:6)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>298.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Al-Hasan bin `Ali (May Allah be pleased with them) took one of the dates of the Sadaqah (charity) and put it in his mouth, whereupon Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Leave it, leave it, throw it away. Do you not know that we do not eat the Sadaqah (charity)?&#8221;</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>299</b>. `Umar bin Abu Salamah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: I was a boy under the care of Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), and my hand would wander about in the dish. Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said to me<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Mention Allah&#8217;s Name (i.e., say Bismillah before you start eating), eat with your right hand and eat from what is near to you&#8221;.</span> I always followed this way of eating after this incident.<br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>300.</b> Ibn `Umar (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;All of you are guardians and are responsible for your subjects. The ruler is a guardian and responsible for his subjects; the man is a guardian of his family; the woman is guardian in her husband&#8217;s house and responsible for her wards; a servant is guardian of his master&#8217;s property and responsible for his ward. So all of you are guardians and are responsible for your subjects&#8221;.</span><br />
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>301.</b> `Amr bin Shu`aib reported on his father&#8217;s authority that his grandfather (May Allah be pleased with him) said: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Command your children to perform Salat (prayer) when they are seven years old, and beat them for (not offering) it when they are ten, and do not let (boys and girls) sleep together&#8221;.</span><br />
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>302.</b> Sabrah bin Ma`bad Al-Juhani (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Teach a boy Salat (the prayer) when he attains the age of seven years, and punish him (if he does not offer it) at ten&#8221;.</span><br />
[Abu Dawud and Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narration in Abu Dawud is: Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said,<span style="color:#0000ff;"> &#8220;Order a boy to perform Salat (the prayer) when he is seven years old&#8221;.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A son was born to me and I took him to the Prophet who named him Ibrahim, did Tahnik for him with a date, invoked Allah to bless him and returned him to me. (The narrator added: That was Abu Musa&#8217;s eldest son.)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 66, Number 377:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A boy was brought to the Prophet to do Tahnik for him, but the boy urinated on him, whereupon the Prophet had water poured on the place of urine.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 66, Number 378:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Asma&#8217; bint Abu Bakr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I conceived &#8216;Abdullah bin AzZubair at Mecca and went out (of Mecca) while I was about to give birth. I came to Medina and encamped at Quba&#8217;, and gave birth at Quba&#8217;. Then I brought the child to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and placed it (on his lap). He asked for a date, chewed it, and put his saliva in the mouth of the child. So the first thing to enter its stomach was the saliva of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Then he did its Tahnik with a date, and invoked Allah to bless him. It was the first child born in the Islamic era, therefore they (Muslims) were very happy with its birth, for it had been said to them that the Jews had bewitched them, and so they would not produce any offspring.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 66, Number 379p:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Talha had a child who was sick. Once, while Abu Talha was out, the child died. When Abu Talha returned home, he asked, &#8220;How does my son fare?&#8221; Um Salaim (his wife) replied, &#8220;He is quieter than he has ever been.&#8221; Then she brought supper for him and he took his supper and slept with her. When he had finished, she said (to him), &#8220;Bury the child (as he&#8217;s dead).&#8221; Next morning Abu Talha came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and told him about that. The Prophet said (to him), &#8220;Did you sleep with your wife last night?&#8221; Abu Talha said, &#8220;Yes&#8221;. The Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah! Bestow your blessing on them as regards that night of theirs.&#8221; Um Sulaim gave birth to a boy. Abu Talha told me to take care of the child till it was taken to the Prophet. Then Abu Talha took the child to the Prophet and Um Sulaim sent some dates along with the child. The Prophet took the child (on his lap) and asked if there was something with him. The people replied, &#8220;Yes, a few dates.&#8221; The Prophet took a date, chewed it, took some of it out of his mouth, put it into the child&#8217;s mouth and did Tahnik for him with that, and named him &#8216;Abdullah.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 66, Number 379i:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As above.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 66, Number 380:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salman bin &#8216;Amir Ad-Dabbi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;&#8216;Aqiqa is to be offered for a (newly born) boy, so slaughter (an animal) for him, and relieve him of his suffering.&#8221; (Note: It has been quoted in Fateh-AL-Bari that the majority of the Religious Scholars agrees to the Hadith narrated in Sahih At-TlRMlZY that the Prophet was asked about Aqiqa and he ordered 2 sheep for a boy and one sheep for a girl and that is his tradition &#8220;SUNNA&#8221;.)</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 66, Number 381:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Habib bin Ash-Shahid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Sirin told me to ask Al-Hassan from whom he had heard the narration of &#8216;Aqiqa. I asked him and he said, &#8220;From Samura bin Jundab.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 66, Number 382:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>

Video Courtesy : Bilal Nahim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">كيف يعلم الأب أبناءه التوحيد؟<br />
Translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Allama Muhammad bin Salih al-Uthaymeen</strong> <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How does a father teach his children <em>Tawheed</em>?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> He answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> ● &#8216;He teaches them <em>Tawheed</em> just like he teaches them other matters of the <em>Deen</em>. From the best of what is in this subject is the book <strong>&#8216;The Three Principles&#8217;</strong> by Shaykh-ul-Islaam Muhammad bin AbdulWahab. If he makes them <strong>memorise</strong> it by heart and <strong>explains </strong>to them its meanings appropriately to their understanding and their intellects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there comes a lot of goodness from this. This is because this book is built upon questions and answers, and clear easy expressions, which have no complexity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the father <strong>shows them the <em>Ayaat</em> of Allaah (His signs)</strong> so that he can practically implement what is mentioned in this small book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example,  the sun, the father asks, who created it? Likewise the moon,  the stars,  the night and day, you say to them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;The sun, who created it? Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The moon?   Allaah,  the night?  Allaah, the day?  Allaah.  Allaah -Azza wa Jal- created all of these. This is so that one can water the tree of the <em>Fitrah</em> (the natural disposition) because the human himself has been created with his natural disposition upon <em>Tawheed</em> of Allaah -Azza wa Jal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Like the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(كل مولود يولد على الفطرة ، فأبواه يهودانه أوينصرانه أو يمجسانه)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Every newborn is born upon the <em>Fitrah</em> (natural disposition), so it is his parents who either make him into a Jew or into a Christian or into a Majoos (fire worshipper).&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">● Also he <strong>teaches them <em>Wudu</em></strong>, how to make <em>Wudu</em> by demonstration and saying: This is how one does <em>Wudu</em>, and he performs the <em>Wudu</em> in front of him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">● Likewise the <strong><em>Salah</em> </strong>(prayer), along with taking aid with Allaah Ta&#8217;ala, and asking Allaah -Azza wa Jal- for guidance for them. Also, that one keeps away from any statement which opposes good behaviour or every prohibited action, so he should not get them used to lying,  cheating and treachery,  nor lowly manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even if the father was trialed by prohibited actions, like if he was trialed by smoking,  he should not smoke in front of them because they will get used to it and it will become easy upon them to do it as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> One should know that every man of a household is responsible for the people of the house, due to the saying of Allah Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(يَا أَيُّهَاالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا قُوا أَنفُسَكُمْ وَأَهْلِيكُمْ نَاراً)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">《 <span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Ward off from yourselves and your families a Fire (Hell)</span>》[Tahreem: 6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our protecting them from the fire cannot be except if we get them used to righteous actions and to leave off bad actions. The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> affirmed that in his saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(الرجل راع في أهله ومسؤول عن رعيته)<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;A man is a shepherd for his family and he is responsible for his flock.&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A father should know that their being righteous is beneficial to him in this world and the hereafter Indeed from the closest of people to their fathers and mothers are the righteous children, male and female.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(وإذا مات الإنسان انقطع عمله إلا من ثلاث: صدقة جارية، أو علم ينتفع به،أو ولد صالح يدعو له )<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;When a person dies his actions cease except for three: continuous charity,  or knowledge people benefit from,  or a righteous child who supplicates for him.&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah Ta&#8217;ala to aid all of us upon carrying out the trust and responsibility.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">[Silsilah Noor ala Darb. Tape: 350 side A]</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>From Umm &#8216;Abdillah Al-Waadi&#8217;iyyah&#8217;s &#8220;My Advice to the Women&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Umm &#8216;Abdillah Al-Waadi&#8217;iyyah&#8217;s &#8220;Naseehati Lin-Nisaa&#8217; &#8221; (My Advice to the Women).   I typed this excerpt from the english translation published by Tarbiyyah Bookstore.  To save time in typing, I omitted the chains of narration for the ahadeeth (but still included all references), as some of them were rather long.  Other than that, I didn&#8217;t deviate from the translated text, translated by the brother Abul-Layth</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Chapter: Whoever Does Not Show Mercy Will Not Be Shown Mercy (pages 117-122):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Hurayrah narrated that the Messenger of Allah, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa salam, kissed Al-Hasan while Al-Aqra ibn Haabis at-Tameemee was sitting near him.  A-Aqra said, &#8220;Indeed I have ten children and I have never kissed any of them.&#8221;  The Messenger of Allah looked at him and said,  &#8220;Whoever does not show mercy will not be shown mercy.&#8221;  [Saheeh al-Bukhaari, 426/10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Shaddaad ibn Aws who said that the Messenger of Alah, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa salam, said, &#8220;Verily Allah has perscribed al-ihsaan (excellence) for everything.  So when you kill, you should kill in the best manner.  And when you slaughter, you should slaughter in the best manner.  Let each of you sharpen his knife to provide ease for his animal.&#8221;  [Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Al-ihsaan&#8221; or &#8220;excellence&#8221; in the arabic language is procifency in performing an action, while perfecting it with sincerity.  In Islaamic law, Al-Ihsaan is what the Prophet, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa salam, has explained in his statement:  &#8220;That you worship Allah as though you see Him, but since you are un able to see Him, then He most certainly sees you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Rajab said concerning the prophetic narration of Shaddaad, &#8220;This prophetic narration indicates the obligation of excellence in all of the actions.&#8221;  [Jami&#8217;Al-Uloom 151]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the types of mercy which can be shown to a child is kissing him:  &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah said that a Bedouin man came to the Prophet, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa salam, and  said, &#8220;You (people) kiss the children and we do not kiss them.&#8221;  So the Prophet said, &#8220;Is there anything that I can do once Allah has removed mercy from your heart?&#8221;  [Saheeh Al-Bukhari 426/10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umayr ibn Ishaaq said, &#8220;I was with Al-Hasan ibn &#8216;Alee when we met with Aboo Hurayrah who said, &#8220;Show me where I might kiss you in the place where I saw the messenger of Allah kiss.&#8221;  He replied, &#8220;Al-Qameesah&#8221; (shirt or upper garment), He said, &#8220;So he kissed the front of his stomach.&#8221;  [Ahmed with a hasan chain]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the types of mercy that can be shown to a child is carrying him while in prayer.  Abu Qataadah said that the Prophet, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, came out to us with Umaamah bint Abeel-&#8216;Aas on his shoulders.  Then he prayed.  When he bowed, he placed her on the ground and when he rose from bowing, he lifted her back off the ground.&#8221;  [Saheeh Al-Bukhaari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Shaddaad, from his father, who said that the Prophet, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, came out to us for one of the &#8216;ishaa prayers carrying Hasan and Husayn.  The Messenger of Allah stepped forward and set them both down.  Then he prayed and prostrated between their backs a single prostration that was lengthy.  My (Abu Shaddaad&#8217;s) father said, &#8216;Then I raised my head and the child was on the back of the Messenger of Allah while he was prostrating.  I then returned to my prostration.&#8217;  So once the Messenger of Allah had completed his prayer, the people said, &#8216;O Messenger of Allah, certainly you have prostrated between two backs in your prayer.  Certainly the length of this prostration led us to believe that something had happened or that revelation had decended upon you.&#8217;  He, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, said, &#8216;None of that occured, rather this child moved around me and I didn&#8217;t wish to disturb him until he had finished.&#8217;  [hadeeth collected in An-Nasaa&#8217;ee, authenticated by Shaykh Muqbil]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the types of mercy that can be shown to smaller children is playing with them:  Umm Khaalid bint Khaalid ibn Sa&#8217;eed said, &#8220;I came to the Messenger of Allah, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, along with my father and I was wearing a yellow shirt.  The messenger of Allah said, &#8216;Sanah, sanah!&#8217; (this means &#8216;good&#8217; in the ethiopian langauge)  Umm Khaalid further said, &#8216;Then I started playing with the seal of Prophethood.  My father admonished me, but the Messenger of Allah said (to my father) &#8216;Leave her.&#8217;  The Messenger of Allah then addressed me saying, &#8216;Ablee wa akhliqee, thumma ablee wa akhliqee, thumma ablee wa akhliqee.&#8217; (Trans. note: This phrase &#8216;ablee wa akhliqee&#8217; is used by the arabs to supplicate for an extended life.  Its meaning could be conveyed in the following expression: &#8216;May you live so long that your garments become worn and ragged.&#8217;)  So she (Umm Khaalid) remained this way until (this supplication for her became actualized and subsequently) she would be mentioned by the people,&#8221; meaning that she would remain until her garments became old and ragged.  [Saheeh Al-Bukhaari 425/10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mahmood ibn Ar-Rabee&#8217; said, &#8220;I remember when I was a boy of Five years old, the Prophet, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, took water from a bucket with his mouth (majjatan majjahaa) and threw it in my face.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh said, &#8221; &#8216;Majj&#8217; is the expelling of water from the mouth.  It is said that nothing is refered to as &#8216;majj&#8217; except if it is from a distance.   The action of the Prophet, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, with Mahmood was either from his play with him or it was a means of blessing him with it just as he used to do with the children of his companions.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas ibn Maalik said, &#8220;Certainly the Prophet, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, used to spend time with us to the extent that he even said to my young brother, &#8216;Oh father of &#8216;Umayr, what did the little birdie do?&#8217;  &#8221;  [Saheeh Al-Bukhaari 526/10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, from the types of mercy that can be shown to a child is placing the child in one&#8217;s lap.  &#8216;Usaamah ibn Zayd said that the Messenger of Allah, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, used to take me and place me on his thigh and he would place al-Hasan ibn &#8216;Alee on his other thigh, then he would come close to us and say, &#8220;Oh Allah!  Please be merciful to them, for indeed, I am merciful to them.&#8221;  [Saheeh Al-Bukhaari 434/10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, this is how one might be affectionate with the smaller children concerning everything they might need or how they might be amused.  This is an appropiate means of showing them mercy and affection, as long as this does not lead towards bringing about improper behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Certainly the Prophet, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, has praised the women of Quraysh because they possessed praiseworthy characteristics and from them is their affection for children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated upon Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, said, &#8220;The best wome to ever ride the camel were the women of Quraysh.&#8221;  [Saheeh Al-Bukhari 511/9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said, &#8220;The most righteous from the women of Quraysh are those who are most affectionate (&#8220;ahnaah&#8221;) to the child during its youth and who are most protective concerning their husband&#8217;s property.&#8221;  Al-Haafidh said that &#8220;ahnaah&#8221; is from affection, which is compassion and tenderness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The mercy that is shown to the young children and other than them is from the reasons that cause a person to achieve the mercy of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has also reached us from the Prophet, slallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, that he said, &#8220;He is not from us who does not show mercy to the young and does not honor the old.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Muhammad &#8216;Umar Baazmool<br />
Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This book is a complete translation of the concise booklet <b><i>“Fildhaat-ul-Akbaad Huqooq-ul-Awlaad”</i></b> (Your Flesh and Blood: A Lecture on the Rights of Children). The source used for the translation was the 2006 Daar-ul-Istiqaamah Edition. The origin of this publication in the Arabic language was a lecture the Shaikh gave which was then transcribed and published in book format. All quotes and narrations are referenced in the original publication.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Although small in size, this booklet presents the readers with a valuable discussion on some of the rights and privileges of children, which parents are obligated to fulfill. Indeed, it is not only the children who will be asked concerning their behavior towards their parents on the Day of Judgement but also the parents will be asked concerning their children and how they raised them. Therefore, we must know the rights of our children and strive to fulfill our duties towards them so that they in turn may serve as righteous deeds for us and benefit us after we die.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Muhammad Baazmool is one of the well known people of knowledge in Saudi Arabia. Currently, he serves as a member of the teachers’ committee in the College of Da’wah and Usool-ud-Deen at Umm-ul-Qurraa University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia. He has authored numerous books and given many lectures, some of which have been transcribed, as is the case with this booklet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Excerpts from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah has given importance to the caring and maintaining of our flesh and blood since their inception – from the time that a Muslim thinks about getting married. The Messenger ordered every youth to strive towards marriage on the condition that he can accommodate a wife, i.e. he has the ability to fulfill the responsibilities of marriage and the obligations of marital life.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Thereafter, he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) ordered us to choose a righteous wife. This is since the Messenger informed us of the effect that a person’s immediate family has over him in the narration reported by Abu Salamah bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan who related from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: <b>‘There is no child except that he is born upon true faith (Fitrah), but it is his parents that make him a Jew or a Christian or a Zoroastrian. Just as an animal gives birth to a baby animal that is whole, do you find it mutilated?’</b> Then Abu Hurairah recited: <b>‘…the Fitrah of Allaah which He created mankind upon.’</b> [Surah Ar-Room: 30]”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Messenger of Allaah has instructed us how to expiate this fitnah. Hudhaifah reported: ‘We were sitting one day with ‘Umar when he asked us: ‘Which one of you memorized the words of Allaah’s Messenger concerning trials?’ I replied: ‘I did, just as he said it.’ He said: ‘You are quick to respond!!’ I said: <b>‘A man’s trials with regard to his family, his wealth, his children and his neighbor are expiated by prayer, fasting, charity, and commanding (good) and forbidding (evil).’</b>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“A Muslim may work and comply with all of the things (we just mentioned) and ask Allaah for success and assistance. However, what occurs may be something other than what you intended. So you must know that this is part of Allaah’s Divine Decree which He has allowed to occur. Just look at the son of the messenger of Allaah, Nooh, and at how he wasn’t righteous. And look at the wife of Loot who also wasn’t righteous, as well as the wife of Nooh, even though they were married to prophets of Allaah. Allaah says: <b>‘And Nooh called upon his Lord and said: ‘O my Lord, verily my son is of my family! And certainly Your promise is true, and You are the most just of judges. He said: ‘O Nooh! Surely, he is not of your family. Verily, it is an act that is dishonorable. So do not ask Me about that of which you have no knowledge. I admonish you lest you should be one of the ignorant.’ Nooh said: ‘O my Lord! I seek refuge in you from asking You about that which I have no knowledge of. And unless You forgive me and have mercy on me, I would indeed be one of the losers.’</b> [Surah Hood: 45-47]”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In her biographical account of her father, Umm ‘Abdillaah Al-Waadi’iyyah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“His father died while he was young and he didn’t know him. So he grew up as an orphan and under the care of his mother for a period of time. She would ask him to work to make money and order him to look at the state of his community so that he could be like them. But he would turn away from this and say: <strong>‘I will go out to study.’</strong> So she would say: <strong>‘May Allaah guide you.’</strong> (<strong>hadaakAllaah). </strong>She would supplicate for him to be guided, as several women who were around at that time informed me. Perhaps her supplication coincided with the time when supplications are accepted since he became one of the guided, guiding others.” [<i>Nubdhah Mukhtasarah</i>: pg. 18]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Do not pray against your children:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sal Allahu alaihi wa sallam) forbade praying against one&#8217;s children, one&#8217;s wealth and one&#8217;s own self, lest that be at a time when the du&#8217;aa is answered. He (sal Allahu alaihi wa sallam) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Do not pray against yourselves, do not pray against your children, do not pray against your wealth, lest that coincides with a time when Allah is asked and He gives, so He answers your prayer.&#8221; </span></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>ADVICE FOR THE YOUTH IN THE BEGIN STAGES OF UPRIGHTNESS</strong></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">By: Shaykh Abdul Aziz Aali Shaykh</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Asalaamu alaikum may Allaah treat you well and the muslim benefit from your knowledge; the questioner asks: for the youth that are in the being stage of uprightness (upon the truth); what do you advise him with? And how does he know the people who are upon the sound Manhaj from those who are upon an evil Manhaj? </span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I advise him with the fear of Allaah and the praising of Allaah for saving him from misguidance and going astray and guided him to the straight path. (Also) <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>let him</strong> <strong>search for the scholars who are adhering to the legislation (of Islam)</strong></span>; and <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>let him read their books and be diligent in gaining understanding of the religion of Allaah. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Let him</span> <span style="color:#000000;">distance himself from those who don&#8217;t have ability to be apparent in front of the people</span></strong>; And their followers are only hidden and concealed. Certainly these are the things that diverts from the upright inclination. These people desire that their evil affairs be concealed; so let him distant himself from these people. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Let him search for a scholar that possesses taqwa</strong></span>; and he will give him insight and direct him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He should read much of the Quran, Sunnah and the books of creed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah that He prepares him for the possession of knowledge and that he is taken by his hand to what’s good.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">We should (truly) be afraid of the reality of shirk since Ibraaheem (`alayhis-salaam) was the Imaam of the monotheists, and he demolished the idols with his hands, yet still feared falling into shirk. If the Imaam of the monotheists, Ibraheem (`alayhis-salaam), feared shirk for his own being, should we not, as average every-day monotheists, be moreso afraid for ours?</p>

<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">Here, one of the sisters asks: What is the ruling on clothing children with clothes which contains pictures of things which have souls if it is not possible to erase these pictures from them, because by erasing them (the pictures), the garment is spoiled?</span></p>
<p>So, the Sheikh replied:</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p>Without doubt, it has to be said, that for the likes of this question, the purchasing of the garment which is illustrated with pictures, has to have definitely already occurred by mistake or negligence from the father or mother who bought (it), because <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>the fundamental principle is that it is not appropriate for the Muslims that they purchase clothes which have pictures on them</strong></span>. However, a person may be unaware, and he may be negligent, and they may forget…and he may forget and he may purchase a garment, (and) after he returns with it to his house it becomes clear to him that there is a full prohibited picture on it. So, in this situation also, this question (above) is not to be found. It is imperative that another introduction precede it (this question), and it is…the changing of the garment for another garment from the place where it was purchased from, (whereby this new garment) does not have on it a prohibited picture. So if… so if it was not possible for the father or the mother to change it (for another garment), then here in the third stage (of this situation) this question comes about.</p>
<p>So, I remind about these two introductions (which should be placed before the question) because the majority of the people are heedless when they proceed to the markets. They buy everyday necessities (which are made) from different materials, from them which are the likes of those things which are spread out (carpets, rugs, mats etc.) and blankets or what resembles that, those (things) which are predominantly illustrated with pictures and decorated. And they do not pay any attention to them at all (these materials which have pictures) and they buy them <strong><span style="color:#993300;">with the excuse that these materials are not respected (because they are sat on, slept on etc.) and are not hung up</span></strong>. So, we say: It is imperative upon the Muslims that they be those who are awake (and) not those who are asleep, and that they pay attention to the plot of the disbelievers, those who are invading them in the midst of their own house with diverse ways – and that which is from them (these ways) are these clothes which are illustrated with pictures.And it (this matter) is mentioned bit by bit, specifically if the people are in need of it. And in a manner more specific when they are made heedless through some of the erroneous guidelines, through some of the fataawa (religious edicts) which are not based upon authentic proof, like (the fataawa for) these dolls and children’s toys which cram up the markets and the mothers go and buy for the boys and girls many a thing from these amusements in the name of them (being) toys for children or toys for girls.</p>
<p>So, it is imperative that we remember something here, and it is that the toys (i.e. dolls) which are allowed to be used for the small children… rather I say for girls only and not for the males from the children, that there is not out there any proof for the permissibility (of these toys/dolls) except the hadeeth of ‘Aaishah (may Allah be pleased with her) which says that she used to send for the daughters from the daughters of her neighbours to come to her and she would play with them with girls’ toys and the Messenger (sallallahu ‘alaihi wa ‘ala aalihi wa sallam) would help her in that and consent to her (doing that) and he would not rebuke her. Rather, indeed he (sallallahu ‘alaihi wa ‘ala aalihi wa sallam) [entered upon her] one time and saw amongst her toys a horse with two wings. So he (‘alaihi salaam) said to ‘Aaishah, playing about with her: ‘A horse which has two wings?!’ She said: ‘O’ Messenger of Allah, have you not heard’ or ‘has it not reached you that the horse of Sulaymaan (‘alaihi salaam) had wings?’ and he (‘alaihi salaatu wa salaam) laughed and he affirmed her in that. This hadeeth is the proof which makes it possible for us to rely upon it in allowing girl’s toys (i.e. dolls) with images and sculptured forms.</p>
<p>However, there is a principle of fiqh (jurisprudence) out there that every text which comes and carries within its folds a ruling which is an exception from the general proofs, then this ruling is halted at and it is not increased upon because it is against the fundamental principle. And that which was like that, i.e. that which was against the fundamental principle, then an analogy (qiyaas) is not made from that which was irregular to the fundamental principle, (and) because that which was against (an) analogy (being made with it), cannot (then) be used to make (a further) analogy based upon it, and indeed it is but connected (back) to the general principle.</p>
<p>If this meaning is clear to all, inshaa’Allah, then at this time we say: The toys which Sayyidah ‘Aaishah (may Allah be pleased with her) [had], they were from that type which some of the other women engaged in, in diverting the attention of their children away from requesting food and drink in the state of them fasting. And indeed they (the women) used to take for them images from coloured wool, from cotton and give them to those who were fasting from the youngsters, diverting their attention away from requesting food and drink. This type from the images, this type from the toys of the children, it was a local (type of image and toy) and it was a domestic [i.e. in the house] (type of image and toy), and it was not imported from outside the Islamic households, let alone being imported from the lands of disbelief and misguidance which manufacture toys and figures which are in accordance with their tastes, with their habits and their customs, and which do not agree in any way whatsoever with the habits of the Muslims and their customs and the rulings of their share ‘ah. <span style="color:#339966;">And from that which shows you this, is what you see in these (imported) images, from the (imported) figures (which) sometimes are small (in size) and sometimes are big (in size), until (even) a young girl (who) can just about hold the doll and (yet) it is the same length as her and the same width as her and it has blond hair and clipped (in its hair) from the sides like the male children. And it (the imported doll) has a garment which are shorts i.e. the garment which has no legs to it, and it has the short garment which reveals the thighs (of the dolls). These sculptured forms contain the customs of those disbelievers and their habits and their mannerisms.</span></p>
<p>So, if we entered these sculptured forms into our houses, then first that (shows) that we are pleased with what they contain (i.e. from the customs, habits and mannerisms of those who made them)…firstly…, and secondly, that we are teaching our children (those) mannerisms and that we are bringing them up since their tender age upon finding pleasant these objects which are mutually contradictory to the Islamic clothing, and in particular that which is related to the men. And due to this, it is imperative upon us to beware of these imported clothes from the lands of disbelief with their [different] types and their (different) forms and their (different) purposes, and from that are the clothes of young children.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#993300;">So we, with great sorrow, every time we enter a house we find the children of our brothers, those who adhere – according to our claim – to the Book of our Lord and the Sunnah of our Prophet, despite all of that, we find that the children have been dressed in clothes which have pictures on them and lewd pictures. Then, this calamity has spread until we have begun to clothe our youths who have passed the age of responsibility with shirts which have pictures on the back and on the front. And (when) sometimes we pray the Friday prayer, there comes to the Friday prayer, as you know, the one who does not pray except on the day of Friday, and most of his life he spends in play and amusement and despite that he (stills) attends the Friday prayer. So, we see him praying and behind him i.e. on the back of his shirt, there is a picture of a woman with her hair flowing and visible from her is her arm and her neck and the likes of that, and we face this picture (whilst praying).</span></p></blockquote>
<p>These strange acts of heedlessness from the Muslims, I think that that which helps in spreading these shameful things and these Islamic violations is the saying that the prohibited images are indeed only but firstly, the three- dimensional images which have a shadow. As for that which is not three- dimensional, then these they claim are permissible and allowed and especially if they were not formed by the hand but were rather but formed with a photo camera or a printer. So, these are from the whisperings of shaytaan which he has thrown amongst humanity in this time and beautified for them (the fact) that there is nothing wrong with them.</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So, it is upon the Muslims therefore, to stay away from buying any type from the types of clothes which have these pictures on them due to what we have mentioned earlier.</strong></span></p>
<p>And in conclusion I say in response to that question (asked above): If the affair revolves around scraping off (the picture from) the garment and wasting the benefit from it and around seeking pleasure from it (the garment) despite its obvious and hidden shortcomings…I say if…., then seeking benefit (from it) is permissible. However, I believe that the believing woman and the one who with her capability is truly the mistress of the house, (should) <strong>erase the traces of that picture by scraping (it) off and with embroidery whereby the head is wiped out</strong> because the affair is as he (‘alaihi as salaam) said:</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><em>‘Indeed, the picture is but the head’.</em></span></p>
<p>So, if the head is wiped out, the picture is wiped out, even if some of its traces remain. And with this has the answer been completed inshaa’Allah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#008000;">Teaching the child Kalimatut-Tawheed</span></span><br />
(Laa Ilaaha Illallah – There is no god/deity deserving of worship in truth except Allah)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the book “<strong>Taribeeyatul-Awlaad fee Dhaw’il-Kitaab was Sunnah</strong>” (Educating the Children in the Light of the Book (Qur’aan) and the Sunnah), introduced by Ash-Shaykh, Al-Aalim, Ar-Rabbaaniyy (the educator)<strong> Saalih inb Fawzaan Al-Fawzaan</strong> (May Allah preserve him upon good) and prepared by Abdus-Salaam Ibn Abdillah Sulaymaan (May Allah preserve him upon good).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Point 12</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Teaching the child the Statement of At-Tawheed (Tawheed is to single out Allah alone, in all acts of worship).</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the first of what the child begins with in speech, obligatory upon al-waalidayn (the father and mother), is teaching him Kalimatut-Tawheed, and to instruct to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abbaas (May Allah be pleased with his father and him) narrates that An-Nabiyy (the Prophet) (Allah’s peace and blessings upon him) said: <span style="color:#008000;"><em>((Establish upon your children the first statement, Laa Ilaaha Illallah and instruct them at the time of death Laa Ilaaha Illallah)).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umm Sulaym (May Allah be pleased with her), used to teach her son Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) to say: <em><span style="color:#008000;">Laa Ilaaha Illallah (There is no god deserving of worship in truth except Allah). Say: I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and that was before Al-Fitaam (the end of 2 year suckling or nursing period of a baby from his mother).</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It must be repeated in front of him, and this is pertaining to the mother and she plays with him. It then becomes habitual. To bring about understanding, she explains to him a simple explanation teaching him its meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He knows that Allah is One, and He has no partner(s). He is Al-Khaaliq (The Creator). He is above the heavens, and He rises above His Arsh (Throne). He is fully aware (in sight and knowledge) over us and knowledgeable of our affairs. He hears and sees. Verily He is Al-Qaadir (His will and decree is over everything).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Trusting upon Allah becomes habitual and Allah is Ash-Shaafee (the One Who cures and gives good health). It is obligatory upon us to love Him and to worship Him. Likewise, the child is to be taught to love An-Nabiyy (Allah’s peace and blessings upon him), and to obey him. He is to be told something regarding his (An-Nabiyy) behaviour and his traits. That he loved children and played with them and similar to that of what she teaches him of their understanding.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is repeated upon them:<span style="color:#993300;"> ((Who is your Lord? Who is your Prophet? What is your Religion?)) and ((Where is Allah?)).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He learns about love of the Companions (May Allah be pleased with them all) and the righteous (May Allah have mercy upon them). He memorises Al-Faatihah, Suratul-Ikhlaas and Al-Mu’awwidhatayn ( Suratul-Falaq and Suratun-Naas).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Islam the youth have an important place and as such deserve specific attention.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here are a series of lectures delivered by our brother <strong>Abu Muhammad al-Maghribee</strong> on the <strong>24<sup>th</sup>, 25<sup>th</sup> and 26<sup>th</sup> February 2012</strong>.  May Allaah reward him for his efforts in speading the Da’wah of the Salaf and keep him sincere in his efforts, ameen!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Muhammad says: <strong>“The child is like dough, when it fresh piece of dough.  When he was born, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years they don’t know much.  They don’t know anything.  Just like that fresh dough, you can shape it well roung.  You can make it long you can make it square you can cut it you can make it anyway you want it.  But once you cook it and it’s hard, can you do something else with it?  You can’t!  You are stuck with that.  Like wise,  certain people they neglect their children until they become a teenager, and they are already set up on one way or a different way&#8230; all of a sudden now the parents want to do something about it&#8230;”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For those brother and sisters that have never heard a lecture by Abu Muhammad, give him a try.   I find his lectures to the youth [amongst others] have a beautiful way of attracting their attention and focusing them on a topic.  My children love his lectures very much.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But, that is not to say in anyway that the adults can’t benefit!  They should listen to the lectures they download whether they by by Abu Muhammad or anyone else before giving them to their children.</p>

English Translation: <strong>Taalib Abdullah (hafidhahullaah)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Brief note of correction &#8211; as recieved from Talib Abdullaah (hafidhahullaah) :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>It has been brought to my attention that I translated a phrase incorrectly on the CD Raising Muslim Children by Shaykh Saalih Fauzaan, may allah preserve him. The shaykh quoted the statement of Ibn Haazim may Allah have mercy upon him, stating that it is impermissible to name a child the servant of the creation like Abdul Azza etc. then he said even Abdul Muttalib I heard it as &#8216;aadah Abdul-Mutalib IE except Abddul-Mutalib. This is a mistake on my part. I ask you to please make your listeners aware of it, as I don&#8217;t desire to be responsible for any confusion on the part of the Muslims. I seek Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness and I apologize to you for any inconvenience you may incur because of it.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Some people commonly give their children names such as `Abdul-Nabiy (the servant of the Prophet), `Abdul-Hussayn (the servant of Al-Hussayn). What is the opinion of your Eminence on such names? Please advise us. May Allah reward you well.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is impermissible to give names indicating servitude to other than Allah (Exalted be He), i.e. it is prohibited to say <span style="color:#ff6600;">`Abdul-Nabiy, `Abd Aly, `Abdul-Hussayn</span> and so on. This is Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect), for such names should be denoting servitude to Allah Alone like `Abdul-Rahman (The Servant of The Most Compassionate), `Abdul-Rahim (The Servant of the Most Merciful), `Abdul-Malik (The Servant of The Sovereign), `Abdul-Quddus (The Servant of The Most Holy) etc. This is the right form of servitude, which is to be declared to None but Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn Hazm</strong> Abu Muhammad said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The widely-known opinion of scholars is to prohibit any name indicating servitude to other than Allah, such as <span style="color:#ff6600;">`Abd `Umar, `Abd Al-Ka`bah</span> and the like with the exception of <span style="color:#ff6600;">`Abdul-Muttalib</span>, as there is disagreement on that. In other words, scholars agree upon prohibiting this. Therefore, it is impermissible to give names showing servitude to other than Allah (Exalted be He) regardless of who the person is. Accordingly, it is impermissible to say: <span style="color:#ff6600;">`Abdul-Hussayn, `Abd `Umar, `Abdul-Nabiy, `Abdul-Ka`bah</span> and the like. Rather, a person should use either names signifying servitude to Allah (Exalted be He) or other names like Salih, Muhammad, Ahmad, Zayd, Khalid, Bakr and the like.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: I am a Muslim woman from Sweden. I write to you about a complex problem that befell me. Before I embraced Islam, I had been married to a non-Muslim man and gave birth to a child. I named him Mustafa. I and Mustafa&#8217;s father separated. Mustafa&#8217;s father wanted to raise the child. I feared that Mustafa&#8217;s father might use the religion for his own sake. So, I suggested that I sign an agreement with Mustafa&#8217;s father without the interference of the court. This agreement stipulates that:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">1- Mustafa&#8217;s father has the right to see his son for a certain period of time every year.</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">2- Mustafa&#8217;s father abides by respecting the traditions of Islam and never opposes the teachings set by Mustafa&#8217;s mother with regard to the rules of food and drink.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Now, let me narrate the story of my problem. I want to relate my problem in details to let you understand the case: when I accepted Islam, my mother was not happy and she hoped that I might forget the whole matter after a while. Some months later, I got married to a Muslim man, a matter that led my mother into a state of hysteria. As a result, she kidnapped Mustafa and called Mustafa&#8217;s father as well as the police and the social security. She told them falsehoods about me and my husband. She contacted the lawyer of Mustafa&#8217;s father and tried to get us out of our flat. She wrote a letter to the lawyer of Mustafa&#8217;s father and told him some lies about me and that I am not competent to raise Mustafa. She added that I am completely insane. In Sweden, the individuals have the right to embrace the religion they want, but it is natural that such case does not apply to the religion of Islam. I was very worried that I might lose Mustafa. When I signed the agreement with Mustafa&#8217;s father, I had the intention not to let him see Mustafa at all. I hoped to leave this country in the near future and get rid of this problem completely. Unfortunately, my husband does not yet have a residence document. This means that he can not get a Swedish passport, so we can not travel to any place. Cooperating with Mustafa&#8217;s father, my parents helped him with money and securing several things. Theyall do whatever they can against me and against Islam. I know that they intend to influence Mustafa to leave Islam in the same way they did with me. They did several things against me and my family, which I find no room or time to relate in this letter. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Now, let me ask the following questions:</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">1- Is it permissible for me to breach the agreement I signed with Mustafa&#8217;s father out of my fear so that Mustafa could live in peace?</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">2- Is it permissible for me to prevent Mustafa&#8217;s father from seeing his child?</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">3- Is it permissible for me to send Mustafa to another country?</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">4- Is it permissible for me in such case to travel alone? Or will I be in need of a Mahram (spouse or unmarriageable relative) to travel with me?</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">5- Do my parents have the legal right to see their grandson even though they are non-Muslims and plot against Islam?</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">6- Should I pay a visit to my mother despite the hostility she holds against me?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">I am very worried about Mustafa as this may cause him internal conflicts. Two months ago, Mustafa began to study at an Islamic school in Malm?o. He goes there everyday to learn the Holy Qur&#8217;an. He loves his school and classmates. Though he is Swedish, he speaks Arabic better than the Arab children themselves. He has memorized several Surahs (Qur&#8217;anic chapters).All Praise be to Allah that my son is very intelligent. However, I am always worried about him as I fear that his father may affect him and distract him from the Right Path of Islam, as his father is bad-tempered. I know that he is a liar when he says he respects my religion. This situation is not suitable for a child of this age. I am an adult and reasonable woman who feels strong through this religion. In addition, I can protect myself, but the child can not protect himself. It is not logical or permissible in the field of Islamic education for Mustafa to see his mother performing Salah (Prayer) and reciting the Holy Qur&#8217;an one day and see his father performing acts of Kufr (Disbelief) the next day. Mustafa may be inflicted with disorders, which may lead him to be unable to distinguish between what is right and what is wrong. I would be grateful if you would give a reply to my letter as quickly as possible. This is because I want to do what I can for Mustafa and his future so that he can be a pious Muslim, In-Shaa` Allah. I would like you to give me the ruling on the following question: Is it permissible for me in Islam to keep Mustafa away from his father who is a non-Muslim (a disbeliever)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: You are more entitled to raise your son, Mustafa, as long as his father is a disbeliever and you are a Muslim. Since you are a Muslim, Mustafa is regarded as a Muslim as well. This is because a disbeliever can not be a guardian of a Muslim, as Allah (Exalted be He) says in His Book, in Surah Al-Nisa&#8217;: <span style="color:#0000ff;">And never will Allâh grant to the disbelievers a way (to triumph) over the believers</span>. Allah (Exalted be He) says: <span style="color:#0000ff;">The believers, men and women, are Auliyâ’ (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question </strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">All praise be to Allah and may blessings and peace be upon the Messenger , his family and companions. To commence : The Permanent Committee for Islaamic Research and deliverance of legal rulings has looked into the question posed by the Executive secretary of the Punjabi assembly for the welfare of children to his Eminence, the President of the administration of the Islamic research, deliverance of rulings, propagation and guidance committee. The question was then referred to the General secretariat for the board of Great scholars numbered :2/86 dates 15/1/1392 Hijriy. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The questioner seeks information pertaining to the rules and principles concerning the rights of an adopted child regarding inheritance.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Adoption was known in the days of ignorance before the message of our Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alayhe was salaam. The adopted son would be ascribed to his foster father, inherit from him, allowed to be in seclusion with his wife and daughters and his foster fathers wife would be forbidden to him in marriage. On the whole the status of an adopted son was that of a begotten one in all affairs. The Prophet sallallahu alayhe was salaam adopted Zayd Ibn Haarith Ibn Sharaaheel al-Kilaby before the message of Islaam, and he used to be called Zayd Ibn Muhammad. This form of pre-Islaamic adoption continued until the third or fifth year after the migration to Madeenah(Hijraah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Then Allah ordered to ascribe adopted children to their fathers from those whose loins they originated, if they are known. If their original fathers are unknown they are considered brothers in the religion and as freed slaves to those who adopted them.<span style="color:#808000;"> He, glory be to Him forbade that a child should be ascribed to it&#8217;s foster in descent and forbade the child from attributing itself to other than it&#8217;s real father, except by a slip of the tongue in error , for there is no blame in that</span>. He, glory be to Him, verified that this ruling is pure justice due to it entailing truth in speech, preservation of lineage, honour, and the reservation of financial rights to those who are more deserving.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Most High said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;&#8230;.nor has He made your adopted sons your real sons. That is but your saying with your mouths. But Allâh says the truth, and He guides to the (Right) Way.Call them (adopted sons) by (the names of) their fathers, that is more just with Allâh. But if you know not their father&#8217;s (names, call them) your brothers in faith and Mawâlîkum (your freed slaves). And there is no sin on you if you make a mistake therein, except in regard to what your hearts deliberately intend. And Allâh is Ever Oft¬Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221;</span> (Al-Ahzab 33:4,5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore the Prophet sallallahu alayhe was salaam said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8221; Whoever attributes himself to other than his father or ascribes to other than his manumator(the person who frees a slave), then the continuous curse of Allah is upon him&#8221;.</em></span> [Narrated by Abu Daawood.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>At His termination of adoption, glory be to Him,</strong></span> ( that is the false acclaiming of son-ship), He terminated those rules that were linked with it in the pre-Islaamic period that had continued into the early stage of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a) He terminated inheritance between the adopted and the foster guardian by means of this false son-ship. He made it that each one should be charitable to the other in their lifetimes, and that a deserved share be bequeathed to the other from the deceased that does not exceed a third of his wealth. The Sharee&#8217;ah has clarified the laws of inheritance and the deserving heirs in detail without a mention of the adopted or his guardian amongst them. He, the most High, has also mentioned in general those who are to inherit of distant relatives out of kindeness to kin. The Most High said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;&#8230;..And blood relations among each other have closer personal ties in the Decree of Allâh (regarding inheritance) than (the brotherhood of) the believers and the Muhajirûn (emigrants from Makkah, etc.), except that you do kindness to those brothers (when the Prophet Sallallahu alayhe was salaam joined them in brotherhood ties)&#8230;.&#8221;</span>(Al-Ahzab 33:6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b) Allah has permitted the adopted son to marry the wife of his guardian after his term with her ends and this was forbidden in the pre-Islaamic period. He started with His Messenger in this to be the stronger in its legislation and tougher in terminating the custom of the people of the pre-Islaamic period in forbiddeing this. The Most High said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;&#8230;..So when Zaid had accomplished his desire from her (i.e. divorced her), We gave her to you in marriage, so that (in future) there may be no difficulty to the believers in respect of (the marriage of) the wives of their adopted sons when the latter have no desire to keep them (i.e. they have divorced them). And Allâh&#8217;s Command must be fulfilled.</span> (Al-Ahzab 33:37)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet sallallahu alayhe was salaam married Zaynab Bint Jahsh by the command of Allah after Zayd Ibn Haarithah had divorced her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. From the preceding ,<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> it is clear that the termination of adoption is not the termination of human emotions and Islamic rights such as brotherhood, love, keeping ties, and good treatment, and all that it linked with prestigious morals</span>. It is recommended to do good deeds, as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a) A person is allowed to call he who is younger than him with the words &#8221; O my son&#8230;&#8221; in treating him with kindeness , gentleness and making him feel loved, so that he may become friendly and listen to his advise or carry out his need. likewise, it is allowed for a person to call who is older than him with the words &#8220;&#8230;O my father..&#8221; out of respect for him and seeking his compassion in order to recieve his kindness , advise and help. Good manners can spread in the society and relationships between its members can strengthen due to this and all can feel a general feeling of brotherhood in faith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b) The Sharee&#8217;ah has encouraged cooperation in doing good and increasing the fear of Allah . It has been recommended for people from all walks of life to love and treat eachother well. The Most High said :<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Help you one another in Al¬Birr and At¬Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression. &#8230;..</span> (Al-Ma&#8217;idah 5:2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also the Prophet sallallahu alayhe was salaam said :<br />
<em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8221; The similitude of the believers is their love, compassion and kindness between one another is like that of a body, if a limb complains , the rest of the body collapses with fever and restlessness.&#8221; </span></em>[Narrated by Ahmad and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He sallallahu alayhe was salaam furthermore said :<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8221; The believers amongst themselves are like a structure, parts of it srengthen others&#8221;<br />
</em></span>[Narrated by Bukhari, Muslim, Tirmidthee and Nasaaee.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This includes the caring of orphans, the poor, those unable to work and those whose fathers are unknown by tending , raising, and treating them well. So that society may not contain those who are wretched and neglected for they could afflict the Ummah due to their bad upbringing or rebel for having felt the harshness of society and its neglect. It is upon the Islamic governments to establish centres for the disabled , orphans, abandoned children, those who have no families and those who fall under the rulings of these categories. If the treasury of the government does not suffice the needs of such people, assistance can be sought from the affluent of the Ummah, the Prophet sallallahu alayhe was salaam said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8221; Any believer who dies and bequeaths wealth, let his heirs whoever they may be inherit from him, if he bequeaths a debt or loss , then let his creditors refer to me, for I am his sponsor&#8221;.</span></em> [Narrated by Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah bless and send peace upon the Messenger , his family, and companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Question posed to Shaykh Ibn Baaz, rahimahullah:</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">Q. Are the deeds of a child who has not yet reached the age of puberty such as prayer, Hajj and the reading of the Qur&#8217;aan attributed to his parents or are they attributed to him?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A.  The good deeds of a child who has not yet reached the age of puberty and their rewards are for him and not for his parents or anyone else.  His parents are rewarded for having taught him to perform these deeds, for directing him to do good and for helping him in them.  This is indicated by the hadeeth in Saheeh Muslim, narrated by Ibn Abbaas, that a woman lifted a child to the Prophet, salallahu &#8216;alayhi wa salam, during his farewell Hajj and said:  &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, is there Hajj for him?&#8221;  He, salallahu &#8216;alayhi wa salam, replied:  &#8220;Yes, and there is reward for you.&#8221;The Prophet, salallahu &#8216;alayhi wa salam, informed us that the Hajj is for the child, and that his mother is rewarded for her Hajj with him.  Similarly, there is reward for others besides the child&#8217;s parents, for the good they do such as teaching orphans, relatives, servants and others, due to the Prophet&#8217;s, salallahu &#8216;alayhi wa salam, saying:  &#8220;For the one who guides to good, a reward similar to that of the one who performs it.&#8221;  Narrated in Saheeh Muslim.  This is because it is from the assisting one another in virtue and fearfulness of Allah and that He, Glory be to Him, rewards for this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from the book: Islamic Fataawa Regarding The Muslim Child<br />
Compiled By: Yahya Ibn Sa&#8217;eed Aale Shalwaan<br />
Translation And Footnotes By: Abu Ziyaad Ibn Mahmood Abdul-Ghafoor<br />
Pgs. 192-193</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwa 121:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allaah and may blessings and peace be upon His Messenger &#8230;To commence: I have read the article written by some journalists in the magazine &#8220;Al-Jazeerah&#8221; edition number: 3754 dated: 15/4/1403, according to the Hijri calendar, in which the free mixing of the sexes was suggested at the elementary school level. Due to the detrimental consequences of this suggestion, I see fit to warn against it, so I say: <span style="color:#ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Free mixing is a medium that leads to much evil and corruption, so its practice is not permissible</span></span>. The Prophet (sallAllahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Order your children to perform the prayer at seven years,<br />
spank them over it at ten and separate between them in the beds&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallAllahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) ordered that they be<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> separated between in their beds because their proximity to each other at the age of ten years or more can be a cause of the occurrence of indecent sexual acts due to free mixing</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No doubt, their gathering every day whilst they are in the elementary school level is also a cause of this, just as it is means for their free mixing in the remaining levels of education.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Under all circumstances the free mixing of boys and girls at this level is evil and not permissible due to it leading to various types of immorality. <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>The perfect Sharee&#8217;ah has obligated the forbidding of the means that lead to Shirk and disobedience</strong></span>. Much evidence from the Verses of the Qur&#8217;aan and Ahaadeeth have indicated towards this principle, if it were not for lengthiness I would have mentioned many of them. The great scholar Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy upon him mentioned ninety-nine pieces of evidence indicating towards this principle in his book (E&#8217;laam al-Muwaqqi&#8217;een). My advice to these journalists and others is not to suggest matters that open the doors of evil upon the Muslims that have been closed. We ask Allaah for guidance and success for all. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">It is sufficient for the sound minded to see what has occurred of immense immorality in the countries that have legalised free mixing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sheikh Ibn Baaz.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Question posed to <strong>Shaykh &#8216;Uthaymeen</strong>, rahimahullah:<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000;"><br />
</span><span style="color:#333300;">Q. My brother dresses his four year old daughter in a veil and says, &#8220;He who grows up upon something grows old upon it&#8221;, and he tries to force this upon my children.  Whereas I disagree with him in this, and say to him, when they reach their menses.  What is your opinion about this severity by which he has chained the childhood of this child at the age of four?  May Allah reward you with good.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. There is no doubt that your brother&#8217;s statement is the common occurance: He who grows up upon something grows old upon it, this is why the Prophet, salallahu &#8216;alayhi wa salam, has ordered the one who reaches the age of seven years to perform the prayer, even though he is not yet responsible for his actions, rather this is an order than he be accustomed to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for a young girl, there is no ruling concerning her private zone, it is not obligatory upon her to cover her face, neck and hands or feet, and it is not befitting that she be forced into this.  <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Whereas if she reaches a stage at which men start to become attracted to her, then she should wear the hijab to prevent trials and evil</span>.  This varies with different women, for there are some who develope quite rapidly, while others are the opposite of this.  Allah is the One Who gives success.</p>

<p>Assalamu Alaikum,</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>This is the Fatwa on educational cartoons. One is by Shaikh Fawzaan and the other by the Lajnah Ad Daaimah.</p>
</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaikh Salih Al Fawzaan</strong> was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling on nurturing children upon Cartoons of which the goal is to benefit them and teach them good manners?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah made pictures Haraam, and it is Haraam to acquire them so how can we nurture our children upon them?? How can we nurture them upon something that is Haraam, upon pictures that are Haraam and drawings that move and speak and are similar to human beings? This is an evil picture and it is unlawful to nurture children upon it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what the Kuffar want. They want us to oppose what the Messenger of Allah صلى الله عليه و سلم prohibited us from.  And the Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم prohibited us from pictures, and using them, and acquiring them. And those who spread it (cartoons) between the youth and the Muslims, claiming that it is from nurturing (the children) then this is immoral nurturing. And the correct nurturing is to teach them what will benefit them in their religion and worldly affairs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Link: ajurry.com/vb/showthread.php?t=12724</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the ruling on watching and buying islamic animated-cartoon movies, given that these movies present purposeful and beneficial stories for children which promote good character, dutifulness to parents, honesty, offering Salah (Prayer) regularly and the like. These animated movies are intended as good substitutes for television which has become widespread. However, the problem we face is related to the fact that such movies present hand-drawn pictures of humans and animals. Is it permissible to watch these animated cartoons? Please advise. May Allah reward you with the best!</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is not permissible to buy, sell or use cartoon movies, because they include Haram pictures. Raising children should be done in ways that are Islamically acceptable with regard to teaching, disciplining, encouraging them to offer Salah and taking good care of them</strong></span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: <strong>Fataawaa of Shaikh Al-Albaanee</strong> [Al-Asaalah, Issue #20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, said: &#8220;<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">Whoever loves that the people appear before him standing (up for him), then let him find his seat in the Hellfire.</span></span>&#8221; Reported by Al-Bukhaaree in Al-Adab-ul-Mufrad (977) and others</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It occurs from the path of Habeeb Ibn Ash-Shaheed on the authority of Abu Mujliz, who said: &#8220;Mu&#8217;awiyah entered a house in which was &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Az-Zubair and &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn &#8216;Aamir. So Ibn &#8216;Aamir stood up while Ibn Az-Zubair remained seated – and he was the one with the most experience of the two. So Mu&#8217;awiyah, radyAllaahu &#8216;anhumaa, said: &#8220;Sit O Ibn &#8216;Aamir for I heard the Messenger of Allaah, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, say: [and he mentioned the hadeeth]. At-Tirmidhee said: &#8220;It is a hasan hadeeth.&#8221; I say: Rather, it is a saheeh hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Mukhlis said in (his book) Al-Fawaa&#8217;id:<br />
&#8216;Abdullaah narrated to us: Dawood reported to us: Marwaan reported to us, Mugheerah Ibn Muslim As-Siraaj reported on the authority of &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Buraidah that he said: &#8220;Mu&#8217;awiyah went outside (one day) and saw that they were standing up because he was going out. So he said to them: Sit for the Messenger of Allaah, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, said: &#8216;Whoever is pleased that the Children of Adam (mankind) stand up for him, Hellfire becomes binding upon him.'&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth has an authentic chain of narration.<br />
Shabaaba Ibn Siwaar followed up the same hadeeth except that he reported &#8220;Whoever loves that men gather around him standing (up for him)…&#8221; and the rest is the same.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by At-Tahaawee (2/38/39) and Al-Khateeb in Taareekh Baghdaad (13/193). And the hadeeth has another supporting evidence with Al-Khateeb (11/361) in mursal form concerning a road story. He reported it from &#8216;Abd-ur-Razzaaq Ibn Sulaimaan Ibn &#8216;Alee Ibn Al-Ja&#8217;ad who said: I heard my father say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Once Al-Ma&#8217;moon (the Khaleefah at that time) went to visit the jewelers in the market place. So he haggled with them on the price of an object that they had. Then Al-Ma&#8217;moon embarked on completing some of his needs. Then he left, so everyone that was in that gathering stood up for him except for Ibn Al-Ja&#8217;ad, for he did not stand. So Al-Ma&#8217;moon looked at him with an expression of anger. Then he took him to the side and said: &#8216;O Shaikh, what prevented you from standing up for me as your companions stand up for me?&#8217; So he (&#8216;Alee Ibn Al-Ja&#8217;ad) said: &#8216;I honor the Ameer Al-Mu&#8217;mineen too much (to stand up for him) because of the hadeeth that we report from the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam.&#8217; He said: &#8216;What is it?&#8217; &#8220;Alee Ibn Al-Ja&#8217;ad said: &#8216;I heard Al-Mubaraak Ibn Fudaalah say: I heard Al-Hasan say: the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, said…[then he mentioned the hadeeth with the first wording]. So Al-Ma&#8217;moon lowered his head pondering over the hadeeth. Then he raised his head and said: &#8216;No one should buy except from this Shaikh.&#8217; So the people bought only from that Shaikh on that day till he had the amount of thirty thousand deenaars.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah&#8217;s saying:<br />
&#8220;And whoever fears Allaah, he will make a way out for him (i.e. from difficulty), and he will provide for him from places he never imagined&#8221; became a reality for &#8216;Alee Ibn Al-Ja&#8217;ad, the reliable and trustworthy reporter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Dainooree reported a similar story to this in Al-Muntaqaa min Al-Majaalisah: Ahmad Ibn &#8216;Alee Al-Basree narrated to us saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Al-Mutawakkil (the Khaleefah at that time) turned his attention to Ahmad Ibn Al-Mu&#8217;adhal and other scholars and so he gathered them in his home. Then he came out to them, so all of the people there stood up for him except Ahmad Ibn Al-Mu&#8217;adhal. So Al-Mutawakkil said to &#8216;Ubaidullaah. &#8216;This man does not agree with swearing allegiance to us (bay&#8217;ah).&#8217; So he (&#8216;Ubaidullaah) said to him: &#8216;Yes O Ameer Al-Mu&#8217;mineen, but he appears to have bad eyesight.&#8217; So Ahmad Ibn Al-Mu&#8217;adhal said: &#8216;O Ameer Al-Mu&#8217;mineen, I do not have any defect in my eyesight. But rather I removed you from the punishment of Allaah, the Most Exalted, for the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, said: &#8216;Whosoever loves that men present themselves to him standing (up for him), then let him find his seat in the Hellfire.&#8217; So Al-Mutawakkil went to sit down beside him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Asaakir reported in Taareekh Dimashq (19/170/2) with his chain of narration to Al-Awzaa&#8217;ee:<br />
Some of the guards of &#8216;Umar Ibn &#8216;Abd-il-&#8216;Azeez (the Khaleefah) narrated to me saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8216;Umar Ibn &#8216;Abd-il-&#8216;Azeez came out one day while we were waiting for him on the day of Jumu&#8217;ah. So when we saw him, we stood up. So he said: &#8216;When you see me do not stand up but instead spread out (to make way for passing).'&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Fiqh (understanding) of the Hadeeth: This hadeeth indicates two matters to us:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First: The prohibition of someone loving that people stand up for him when he enters. And this evidence is clear such that there is no need for it to be clarified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second: The disapproval of those sitting to stand up for the one who is entering, even if he doesn&#8217;t have a love for people standing up for him. This falls under the aspect of helping one another in goodness and avoiding opening the door to evil. And that is an accurate understanding that has been indicated to us by the narrator of the hadeeth, Mu&#8217;awiyah, radyAllaahu &#8216;anhumaa, when he refused that &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn &#8216;Aamir stand up for him, and he used this hadeeth as evidence for what he said. He did this because of his understanding and knowledge of the Religion and it&#8217;s legal principles, which include &#8220;preventing the means&#8221;, and because of his awareness of the natural dispositions of humans and their reactions to good and evil factors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if you were to imagine a community like the community of the first predecessors, they never practiced the custom of standing up for one another. It would be very rare that you find among them anyone that loved this kind of standing, which can throw someone into the Hellfire. And this was due to the lack of there being present that thing which would remind one about it – and it is the standing itself. On the other hand, if you were to look at a society like our society today, they have taken this particular type of standing as a normal custom. Indeed, this practice, particularly when done repeatedly, constantly reminds the person. So then the person&#8217;s soul desires it and finds pleasure in it until he ends up loving it. So when he loves it, he becomes ruined. So it becomes from the aspect of helping one another towards righteousness and Taqwaa to abandon doing this standing, even to those whom we feel don&#8217;t have a love for it, out of fear that our standing up for him will bring him to love it, for then we would be assisting him in bringing destruction to his soul and this is not permissible. Among the proofs that bear witness to this is when you see some of the people of knowledge of whom it is thought have good manners, their souls change when their eyes fall upon an individual that does not stand up for them. This is if they don&#8217;t become angry with him and attribute him with having little manners and give him the tidings of being prevented form the blessing of knowledge due to his lack of showing respect for its people, according to their claim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, there is even among them he who calls others to stand, deceiving them with such sayings as &#8220;You do not stand up for me for the sake of a body of flesh and bones, but rather you only stand up for the knowledge that is contained in my chest!!&#8221; As if the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216; alayhi wa sallam, did not have knowledge in his!! For the Companions did not used to stand up for him. Or is it that the Companions did not used to give him the respect that was befitting of him! So can a Muslim honestly say this or the other?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And due to this hadeeth and others beside it, a group of scholars have taken the opinion that it is prohibited to stand up for another person, as is stated in Al-Fath (4/14). Then he (Ibn Hajr) said: &#8220;The outcome of what has been reported on Maalik is the forbiddance of standing for the length of time that the one who is being stood up for doesn&#8217;t sit., even if he is busy serving himself. For he (Maalik) was asked about the woman who goes to great extents in hosting her husband, by receiving him, taking off his (outer) garments and standing until he sits? So he responded: &#8216;As for her receiving him, then there is nothing wrong with this. But as for her standing until he sits down, then no, for this is from the acts of the tyrants. And &#8216;Umar Ibn &#8216;Abd-il-&#8216;Azeez forbade this.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: There is nothing in this subject that presents a contradiction to the evidence found in this hadeeth at all. And those who oppose and hold the opinion that it is permissible to stand, rather that it is recommended, they use as evidence ahaadeeth, some of which are authentic and some of which are weak. But all of them, when one reflects on their chains of narration and texts do not present a contradiction to the evidences for that (prohibition).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what further confirms and clarifies this is the Prophet&#8217;s dislike of people standing up for him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There was no individual in the world that was more beloved to them than the Messenger of Allaah, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam. And when they would see him, they would not stand up for him due to what they knew of his dislike for that.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Al-Bukhaaree in Al-Adab-ul-Mufrad (946), At-Tirmidhee (2/125), At-Tahaawee in Mushkil-ul-Athaar (2/39), Ahmad (3/132), and Abu Ya&#8217;laa in his Musnad (2/183) and the wording is from him. It is from the path of Humaid on Anas, radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu. And At-Tirmidhee said: &#8220;It is a hasan saheeh hadeeth, ghareeb from this perspective.&#8221; I say its chain of narration is authentic according to the standards of Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth strengthens what the previous hadeeth has indicated from the forbiddance of standing out of respect and honor. This is since if standing up were a legislated form of showing respect, it would not be permitted for him sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam to make it disliked for his Companions. And he, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, is the most deserving of people to be shown respect and honor. And they, radyAllaahu &#8216;anhum, were the most aware of people of what he, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, deserved.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, hated this standing up for him to be done by his Companions. So therefore, it is upon the Muslims – especially if they are from the people of knowledge and exemplary figures – that they should hate that for themselves, in accordance with following his, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, way. And they should hate that for those Muslims beside themselves due to his saying: &#8220;None of you truly believes untill he loves for his brother what he loves for himself from good.&#8221; So no one should stand up for him nor should he stand up for anyone. Rather their hatred for this standing should be greater than that of the Prophet&#8217;s hatred (for it). This is since if they do not hate it, it will become a normal practice for some of them to stand up for others. And that will lead them to hold a love for it, which then will serve as a cause for which they will be deserving of the Hellfire, as is stated in the previous hadeeth. And Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam was not like this, for he was free and protected from having any love for this act of disobedience. So if he also hated it along with that, it becomes clear that it is more fitting that the Muslim hate it. [30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, has gathered the comprehensive and abundant good manners in his saying: &#8220;He is not from us who doesn&#8217;t have mercy for our young, and respects our old and knows the right of our scholar.&#8221; [31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So knowing the right of the scholar requires having good manners with him in his presence as well as in his absence. However, this does not require that one should worship him, as is the case with some of the Sufis and the extremists among the shaikhs. An example of this is standing up for the scholar when he enters the gathering. This act is not befitting for the pure and uncorrupted Islaamic society. So the main concern of the true Islaamic callers is to bring back as close as possible the first Islaamic society, in which it was not possible to adopt a practice any way they felt like. So indeed the matter is only as the famous saying goes: &#8220;So imitate them if you are not like them, Verily, imitation of the righteous is success.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we are trying to imitate those righteous and good individuals (from the Salaf), and we are attempting to bring forth a society that resembles that first luminous society that existed in that radiant time. So our attention must always be directed towards doing what they used to do, as much as we are able to, for the reality is as his, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, saying indicates: &#8220;Whatever I command you to do, then do as much of it as you are able. And what I forbid you from, then stay away from it.&#8221;32 So the matters related to actions are restricted and thus additions to them are not accepted. An example of that is being kind to the scholar by outward gestures, such as by standing up for him or others when they enter one of the gatherings. And I do not say the gatherings of knowledge, for this is very clear &#8211; that the students in that situation should not stand up for this scholar. However, if he enters a gathering that is not a gathering of knowledge, is it from the beneficial knowledge and from the righteous deeds that the people of that gathering stand up for that scholar who has entered the gathering?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer: &#8220;So imitate them if you are not like them.&#8221; Who is the only single individual that we should imitate apart from others? He is, as we all know, Muhammad the Messenger of Allaah. And the people of knowledge know, and this is something that they do not differ about.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nowadays, the whole Islaamic world – except for those whom Allaah has mercy on – is in opposition to the Prophet&#8217;s guidance of the past concerning this matter. So the people of knowledge do not forbid their companions nor the general people when one of them enters a gathering and they stand up for him. And those who stand up for him out of kindness and respect, they deem that this is how the first society (of the Companions) were. Therefore, it is upon us to constantly direct the attention towards physically imitating the (way of this) first society.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are from the matters of which it is obligatory upon the scholars, rather upon the students of knowledge, to take concern of. This is since if you are truthful in your imitation of the Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, then spread amongst your companions the fact that you hate this outward expression. This means to humble yourself as the Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, used to humble himself. The Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, used to hate this standing and so the people accepted it, for in reality he hated this thing. So if the scholar is following the example of the Messenger then let him spread that amongst his companions. This comes first.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second, it falls into the realm of &#8220;preventing the means.&#8221; For instance, if the scholar makes it a normal habit for the people to stand up for him, his soul will yearn for this standing. Then there will come a time when he will see his student who loves him and is devoted to him. He used to stand up for him then all of a sudden he stopped standing up for him. So there will occur disputes, then blaming, then perhaps more than that between the scholar and the student. This is because this scholar made it a normal habit for himself to love this standing. So what brought him to fall into this hated and forbidden love was the people&#8217;s accustoming him to it. I also wanted to remind the scholar and the students of knowledge to not adapt the societies because this adapting (and conforming) has no fixed limits today, for an innovation may appear and we will say: “There is something more important than it.” And then tomorrow there will be another innovation and we will say what we said in the first instance, until the society has gone far away from acting in accordance with what Islaam has brought, due to these distortions and false justifications.</p>
