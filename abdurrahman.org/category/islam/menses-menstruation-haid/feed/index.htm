										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Sixth : Menses &amp; Legal Sexual Intercourse</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is prohibited for a husband to have sexual intercourse with his menstruating wife, and it is not allowed for her to make it possible for him. Allah (Azza wa Jal) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{ويسألونك عن المحيض قُل هُوَ أذًى فاعتَزِلُوا النِّساءَ في المَحيض ولا تقربوهُنَّ حتى يطْهُرن }</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Surah Al-Baqarah 2:222]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;They ask you concerning menstruation. Say: that is an Adha (a harmful thing for a husband to have a sexual intercourse with his wife while she is having her menses), therefore keep away from women during menses and go not unto them till they have been purified (from menses and have taken a bath).&#8221;</strong> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 222).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Menses here refers to the period of menstruation and the private part of the woman is the prohibited place. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم) said: &#8220;<strong>Do everything except sexual intercourse</strong>.&#8221; [40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Muslims had Ijmaa&#8217; prohibiting sexual intercourse with a menstruating woman. It is not permissible for anyone who believes in Allah and in the Day of Judgment to practice this act. Anyone who does this then he had disobeyed Allah and His Messenger and followed a path other than the believers path [41].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is related that Imam Ash-Shaafiee&#8217; had said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>Anyone who does such an act then he had committed a Great Sin</strong>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Other scholars of the same school said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>Anyone who sees it permissible to have sexual intercourse with a menstruating woman then a decree of his Kufr (rejection of Faith) should be made</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In order to break the intensity of sexual desire, it is permissible (and praise is due to Allah) to kiss, hug and fondle a menstruating woman in places other than her private parts. It is important, however, that the husband does not approach the area between the knees and the navel without laying a cover sheet as &#8216;Aisha ( رضي الله عنها) explained:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;He (صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم) used to order me to put an Izar (dress worn below the waist) and used to fondle me (during her menses)&#8221;</strong> [42].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[40] Saheeh Muslim (English) V 1. P.175, Hadeeth # 592.<br />
[41] Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) warns saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{ ومن يُشاققِ الرَّسول من بَعدِ ما تبينَ لهُ الهُدى ويتَّبِعُ غيرَ سبيل المؤمنين نُوَلِّهِ ما تَولَّى ونصلِهِ جَهَنَّم وساءتْ مَصيراً }<br />
&#8211; Surah an-Nisa 115</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger (Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم)) after the Right Path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers&#8217; way, We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and burn him in Hell;&#8211;what an evil destination.&#8221;</strong> (Qur&#8217;an 4: 115)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter Six<br />
Nifass And Its Rulings</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Nifass</strong>: is the bleeding due to delivery by a pregnant woman. It may occur with delivery, after delivery (post-natal) or before delivery (by two or three days coupled to contractions).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shayekh Al-Islam Ibn Taymeeyah said: &#8220;The blood seen when the woman starts her contractions is Nifass and it is not limited to two or three days. These contractions are followed by delivery or otherwise the released blood is not Nifass&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars differed as to whether there is a limit on its duration. Shayekul Islam Ibn Taymeeyah said: &#8220;Nifass has no limit on the duration of its shorter or longer periods. Assuming that a woman sees a flowing of blood for more than forty, sixty, or seventy days and then the blood flow stops. This kind of bleeding is Nifass. Suppose, however, that the bleeding continues, then a limit of forty days is set as Nifass because this period is the common period encountered by most women&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This author said: &#8220;based upon the above, if the bleeding of a woman continues beyond forty days and if there are signs that indicate that it will come to a stop (based upon previous pregnancies or some other signs), then she should wait until the blood flow stops. If none of these signs are encountered by a woman, then she cleans herself (bath) upon the completion of forty days considering it the reference period for most women. On the other hand, if upon the completion of her forty days she gets her normal menses then she should wait until it ends. If the blood continues after her regular menses ends, then she is a Mustahadah and should apply the rules of Istihadah&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the Nifass bleeding stops before the forty day-reference period and she becomes clean, then she should take a bath, pray, fast and she may engage in sexual intercourse with her husband. The stopping of the flow of blood for less than a day does not qualify her to be clean (as mentioned in Al-Mughnee).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nifass is not confirmed unless the woman delivers a human being with clear features. If a small body is delivered but clearly does not show the developed features of a human being, then the associated bleeding is not Nifass and it is considered as Irq blood (blood from a blood vessel). The least period for which a human form can develop is eighty days starting from the day of conception and most often it is ninety days. Al-Mujid Ibn Taymeeyah [57] said: &#8220;If she sees blood coupled to contractions prior to the 80/90-days she should not give it any consideration (i.e., she continues to pray and fast) but if she sees blood after this period she should then refrain from praying and fasting. If, however, she delivers her load and the new born has developed human features, then her bleeding (prior the 80/90 days) should be considered as Nifass and she should correct for her missed prayers and fasting. If on the other hand the newborn does not show developed human features then her bleeding should still not to be considered as Nifass and does not have to make up for her prayers and fasting.&#8221;</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">The Laws of Nifass</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The laws of Nifass are the same as the laws governing menses, except in the following cases:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) <strong>The Idda is not related to Nifass, but rather to the rules of divorce</strong>. For example: if Talaq (divorce) was declared prior to delivery, then the Idda ends upon delivery and is not related to the Nifass period. If Talaq was declared after delivery, she waits for the return of her menses and accordingly calculates her Idda as explained earlier.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) <strong>The period of Eelaa&#8217;</strong>. The Eelaa&#8217; is when the husband makes an oath to indefinitely (or for more than four months) not to have sexual intercourse with his wife. If his wife demands sexual intercourse, a period of four months starting from the day he took his oath, will be set. If this period is completed he will be ordered (by a Muslim Judge) either to perform sexual intercourse with his wife or request of separation by his wife will be fulfilled. Nifass will not be counted against the Eelaa&#8217; period. An increment equal to the period needed for the wife&#8217;s Tahara from Nifass will be added towards the Eelaa&#8217; period. This is in contrast with menses (Haid), whereby its period is counted against the Eelaa&#8217; period.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) <strong>Puberty</strong>: It is clear that Nifass is related to pregnancy. A woman cannot get pregnant before she has her own sexual secretions. Haid (and not Nifass) indicates that puberty had been reached.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(4) <strong>What if the flow of Nifass blood stops before the forty days period and then resumes on the fortyth day?</strong> In contrast with Haid blood [58], the state of this resumption is considered to be &#8220;doubtful&#8221; according to famous sayings by the Hanabilah scholars. She, according to them, must fast and pray on time . All that which is forbidden on the Haa&#8217;id is forbidden on her, except obligatory acts. She must compensate all that which the Haa&#8217;id must compensate for. This author, however, is with the opinion that: &#8220;If the blood resumes within a period that may be a Nifass period, then her blood is Nifass blood. If not, then it is a Haid blood unless it continues to flow and it will then be an Istihadah blood. This opinion is close to that reported in Al-Mughnee (V.1, P. 349) in which it is mentioned that Imam Malik have said: &#8220;If she sees blood two or three days after its flow had stopped, then it is Nifass blood or otherwise it is a Haid blood.&#8221; This is also the choice of Shayekul Islam Ibn Taymeeyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Realistically, there can be no &#8220;doubt&#8221; about blood. It is, however, a relative matter in which peoples&#8217; opinions may vary depending upon their knowledge and understanding. The Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) are sources of clarification for everything. Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) did not make it mandatory for someone to fast twice or make Tawaff twice except when there is something done wrong during the performance of these acts for the first time and that it cannot be corrected without actually making it up. However, in the case when someone performs a certain act to the best of his/her ability then he/she is relieved from any responsibility as Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">( { لا يُكَلِّفُ الله نفساً إلاَّ وُسعَها } (البقرة، 286<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope&#8221;</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 286)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">( { فاتَّقوا الله ما استَطَعتُم } (التغابن، 16<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;So keep your duty to Allah as much as you can&#8221;</strong> </span>(Qur&#8217;an 64: 16)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(5) <strong>What about sexual intercourse with a woman who becomes clean prior to the forty days-reference period of Nifass?</strong> In the case of the Haa&#8217;id, sexual intercourse is permissible if she becomes clean prior to her &#8220;normal&#8221; duration of her cycle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the case of Nifass and in accordance with the well known opinion of the Hanbali school of thought, sexual intercourse is disliked. The right opinion, however, is that it is not disliked and this is also the saying of the majority of Muslim Scholars, because to make something disliked requires a supporting evidence from Islamic Law. In this case there is no evidence except that which Imam Ahmad related: &#8220;the wife of Uthman the son of Abi Al-&#8216;Aass approached him before the end of the forty -day period and he told her: &#8216;do not!'&#8221;. This does not necessitate that he disliked what she did because it is possible that he was acting cautiously being afraid that she was not certain that she was Tahira (clean from Nifass) or that bleeding may be re-activated following intercourse with her or for some other reason- and Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>References :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[57] Al-Mujid Ibin Taymeeyah: Is the grandfather of the famous Ibin Taymeeyah. He was also a highly respected scholar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[58] If menses blood stops and resumes then it is certainly Haid blood. For example, a woman has her normal monthly cycle for eight days. She says that the blood stops on the fourth day for two days and then it resumes on the seventh and eighth day. This resumed blood is a certainly a Haid blood.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Video Courtesy: Bilal Nahim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Is a woman that is menstruating or in her post-partum period allowed to touch the mus-haf or read from it? Also, is the menstruating woman allowed to enter the masjid in order to gain religious knowledge?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Abdulazeez bin Abdullah bin Baaz:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The menstruating woman is not allowed to sit in the masjid nor touch the mus-haf until she has become purified. However, if a need for her to touch it arose, such as in order to revise a verse (of the Qur&#8217;an) or something like that, there is no problem to do so by wearing gloves or by using some other barrier.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for touching it without some sort of barrier, then no, she should not do that. This is because her impurity is major, like the one who is impure due to sexual relations (junub). The one who is &#8216;junub&#8217; does not read or touch the mus-haf. As for the menstruating woman, she may recite [the Qur&#8217;an] during the whole period. So can the one in her post-partum period, according to the correct Opinion. She can read from her memory without touching the mus-haf unless she has to in order to revise a verse in which case it is alright if she touches it using a barrier.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">It is <strong>unlawful</strong> for a menstruating woman to perform all types of fasting: obligatory or optional.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is, however, obligatory to <strong>make up for the missed obligatory days</strong> of fasting as explained by &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنها):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;We passed through this (period of menstruation), and we were ordered to complete (i.e., compensate) the fasts but we were not ordered to complete the prayers&#8221;</strong> </span>(agreed upon Hadeeth) [34]<span style="color:#808080;"><a style="color:#808080;" href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-9F0" target="_blank">.</a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the woman encounters menses while fasting then her fasting is negated even if her blood flow occurs a moment before sunset. If this day is one of the prescribed days of fasting then she must make up for this day once she becomes clean<span style="color:#808080;"><a style="color:#808080;" href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-9F0" target="_blank">.</a></span> If on her day of fasting she feels she is about to have her menses but no blood flow actually occurs till after sunset, then her fasting is complete and is not negated in accordance with the right opinion about this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because there is no ruling regarding blood inside the woman&#8217;s body and because the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) when asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Is it necessary for a woman to take a bath after she has a wet dream (nocturnal sexual discharge)?&#8221;<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> he replied: &#8220;Yes, if she notices a discharge.&#8221;</strong></span> [35]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) conditioned the ruling upon the actual seeing of the discharge and not upon its transfer (from inside-out). Similarly in the case of Haid, the ruling applies once there is an actual seeing of discharge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Case</strong>: If a woman&#8217;s period continues till after dawn (Fajr), then no fasting will be acceptable from her on this day even if she becomes clean moments after dawn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Case</strong>: If she becomes clean before Fajr and she fasted, then her fasting is correct even though she may have not taken her cleaning bath till after Fajr time. This is the same as in the case of the person who has Jannabah. If he (she) intends to fast and did not take his (her) bath until after Fajr, then his (her) fasting on this day is correct. This is in accordance with the Hadeeth of &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنها) who said that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to get up in a state of Jannabah (after sexual relations with his wives) and fast during the month of Ramadan.&#8221;</strong></span> [36]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p>[33] Ibin Taymeeyah in Al-Fatawa (religious decrees) V. 26, P. 191.<br />
[34] The text is from Saheeh Muslim, V.1, P. 191.<br />
[35] Saheeh Al-Bukhari (Arabic-English) V.1, P. 171-2, Hadeeth # 280.<br />
[36] Aisha (رضي الله عنها) said: &#8220;The dawn broke upon the Messenger of Allah (صلى الله عليه و سلم) during the Ramadan in a state of Jannabah not becuase of sexual dream</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 10:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Suppose a woman becomes clean from her menses before Salat Al-Fajr but she took her bath after the commencement of the Salat time, and fasted that day. Is her fasting correct?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer by Shaykh Uthaymeen:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a woman becomes clean during the month of Ramadan one minute before the commencement of the prescribed time of Salat Al-Fajr, then she must fast that day and her fasting is correct and it is not mandatory upon her to make up the fast because she fasted while she was clean even though she did not take her bath till after the rise of Fajr. This is similar to the case when a man has a wet dream or in a state of Jannabah. He can have his Suhor (meal before Fajr), fast and take his bath after Fajr.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>I want to caution some women who may think that if they get their menses after breaking the fast and before Isha&#8217; then their fasting was incorrect. This understanding is wrong. Their fasting is correct and complete even if they get their respective periods one moment after sunset (Maghrib).</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 6:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">A woman has reached sixty five years of age. She did not give birth to any child during the last nineteen years. For the past three years she had continuous bleeding. What should she do for fasting and what should women like her do (regarding Salat and Fasting)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer by Shaykh ibn Uthaymeen:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This type of woman should refrain from fasting and Salat during the time of her regular cycle of menses. If for example she used to have her normal period of menses during the first six days of the month, then she should refrain from fasting and praying during the first six days of each month. Once that is done, she should take a bath and perform Salat and fast.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As to the how she offers her Salat, she should wash her private part real well and apply a pad to it and make ablution. She does this at the time of the obligatory prayers. She could also do the same for the optional prayers at times other than the times of the obligatory prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the difficulty encountered by such woman, it is allowable for her to combine (but not shorten) the Thuhr with the &#8216;Asr prayer (and pray either at time of Thuhr or at time of &#8216;Asr) and the Maghrib with the Isha&#8217; (and pray either at time of Maghrib or at time of Isha&#8217;). This way she can do this type of preparation for her Salat three times (including one for Fajr prayer) instead of five times a day. She can perform optional prayers based upon her ablution for either of the combined prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 5:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What should a woman do when she does not make up for the days she did not fast in Ramadan due to her menses?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer by Shaykh ibn Uthaymeen:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is regrettable for something like this to happen amongst the believing women. This is either due to ignorance or laziness and both reasons are wrong! because the cure for ignorance is to ask those who know and the cure for laziness is the fear of Allah and His punishment. So a woman who may have done this should sincerely repent to Allah and seek His forgiveness. She should also try her best to find out the number of days she missed and make up for it. I ask Allah to accept the repentance of such women.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the ruling on the blood that comes out of a woman outside the menstrual or post-partum period? Should she make up later for the days in which she experiences such blood during the daytime of Ramadan? </span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If the blood referred to above comes out of her during the daytime in Ramadan and it is not menstrual blood or postpartum blood, she is obliged to observe Sawm (Fasting) and Salah (Prayer). </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>She must <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> stop observing Sawm or Salah, and she <span style="text-decoration:underline;">does not</span> need to make up later for the days in which she observed Sawm and Salah while having Istihadah (abnormal vaginal bleeding outside the menstrual or post-partum period). </strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Use of Haid (Menses) Inhibitors is permissible under two conditions:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>FIRST</strong>: There is no associated harm on the woman. Because Allah (subhana wa ta&#8217;aala) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">( { ولا تُلقُوا بأيديكُم إلى التَّهلُكَة } (البقرة، 195<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And do not throw yourselves in destruction&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 195).</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">( { ولا تَقتُلوا أنفُسَكُم إنَّ الله آانَ بكم رحيماً } (النِّساء، 29<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And do not kill yourselves surely Allah is Most Merciful to you&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 4: 29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>SECOND</strong>: If its use affects the husband in one way or another, then his permission should be first sought. For example, if a woman is going through her Idda and the husband is obligated to spend upon her, then she is not allowed to prolong her Idda (by using Haid inhibitors) in order that she can receive more of his spending. She should request his permission. Similarly it is not permissible to use such inhibitors without the husband&#8217;s approval if it is known that the inhibitors will prevent her becoming pregnant. It is better not to use these inhibitors except under the above conditions and when there is a real need for that, because leaving the matter as natural as possible is better for the balance of health and safety of the woman.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Use of Haid (Menses) Stimulants is permissible under two conditions:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>FIRST</strong>: There must be no abuse of its use. For example, to excuse herself from certain mandatory acts of worship like using stimulants right before the month of Ramadan so as to be excused from fasting or from prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>SECOND</strong>: The use of stimulants must be permitted by the husband because the presence of Haid prevents him from having full enjoyment with his wife. Also, if she was divorced, then this will quickly drop off the husband&#8217;s right of returning her because it will hasten the end of her Idda. This applies to the case when the declared divorce is of the type known as Revocable Divorce in which the husband has the right to return his wife before the end of her Idda.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;">Questions &amp; Answers</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> Haid Inhibitors</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q1: What is the ruling regarding on the use of Haid-inhibitory pills during the month of Ramadan?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As long as there is no harm in their use and as long as the husband permits this, then it is permissible to use these pills.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, it came to my knowledge that these measures can harm the woman, especially when it is known that the release of blood by menses is a natural process. To prevent this natural way may cause certain harm to the woman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also the use of these pills can effect the regulation of the periodical cycle itself and that leaves her in doubt and confusion regarding the offering of her prayer and whether she is able to have sexual intercourse with her husband or not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of this and other associated reasons, I cannot say that the use of these pills is unlawful but I do not like it and do not encourage it. I say that the woman should accept what Allah had ordained for her and should consider the answer of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to his wife &#8216;Aisha when she had her menses after she made Ihram for Umra. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) asked &#8216;Aisha: &#8220;May be that you got your menses?&#8221;. &#8216;Aisha replied, &#8220;Yes&#8221;. He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) then said,&#8221;This is the thing which Allah has ordained for all the daughters of Adam&#8221; [62]. The woman should then be patient and seek the reward from Allah. If she is unable to perform Salat and fasting because of her menses, the door is still opened for her to celebrate the praises of Allah, give charity and do good to people and such acts are great acts of worship.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Chapter Five &#8211; ISTIHADAH</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ISTIHADAH is the vaginal bleeding of a woman such that it may not stop or it may stop but for a short period of time (a day or two in each month).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) <strong>Bleeding that does not stop:</strong> &#8216;Aisha (radyAllaahu &#8216;anha) related that: &#8220;Fatimah bint Abi Hubaish said to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم): &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">I do not become clean (i.e., bleeding is not ending)</span> and in one narration &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">I got persistent bleeding (in between the periods) and I do not become clean</span>&#8221; [49].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) <strong>Bleeding that stops for a short period of time</strong>: Humnah bint Jahsh came to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and said: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">My menstruation was great in quantity and severe</span>&#8220;[50].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Several States of Istihadah</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>ONE</strong>: The woman has a known period of normal cycles of menses prior to Istihadah. The woman in this case refers to her previously known period of menses and during this period she applies all the rules regarding Salat, Fasting etc. Bleeding in days other than this reference period is considered as Istihadah with all associated rules being applicable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Example</strong>: A woman used to get normal bleeding for six days at the beginning of each month. She then started to have prolonged bleeding. For this woman her <strong>Haid (Menses)</strong> period should be the &#8220;first six days of every month&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following extra vaginal bleeding is her Istihadah. This is in accordance with the Hadeeth of &#8216;Aisha (radyAllaahu &#8216;anha) who narrated that: &#8220;Fatimah bint Abi Hubaish asked the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم): &#8220;I got persistent bleeding (in between the periods) and do not become clean. Shall I give up prayers? He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) replied: No, this is from a blood vessel. <span style="color:#008000;">Give up the prayers only for the days on which you usually get the menses and then take a bath and offer your prayers</span>&#8220;[51].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in Saheeh Muslim, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) told Umm Habeebah bint Jahsh who had a prolonged flow of blood to &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">refrain (from prayer) during your menstrual period, then wash and pray</span>&#8221; [52]. Having done this she should pray and pay attention to any flowing blood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>TWO</strong>: The woman does not have a known period of normal cycles of menses prior to Istihadah. To be able to distinguish between her blood from normal menses and her Istihadah blood, she should watch for some characteristics of these two types of blood. <span style="color:#ff6600;">Haid blood may be characterized by thickness, darkness or certain distinct odor.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Example</strong>: a woman sees a continuous blood flow but she sees it dark for the first ten days and red for the rest of the month. Or it looks thick for the first ten days and soft for the rest of the month, or for the first ten days it has the characteristic odor of Haid blood and it becomes odorless for the rest of the month. So her Haid period is the dark blood flow for the first example, the thick blood for the second and the one with the distinct odor for the third. The bleeding that follows is considered Istihadah. It is related that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) told Fatimah bint Abi Jahsh: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">When the blood of menses comes, it is black and can be recognized; so when that comes, refrain from prayer, but when a different type of blood comes, perform ablution and pray, for it is (due only to) a vein</span>.&#8221; [53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THREE</strong>: The woman does not have a known period of Haid and lacks the distinctive characteristics mentioned above!. Blood flow is continuous carrying the same quality or flowing with abnormal qualities that make it hard to distinguish the Haid bleeding from that of the Istihadah bleeding. In this case, women encountering this prolonged and undetermined type of flow should consider their Haid period to be the period encountered by most women: 6-7 days of Haid flow per month, starting from the time she sees the flowing blood. Other than this period, the blood flowing should be considered as Istihadah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Example</strong>: A woman sees her blood for the first time on the fifth day of the month and it continues to flow while she is unable to distinguish any difference in color, odor or thickness of blood. Her Haid period should be six or seven days starting on the fifth day of each month. This is in lieu of the Hadeeth of Hamnah bint Jahsh (radyAllaahu &#8216;anha). She said: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O Messenger of Allah I am a woman who menstruates in great quantity and it is severe, so what do you think about it? It has prevented me from praying and fasting&#8221;</span>. He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;I recommend that you should use cotton, put it on your private part, for it absorbs the blood. She replied: &#8220;It is too copious for that&#8230;&#8221; In this Hadeeth, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: &#8220;This is a stroke of the devil, so observe your menses for six or seven days, Allah alone knows which it should be; then wash and when you see that you are purified, and quite clean, pray during twenty three or twenty four days and nights and fast, for that will be enough for you.&#8221;</span> [54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The saying of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) &#8220;for six or seven days&#8221; is not meant to give Hamnah bint Jahsh the choice but just for her to examine and find out who (amongst other women) is closer to her in age, body structure, number of children, etc. the woman that mostly resembles her condition has a Haid period of six days, then she should consider this period as her reference. The same is true if the Haid period was seven days.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">The One Who Resembles The Mustahadah</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is possible that something (e.g. surgery) may cause the flow of blood through the vagina. There are two types of this case:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) It is not possible for her to have menses following surgery e.g. removal of the uterus or its blockage. Under this case, the ruling of Istihadah cannot be applicable. If the woman sees blood, then the laws governing the <strong>yellowish discharge</strong> (see above) apply. Hence she should not refrain from performing prayers or fasting. It is not prohibited for her husband to have sexual intercourse with her and it is not obligatory upon her to have a bath. She must, however, wash, clean, and make ablution at the commencing time of the obligatory prayers and when she intends to offer the optional prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) It is not certain that her menses will stop following surgery. It is possible that she may have menses. In this case the rulings applicable on a Mustahadah (woman going through Istihadah) are also applicable on this condition in lieu of the Hadeeth of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to Fatimah bint Abi Hubaish: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">It is from a blood vessel, so when the real menses begins give up your prayers and when it (the period) has finished wash the blood off your body (have a full shower) and offer your prayers.&#8221;</span>[55] The saying of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم): &#8220;when the real menses begins&#8221; indicates that the rules for the Mustahadah woman are applicable upon the woman who, potentially, may have menses (with a beginning and an end). The woman, however, without a potentially occurring menses, her blood is a vessel blood.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Rulings About The Mustahadah</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Earlier it was explained when the blood is considered a menses (Haid) blood or Istihadah blood. The rulings applicable for menses and Istihadah depend upon the type of the flowing blood. Rulings about menses were discussed earlier. The rulings about Istihadah are the same as those applicable to a clean woman except for the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) It is obligatory upon the Mustahadah to perform Ablution for each prayer, because of the order of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to Fatimah bint Abi Hubaish: &#8220;Then make Ablution for every Salat&#8221; [56], meaning that she should make ablution only when the prescribed time of Salat begins and not before it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) Prior to ablution she should wash the traces of blood and covers her private part with a pad of cotton to absorb the blood. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) told Humnah bint Jahsh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I recommend that you should use cotton, for it absorbs blood.&#8221; She said: &#8220;it is too copious for that&#8221;. He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said; &#8220;then take a cloth.&#8221; She replied, &#8220;it is too copious for that.&#8221; He said: &#8220;then Talaj&#8217;jami&#8221; i.e., to prepare a holding around the waist that will maintain the cotton pad tightly attached to her private part. Nothing that comes out should then harm her because the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) told Fatimah bint Hubaish: &#8220;Refrain from Salat during the days of your normal menses then wash and make ablution for every Salat and then pray &#8220;even if blood drops onto the mat!&#8221; (Related by Imam Ahmad and Ibn Majah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) Sexual Intercourse: Scholars disagreed about its permissibility. The correct opinion is that it is permissible because many women (ten or more) had their Istihadah at the time of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم). Allah and His Messenger did not prevent spouses from engaging in sexual intercourse. In fact, the saying of Allah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) :</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">( { فاعتَزِلُوا النِّساء في المَحيض } الأية (البقرة، 222<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Keep away from women during menses&#8221;</span><br />
(Qur&#8217;an 2: 222),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">is an evidence that it is only obligatory to keep away from sexual intercourse with women only during menses. And since offering prayers is allowed while in Istihadah, then there should be no difficulty in having sexual intercourse. To prevent sexual intercourse based upon Qiyass (analogy) with the state of Haid is incorrect, because the two situations are not the same. Deduction of rulings by Qiyass is invalid whenever there are existing variations.</p>

[53] Related by Abu Dawoud and An-Nassaa&#8217;ee, Ibin Habban and Al-Hakim said it is Saheeh. This author said: &#8220;although there are critical views regarding the chain of narrators and the interpretation of this Hadeeth, it had been a practical reference for some Muslim scholars and it is a better reference than referring to the average period encountered by most women (six or seven days).&#8221;<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Case</strong>: During Menses, it is not unlawful to celebrate Allah&#8217;s Praises (Saying Takbeer, Tasbeeh, and Tahmeed),[29] saying Bismillah before acting upon something (eating, drinking, etc..), reading Hadeeth, Islamic discussions, invocation upon Allah (Dua&#8217;), and listening to the recitation of Qur&#8217;an.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been confirmed by &#8216;Aisha (radhi Allaahu anha) that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;lean on my lap and recite Qur&#8217;an while I was in menses&#8221;</span> (Al-Bukhari and Muslim).[30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also Umm &#8216;Atiyya reported that she heard the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) saying: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The Unmarried young virgins and the mature girl who stay often screened or the young unmarried virgins who often stayscreened and the menstruating women should come out and participate in the good deeds as well as the religious gathering of the faithful believers but the menstruating women should keep away from the Musalla (praying place).&#8221;</span> [31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Case</strong>: The reciting of the Qur&#8217;an by a menstruating woman either via direct looking or silently (in her heart) without the actual uttering by the tongue is permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The majority of the scholars are with the opinion that it is not prohibited for her to utter the Qur&#8217;anic recitation. Imam Bukhari, Ibn Jareer At- Tabaree and Ibn Al-Munthir, Imam Malik, and Imam Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee (in one of his earlier sayings) are with the opinion that it is permissible for her to recite the Ayah (verse in the Qur&#8217;an).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shayekul Islam Ibn Taymeeyah said: &#8220;Basically, there is no Sunnah to prevent her from reciting Qur&#8217;an. The &#8220;hadeeth&#8221; that: &#8220;A menstruating woman and the one who is in state of Jannabah [32] should not recite anything of the Qur&#8217;an&#8221;, is a weak hadeeth as agreed upon by the knowledgeable scholars of Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In fact women at the time of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to have their monthly cycles of menses.Had the recitation of Qur&#8217;an been prohibited for them (as it is the case with Salat) then the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) would have made it clear to his Ummah (Islamic community) and his wives would have known about it and they would have dissipated this knowledge to the people. Because no one had related a prohibition by the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) about this issue, then it cannot be made unlawful especially when it is known that he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not prohibit it at the time when menses was very much present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, recitation by the tongue is not Haram (legally unlawful).[33] This author said: &#8220;having known the dispute between the scholars about this matter, then it is more proper for the menstruating woman not to recite Qur&#8217;an by the tongue except when it is necessary e.g. if she is a teacher or if she is preparing for an exam.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[29] Takbeer: saying Allahu Akbar (Allah is The Greatest); Tasbeeh: saying Subhana Allah (Most Glorified is Allah); Tahmeed: saying Al Hamdulil&#8217;lah: All Praise is due to Allah.<br />
[30] Saheeh Al-Bukhari (Arabic-English) V.1, P.179, Hadeeth # 296.<br />
[31] Agreed upon Hadeeth. In Saheeh Al-Bukhari (Arabic- English), V. 1, P. 192, Hadeeth # 321.<br />
[32] Jannabah: Is the state in which a man (or a woman) has sexual discharge during sexual intercourse or in a dream, etc. In this state a Muslim is not allowed to pray or do other kinds of worships unless and until he (she) performs Ghusl (have a full shower) or do Tayammum if he/she cannot use water for any reason.<br />
[33] Ibin Taymeeyah in Al-Fatawa (religious decrees) V. 26, P. 191.</p>

The Jew said: We call him by the name by which he was named by his family. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: My name is Muhammad with which I was named by my family. The Jew said: I have come to ask you (something). The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Should that thing be of any benefit to you, if I tell you that? He (the Jew) said: I will lend my ears to it. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) drew a line with the help of the stick that he had with him and then said: Ask (whatever you like).

The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: They would be in darkness beside the Bridge. He (the Jew) again said: Who amongst people would be the first to cross (this bridge).?

He (the Jew) said. What would be their food alter this? He (the Holy Prophet) said: A bullockwhich was fed in the different quarters of Paradise would be slaughtered for them. He (the Jew) said: What would be their drink? He (the Holy Prophet) said: They would be given drink from the fountain which is named&#8221; Salsabil&#8221;. He (the Jew) said: I have come to ask you about a thing which no one amongst the people on the earth knows except an apostle or one or two men besides him. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Would it benefit you if I tell you that? He (the Jew) said: I would lend ears to that. He then said: I have come to ask you about the child. He (the Holy Prophet) said: The reproductive substance of man is white and that of woman (i. e. ovum central portion) yellow, and when they have sexual intercourse and the male&#8217;s substance (chromosomes and genes) prevails upon the female&#8217;s substance (chromosomes and genes), it is the male child that is created by Allah&#8217;s Decree, and when the substance of the female prevails upon the substance contributed by the male, a female child is formed by the Decree of Allah.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Amongst the traditions narrated from Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) on the authority of Abu Huraira, the one is that Banu Isra&#8217;il used to take a bath naked, and they looked at the private parts of one another. Moses (peace be upon him), however, took a bath alone (in privacy) ; and they said (tauntingly): By Allah, nothing prohibits Moses to take a bath along with us, but sacrotal hernia. He (Moses) once went for a bath and placed his clothes on a stone and the stone moved on with his clothes. Moses ran after it saying: 0 stone, my clothes,0 stone, my clothes, and Banu Isra&#8217;il had the chance to see the private parts of Moses, and said: By Allah, Moses does not suffer from any ailment. The stone then stopped, till Moses had been seen by them, and he then took hold of his clothes and struck the stone. Abu Huraira said: By Allah, there are the marks of six or seven strokes made by Moses on the stone.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.006.293"></a>Volume 1, Book 6, Number 293:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Qasim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;We set out with the sole intention of performing Hajj and when we reached Sarif, (a place six miles from Mecca) I got my menses. Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me while I was weeping. He said &#8216;What is the matter with you? Have you got your menses?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; He said, &#8216;This is a thing which Allah has ordained for the daughters of Adam. So do what all the pilgrims do with the exception of the Taw-af (Circumambulation) round the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle sacrificed cows on behalf of his wives.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A person asked me, &#8220;Can a woman in menses serve me? And can a Junub woman come close to me?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;All this is easy for me. All of them can serve me, and there is no harm for any other person to do the same. &#8216;Aisha told me that she used to comb the hair of Allah&#8217;s Apostle while she was in her menses, and he was in Itikaf (in the mosque). He would bring his head near her in her room and she would comb his hair, while she used to be in her menses.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Um Salama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While I was laying with the Prophet under a single woolen sheet, I got the menses. I slipped away and put on the clothes for menses. He said, &#8220;Have you got &#8220;Nifas&#8221; (menses)?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He then called me and made me lie with him under the same sheet.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet and I used to take a bath from a single pot while we were Junub. During the menses, he used to order me to put on an Izar (dress worn below the waist) and used to fondle me. While in Itikaf, he used to bring his head near me and I would wash it while I used to be in my periods (menses).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Once Allah&#8217;s Apostle went out to the Musalla (to offer the prayer) o &#8216;Id-al-Adha or Al-Fitr prayer. Then he passed by the women and said, &#8220;O women! Give alms, as I have seen that the majority of the dwellers of Hell-fire were you (women).&#8221; They asked, &#8220;Why is it so, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;You curse frequently and are ungrateful to your husbands. I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and religion than you. A cautious sensible man could be led astray by some of you.&#8221; The women asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What is deficient in our intelligence and religion?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Is not the evidence of two women equal to the witness of one man?&#8221; They replied in the affirmative. He said, &#8220;This is the deficiency in her intelligence. Isn&#8217;t it true that a woman can neither pray nor fast during her menses?&#8221; The women replied in the affirmative. He said, &#8220;This is the deficiency in her religion.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatima bint Abi Hubaish said to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I do not become clean (from bleeding). Shall I give up my prayers?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied: &#8220;No, because it is from a blood vessel and not the menses. So when the real menses begins give up your prayers and when it (the period) has finished wash the blood off your body (take a bath) and offer your prayers.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">None of us had more than a single garment and we used to have our menses while wearing it. Whenever it got soiled with blood of menses we used to apply saliva to the blood spot and rub off the blood with our nails.</p>

<hr />

<p style="text-align:justify;">An Ansari woman asked the Prophet how to take a bath after finishing from the menses. He replied, &#8220;Take a piece a cloth perfumed with musk and clean the private parts with it thrice.&#8221; The Prophet felt shy and turned his face. So pulled her to me and told her what the Prophet meant.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 6, Number 313:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the last Hajj of Allah&#8217;s Apostle I assume the Ihram for Hajj along with Allah Apostle. I was one of those who intended Tamattu&#8217; (to perform Hajj an &#8216;Umra) and did not take the Hadi (animal for sacrifice) with me. I got my menses and was not clean till the night of &#8216;Arafa I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! It is the night of the day of &#8216;Arafat and I intended to perform the Hajj Tamattu&#8217; with &#8216;Umra Allah&#8217;s Apostle told me to undo my hair and comb it and to postpone the &#8216;Umra. I did the same and completed the Hajj. On the night of Al-Hasba (i.e. place outside Mecca where the pilgrims go after finishing all the ceremonies Hajj at Mina) he (the Prophet ordered &#8216;Abdur Rahman (&#8216;Aisha&#8217;s brother) to take me to At-Tan&#8217;im to assume the lhram for&#8217;Umra in lieu of that of Hajj-atTamattu&#8217; which I had intended to perform.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 6, Number 314:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the 1st of Dhul-Hijja we set out with the intention of performing Hajj. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Any one who likes to assume the Ihram for &#8216;Umra he can do so. Had I not brought the Hadi with me, I would have assumed the Ihram for &#8216;Umra. &#8220;Some of us assumed the Ihram for &#8216;Umra while the others assumed the Ihram for Hajj. I was one of those who assumed the Ihram for &#8216;Umra. I got menses and kept on menstruating until the day of &#8216;Arafat and complained of that to the Prophet . He told me to postpone my &#8216;Umra, undo and comb my hair, and to assure the Ihram of Hajj and I did so. On the right of Hasba, he sent my brother &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr with me to At-Tah&#8217;im, where I assumed the Ihram for&#8217;Umra in lieu of the previous one. Hisham said, &#8220;For that (&#8216;Umra) no Hadi, fasting or alms were required.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 6, Number 315:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;At every womb Allah appoints an angel who says, &#8216;O Lord! A drop of semen, O Lord! A clot. O Lord! A little lump of flesh.&#8221; Then if Allah wishes (to complete) its creation, the angel asks, (O Lord!) Will it be a male or female, a wretched or a blessed, and how much will his provision be? And what will his age be?&#8217; So all that is written while the child is still in the mother&#8217;s womb.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;We set out with the Prophet in his last Hajj. Some of us intended to perform &#8216;Umra while others Hajj. When we reached Mecca, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Those who had assumed the lhram for&#8217;Umra and had not brought the Hadi should finish his lhram and whoever had assumed the Ihram for &#8216;Umra and brought the Hadi should not finish the Ihram till he has slaughtered his Hadi and whoever had assumed the lhram for Hajj should complete his Hajj.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha further said, &#8220;I got my periods (menses) and kept on menstruating till the day of &#8216;Arafat, and I had assumed the Ihram for &#8216;Umra only (Tamattu&#8217;). The Prophet ordered me to undo and comb my head hair and assume the lhram for Hajj only and leave the &#8216;Umra. I did the same till I completed the Hajj. Then the Prophet sent &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin Abi Bakr with me and ordered me to perform &#8216;Umra from At-Tan&#8217;im in lieu of the missed &#8216;Umra.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 6, Number 317:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatima bint Abi Hubaish used to have bleeding in between the periods, so she asked the Prophet about it . He replied, &#8220;The bleeding is from a blood vessel and not the menses. So give up the prayers when the (real) menses begin and when it has finished, take a bath and start praying.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 6, Number 318:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Mu&#8217;adha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A woman asked &#8216;Aisha, &#8220;Should I offer the prayers that which I did not offer because of menses&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;Are you from the Huraura&#8217; (a town in Iraq?) We were with the Prophet and used to get our periods but he never ordered us to offer them (the Prayers missed during menses).&#8221; &#8216;Aisha perhaps said, &#8220;We did not offer them.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 6, Number 319:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zainab bint Abi Salama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Um-Salama said, &#8220;I got my menses while I was lying with the Prophet under a woolen sheet. So I slipped away, took the clothes for menses and put them on. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Have you got your menses?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Then he called me and took me with him under the woolen sheet.&#8221; Um Salama further said, &#8220;The Prophet used to kiss me while he was fasting. The Prophet and I used to take the bath of Janaba from a single pot.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 6, Number 320:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Um Salama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While I was lying with the Prophet under a woolen sheet, I got my menses. I slipped away and put on the clothes for menses. The Prophet said, &#8220;Have you got your menses?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He called me and I slept with him under the woolen sheet.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 6, Number 321:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aiyub:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hafsa said, &#8216;We used to forbid our young women to go out for the two &#8216;Id prayers. A woman came and stayed at the palace of Bani Khalaf and she narrated about her sister whose husband took part in twelve holy battles along with the Prophet and her sister was with her husband in six (out of these twelve). She (the woman&#8217;s sister) said, &#8220;We used to treat the wounded, look after the patients and once I asked the Prophet, &#8216;Is there any harm for any of us to stay at home if she doesn&#8217;t have a veil?&#8217; He said, &#8216;She should cover herself with the veil of her companion and should participate in the good deeds and in the religious gathering of the Muslims.&#8217; When Um &#8216;Atiya came I asked her whether she had heard it from the Prophet. She replied, &#8220;Yes. May my father be sacrificed for him (the Prophet)! (Whenever she mentioned the Prophet she used to say, &#8216;May my father be sacrificed for him) I have heard the Prophet saying, &#8216;The unmarried young virgins and the mature girl who stay often screened or the young unmarried virgins who often stay screened and the menstruating women should come out and participate in the good deeds as well as the religious gathering of the faithful believers but the menstruating women should keep away from the Musalla (praying place).&#8217; &#8221; Hafsa asked Um &#8216;Atiya surprisingly, &#8220;Do you say the menstruating women?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t a menstruating woman attend &#8216;Arafat (Hajj) and such and such (other deeds)?&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 6, Number 322:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatima bint Abi Hubaish asked the Prophet, &#8220;I got persistent bleeding (in between the periods) and do not become clean. Shall I give up prayers?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;No, this is from a blood vessel. Give up the prayers only for the days on which you usually get the menses and then take a bath and offer your prayers.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 6, Number 323:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Um &#8216;Atiya:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We never considered yellowish discharge as a thing of importance (as menses).</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 6, Number 324:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) Um Habiba got bleeding in between the periods for seven years. She asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about it. He ordered her to take a bath (after the termination of actual periods) and added that it was (from) a blood vessel. So she used to take a bath for every prayer.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 6, Number 325:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) I told Allah&#8217;s Apostle that Safiya bint Huyai had got her menses. He said, &#8220;She will probably delay us. Did she perform Tawaf (Al-Ifada) with you?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; On that the Prophet told her to depart.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 6, Number 326:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A woman is al lowed to leave (go back home) if she gets menses (after Tawaf-AlIfada). Ibn &#8216;Umar formerly used to say that she should not leave but later on I heard him saying, &#8220;She may leave, since Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave them the permission to leave (after Tawaf-AlIfada.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 6, Number 327:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said to me, &#8220;Give up the prayer when your menses begin and when it has finished, wash the blood off your body (take a bath) and start praying.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 6, Number 328:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Samura bin Jundab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet offered the funeral prayer for the dead body of a woman who died of (during) delivery (i.e. child birth) and he stood by the middle of her body.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 6, Number 329:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Maimuna:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) During my menses, I never prayed, but used to sit on the mat beside the mosque of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. He used to offer the prayer on his sheet and in prostration some of his clothes used to touch me.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">When a menstruating woman becomes pure before before sunrise is it obligatory upon her to perform the maghrib and &#8216;ishaa prayers? Similarly, if she becomes pure before sunset, is it obligatory upon her to perform the dhuhr and &#8216;asr prayer?</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;">If a mentruating or post-partum bleeding woman becomes pure<strong> before sunset</strong>, it is obligatory upon her to perform both <strong>dhuhr and &#8216;asr</strong> prayers according to the strongest opinion among the scholars.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;">Similar is the case if she becomes pure <strong>before dawn</strong>. In that case, she must perform the <strong>maghrib and &#8216;ishaa</strong> prayers. This has been narrated from &#8216;Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Awf and &#8216;Abdullaah ibn Abbaas. This is the opinion of the majority of the Scholars.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;">Similarly, if a menstruating or post-partum bleeding woman becomes pure <strong>before sunrise</strong>, it is obligatory upon her to perform the <strong>Fajr</strong> prayer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from Allaah is guidance.</p>
<p><span style="color:#cc99ff;">Shaykh `Abdul-`Azeez Bin Baz</span><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 2: I have taken contraceptive pills in Ramadan. Should I make up for the days during which I did not have my period through the contraceptive effect of the pills and so I observed Sawm (Fasting) and offered Salah (Prayer) on them with the people? Is there any sin on me for taking these pills?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is permissible for a woman to take a medicine to delay her menstrual period, so that she can perform Hajj or ‘Umrah (lesser pilgrimage), or observe Sawm in Ramadan, <span style="color:#ff0000;">provided that it will result in no harmful effect on her</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You do not have to make up for these days in which menstrual bleeding was stopped by the effect of the pills and you observed Sawm with the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The woman in her menses in her last ten days of Ramadhaan is still beneficial for her to get up in the last third of the night to make du’a as she cannot make salaah, of course . It is beneficial to make du’a in the third of the night and this is open for the one who is in a state of ritual purity or ritual impurity. So there is nothing wrong with that. And the woman in menses also could recite Qur’an from her memory and could make remembrances. All of that. And we can refer you to the book, <strong>&#8220;Natural Blood of Woman&#8221;</strong> by our Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen. Check this book insha Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"> If a sister on her menses during the last ten nights, is she allowed to do prayer on these nights?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. She can do anything except the prayers and fasting. She can invoke Allah (subhaanahu wa ta’aala). She can invoke Allah with this du’a. She can give charity. She can do all good actions of worship except for praying and fasting. Is this clear insha Allah sister? And by the way, a comment on this answer, for all the sisters: a woman who gets her menses during this time &#8211; this is a matter prescribed by Allah. They should not feel in anyway, saddened at all. Why should they feel sad? Even a little bit, when Allah (subhaanahu wa ta’aala) prescribed this matter upon them? This is a very important matter. They shouldn’t have any kind of objection what so ever. They are not going to be deprived of anything that Allah (subhaanahu wa ta’aala) bestowed of his favors because of this. He is the one who commanded her to refrain from prayers. He is the one who commanded her to refrain from fasting. Mercy upon her. I hope that this is insha Allah, ya’ni, met with good understanding.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a good question:<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000;">Because she cannot do the prayers on these nights due to the menses, doesn’t that mean she misses out on the rewards of praying the night of Qadr?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer is that, she cannot due to a legal permit. So she does the acts of worship permitted for her. She may recite Qur’an from memory. She may invoke Allah on these nights, anticipating these nights. She may give charity. She does what she is permitted to do. And that is why our Shaykh Muhammad bin Saalih al Uthaymeen (rahimahullaah) mentioned that the matter is not limited to the establishment of prayers. But rather to all of the actions. To all of the worship. So that is the critical difference. Because we know that in some nights Prophet Muhammad (salallahu ‘alaiyhi w<span style="font-size:10pt;">asallam) did not establish the prayers all night</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the sisters who have their natural blood on these days, shouldn’t give up.<br />
Do acts of worship that are permitted.<br />
Give charity.<br />
Give good word.<br />
Anticipating the reward from Allah. Making du’a. Making remembrances. Alhamdulillah.</p>
